          <p>Barbara Rae-Venter, a retired patent attorney and genetic genealogist, has become instrumental in solving cold cases, including identifying the notorious Golden State Killer. Her innovative technique, investigative genetic genealogy, involves building extensive family trees using DNA samples to pinpoint relatives of unknown suspects. The article details her pivotal role in the Golden State Killer case, responsible for numerous murders and sexual assaults, and her subsequent success in identifying "John Doe #147," a sexual predator from a 1997 case. Rae-Venter's groundbreaking efforts have led to approximately 60 solved cases, revolutionizing forensic investigations while also prompting discussions about privacy implications concerning public DNA databases used by law enforcement.</p>

          <h2>Senate Report Alleges Secret Service Denied Trump's Security Requests Before Butler Shooting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:44:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Senate Homeland Security Committee report reveals that the U.S. Secret Service denied or failed to fulfill at least ten requests for additional security resources for former President Trump's 2024 campaign, prior to the Butler, Pennsylvania, assassination attempt. These requests included enhanced counter-drone systems and counter-sniper personnel, with the shooting resulting in one death and multiple injuries. The report criticizes communication failures and negligence within the agency, directly contradicting previous Secret Service testimony. It also notes a significant lack of formal processes for resource requests, suggesting systemic issues. Furthermore, the report highlights that a key agent involved in communications was not among those disciplined, despite alleged failures to relay critical information.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination attempt on former President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has significantly bolstered its security protocols and technology. CBS News was given a tour of their training center, showcasing new military-grade drones designed for aerial reconnaissance and improved detection and mitigation of unauthorized unmanned aircraft systems. Additionally, the agency has established a system of mobile command posts, costing up to $1.5 million each, to enable direct radio communication between Secret Service agents and local law enforcement, addressing a critical failure from the Butler incident. These substantial changes aim to prevent future security breaches and enhance overall protective capabilities, reflecting lessons learned from the tragic event.</p>

          <p>The selection of Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Jacob Misiorowski for the MLB All-Star Game, after only five career starts, has sparked significant backlash from players, particularly those on the Philadelphia Phillies. Phillies star Trea Turner called the decision a "joke" and "terrible," arguing it "cheapens" the All-Star Game by prioritizing social media popularity or novelty over established performance and merit. While Misiorowski has indeed shown strong, electric performance in his limited outings, his inclusion over more experienced and statistically deserving players like Turner, Ranger Suárez, and Cristopher Sánchez has ignited a broader debate about the integrity and purpose of the All-Star selection process, questioning if it truly represents the league's best.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has called on the European Union to “defend European interests resolutely” after former US President Donald Trump threatened to impose 30% tariffs on nearly all EU imports. While the EU initially paused retaliatory tariffs until August 1st, reflecting a de-escalation attempt, Macron advocates for accelerating credible countermeasures if no agreement is reached. Other European leaders, including Germany and Italy, urged a more pragmatic response, highlighting existing divisions within the bloc on how to address the threat. The tariff threat is widely seen as a negotiating tactic by Trump, but it has caused significant shock and fury across Europe, with warnings of substantial rising costs for industries like German car manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Amid the deadly floods in Texas, a conspiracy theory has gained traction, including among some politicians, claiming that cloud seeding—man-made methods of increasing precipitation—was the direct cause of the disaster.

The article highlights the critical importance of accurate information dissemination during natural disasters and the pervasive negative impact of unfounded theories on public understanding and collective resilience.

          <p>The UK Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has announced that the government will implement measures to make electric vehicles (EVs) more affordable for consumers. While she would not confirm specific taxpayer-funded grants, she hinted at forthcoming announcements later this week. The plan includes a £25 million package for "cross-pavement gullies" to aid charging for homes without driveways, alongside £63 million for broader charging infrastructure. This initiative aims to boost EV sales, which currently lag behind mandated targets despite a ban on new petrol and diesel cars approaching in 2030. The government seeks to address both the high upfront costs and "range anxiety" as primary barriers to widespread EV adoption across the country.</p>

His decision reflects a familiar pattern of traditional Reagan conservatives opting out as the party shifts further right. Bacon expressed a desire to "fight for the soul of the party" outside of Congress, hoping for a return to normalcy after Trump's term, and noting the toll political pressures have taken on his family.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial planners increasingly emphasize passive income streams, such as rental properties, dividends, or royalties, as a crucial component for a comfortable retirement. These diverse streams provide predictable cash flow, effectively supplementing traditional savings and Social Security, thereby reducing reliance on investment withdrawals during potentially volatile market downturns. Passive income also acts as a vital replacement for a regular paycheck from full-time work, fostering significant financial stability and peace of mind for retirees. Experts note that these reliable income sources can often grow with inflation, adding a critical layer of resilience to retirement portfolios and helping retirees preserve their principal investments over the long term.

          <p>Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) head, Vasyl Malyuk, announced that two agents working for Russia's FSB were "liquidated" after resisting arrest, following the assassination of a senior Ukrainian intelligence officer, Colonel Ivan Voronych, in Kyiv. The SBU stated the suspects had tracked Voronych's movements and were found after a joint investigation with national police. This incident comes amidst Ukraine's prominent role in sabotage attacks and assassinations deep inside Russia since the 2022 invasion, though Kyiv rarely officially claims responsibility for such actions. The national police confirmed the killed agents were "citizens of a foreign country," underscoring the ongoing covert conflict and intelligence operations between the two nations.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies five crucial weekday habits that contribute significantly to happier relationships, often neglected by busy individuals. These include building a "mini morning routine" for shared moments, sending thoughtful check-ins during the day to foster emotional intimacy, and prioritizing individual "me time" to de-stress and clear mental clutter before reconnecting. Additionally, happy couples intentionally carve out daily "us time" free from distractions, whether it's dinner or a quick game, and conclude the day with a quiet check-in to prevent unresolved issues from accumulating. These small, intentional actions help maintain connection and intimacy amidst hectic schedules, ensuring emotional alignment and mutual support.</p>

These figures, seen as an extension of the "manosphere" and aligned with Trumpism, leverage platforms like ESPN to spread insensitivity and entitlement. They frequently promote themes like veneration of the military, traditional male values, and denigration of "woke" culture, often couched in ostensibly apolitical sports language. Their cultural supremacy reflects a significant shift where provocation is seemingly bulletproof, normalizing certain political reflexes and modes of attack within mainstream sports discourse.

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated a landmark 2023 civil rights settlement aimed at resolving Alabama's raw sewage crisis, dismissing it as an "illegal" diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) agreement. This decision leaves an estimated 60-80% of rural Lowndes County households, predominantly Black and low-income, without functioning sanitation systems, exposing them to severe health hazards like hookworm. The original settlement, a historic environmental justice victory, had forbidden criminalizing residents for non-compliance and allocated federal funds for custom septic systems. Critics argue the revocation is part of a broader assault on anti-racism efforts, leaving vulnerable communities without crucial federal support or a clear path to resolving a decades-old public health crisis.</p>
