            <p>A federal judge ruled in favor of the Associated Press in its dispute with the White House, ordering officials to restore the news outlet's access to events after it was restricted for continuing to use the name 'Gulf of Mexico' instead of 'Gulf of America.' The judge found that the AP's exclusion was based on viewpoint discrimination, violating the First Amendment. The White House had barred AP reporters from press pool events and other gatherings after the news agency declined to update its Stylebook to reflect the name change. The ruling has been put on hold pending a potential appeal by the government.</p>

            <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has warned that the U.S. economy is likely headed towards a recession due to President Trump's tariffs, which are disrupting financial markets.

JPMorgan economists project a 0.3% contraction in U.S. GDP this year. While Dimon had previously supported tariffs, he now encourages the U.S. to negotiate trade deals to mitigate potential market reactions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Federal judges in New York and Texas have temporarily blocked the deportation of five Venezuelans, identified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang, allowing them to challenge their removals. The men are being detained under the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely used law that grants the president power to deport non-citizens during wartime. Civil liberties lawyers argue the identification methods used by ICE are unreliable and that the act is being unlawfully invoked. The ACLU has requested a temporary restraining order to keep their petitioners in the US and for the judge to declare the 18-century Alien Enemies Act unlawful.</p>

            <p>There are concerns that China's response to President Trump's tariffs may include selling agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which could negatively affect the U.S. housing market. If China and other foreign countries were to accelerate their sales of MBS, mortgage rates would rise, further destabilizing the spring housing market. The U.S. Federal Reserve's current policy of letting MBS roll off its portfolio adds to the potential pressure. A recent survey found that 1 in 5 potential buyers sell stock to finance their down payments. (not investment advice)</p>

Companies are telling manufacturing facilities to delay shipment due to lack of working capital.

Retailers may be forced to raise prices as they struggle to absorb the increased costs. (not investment advice)</p>
