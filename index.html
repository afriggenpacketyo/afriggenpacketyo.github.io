          <p>The House Oversight Committee is investigating whether insurance companies and large asset managers are improperly using American retirees' pension funds to advance progressive political agendas. Led by Chairman James Comer, the probe examines if firms are prioritizing Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives over their fiduciary duties, potentially at the expense of financial returns. The investigation also expands on concerns about "debanking," where financial institutions allegedly discriminate against individuals and businesses with right-wing views, seeking to ensure savings are not weaponized for political purposes.</p>

          <p>Hadush Kebatu, an asylum seeker from Ethiopia, has been sentenced to one year in prison for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman in Epping, Essex.

The case sparked significant local protests outside the hotel where he was housed.

The index generates substantial revenue by licensing its name and data to financial products like index funds and ETFs, which manage trillions in assets. Despite its success, the index's increasing concentration in a few large tech companies, known as the "Magnificent 7," raises concerns about its diversification, reflecting a broader economic bet on the technology sector and artificial intelligence.</p>

The 61-year-old New Zealander's career spans roles with the All Blacks, England's men's team, and clubs across multiple continents. Known for his demanding style that helped build the foundation for England's 2003 men's World Cup victory, Mitchell has since adopted a more mellowed coaching philosophy. His leadership has guided the Red Roses on an unbeaten streak, aiming for his first World Cup title as a head coach.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 11:55:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent 25-basis-point rate cut, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has fallen to 6.13%, its lowest level in three years. For a $350,000 mortgage, this translates to a principal and interest payment of approximately $2,128 per month, a saving of about $210 monthly compared to rates seen earlier in the year. This reduction in borrowing costs has spurred a surge in both new mortgage applications and refinancing, making homeownership more accessible and offering significant long-term interest savings for borrowers.

The meeting was intended to negotiate a funding bill ahead of the September 30 deadline. Trump cited Democrats' "unserious and ridiculous demands," particularly regarding the extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits, as the reason for the cancellation. Democratic leaders accused the president of political posturing and stated that he will be responsible for any resulting shutdown.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Why German Footballers Have Not Won the Ballon d'Or in Nearly 30 Years</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite Germany's consistent success in international and club football, a German player has not won the prestigious Ballon d'Or award since Matthias Sammer in 1996. One key reason is the award's historical preference for attacking players, an area where Germany has not produced generational talents on par with other nations in recent decades. Furthermore, the nearly two-decade dominance of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo made it exceptionally difficult for any player to win. However, with their era ending, young German stars like Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz represent a new hope for breaking the long drought.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's imposition of a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications has created significant uncertainty for immigrant workers and their employers. The White House clarified that the one-time fee applies only to new applications, not renewals or current visa holders. However, immigration attorneys express concern about gray areas, such as whether a current visa holder who travels abroad while an extension is pending could be subject to the fee upon re-entry. The policy is intended to encourage hiring American workers, but critics argue it will have a chilling effect on attracting skilled foreign talent.</p>

          <p>The UK's Court of Appeal has denied the Home Office permission to appeal a High Court injunction that temporarily blocked the removal of an Eritrean asylum seeker to France. The man was set to be one of the first individuals returned under a new "one in, one out" agreement but was granted a last-minute reprieve to pursue a modern slavery claim. The court upheld the injunction because Home Office officials had previously told the man he would not have to pursue his case from France, making the removal attempt a contradiction of its own advice.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of politically motivated violence in the U.S. reveals a notable increase in left-wing terrorist attacks and plots since 2016, with 2025 on pace to be the most violent year from the far-left in over three decades. While right-wing extremism has historically been more common and lethal, its incidence has sharply declined in 2025, potentially due to Donald Trump's reelection. The study, from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, highlights how political shifts can energize extremist elements on the losing side, contributing to a volatile cycle of political violence.</p>

A recent poll of 100 CEOs revealed widespread concern, with the majority stating that U.S. consumers are paying for the tariffs and that the policies are harming their businesses without spurring domestic investment. The article argues that chaotic and ideologically driven policies, such as the confusing rollout of new H-1B visa fees, are creating uncertainty and undermining the administration's stated economic goals.</p>

          <p>President Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F.

Experts worry that this messaging is dangerous, as Tylenol (acetaminophen) is the only painkiller considered safe during pregnancy, and untreated fevers pose a known risk to fetal development. Researchers whose work was cited by the White House expressed alarm at the distortion of their findings, stating that any potential association is weak and unproven, while decades of research have debunked vaccine-autism links.</p>
