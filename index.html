          <p>The United States and Australia have signed a new agreement to bolster the supply chain for critical minerals and rare earths, aiming to reduce dependence on China. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced a project pipeline worth up to $8.5 billion, though White House figures cited a different amount, indicating over $3 billion in investments in the next six months. The collaboration includes U.S. investment in Australian rare earths processing and a Pentagon-funded gallium refinery, reflecting a strategic push to secure resources essential for defense and technology sectors.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As mortgage rates cool to a three-year low, prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance are advised to avoid several common mistakes. The article cautions against assuming rates will only continue to fall, as market fluctuations are unpredictable, and suggests acting if a current rate is affordable. It also highlights the importance of exploring alternatives like mortgage points or adjustable-rate mortgages for additional savings. Finally, homeowners are encouraged to calculate the potential benefits of refinancing even if the rate reduction is less than the traditional one-percent benchmark. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces confirmed that the remains of another hostage held in Gaza were returned to Israel on Monday after being transferred via the Red Cross. The identity of the individual has not yet been released, pending notification of the family. This handover is a component of the U.S.-brokered peace plan, which stipulated the return of all hostages, both living and deceased, from Hamas. The event occurred as U.S. envoys met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reinforce the fragile peace process following recent violence.</p>

Zelensky emphasized his goal is a "just peace, not a quick peace," and expressed skepticism about Hungary's neutrality as a host, highlighting significant disagreements between Kyiv and Washington on the path forward.</p>

          <p>An essay in The Atlantic reflects on the character of the nationwide "No Kings" protests, describing them not as radical mobs but as gatherings of ordinary, middle-aged, and older Americans motivated by a "good-natured indignation." The author observes a tone of old-fashioned patriotism and a desire to reclaim a sense of decency that they feel has been lost under the current administration. Contrasting the protesters' dignity with the president's vulgar response, the article suggests that this quiet, heartfelt movement offers a glimmer of hope for rousing a mainstream opposition to the perceived collapse of American values.</p>

          <p>As European soccer leagues like La Liga and Serie A plan to host their first regular-season games abroad, an analysis looks to the NFL's successful international strategy for lessons. The NFL's global expansion, which began with a long-term plan in 2003, has been built on providing a seamless experience for teams and cultivating local fanbases years before games are scheduled. By establishing grassroots programs and ensuring host cities benefit, the NFL has turned its international series into a highly profitable venture that has significantly grown its global brand and shared revenue for all its teams.</p>

          <p>Don Allison, who was shot and nearly killed during a robbery in 1996, has formed an unlikely friendship with his attacker, Marcus Cheffen, after Cheffen served 24 years of a 95-year prison sentence. Allison initially advocated for Cheffen to remain imprisoned for life but had a change of heart, influenced by his wife and his studies to become a Catholic deacon. After meeting Cheffen through a victim-offender dialogue program and seeing his remorse, Allison spoke in favor of his parole in 2020, and today the two men work together for the Louisiana Parole Project to help formerly incarcerated individuals.</p>

The stolen items include Empress Eugénie's Pearl and Diamond Tiara, a Grand Corsage Bow brooch, and several sets of tiaras, necklaces, and earrings that belonged to French royalty.

          <p>Beloved Southern California public radio station KCRW has laid off 10% of its staff, citing the loss of federal funding for public media and the need to adapt to a changing media landscape. The cuts included several well-known and influential DJs—Jeremy Sole, Jason Kramer, and José Galván—who were celebrated for their eclectic musical tastes and for breaking new artists. The layoffs are the latest in a series of contractions for the station, which has faced significant budget deficits in recent years, reflecting the broader financial challenges confronting public media organizations across the country.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced that university tuition fees in England, currently £9,535, will increase annually in line with inflation starting in 2026. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated that the ability for universities to charge the maximum fee will be conditional on providing high-quality teaching and strong student outcomes. While university representatives welcomed the move as a way to ensure financial sustainability after a decade-long fee freeze, the University and College Union criticized it as doubling down on a "disastrous" funding model that harms both students and staff.</p>

          <p>Employees with employer-sponsored health insurance are likely to see their premiums increase by 6% to 7% in 2026, a rate more than double the current pace of inflation, according to a Mercer analysis. This hike could result in an average annual cost of $2,400 for single coverage and nearly $9,000 for family plans. The rising costs are attributed to factors such as an aging workforce utilizing more medical services and increased demand for expensive new treatments. This financial pressure adds to the strain many American households already face from inflation in other essential goods and services.</p>
