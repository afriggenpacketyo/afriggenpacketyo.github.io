          <p>Ukraine claims a large-scale drone attack deep within Russian territory, reportedly destroying 40 military bombers, an operation allegedly supervised by President Zelenskyy and taking over a year and a half to plan. The drones, transported in containers by trucks, targeted airfields over 2,500 miles from Ukraine, marking the first time a Ukrainian drone has been spotted in the Irkutsk region. This attack coincides with reports of explosions collapsing bridges and derailing trains in western Russia, causing casualties. As a Ukrainian delegation heads to Istanbul for ceasefire talks, Zelenskyy emphasizes the priorities of a complete ceasefire, prisoner returns, and the repatriation of abducted children.</p>

David has written a book, 'The Unthinkable,' about his family's experiences, aiming to give voice to those who grow up in homes where domestic abuse is present, and he advocates for more action to protect victims.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent anticipates President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping will soon discuss trade issues, including a dispute over critical minerals. Trump accused China of violating an agreement to mutually roll back tariffs and trade restrictions for these minerals. Bessent stated that China's actions are disrupting industrial supply chains and expressed confidence that the leaders' call would resolve the issue. He believes that the withholding of products agreed upon in their previous agreement could be a glitch or intentional, which will be determined after the call.</p>
