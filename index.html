          <p>President Trump has repeatedly stated that he would not cut Medicaid, but a House Republican bill aims to slash hundreds of billions from the program, leading to confusion and pushback. The bill proposes work requirements for recipients, more frequent eligibility checks, and penalties for states offering Medicaid to illegal immigrants. Trump has maintained that his administration is only looking for "fraud" and "abuse" in the program, despite criticism that the proposed cuts would leave millions uninsured. Several Republican senators have also voiced opposition to the Medicaid cuts, creating further uncertainty around the bill's future. </p>

          <p>North Carolina Tar Heels head coach Bill Belichick stated that Jordon Hudson "doesnâ€™t have anything to do" with the football program, addressing recent off-field drama.

The university refuted claims that Hudson was barred from the facility, clarifying she manages Belichick's personal brand outside his UNC responsibilities. Belichick emphasized his focus on coaching and preparing for the upcoming season, distancing himself from the controversy surrounding his relationship with Hudson. </p>

          <p>Vaccine experts are puzzled by the Trump administration's $500 million project to develop a universal flu vaccine, called Generation Gold Standard. The project aims to create a flu shot that doesn't need annual updates and protects against other respiratory viruses. Experts are skeptical because the project plans to use a whole killed virus approach, considered antiquated, and the funding was diverted from next-generation COVID-19 vaccine research. Concerns also arise from the selection of the technology without independent review and the involvement of NIH scientists recently appointed to high-ranking positions. </p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine are preparing for potential direct talks in Turkey, with President Trump possibly attending to help mediate. The diplomatic maneuvering began with Putin announcing a unilateral ceasefire, followed by Ukraine demanding an extended ceasefire. Trump has expressed enthusiasm for the talks, urging Ukraine to attend. Zelenskyy has agreed to attend if Putin signs on to a ceasefire first. </p>

          <p>Santa Monica is reminding the public not to feed ground squirrels in Palisades Park, as their population is growing and causing ecological imbalances. The city has cited the county for overpopulation and has tried suppression methods in the past. Feeding the squirrels can lead to the spread of parasites and diseases. The burrowing of the squirrels can also contribute to coastal erosion, particularly along the bluffs near Pacific Coast Highway. </p>
