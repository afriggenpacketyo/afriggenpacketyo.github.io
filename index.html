          <p>E.J. Antoni, President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), has suggested the agency should suspend its monthly jobs report. Antoni, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, criticized the report as flawed and argued for relying on more accurate, albeit less timely, quarterly data instead. This proposal has raised concerns as the monthly report is a crucial economic indicator used by the Federal Reserve and businesses to make critical decisions. The nomination follows the firing of the previous commissioner, whom Trump blamed for a disappointing jobs report.</p>

          <p>During a family holiday in the UK, U.S. Vice President JD Vance held a private meeting with Conservative shadow secretaries Robert Jenrick and Chris Philp in the Cotswolds. The meeting was arranged by Vance's team and follows a separate discussion he had with UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy about international affairs. While Vance's trip includes official engagements, a planned meeting with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch did not occur due to scheduling conflicts. The visit has drawn some local attention due to the heavy security presence in the area for the vice president's stay.</p>

          <p>Shares of Spirit Airlines' parent company, Spirit Aviation Holdings, dropped sharply after the airline issued a warning about its ability to continue operations. The budget carrier expressed "substantial doubt" about its viability over the next year, citing adverse market conditions and weak demand for domestic leisure travel. This announcement comes just months after Spirit emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, highlighting its ongoing struggles with profitability, rising costs, and debt since the pandemic. The company is now considering selling aircraft and real estate to improve its liquidity.</p>

          <p>As retirees face rising living costs, many are considering reverse mortgages to tap into their home equity for financial support. These specialized loans, available to homeowners aged 62 and older, provide cash without requiring monthly payments. While most reverse mortgages are federally regulated and insured by the FHA, they are not without risks. Homeowners must still pay for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance, and failing to do so can lead to foreclosure. The article suggests that these loans are safest for seniors planning to remain in their homes long-term and advises careful consideration of all costs and potential scams.

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is requesting that a judge consider jailing former congressman Beto O'Rourke for allegedly violating a court order. The order blocked O'Rourke and his political group, Powered by People, from fundraising to support Texas Democratic lawmakers who left the state to prevent a quorum on a controversial redistricting bill. Paxton claims O'Rourke has continued to solicit donations despite the ruling and is seeking fines and jail time until he complies. This legal action escalates the political battle over the new congressional map, which Republicans are trying to pass.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to explore rule changes that would permit 401(k) retirement plans to include alternative investments such as private equity and cryptocurrencies. The move aims to provide savers with more options that could offer higher returns, but it also introduces greater risk and complexity. While proponents see it as a way to democratize access to high-performing asset classes, experts caution about the higher fees, lack of transparency, and volatility associated with these investments. Adoption by employers is expected to be slow due to these concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

This public attack continues Trump's long-standing campaign to influence the independent central bank's decisions, which he claims would save the government money on borrowing costs.

Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, stated that several investors are backing the offer, which is higher than the startup's own valuation.

          <p>According to internal documents reported by The Washington Post, Pentagon officials are evaluating plans to create a "Domestic Civil Disturbance Quick Reaction Force." This specialized unit of 600 troops would be on standby to deploy rapidly to U.S. cities to handle protests or civil unrest. The proposal comes as President Trump has already expanded the use of the National Guard for domestic law enforcement, including deployments in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles. Critics raise legal questions about the plan, which would represent a significant expansion of military involvement in domestic affairs.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is expected to strengthen into the season's first hurricane later this week. The storm, which developed west of the Cabo Verde islands, is currently moving westward and does not pose an immediate threat to the United States. However, early models project it will become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands. The storm has already caused flooding and at least eight fatalities in Cabo Verde, prompting an emergency declaration. Forecasters are monitoring its path closely as the Atlantic hurricane season enters its peak months.</p>

          <p>England has officially entered its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F) for three consecutive days in several regions. The prolonged period of dry, hot weather has led to "nationally significant" water shortfalls, according to the national drought group. This has resulted in widespread environmental damage, increased wildfire risk, and negative impacts on farming, with many farmers reporting that the harvest could be catastrophic. In response, millions of people are now under hosepipe bans as water companies struggle to manage dwindling supplies amid the extreme conditions.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that claims of success regarding President Trump's tariff policies are premature and overlook critical economic principles. While supporters point to increased revenue as proof that tariffs are working, the author contends this money comes from American importers and consumers, not foreign countries. The piece dismisses the "Mission Accomplished" narrative, stating that the most dire predictions were avoided only because the administration backed off its most extreme plans. The true, long-term effects on prices, jobs, and manufacturing will take time to materialize and may not be as positive as proponents claim.</p>

Following a positive earnings report, Baird upgraded the company's stock to an outperform rating, citing "high conviction" in Niccol's efforts to improve store operations and customer service. A key initiative is the new "Green Apron" service model, which has already shown double-digit improvements in service speed at test stores and is being rolled out nationwide ahead of schedule. Analysts believe these changes will stabilize sales and lead to stronger profits in the coming year. (not investment advice)</p>

Financial experts suggest reinvesting the funds in a brokerage account, often using tax-efficient exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to maintain long-term growth. Another popular option for the charitably inclined is a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct, tax-free transfer to a nonprofit. For those focused on legacy planning, contributing the RMD proceeds to a 529 college savings plan for family members can also be a beneficial move. (not investment advice)</p>

This inquiry was launched following numerous allegations of misconduct, including the 2012 death of Agnes Wanjiru, who was allegedly killed by a British soldier.
