          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order establishing new tariffs on a wide range of trading partners, set to take effect in seven days. The duties, ranging from 10% to 50% on various nations, are part of what officials call a "new system of trade" aimed at prioritizing fair and balanced commerce. This move follows months of negotiations and delays, with the administration having recently secured agreements with several key partners to lower previously threatened rates. Analysts estimate these tariffs could cost the average American household an additional $2,400 this year as importers pass on costs to consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported second-quarter earnings that, while lower than the previous year, exceeded Wall Street's expectations. The company's net income fell to $7.1 billion, but strong production growth, particularly a record output in the Permian Basin, helped mitigate the impact of declining oil prices. The oil major's refining business saw a significant profit increase due to higher margins. Exxon also returned $9.2 billion to its shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, signaling financial strength despite market fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Moderna has reduced the high end of its 2025 revenue forecast, citing a delay in Covid vaccine shipments to the United Kingdom from late 2025 to early 2026. Despite this adjustment and grappling with falling vaccine demand, the company surpassed Wall Street's second-quarter expectations, reporting a smaller-than-anticipated loss and higher revenue. This outperformance was largely attributed to significant cost-cutting measures, including a recent announcement to reduce its workforce by 10%. The news reflects Moderna's ongoing transition in the post-pandemic market. (not investment advice)</p>

This decision comes amid growing tensions with FIFA over an increasingly congested international match calendar, which has been exacerbated by expanded club and international competitions. Masters stated that domestic football should not be sacrificed for global expansion and criticized FIFA for a lack of proper dialogue with stakeholders. The stance reaffirms the league's commitment to its current structure, which has been in place since 1994.</p>

          <p>New York Mets star shortstop Francisco Lindor expressed his belief that his teammate, Juan Soto, was unjustly snubbed from this year's MLB All-Star game. Speaking to Fox News Digital, Lindor stated that Soto "deserved it" and "definitely should have been there," highlighting his status as one of the league's best hitters. Despite a slow start to the season, Soto has demonstrated strong performance with 25 home runs and 62 RBIs. Lindor's comments underscore the respect Soto commands from his peers, even when not selected for the midsummer classic.</p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates that a majority of Americans hold the Trump administration and corporate interests responsible for the rising cost of living and their financial struggles. According to the survey, six in ten Americans blame the administration for increased costs, with a significant number fearing that the president's tariffs will further elevate prices on everyday goods. The poll highlights widespread financial anxiety, with many respondents worried about affording groceries, housing, and unexpected expenses. This sentiment points to a growing belief that economic policies have favored corporations and the wealthy over average families. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new peer-reviewed study suggests that a mass die-off of monarch butterflies in Southern California in January 2024 was likely caused by pesticide exposure. Researchers found hundreds of dead or dying butterflies near a wintering site, exhibiting symptoms of neurotoxic poisoning. Subsequent testing of the insects revealed an average of seven different pesticides in each, at levels suspected to be lethal. This research provides rare, direct evidence linking pesticide use to the dramatic decline in monarch populations, a connection that has been hard to prove definitively in the wild.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Ray Dalio has completed his departure from Bridgewater Associates, the massive hedge fund he founded in 1975, by selling his remaining equity stake and stepping away from its board. This move finalizes a management transition process that began in 2022, though Dalio will continue to be a significant investor and mentor for the firm. Bridgewater raised capital from existing investors and employees to facilitate the final sale of Dalio's ownership. The transition marks the end of an era for one of the most influential firms in the financial world. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rising global temperatures are making mountaineering increasingly hazardous, as melting snow and ice destabilize mountain environments and heighten the risk of rockfalls and avalanches. This article highlights how climate change is altering iconic peaks in regions like Pakistan's Karakoram, where conditions are becoming dangerously unpredictable, forcing some expeditions to end prematurely. Climbers are adapting by starting ascents earlier or at night to avoid the warmest parts of the day. The trend not only poses a threat to climbers but also to the local economies in Nepal and Pakistan that depend heavily on mountain tourism.</p>

          <p>The UK's Met Office has officially named Storm Floris, which is expected to hit the country on Monday, bringing a period of heavy rain and strong winds. As the fifth named storm of the season, Floris is forecast to track across the northern UK, with the most disruptive winds affecting southern and western areas. Gusts could reach 60 to 80 mph in some coastal and hilly regions, with a risk of travel disruption, power outages, and damage to temporary structures. The storm system is currently developing in the Atlantic and its exact path will determine the severity of its impact.</p>

          <p>In a new initiative to increase social mobility, the UK government has announced that its main civil service internship scheme will now be exclusively for university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The policy, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to make the civil service more representative of the country it serves. A student's eligibility will be determined by their parents' occupation. Those who successfully complete the paid internship will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program, creating a new pathway into Whitehall for underrepresented talent.</p>

All suspects have been interviewed and subsequently bailed as the investigation continues.

          <p>A new California state law, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, has brought a major change to how homeowners associations (HOAs) can penalize residents. The law amends the Davis-Stirling Act to cap fines for most violations at $100, unless the issue poses a direct health or safety risk. This legislation is seen as a significant victory for homeowners who have long complained about aggressive and arbitrary fines from their associations. The law, which was passed quickly as part of a larger housing bill, has surprised and frustrated the HOA industry, which argues it undermines their ability to enforce community rules.</p>

The California Department of Fish and Wildlife recently killed a bear believed to be responsible for many break-ins, but tensions remain high as local leaders criticize the state's management and explore regional solutions to what they call a growing public safety threat.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers, despite having baseball's best record on paper, were surprisingly inactive at the trade deadline, failing to acquire a proven closer or a defensive outfielder. This article argues that this lack of moves represents a significant failure by the team's front office, led by Andrew Friedman, who has historically made impactful midseason trades. With several key relief pitchers being traded to rival contenders, the Dodgers are left to rely on an inconsistent bullpen. The inaction is seen as an arrogant gamble on a roster that, while talented, has shown vulnerabilities this season.</p>

While Nvidia's value has soared past $4 trillion on the strength of its AI-powering chips, Intel's has dropped below $100 billion. Under a new CEO, the company is attempting another costly turnaround, focusing on its foundry business and cost-cutting to regain its footing in a highly competitive industry.

In 2001, state regulators proposed forcing utilities to remove inactive lines, but lobbying efforts resulted in a diluted rule that allowed companies to keep them up indefinitely if they determined a "foreseeable future use." This regulatory history is now under scrutiny as the old Edison line, last used in 1971, is a leading theory for the cause of the fire that killed 19 people.</p>
