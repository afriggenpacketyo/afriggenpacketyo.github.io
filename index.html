Witnesses reported that up to 50 people attempted to lift the tree to free the children trapped underneath. In a tribute, Leonna's family described her as a "light in our lives" who was "full of life."

          <p>The Trump administration has informed states it is withholding more than $6 billion in federal education grants, a move that disrupts funding just before the traditional July 1 disbursement date. The U.S. Education Department stated it is reviewing several grant programs, including those for teacher professional development, migrant education, and after-school activities. School officials have called the decision "unprecedented" and warned it will disrupt district planning and budgeting for the upcoming school year. The administration had previously proposed eliminating these same grant programs in its fiscal year 2026 budget.</p>

Despite clearing the Senate, the legislation's future is uncertain as it returns to the House of Representatives, where it must be approved with the Senate's amendments.

          <p>NYU Stern professor Suzy Welch advises job seekers to ask, "What kind of person should not work at this company?" during interviews to gain honest insights into a company's true values. Welch argues this question often elicits less-rehearsed and more revealing answers than direct inquiries about company culture, helping candidates assess if the environment is a good fit. Responses like "a person who doesn't want to text on weekends" can expose underlying expectations about work-life balance. The article suggests this approach helps align personal values with a potential employer's actual practices, leading to better job satisfaction.</p>

          <p>California has passed a significant reform of its landmark environmental law, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), to expedite housing construction and address the state's affordability crisis. Governor Gavin Newsom, who championed the changes, argued that the 1970s-era law had become a bureaucratic obstacle to building much-needed housing. The overhaul aims to streamline the approval process for new developments, a move supported by housing advocates but opposed by some environmental groups. This legislative change is part of a broader state budget effort to tackle pressing issues like housing and homelessness.</p>

The facility, built on a remote airstrip, is intended to house, process, and deport undocumented immigrants as part of the administration's expanded enforcement efforts. Officials emphasized the site's remote and unforgiving location as a deterrent, with Noem warning that those in the country illegally could "end up here" if they do not self-deport.

          <p>As President Trump's signature tax-cut and spending bill moves through Congress, Republicans are shifting their messaging to deny that the legislation will increase the national debt. Independent analysts project the bill could add $3.3 trillion to the debt over a decade, but proponents argue that extending existing tax cuts does not constitute a new cost. This approach has drawn criticism from Democrats and some investment strategists, who warn it could erode fiscal health and market confidence. The bill also includes a $5 trillion increase to the debt ceiling to avert a potential government default. (not investment advice)</p>

These alleged financial schemes are now part of a broader "pattern of unlawful activity" charge that also covers the alleged murder.

          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, house prices in the United Kingdom fell by 0.8% in June, marking the largest single-month drop since February 2023.

Despite the monthly fall, the annual price growth rate was still positive at 2.1%, though this represents the slowest yearly increase in nearly a year.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has identified President Trump's trade tariffs as a key reason for the central bank's hesitation to cut interest rates more aggressively. Speaking at an event in Portugal, Powell explained that the imposition of tariffs forced the Fed to pause its rate adjustments to assess their uncertain inflationary impact. He suggested that without the tariffs, further rate cuts would have been more likely. This statement directly addresses the President's frequent criticism of the Fed for not lowering borrowing costs, attributing the policy constraint to the administration's own actions.
