          <p>In an exclusive interview, a top Iranian official confirmed that the nation will not relinquish its nuclear enrichment program, viewing it as a matter of national pride and scientific achievement. The official acknowledged that recent U.S. strikes caused "serious" damage to their nuclear facilities, temporarily halting enrichment capabilities. Despite international pressure and the threat of sanctions, Iran maintains its defiant stance, rejecting proposals for a consortium to supply its civil nuclear power needs. Upcoming talks with European nations, Russia, and China are set ahead of an August deadline for a new nuclear agreement.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has increasingly favored tariffs as a primary tool of foreign policy, creating global economic uncertainty and altering traditional diplomatic strategies. Unlike sanctions, which are typically used to punish specific actions, tariffs are being deployed to pressure countries on a range of non-trade issues like immigration and drug trafficking. This approach provides the president with unilateral control and generates revenue, but critics warn it blurs the lines between economic and punitive measures, risking destabilization of international trade relations.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that a vote on a resolution calling for the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein will not occur before the August congressional recess. Johnson stated he believes the Trump administration needs space to conduct its own review, following the President's order for the Justice Department to produce grand jury testimony. The decision has drawn criticism from Democrats, who label the non-binding resolution a "cover vote," and from some Republicans pushing for more immediate action on transparency regarding the matter.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated he will not facilitate a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in Washington, D.C., unless the team changes its name back to the 'Washington Redskins.' In social media posts, Trump claimed his stance was very popular and suggested he could impose a "restriction" to enforce his demand. The White House affirmed the president's seriousness, while the Association on American Indian Affairs criticized the remarks as a distraction. The team, which dropped its former name in 2020 due to its racist connotations, has previously stated it has no plans to change its current name.</p>

          <p>Smaller and secondary U.S. ports, from California to the Gulf Coast, are experiencing significant reductions in trade volume due to the ongoing trade war and tariff uncertainty. Shippers are rerouting cargo to larger ports like Los Angeles to get products into the country before potential tariff deadlines, causing a drop in container traffic for ports such as Oakland, Jacksonville, and New Orleans. This market recalibration is leading to concerns about local job losses and economic instability in the communities reliant on these ports. The trend is expected to continue, putting sustained economic pressure on these smaller trade hubs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For individuals struggling with high credit card debt, debt management programs offer a potential solution by consolidating payments and negotiating lower interest rates. To qualify, applicants generally must meet three key requirements. First, they need a steady and sufficient income to cover both living expenses and the new single monthly payment. Second, the debt must be primarily unsecured, such as credit cards or personal loans, and fall within the program's minimum and maximum limits. Finally, applicants must be willing to commit to the program's rules, which often includes closing credit accounts and participating in financial counseling.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has ordered a new trial for Pedro Hernandez, the man convicted in 2017 for the infamous 1979 murder of six-year-old Etan Patz in New York City. The court ruled that the trial judge gave the jury improper instructions regarding Hernandez's confession, which contradicted established federal law and was not a harmless error. Hernandez, who has a history of mental illness and a low IQ, confessed to the crime after hours of questioning in 2012. His defense has long argued the confession was coerced, and this ruling gives him a chance to challenge the conviction.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called for a comprehensive review of the Federal Reserve, suggesting an examination that extends beyond current controversies to its overall mission and success. His comments come amid heightened tension between the White House and the central bank over interest rate policy and spending on building renovations. Bessent questioned whether the institution has succeeded in its mission, comparing the situation to a hypothetical review of the FAA after repeated mistakes. This call for scrutiny reflects the administration's ongoing criticism of the Fed's decisions and operational management. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With U.S. college costs averaging over $38,000 annually, many students rely on federal loans, which come with specific borrowing limits to encourage responsible debt management. For dependent undergraduates, the annual loan limits range from $5,500 to $7,500, with a lifetime maximum of $31,000. Independent undergraduates have higher limits, up to $12,500 annually and a $57,500 aggregate cap. Graduate students can borrow up to $20,500 per year. Since these amounts may not cover the full cost of attendance, students often need to supplement with private loans, which require credit checks but can offer competitive rates.</p>

          <p>A dispute has erupted between NHS England and the British Medical Association (BMA) over the level of care to be provided during an upcoming five-day doctors' strike. NHS England has instructed hospitals to avoid canceling non-urgent care except in exceptional circumstances. However, the BMA warns this directive will stretch non-striking doctors too thin, putting emergency patient safety at risk by depleting staff needed for critical services. This new hardline approach from NHS leadership marks a shift from previous strikes, where widespread rescheduling of non-urgent procedures was considered essential to maintain safety.</p>
