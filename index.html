          <p>The House has passed the bipartisan "Take It Down Act," which aims to combat the non-consensual sharing of explicit imagery, including AI-generated deepfakes. This legislation, supported by First Lady Melania Trump, mandates social media platforms to remove such content within 48 hours of a victim's request. The bill addresses the growing issue of cyber abuse and extortion, which has tragically led to suicides in some cases. Digital rights groups have raised concerns about potential suppression of lawful speech and the lack of safeguards against malicious takedown requests, as the bill now awaits the president's signature.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its conflict with sanctuary cities and states through executive orders aimed at bolstering immigration enforcement. The orders will direct federal agencies to publish a list of jurisdictions that obstruct federal immigration laws and unleash law enforcement to pursue criminal aliens. The administration argues that these measures are necessary to protect American communities, while critics contend they are unconstitutional and intended to scare communities. This move follows legal challenges to previous attempts to penalize sanctuary cities, particularly in California, and is part of Trump's broader focus on immigration.</p>

This "space brolly" will provide scientists with unprecedented data on the amount of woody material, a proxy for carbon dioxide, stored in the planet's 1.5 trillion trees. The satellite will employ a CT scan-like approach, analyzing slices of trees to build a comprehensive picture of carbon storage, which is essential for accurate climate change modeling and deforestation tracking. The project aims to produce annual maps of carbon storage and loss, unaffected by cloud cover, offering a consistent view of forests year after year.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that an immunotherapy drug called dostarlimab may allow some patients with early-stage cancers to avoid surgery. In the study, a significant number of participants responded so well to the drug that their tumors disappeared, and they no longer required surgical intervention. The study focused on patients with tumors that had a "mismatch repair defect," a genetic characteristic that makes them more likely to respond to immunotherapy. Researchers are optimistic about the potential for combining immunotherapy with other approaches to expand its effectiveness across various cancer types.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division is experiencing a mass departure of attorneys following a shift in priorities under the Trump administration. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon stated that the division's focus would move away from traditional civil rights enforcement to culture war issues. This change has prompted over 100 attorneys to resign, as the DOJ pursues legal action against states permitting transgender athletes in women's sports and investigates alleged anti-Christian bias. Democrats have expressed concerns about the politicization of the division.</p>

          <p>Concerns have arisen regarding the editorial independence of CBS News, with suggestions that its parent company, Paramount, is censoring coverage to appease the Trump administration. This scrutiny reportedly includes increased oversight of stories related to the Trump administration, potentially influenced by Paramount's desire for FCC approval of its merger with Skydance Media. The concerns follow President Trump's criticism of CBS and the FCC chair's threats against another company's broadcast license over its coverage of Trump's deportation policies.</p>
