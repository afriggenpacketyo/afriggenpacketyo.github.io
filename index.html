          <p>Starbucks is implementing a $1 billion restructuring plan that includes closing underperforming coffeehouses and eliminating approximately 900 non-retail positions. The company stated the changes are part of its "Back to Starbucks" initiative, aimed at enhancing customer experience and improving financial performance by reallocating resources. While the overall store count in North America will see a slight decline in fiscal year 2025, the company plans to resume growth and upgrade over 1,000 locations in the following year. Affected employees will be offered transfers where possible or receive severance packages.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. saw minimal change in August, with a slight 0.2% decrease from July, according to the National Association of Realtors. The market slowdown is attributed to higher mortgage rates, with activity being stronger for high-end properties and weaker for more affordable homes. Supply has tightened as sellers hesitate to list their properties, which has kept the median home price at $422,600, a 2% increase from the previous year. The data reflects a constrained housing market, particularly for first-time buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has pledged to block any efforts to exclude Israel from the 2026 World Cup, which it is co-hosting. This statement comes after a UN commission's report and calls from a panel of UN experts and Spain's Prime Minister to impose sporting sanctions on Israel, similar to those placed on Russia. The calls for a ban have intensified amid reports that UEFA might consider suspending Israel, although no meeting is currently scheduled. The situation reflects growing international pressure on sporting bodies to take a stance on the ongoing conflict.</p>

Additionally, durable goods orders increased, contrary to forecasts, painting a picture of underlying economic strength that may influence the Federal Reserve's future interest rate decisions.

          <p>The Australian horror film "Together" has faced backlash in China after its distributor digitally altered scenes to change a gay couple into a heterosexual one for advance screenings. Viewers noticed the changes, including the AI-assisted replacement of a male actor's face with a woman's, sparking criticism online for misrepresenting the film's plot and characters. The film's global distributor, Neon, has condemned the unauthorized edits and demanded that the Chinese distributor cease showing the altered version. This incident highlights China's ongoing censorship of LGBTQ+ content and the new methods being used to implement it.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has claimed he was the victim of "triple sabotage" during his appearance at the United Nations, citing three separate equipment failures. In a social media post, he detailed how an escalator he was on stopped abruptly, his teleprompter failed during his speech, and the sound system in the auditorium was reportedly off. Trump dismissed the idea of coincidence and demanded a UN investigation into the incidents, which he called a "real disgrace." A UN official suggested an aide inadvertently hit the escalator's stop lever, but the series of mishaps fueled the president's claims of deliberate interference.</p>

Terms like "situationships," "sneaky links," and "breadcrumbing" describe various forms of casual or undefined connections, reflecting a culture that often prioritizes emotional detachment and fears vulnerability. While this provides flexibility, it can also create stress and confusion, as young people navigate a "buffet" of relationship options without a clear script. The analysis suggests this cautious approach is shaped by a world of online scrutiny, political turmoil, and a desire for autonomy.</p>

          <p>The White House Office of Management and Budget has instructed federal agencies to prepare for potential mass layoffs, known as reductions-in-force, if a government shutdown occurs next week. A memo told agencies to identify employees in programs with discretionary funding or those "not consistent with the President's priorities" for possible termination, a step beyond the typical furloughs of past shutdowns. The move increases pressure on Congress to pass a funding bill before the September 30 deadline. Democratic leaders condemned the memo as an intimidation tactic, while the administration maintained it is a necessary planning measure.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has opened the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for the upcoming academic year a week earlier than its traditional October 1 launch date. Experts view the early opening as a significant benefit for college-bound students, as some financial aid is distributed on a first-come, first-served basis. This timely release is a welcome development after the previous cycle's launch was plagued by delays and glitches, which contributed to a decline in FAFSA completion rates. An earlier start may help more students access federal grants, loans, and work-study programs.</p>

          <p>A Paris court has sentenced former French President Nicolas Sarkozy to five years in prison after finding him guilty of criminal conspiracy related to a scheme to use illicit funds from Libya for his 2007 campaign. The court ruled that Sarkozy will be incarcerated even if he appeals the verdict, a stunning development for a former head of state. Sarkozy, who was cleared of several other charges, denounced the ruling as an "injustice" and a "scandal," vowing to appeal. Two of his former ministers were also found guilty in the case, which has cast a long shadow over his political legacy.</p>

          <p>As of September 24, 2025, the national average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.39%, while a 15-year mortgage averages 5.57%, according to Bankrate data. For homeowners looking to refinance, the average rates are slightly higher, at 6.67% for a 30-year term and 5.98% for a 15-year term. These rates present a challenging environment for prospective buyers and refinancers compared to previous years. Experts suggest that strengthening one's credit profile and comparing offers from multiple lenders are key strategies for securing the best possible rate in the current market.

          <p>A federal judge has refused to reinstate eight inspectors general who were fired by the Trump administration, despite acknowledging that the president likely violated federal law in their removal. U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes stated that while the fired watchdogs "deserved better," the court could not grant their reinstatement before the lawsuit is fully resolved because the harm was not legally deemed "irreparable." The plaintiffs were part of a mass firing of 17 inspectors general in January, an action that critics argue weakened oversight and accountability across major federal agencies. The judge noted Trump could simply fire them again after giving the legally required 30-day notice.</p>

While the FDA is relabeling the drug for a rare condition called cerebral folate deficiency (CFD), which is sometimes associated with autism, its broader efficacy for autism spectrum disorder is unproven. Critics argue the administration is "jumping the gun," as evidence is preliminary and based on small studies.

This marketing shift is seen as a response to polling that shows widespread public disapproval of the law.

This freeze, which the department says could last until winter 2025, is attributed to system adjustments following court rulings against other repayment plans.
