During their first visit to the city since Naruhito's accession in 2019, they laid flowers and bowed at the cenotaph in Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, which commemorates around 340,000 victims. They also toured an exhibition displaying atomic bombing relics, with the Emperor expressing his sorrow upon learning that the area near the hypocenter was once a densely populated neighborhood.

          <p>Julius Malema, a controversial South African opposition MP, has been banned from entering the UK due to his radical views and support for Hamas. The UK government deemed Malema "non-conducive to the public good," citing his past statements, including those seemingly inciting violence. Malema's Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party condemned the decision, arguing that the UK is stifling democratic debate and distorting Malema's views on racial inequality in South Africa. This marks the second time Malema has been denied entry to the UK, with the Home Office stating he has no right of appeal, as the decision was a substantive one.

          <p>Juneteenth, now a federally recognized holiday, commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S., originating from June 19, 1865, when enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom. Celebrations include parades, concerts, and educational events, though some corporate sponsorships have decreased amid efforts to roll back diversity initiatives. The holiday serves as a reminder of the country's foundation on slavery and the long struggle for emancipation, with historical celebrations varying by region based on when news of the Emancipation Proclamation reached different communities. Despite changes in funding, Juneteenth festivities are expected to draw crowds across the country, memorializing a specific day in Galveston while symbolizing the joyful anniversary of independence.

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court's conservative justices allowed Tennessee's ban on transition-related healthcare for minors to remain in effect, potentially impacting similar bans in other states. The ruling in *United States v Skrmetti* is seen as an attack on vulnerable children and a substantial weakening of constitutional guarantees of equal protection of the sexes. By circumventing sex equality provisions, the court's decision suggests a broader, darker outlook for transgender people under the law, with potentially dire implications for queer individuals, women, and anyone not conforming to traditional gender norms.
