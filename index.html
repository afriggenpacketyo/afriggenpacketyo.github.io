          <p>The brother of Amy Bradley, who vanished from a Royal Caribbean cruise ship in 1998, has revealed new information not featured in a recent Netflix documentary about her case. He alleges that the FBI failed to properly investigate, specifically by never interviewing a key witness who could corroborate the timeline of Amy's last known moments. Additionally, he disclosed a third witness who testified to a grand jury about seeing Amy with the primary suspect and hearing another person shout "senorita kidnap" around the time of the disappearance. The family remains hopeful she is still alive and continues to seek answers.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin has rapidly strengthened into a Category 5 storm, becoming the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season. With maximum sustained winds reaching 160 mph, its outer bands are currently affecting the northern Leeward Islands, prompting tropical storm watches and warnings of flash flooding. While the storm's center is expected to pass north of Puerto Rico and remain offshore, avoiding a direct impact on the United States, officials are urging those in the Caribbean to monitor its progress closely. Forecasters anticipate the storm will curve northward, staying away from the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>A strike by approximately 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants led to significant travel disruptions on Saturday, including the cancellation of 24 flights at Los Angeles International Airport and two at John Wayne Airport. The labor dispute, initiated by the Canada Union of Public Employees over wages and unpaid work, began late Friday night. The Canadian government quickly intervened, imposing binding arbitration to force the flight attendants back to work and end the strike. The airline anticipates it could take five to ten days to fully restore its regular flight schedule, which typically includes around 700 flights per day.</p>

This marks the 12th execution scheduled in Florida for the year, a record number since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976.

The strike, centered on demands for higher salaries and payment for ground time, had forced the nation's largest carrier to suspend all operations, affecting an estimated 130,000 passengers daily. Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu cited the need to preserve economic stability and supply chains as the reason for the intervention. The union criticized the move as a violation of their rights, while the airline expressed regret for the disruption caused to customers.</p>

          <p>A group of 96 cross-party Members of Parliament in the UK has formally urged the government to evacuate sick and injured children from Gaza for medical treatment "without delay." In a letter to senior ministers, the MPs highlighted the decimated healthcare system in the war-torn region and stated that many children are at imminent risk of death. They are calling for the removal of any bureaucratic barriers, questioning the practicality of pre-evacuation biometric checks, and requesting that evacuated families have the option to seek asylum in the UK. The government has responded that plans are being accelerated for a few hundred children.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday to discuss a direct peace agreement to end the war with Russia. This approach bypasses the previous goal of securing a ceasefire first, a shift that occurred after Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin, which he described as "very successful." Trump stated that he, Zelenskyy, and European leaders determined a full peace agreement is the best path forward, as ceasefires often fail to hold. The proposed deal's details remain undisclosed, but the meeting aims to save potentially millions of lives by ending the conflict.</p>

The senators expressed serious alarm, arguing the deal trades away America's competitive technological edge and could strengthen China's military capabilities.

Leaked details from a call with European leaders suggest Trump believes a deal is negotiable if Ukraine gives up territory its forces still hold in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. In exchange, Putin allegedly offered to freeze the current front lines and halt further advances. This position marks a significant potential shift in U.S. policy and is at odds with the stance of Ukraine and its European allies, who maintain that Ukraine's internationally recognized borders must be respected.</p>

There are widespread fears in Kyiv that the talks have intensified uncertainty and that Ukraine may now face increased pressure from the U.S. to accept unfavorable terms.

          <p>Hurricane Erin's transformation from a tropical storm into a powerful Category 5 hurricane occurred through a process known as rapid intensification. This happens when a storm's wind speeds increase by more than 58 mph within a 24-hour period, a phenomenon fueled in this case by unusually warm sea surface temperatures exceeding 85 degrees Fahrenheit. Experts note that climate change is making such rapid intensifications more common, as hotter oceans provide more energy for storms to strengthen quickly. This rapid growth complicates forecasting and emergency preparedness for coastal regions, even when storms like Erin are projected to stay at sea.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration to Increase Scrutiny of "Good Moral Character" for U.S. Citizenship</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is implementing stricter guidelines for evaluating the "good moral character" requirement for immigrants applying for U.S. citizenship. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has instructed its officers to conduct a more "holistic assessment" that goes beyond a simple criminal background check. The new policy places greater emphasis on an applicant's positive contributions, such as community involvement and stable employment, while also increasing scrutiny of negative factors, including actions that are lawful but deemed inconsistent with civic responsibility. Critics argue the move is designed to create more grounds for denial and discourage legal immigrants from applying for naturalization.</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales are planning to move to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom home in Windsor Great Park, along with their three children. The family has been residing at Adelaide Cottage since 2022, but have decided on a move for a "fresh start" following a challenging period that included the princess's cancer diagnosis. Sources indicate the couple views this as a long-term, "forever home" where they will live even after becoming King and Queen. The move is being funded privately, and they will pay market rent on the property, continuing their preference for no live-in staff to maintain family privacy.</p>

          <p>A Phoenix-based startup is repurposing old shipping containers to create innovative and rapidly deployable shelters for the city's unhoused population. Architect Brian Stark designed the "X-WING" shelters, where four containers are joined in an 'X' shape to create 20 individual, air-conditioned rooms. The sustainable design utilizes existing materials and can be constructed in just one week, offering a cost-effective solution to the growing housing crisis. Stark's next project is a 105-unit apartment complex made from containers, aimed at providing affordable housing for low-income senior citizens, furthering his mission to use architecture to address social challenges.</p>

From its 1,670-acre Wisconsin campus, Epic operates under Faulkner's principles of remaining private and avoiding acquisitions, focusing solely on its software. This approach has made Epic a leader, used in over 40% of U.S. hospitals, while also drawing criticism for its closed system. Faulkner, described as a mix of Bill Gates and Willy Wonka, has established a detailed succession plan to ensure the company remains privately held and true to her original vision long after she steps down.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data shows a 13% drop in immigration arrests nationwide during July compared to the previous month. This slowdown comes after a sharp increase in June and amid President Trump's push for mass deportations. While ICE has cited the need for more resources to meet its goals, activists and immigrant rights groups believe their efforts may be contributing to the decline. In places like Oregon, a combination of nightly protests outside ICE facilities and a "rapid-response" legal aid system for arrestees may be creating obstacles for large-scale enforcement operations in the state.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued by a California Highway Patrol helicopter after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area near Sequoia National Park. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, trapping him. A search was launched after he failed to return to his car, and a dive team eventually located him using a drone. He was hoisted to safety and treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>
