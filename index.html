          <p>The White House has terminated the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer, after the agency reported weaker-than-expected job growth. President Trump accused the agency of rigging figures, a claim made without evidence that drew widespread condemnation from economists and political opponents for politicizing vital economic data. The move, combined with ongoing tariff concerns, contributed to a sharp decline in US stock markets as critics warned of damage to public trust in government statistics. (not investment advice)</p>

The new duties affect numerous trading partners, including Canada, India, and the European Union, with some industries like French wine producers warning of a "brutal" impact.

A significant portion of the output, around 60 percent from one project, is slated for direct shipment to China.

The incident, triggered by a magnitude 4.2 earth tremor, has already claimed the life of one worker. Rescue teams are working to clear debris to reach the miners, who are located at a depth of over 900 meters, though no contact has been established yet. Operations at the state-run Codelco mine have been suspended as authorities focus on the urgent rescue mission.</p>

She revealed she has not renewed her Nigerian passport since the early 2000s and said her return to the UK at age 16 was because her parents saw no future for her there, an experience which shaped her political views.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led research team has discovered that the modern potato owes its existence to an ancient hybridization event involving an ancestor of the tomato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists traced the tuber's origin back nine million years to a cross between a tomato-like plant and a tuberless potato relative. This groundbreaking study, published in the journal Cell, concludes that this ancient genetic mixing was the key evolutionary driver for the development of the tuber, the edible part that made the potato a global food staple.</p>

          <p>A truck carrying a large quantity of hot dogs spilled its contents across a major highway in Shrewsbury, Pennsylvania, causing significant traffic disruption during the Friday morning commute. A mechanical issue caused the truck's trailer to be torn open after scraping against a concrete divider, scattering the sausages across the road. Cleanup crews were dispatched to the scene, with a fire chief noting the unexpected slipperiness of the hot dogs. A front-end loader was used to scoop up the spilled wieners and clear the roadway for motorists.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has scheduled arguments for a major case concerning whether Louisiana's creation of a second majority-Black congressional district constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The court has asked parties to address if the map violates the 14th or 15th Amendments, setting up a legal battle with significant implications for the Voting Rights Act. The case stems from a yearslong dispute over the state's political map and highlights the challenge of balancing racial representation with constitutional limits on using race in drawing district lines. The outcome could impact the balance of power in the House.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Link Increased Flooding in North China to Solar Cycle Activity</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Chinese scientists suggests a connection between decadal solar cycle activities and a pattern of increased summer flooding in northern China. Research published in the Journal of Climate indicates that changes in the sun's magnetic cycle influence the positioning of the monsoon rain belt over the country. This solar-driven climate regime is believed to contribute to the observed "south drought and north flooding" phenomenon. The findings could provide a crucial new dimension for improving long-term climate predictions and flood season forecasts in the region.</p>

          <p>Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was expected to attend a major fundraiser for President Trump, just one day after the president publicly demanded that pharmaceutical companies drastically lower drug prices in the U.S. The White House sent letters to 17 drug companies, including Pfizer, asking them to match lower international prices for their products. The fundraiser, held at Trump's golf club in New Jersey, aimed to raise approximately $25 million for a pro-Trump super PAC. This event highlights the complex relationship between the administration and the pharmaceutical industry. (not investment advice)</p>
