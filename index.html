        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's US$12.7 trillion stock market is experiencing a sustained rally, primarily fueled by a substantial shift of household savings into equities. Data from the People's Bank of China indicates a significant increase in deposits at non-banking financial institutions, totaling over 3.3 trillion yuan across July and August, suggesting further room for growth. This movement is largely driven by prevailing low-interest-rate policies, which are diminishing returns from traditional banking deposits and encouraging investors to seek higher yields in the capital market. The attractive 5.5% earnings yield of major Chinese listed companies, significantly surpassing government bonds and demand deposit rates, underscores the current appeal and potential for continued investment.

          <p>The UK and US have unveiled the Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy, a landmark agreement designed to accelerate nuclear power development and bolster energy security. This ambitious initiative is projected to generate thousands of jobs and unlock billions in private investment, aiming to position both nations at the forefront of global innovation. A key component involves streamlining regulatory approvals, significantly reducing the average licensing period for nuclear projects from up to four years to just two. The partnership also seeks to increase commercial collaborations between British and American firms, with specific projects already in discussion, promising stable energy prices for consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEO of Aldi UK, Giles Hurley, has issued a warning that forthcoming government policies in the Budget, particularly those increasing employer costs, could inevitably lead to a rise in food prices for consumers. Hurley highlighted that existing measures, including the National Insurance increase and new packaging regulations, have already contributed to higher shelf-edge prices across the supermarket industry. Over 60 retailers have collectively appealed to Chancellor Rachel Reeves to refrain from imposing additional taxes on a sector already grappling with significant cost pressures. Projections from the Food and Drink Federation suggest UK food inflation could climb to 5.7% by December, primarily influenced by minimum wage increases and new packaging rules.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is actively considering a "coal-to-nuclear" (C2N) initiative, proposing the conversion of existing coal-fired power plants into advanced nuclear facilities, primarily utilizing fourth-generation reactors. This strategic move aims to achieve significant decarbonization of the energy sector while efficiently repurposing valuable infrastructure, particularly in the nation's coastal areas. Researchers involved in the project suggest that these advanced reactors could offer enhanced site safety and foster greater public acceptance compared to older nuclear technologies. With over 1.19 terawatts of coal-fired capacity and roughly 100 gigawatts expected to retire by 2030, this plan represents a direct pathway for China to meet its ambitious climate goals and bolster energy sustainability.</p>

A University of Hawaii study indicates that over half of the children reported symptoms of depression, and nearly half were experiencing PTSD. The island faces a critical shortage of mental health specialists, worsened by high living costs and professional burnout, which severely hinders the provision of adequate support for the affected youth. This prolonged crisis underscores the deep and lasting psychological impact of natural disasters on vulnerable communities.</p>

Retail sales increased by only 3.4% year-on-year, falling short of the 3.9% forecast, while industrial output growth decelerated to 5.2%, marking its weakest level since August 2024. Fixed-asset investment expanded by a mere 0.5% year-to-date, with the real estate sector experiencing a sharp contraction of 12.9%.

Despite Amorim's appointment over ten months ago and substantial investment in new players, the team's dismal 3-0 derby defeat to Manchester City prompted many supporters to leave before the final whistle. Rooney emphasized a lack of clear progression or discernible tactical patterns, specifically criticizing the manager's rigid adherence to a 3-4-3 system that consistently leaves the midfield exposed and overrun. Amorim's 36% win rate across all competitions marks the worst for any permanent United manager since World War Two, indicating a deeply concerning period for the storied club.</p>

Despite acknowledging previous disagreements, Hochul highlighted Mamdani's shared commitment to ensuring children grow up safe, expanding economic opportunity, and making the city affordable. She also underscored their mutual resolve to fearlessly confront President Donald Trump's agenda, asserting that New York City must never be subjected to Trump's control. This endorsement from a moderate governor for a democratic socialist candidate is particularly noteworthy, especially given Mamdani's recent efforts to moderate his image, including an apology for past controversial statements regarding the NYPD.</p>

          <h2>South Korea's Kospi Index Reaches Record High Following Scrapped Tax-Hike Plan</h2>

          <p>South Korea's Kospi index soared to a record high of 3,420.23, extending its winning streak to ten consecutive sessions, following Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol's announcement that the government would abandon its prior plan to raise taxes on stock investments. This robust market performance unfolded as broader Asia-Pacific markets displayed mixed trading, with investors closely monitoring ongoing high-level US-China trade discussions in Madrid and evaluating a recent slate of Chinese economic data. The Kospi's strong upward trajectory stands in contrast to China's CSI 300, which registered only a modest advance despite reports of August's economic slowdown and a worsening real estate investment contraction. Meanwhile, US equity futures remained largely unchanged, as investors awaited the Federal Reserve's crucial meeting later in the week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Conservative Party has formally escalated its demands for answers from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer concerning the extent of Downing Street's awareness of Lord Mandelson's connections to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. The Tories have called for the immediate release of all pertinent government documents and for Starmer and his chief of staff to provide evidence to Parliament. This intense scrutiny follows reports that Starmer explicitly inquired about Mandelson's links to Epstein prior to appointing him as ambassador to the US, and Mandelson's subsequent dismissal after emails revealed supportive messages he sent to Epstein. The scandal, occurring shortly after Angela Rayner's resignation, has also prompted some Labour MPs to openly criticize Starmer's leadership and perceived poor judgment.</p>

Authorities classified the incident as a "significant threat to public safety," citing a potential risk of mass casualties. The FBI, spearheading the investigation, successfully traced the suspects to a residence where a cache of firearms, illegal narcotics, and hoax weapons of mass destruction were uncovered, necessitating neighborhood evacuations. Both individuals were legally barred from possessing firearms due to their histories of illicit drug use, adding another layer to the serious charges they now face.</p>

          <p>California's Legislature has successfully passed Senate Bill 627, known as the "No Secret Police Act," which enacts a ban on most local and federal law enforcement officers from covering their faces during operations, including immigration enforcement. Introduced by Democratic state Senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin, the bill's primary objective is to enhance transparency and foster greater public trust, especially in light of intensified federal immigration operations. While specific exemptions exist for SWAT teams, approved undercover assignments, and medical or protective masks, the legislation broadly aims to prevent officers from evading discovery, recognition, or identification. Supporters additionally contend that the bill will help deter individuals from impersonating law enforcement officers. The measure now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature for final approval.</p>

          <p>The city of Long Beach has opted to cancel its annual Día de los Muertos parade, a significant public event, citing profound concerns raised by community members regarding potential federal immigration operations. Despite the absence of specific intelligence indicating federal enforcement activity targeting the parade, the decision was made "out of an abundance of caution" to safeguard attendees. This cancellation underscores widespread fears, which have been intensified by a recent Supreme Court ruling permitting immigration agents to detain individuals based on factors like job type, language, or appearance, thus fueling concerns about racial profiling. In response, the City Council has reallocated unspent parade funds to next year's budget and augmented the Long Beach Justice Fund with an additional $600,000 to provide legal representation for residents facing immigration actions.</p>

Hart, in collaboration with Tommy Boyce, played a pivotal role in defining The Monkees' distinctive sound, also composing their memorable theme song and contributing significantly to their million-selling debut album. Their successful songwriting partnership extended well beyond The Monkees, with their compositions being covered by a wide array of artists, from Dean Martin to the Sex Pistols.

          <p>Days after hundreds of South Korean workers were arrested at a Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery plant in Georgia, President Donald Trump publicly declared that foreign workers are "welcome" in the US and emphasized his desire not to "frighten off" investors. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump elaborated that foreign experts are temporarily necessary to impart knowledge and training to Americans in the production of highly complex products, such as chips, semiconductors, and ships. The mass arrests, which involved approximately 475 individuals suspected of visa overstays or engaging in unauthorized manual labor, generated significant alarm in South Korea. This prompted President Lee Jae Myung to warn that the raid could deter future investment, making Trump's subsequent statement appear as a calculated effort to de-escalate growing international tensions following the contentious operation.</p>

          <p>A growing number of drivers are "underwater" on their auto loans, owing more than their car's value, reaching a four-year high with 26.6% of trade-ins in Q2 2025 having negative equity. This trend forces consumers to either pay the balance in cash or roll it into a new loan, increasing overall debt. Factors contributing to this include longer loan terms, with 84-month loans becoming increasingly common, and smaller down payments. Experts advise maintaining current vehicles if possible, researching credit scores and pre-approvals for new loans, and considering Guaranteed Asset Protection (GAP) insurance to cover the difference if a vehicle is totaled.
