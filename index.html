          <p>China is reportedly advancing in the race to develop next-generation tanks, potentially outpacing the United States. Beijing's recent export controls on advanced lithium batteries, which are essential for new hybrid-electric powertrains, have created a significant supply chain challenge for the US Army's M1E3 Abrams tank upgrade program. The US aims for a lighter, more fuel-efficient tank, similar to China's new designs, but these restrictions could delay its development timeline, highlighting a new front in the technological competition between the two nations.</p>

          <p>American Airlines has appointed Nat Pieper, a seasoned executive with nearly three decades of experience at carriers like Delta and Alaska Airlines, as its new chief commercial officer. The move comes as the airline seeks to bolster its profitability, which has been trailing behind competitors. Pieper will oversee the carrier's commercial strategy, loyalty program, and network planning, taking over after the previous commercial chief was ousted following a backfired business-travel strategy. His appointment is aimed at steering the airline toward stronger financial performance and improved customer experience.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have arrested three men as part of an ongoing counter-terrorism investigation into alleged assistance provided to Russia's foreign intelligence service. The arrests, made under the National Security Act of 2023, come amid rising concerns over foreign states recruiting "proxies" to conduct criminal activities in the UK. This operation follows several other recent cases involving espionage and hostile state actions linked to Russia, as UK intelligence agencies like MI5 report a significant increase in investigations into state-sponsored threats from Russia, China, and Iran.</p>

          <h2>Essay Argues True Free Speech Requires a Foundation of Free Thought and Open Inquiry</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article posits that the contemporary debate over free speech often overlooks a crucial element: the freedom of the thought process behind the speech. Drawing on John Stuart Mill's "On Liberty," it argues that genuinely free speech is the result of conscientious learning, critical thinking, and a willingness to engage with opposing views, rather than just an unrestricted right to express preconceived notions. The essay warns that threats to free thought, such as the spread of misinformation, attacks on educational institutions, and media consolidation, are the primary dangers to a healthy public discourse.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new survey reveals that a majority of potential homebuyers are delaying their purchases because they expect mortgage rates to continue declining from their current levels. Despite rates hovering near a one-year low, real estate agents report that affordability remains the top concern for buyers, who are hesitant to enter the market until borrowing costs become more favorable. This sentiment has created a standoff, with many sellers still pricing their homes for a hotter market, leading buyers to wait for both prices and rates to drop further. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this opinion piece, a university professor and linguist argues that the rise of AI in education should be seen as an evolution rather than a crisis. The author contends that fears about students reading less or using AI to write essays are misplaced, as technology has always changed how people learn and consume information. Instead of assigning traditional essays that AI can now easily generate, educators should adapt by creating assignments that demand personal insight and critical thinking, thereby using AI as a tool to handle busywork and free up time for deeper engagement.</p>
