          <p>At least three individuals have died in North Dakota due to severe weather conditions that swept across the region on Friday night. The Cass County Sheriff's Office responded to a report of tornado damage in rural Enderlin, where storm chasers had already discovered two deceased people. A third deceased person was later found at another location, prompting ongoing search and rescue efforts by law enforcement and first responders to check on residents and assess the extent of the damage in the affected area. Sheriff Jahner of the Cass County Sheriffâ€™s Office held a press conference to discuss the latest details. The optimism score of this article is understandably low due to the tragic loss of life and widespread destruction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the use of sexual assault as a plot device in Celine Song's film 'Materialists,' drawing parallels to a similar storyline in Paul Verhoeven's 'Showgirls.' The author reflects on the film's narrative choice to have the protagonist, Lucy, find redemption through a client, Sophie, who has been sexually assaulted by someone Lucy set her up with. The author critiques the potential cynicism of using a character's trauma to facilitate the protagonist's emotional growth, especially in a film marketed as a rom-com. Despite these shortcomings, the author remains eager to see Song's future work, recognizing the director's potential for sharper filmmaking.</p>

          <p>Tulsi Gabbard now asserts that Iran could produce nuclear weapons "within weeks," a shift from her previous testimony before Congress where she stated Iran was not actively building them. This change follows Donald Trump's claim that Iran possesses a "tremendous amount of material" and could develop a nuclear weapon "within months." Gabbard shared a video of her earlier testimony, where she cited US intelligence agencies' conclusion that Iran was not building nuclear weapons, despite the nation's enriched uranium stockpile being at an all-time high. Gabbard emphasized that Trump has made it clear that Iran cannot develop nuclear weapons, and she agrees with that sentiment.</p>

          <p>Mark Zuckerberg is aggressively investing in artificial intelligence to position Meta at the forefront of the AI revolution. Following a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI, Meta plans to hire Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, former executives from GitHub and Safe Superintelligence, respectively. These moves are part of a broader effort to revamp Meta's AI organization, which faces competition from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. The company is embedding AI across its operations, from online advertising to the metaverse, and is aiming to improve its fundamental AI models, especially after the underwhelming reception of Llama 4.</p>

          <p>The article critiques Albaniaâ€™s Prime Minister Edi Rama, labeling him as the "Ramaduro" of Europe due to his alleged corruption and autocratic tendencies. Rama, once a disciple of George Soros, is accused of transforming into a political chameleon to align with global elites and regional strongmen. Critics point to his consolidation of power and advancement of the Soros-backed "Open Balkan" initiative, as well as his anti-Trump rhetoric. The article suggests that Europe increasingly tolerates leaders like Rama for professing allegiance to "European values," despite concerns over organized crime and electoral manipulation.</p>

The high-speed rail project aims to connect Ahmedabad and Mumbai, reducing travel time between the cities to approximately two hours. Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba are also expected to revise the 2008 Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation to expand their security partnership, particularly amid China's increasing maritime influence. The two leaders also intend to strengthen communication before a four-way summit with the United States and Australia under the Quad framework, which New Delhi is set to host in the fall.</p>

State media reports indicate that the Fujian has been undergoing sea trials since May of last year and is expected to join the Liaoning and Shandong to form a three-carrier fleet for the Chinese navy.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's podcast, "This is Gavin Newsom," has drawn attention for consistently featuring a single-use plastic water bottle, despite Newsom's administration working to scale back a landmark single-use plastic recycling law.

The presence of the plastic bottle has been likened to Newsom's previous controversy involving dining at the French Laundry restaurant during COVID-19 lockdowns.

          <p>Investigators are exploring potential motives behind the killing of a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband, as well as the shooting of another legislator and his wife, focusing on the suspect's religious background and views on abortion. The suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, possessed notebooks detailing numerous other presumed targets, including Democratic public officials and abortion rights supporters. Some scholars suggest examining Boelter's connection with the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR), a fast-growing strand of Evangelical Christianity that frequently uses war-like language when discussing political and spiritual adversaries. Boelter's past sermons and associations indicate a worldview shaped by strong religious beliefs and opposition to abortion.</p>

Israel has successfully intercepted most of the missiles and drones launched by Iran, but concerns are rising about the potential depletion of interceptors. Experts suggest that Israel may eventually need to prioritize defending key military and security targets over civilian infrastructure.

The goal is to shift the NHS from a reactive service to one that proactively identifies and addresses potential health issues.

          <p>Electricity prices are rising rapidly for U.S. households, outpacing overall inflation, due to a combination of increased demand and constraints on supply. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that retail electricity prices will continue to rise faster than inflation through 2026. Factors contributing to this surge include the growing demand from data centers, the electrification of various sectors, and infrastructure challenges related to transmission and distribution. The article notes that prices vary significantly by region, with some areas facing steeper increases than others. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen has called on the House of Lords to support a bill that would grant terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. This appeal comes after the bill was passed by MPs in the House of Commons. Critics, including Lord Shinkwin, express concerns that the bill could lead to vulnerable individuals being coerced into ending their lives. Rantzen, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, argues that the bill includes rigorous safeguards to protect against coercion.</p>

          <p>The People's Liberation Army's (PLA) maneuvers around Taiwan have become increasingly frequent and intense, evolving into a coordinated campaign for combat training and strategic signaling. These operations fall into three categories: near-daily aerial patrols, combat-readiness patrols, and large-scale joint forces exercises. Near-daily patrols have increased sharply since 2024, particularly after William Lai Ching-te assumed office. The article analyzes the types of signals each category of military action sends.</p>

          <p>Japan has been proactively building supply chain resilience, positioning itself to better withstand China's export restrictions on rare earth elements. Following a 2010 embargo by China, Japan has invested in non-China rare-earth projects, such as Australia's Lynas, and has reduced its reliance on Chinese rare earths to below 60%. Niron Magnetics CEO Jonathan Rowntree notes that Japan is more prepared this time due to stockpiling, investments in Lynas, and securing Western rare earth supplies. Western officials view Japan's supply chain transformation as a model, but also recognize the difficulty of escaping China's dominance.</p>

The author points to recent criticism of celebrities like Sabrina Carpenter, Sydney Sweeney, and Addison Rae, arguing that these critiques often lack historical context and economic awareness. The author urges a return to more nuanced and complex discussions of desire, domination, and the economic forces that shape women's images in popular culture. The author also suggests that policing feminine sexuality under the guise of concern for women's safety is a dangerous and historically ignorant approach.</p>
