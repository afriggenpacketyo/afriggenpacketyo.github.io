This new model is notable for being the brand's first hybrid vehicle in North America, featuring a 1.6-liter turbo-four engine that offers over 500 miles per tank. Positioned between the Compass and Grand Cherokee models, the company hopes this technologically updated SUV will reinvigorate the brand's performance in a highly competitive market segment.

          <p>A California parole board has denied parole for Erik Menendez, who has been imprisoned for over 30 years for the 1989 murders of his parents. The panel concluded that Menendez still poses an unreasonable risk to public safety, citing his prison conduct, which included violations like drug smuggling and misuse of computers, as a primary factor. Despite support for his release from family members and claims that the murders were in self-defense after years of abuse, the board was not swayed. Menendez will not be eligible for another parole hearing for three years.</p>

          <p>In a new memoir, "Semi-Well-Adjusted Despite Literally Everything," former child star Alyson Stoner reveals harrowing experiences from their time in Hollywood. The article details a foiled kidnapping plot, encounters with stalkers, and a sexual assault by a potential business partner, highlighting the severe lack of protection for young performers. Stoner also discusses the financial mismanagement by their team and family that left them with no savings after nearly two decades of work. Now an advocate, Stoner aims to shed light on the systemic issues facing child actors in the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>A new Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) rule mandating an email address to apply for federal aid has raised concerns among current and former officials. Critics argue the policy could create significant barriers for disaster victims, particularly the elderly, disabled, and those in areas with limited internet access. This change follows a broader federal move away from paper-based systems and coincides with FEMA reducing in-person services like door-to-door canvassing. Officials worry this will make it harder for the most vulnerable populations to access critical and timely financial assistance after a disaster.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece in The Guardian posits that the Trump administration has replaced adherence to the rule of law with a strategy of 'governing by shakedown.' The author argues that President Trump has repeatedly used threats of financial penalties, tariffs, and funding cuts to coerce institutions like universities, law firms, and foreign nations into compliance with his demands. Citing examples such as deals with Nvidia and pressure on Brazil's justice system, the article contends these actions often violate federal law and constitutional principles. The author criticizes Congress and the Supreme Court for their perceived passivity in challenging this approach.</p>

          <p>Agricultural machinery giant John Deere is experiencing a period of significant challenge, marked by softening demand from farmers, recent layoffs, and the financial impact of tariffs. The company's third-quarter earnings reflected a notable decrease in sales and income as farmers reduce spending due to lower crop prices and rising costs. Despite these headwinds, Deere has committed to a $20 billion investment in its U.S. manufacturing over the next decade, signaling confidence in its long-term future. Analysts suggest the agricultural sector is cyclical and that the company's cost-cutting measures are positioning it for an eventual rebound. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new 1 percent tax on cash remittances sent from the U.S., set to begin in 2026, is projected to drain billions of dollars from families in low- and middle-income countries.

Critics argue the tax will exacerbate poverty and instability, particularly as it coincides with major cuts to USAID funding.

The Home Office had warned that the ruling could significantly affect its ability to house asylum seekers nationwide.

This policy is part of a broader anti-immigration stance by the Trump administration, which also includes social media vetting for new applicants to identify anti-American sentiment.

The regime controls less than half the country and continues to battle widespread armed resistance.

          <p>A significant new study from GiveDirectly found that one-time cash grants of about $1,871 to thousands of households in rural Kenya led to a 48 percent reduction in infant and child mortality.

However, while the life-saving impact is substantial, the program's cost-effectiveness is debated, with a cost per life saved of nearly $300,000.

          <h2>Experts Debate Feasibility of a Knowledge Test for Accessing Private Investments</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. lawmakers are considering a proposal to allow more individuals to become 'accredited investors' by passing a knowledge test, granting them access to high-risk private market assets like venture capital and hedge funds. Currently, access is largely restricted by income and net worth thresholds. Experts say designing a fair and effective test is challenging, as it must gauge an investor's understanding of complex risks, including limited liquidity and subjective valuations. While the goal is to democratize investment opportunities, concerns remain about investor protection, especially when many struggle with basic financial literacy quizzes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke has lost his libel case against the publisher of The Guardian newspaper over a series of 2021 articles that contained allegations of sexual misconduct. A High Court judge dismissed the claim, ruling that the newspaper had successfully defended its reporting on the grounds of truth and public interest. The judge found Clarke was not a credible witness and determined that the meaning of the articles was 'substantially true.' Clarke expressed disappointment with the judgment, maintaining he is not the person described in the stories, while The Guardian's editor hailed the decision as a victory for the women who testified.</p>

          <p>A new species of herbivorous dinosaur, unearthed on the Isle of Wight, has been named Istiorachis macaruthurae in honor of record-breaking sailor Dame Ellen MacArthur. The name combines 'sail spine,' referring to the dinosaur's distinctive back structure, with a reference to MacArthur's surname. The 125-million-year-old fossil was initially discovered by a local fossil hunter and was recently identified as a new species by scientist Jeremy Lockwood. Dame Ellen MacArthur expressed her gratitude for the honor, noting the touching connection between the dinosaur's 'sail' and the sails that have defined much of her life.</p>

          <p>As measles cases rise across the U.S., public health experts are drawing lessons from the recently concluded outbreak in Texas. The experience highlighted the need for detailed local data on vaccination rates to identify at-risk communities and the importance of tailored outreach, such as smaller, neighborhood-level clinics, to address vaccine hesitancy. Health officials faced challenges, including a gag order on the CDC, and found that building trust through community-led education is crucial. Experts warn that without proactive, well-resourced public health strategies, the country remains vulnerable to further outbreaks, especially amid growing anti-vaccine sentiment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has unilaterally terminated union contracts for hundreds of thousands of federal workers at agencies like the Department of Veterans Affairs and the EPA, following a favorable court ruling. A March executive order seeks to eliminate collective bargaining rights for over a million federal employees, citing national security. Union leaders have denounced the move as an unprecedented attack on labor rights, warning that federal workers are a 'test bed' for a broader effort to weaken unions across both the public and private sectors. They are pursuing legal challenges and backing legislation to restore these protections.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador and later returned to the U.S. to face criminal charges, could be released from detention as early as Friday. A federal judge ordered his release two months ago while he awaits trial on charges of gang membership and smuggling, which he denies. His release was delayed over fears that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would immediately re-detain him. While a court order prevents his immediate detention in Tennessee, it remains unclear if ICE will take him into custody once he returns to his home state of Maryland.</p>
