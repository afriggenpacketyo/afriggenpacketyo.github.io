          <p>The Trump administration plans to revoke the legal status of over 500,000 migrants who entered the US under a Biden-era program, urging self-deportation.  This affects immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, who were granted parole under the CHNV initiative.  The administration argues the program was loosely vetted and undercut American workers.</p>
