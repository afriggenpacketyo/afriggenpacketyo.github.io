          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-02 00:01:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States' reliance on China for rare earth magnets is causing economic vulnerabilities as China limits the supply of these crucial materials. Over time, the U.S. allowed its rare earth metals industry to relocate to China and now faces potential economic disruptions. China's control over these resources could significantly impact various sectors in the U.S., including technology and manufacturing. This article highlights the strategic importance of rare earth elements and the risks associated with relying on a single foreign supplier, especially in a context of geopolitical tensions. The need for diversification and domestic production is underscored by this situation.</p>

          <p>Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and Brickworks announced a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger, leading to a surge in both companies' stock prices. The deal involves a new company acquiring all outstanding shares of Soul Patts and Brickworks, creating an entity with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. This merger unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership designed to prevent hostile takeovers, but critics argued it suppressed shareholder value and corporate transparency. The simplification of the structure and increased scale are expected to create a more investable company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mexico held its first judicial elections, becoming the only nation in the world to select judges and magistrates by popular vote. Supporters believe this is necessary to overhaul a judicial system known for corruption and inefficiency, while critics argue it will politicize the judiciary in a country plagued by crime and gang violence. Voters had to elect around 880 federal judges, including Supreme Court justices, as well as hundreds of local judges and magistrates. Turnout appeared to be low, with many voters struggling to choose from largely unknown candidates.

          <p>Immigration lawyer Álex Gálvez says that citizens born in the US or naturalized don't have to fear being questioned when returning from travel, but residents are exposed to the discretion of an officer when entering the country. If residents are outside of the US for more than six months, immigration officials may consider that they have abandoned their residence. If a resident has committed a crime, the official has the power to deny entry and put that person in deportation proceedings. The lawyer advises that if a permanent resident thinks they will be outside the US for more than six months, they should apply for a permit so authorities don't think they've abandoned their residence.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado anticipates increased internal repression from Nicolás Maduro's regime following the U.S. decision to restrict Chevron's operations in Venezuela. Machado, who is in hiding within Venezuela, described living in "total isolation" since Maduro allegedly rigged the presidential elections. The partial revocation of Chevron's license is a significant blow to Venezuela, which relies heavily on oil exports. Machado supports the U.S. decision, viewing it as a necessary step for a future democratic transition, but fears it will provoke further authoritarian measures.

          <p>A report warns that students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more to deliver courses, as institutions struggle to cut costs. Universities UK found reluctance to collaborate due to concerns about breaking business laws designed to promote competition. Greater collaboration could be a solution for institutions struggling to become more efficient. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it wanted to support collaboration where possible, recognizing the financial challenges facing universities.

          <p>The Shared Health Foundation is urging the government to put in measures to stop children in temporary accommodation going "missing" from schools and GPs after widespread displacement of families across the country. More than 164,000 homeless children are currently living in temporary accommodation across England, the highest number on record, figures show. The charity's new report calls for a notification system so that all authorities are aware when a child moves into temporary accommodation. The government says it is investing £1bn in homelessness services this year to help families trapped in temporary accommodation.</p>

          <p>South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa approved a law allowing the state to expropriate some privately owned land without compensation, drawing criticism from US President Donald Trump. The law aims to increase black ownership of land, but critics fear it threatens property rights. The law would only allow for land to be expropriated without compensation when an owner was not using the land and was holding it for "speculative purposes", or when an owner "abandoned the land by failing to exercise control over it despite being reasonably capable of doing so".
