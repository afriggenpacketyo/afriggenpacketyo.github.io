          <h2>Snap Stock Plummets After Company Fails to Provide Guidance</h2>

          <p>Snap's stock experienced a significant drop of 13% after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue but declined to provide guidance for the second quarter, citing macroeconomic uncertainties and potential impacts on advertising demand. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel noted headwinds at the start of the current quarter, leading to a cautious approach in balancing investment with revenue growth. Advertisers reported impacts from changes to the de minimis exemption, and Snap lowered its full-year adjusted operating expenses range. Despite the lack of guidance, Snap reported an increase in daily active users to 460 million and a rise in Snapchat+ subscribers to 15 million, but the uncertainty surrounding advertising demand has investors worried.

          <p>Small businesses, particularly in the food industry, are feeling the pinch from the Trump administration's tariffs on foreign imports, as rising costs for essential ingredients like cocoa and sugar are forcing them to make difficult decisions. Annie Park, co-owner of Sarah's Handmade Ice Cream, explains that she had to cut the orange chocolate flavor due to soaring cocoa prices and is considering further recipe adjustments to avoid raising prices for customers. The tariffs are also causing supply chain disruptions and increased costs for customized items sourced from China. Ji Hye Kim, chef and owner of Miss Kim, highlights the challenges of sourcing Korean pantry staples domestically, emphasizing the need for global supply chains to maintain quality and scale.</p>

Uzbekistan has also introduced new air defense systems of Chinese origin, enhancing its capabilities to intercept aerial threats.

Markle noted the revolutionary thinking of brands like It Cosmetics, which embraced real people as models, marking a shift towards more inclusive beauty standards.

          <p>Los Angeles County has approved a $4 billion payout to settle nearly 7,000 claims of sexual abuse that occurred in juvenile facilities since 1959, surpassing previous large settlements related to sexual abuse. The settlement addresses lawsuits filed by individuals who allege they were mistreated and sexually abused in foster care and juvenile detention facilities, with many claims involving the MacLaren childrenâ€™s center. The plaintiffs were able to sue due to a California law that temporarily suspended the statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse victims. County officials have apologized for the reprehensible acts and acknowledged the profound harm inflicted on thousands of children.</p>

          <p>Environmental policy experts are raising concerns about a series of policies enacted by President Trump during his second term that could harm the environment and hinder greenhouse gas reduction goals. These policies include declaring a national energy emergency, withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, and rolling back drilling restrictions on federal lands and waters. Experts also point to more subtle actions, such as the rollback of the social cost of carbon regulation, as having a significant corrosive effect on environmental protection efforts. The Trump administration has also dismissed authors of the Sixth National Climate Assessment report, signaling a broad effort to undermine climate science and environmental regulations.</p>

Despite a high DNA match, Roshchyna's father has requested further forensic analyses, as he does not believe the body is his daughter's. Roshchyna went missing in 2023 while investigating alleged torture prisons in Russian-occupied territories, and her death has prompted calls for increased international attention to the issue of civilian hostages held by Russia.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order softening some of the automotive tariffs put in place earlier this month, as the car industry faces regulatory uncertainty and additional costs. While tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles will continue, the new measures aim to reduce the overall tariff level on vehicle imports. Additional 25% tariffs on auto parts will still take effect, but vehicles undergoing final assembly in the U.S. may qualify for partial reimbursements on those levies for two years. The administration said it wants to help automakers during this transition, particularly if they face difficulties in sourcing parts.</p>

West Virginia's life expectancy for women born in 2000 increased by only one year compared to those born in 1900, whereas New York saw an increase of roughly two decades.

          <p>Amazon announced that it would not display tariff surcharge pricing on products after White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt criticized the idea as a hostile and political act. The decision followed a report that Amazon was considering showing consumers how much of an item's cost comes from tariffs, leading to concerns about the impact on American consumers. Some Amazon sellers have already raised prices on best-selling items to hedge against import costs stemming from Trump's tariffs. The move comes as Amazon's founder Jeff Bezos has been attempting to improve relations with the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, secured a victory in the federal election, marking a political turnaround largely attributed to the territorial threats and tariff policies of President Trump. The Liberals were projected to win more seats than the Conservatives, potentially forming a minority government. Carney emphasized the need for Canada to assert its sovereignty and build broader partnerships in response to Trump's actions. While domestic issues remained important, Trump's influence on the campaign and voters' choices was undeniable, marking a shift in Canadian politics.</p>

          <p>Factors that have caused gold's price to steadily rise are likely to remain strong this May. The price of gold has surged by more than 60% since the start of 2024, and experts predict that domestic economic concerns, interest rate policy and geopolitical tensions will keep the price elevated in May. Continued stock market volatility will likely cause more investors to turn to gold for safe-haven protection. With no interest rate changes expected in the immediate future, gold prices could easily tick up again in May. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump defended his controversial trade policies in an interview with ABC News, asserting that China will likely absorb the tariff costs and attempting to alleviate economic anxieties among Americans. Despite polling suggesting widespread concern over Trump's trade policies, the president claimed that he has delivered on his promise to lower prices since taking office. Trump dismissed concerns that tariffs will raise prices on goods, stating that China was previously ripping off the United States and is no longer doing so. Trump's perspective contrasts with economists' concerns that Americans will bear the burden of higher prices due to tariffs on Chinese goods.</p>

To improve your chances of reaching a favorable deal, go into the process prepared.

You should also be ready to explain your hardship clearly and honestly. Creditors are more likely to negotiate if they see that your situation is legitimate â€” for example, if you've lost your job, had unexpected medical expenses or gone through a divorce.
