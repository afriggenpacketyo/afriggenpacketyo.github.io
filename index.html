            <p>President Trump's new tariffs have come into force, including a 104% tariff on goods from China, escalating global trade war fears.

The White House claims the tariffs are designed to open negotiations with trading partners, but China has vowed to retaliate. The tariffs aim to revive American manufacturing, but critics warn of higher inflation and potential recession. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The price of gold has decreased due to the uncertainty surrounding the trade war between the United States and China, as traders sell off to cover losses in other asset classes. Despite the drop, analysts maintain that gold remains a safe-haven asset during times of market volatility. The spot price of gold had previously climbed 40% in a year before Trump's tariff announcement caused a decline. Analysts suggest the sell-off is a short-term reaction to the wider market downturn.

The Clippers are aiming to secure a top-six seed to avoid the NBA's play-in tournament. The team has won five straight games and 12 of their last 14, demonstrating improved play due to key players stepping up. Kawhi Leonard sat out the game for injury management, but is expected to play in the next game against the Houston Rockets.</p>

            <p>A BBC News survey indicates that over a third of secondary teachers have reported misogynistic behavior from pupils in the past week. Approximately 40% of teachers feel unprepared to address such conduct. Schools are increasingly concerned about children's exposure to misogynistic and violent content online. The government has issued guidance on extreme ideologies, but teachers are calling for broader guidance on misogyny in relationships, health, and sex education.</p>

            <p>The US and Iran remain far apart as they prepare for nuclear talks, with President Trump pushing for a deal within a couple of months. Trump has restored his "maximum pressure" policy on Iran and threatened military action if negotiations fail. Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons, but other countries fear its ambitions could spark an arms race in the Middle East. The US is hoping to combine economic pressure with diplomacy to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.</p>

            <p>Britain cannot rely on the US alliance under President Trump, as his policies prioritize his warped concept of reciprocity over shared goals and trust. Trump's tariffs will affect Britain, and the UK lacks the market power to retaliate effectively. The ingrained habit of seeing US politics as complex can lead people to project strategic cunning on to decisions when it isn’t supported by the evidence. Britain needs to find new allies who understand the meaning of the word, and cannot rely on the US alone.</p>

            <p>President Trump's new tariffs, initiated on April 2nd, are designed to stimulate the US economy and protect American jobs. The tariffs include a 10% baseline rate on almost all foreign imports, with additional reciprocal tariffs on roughly 60 countries deemed "worst offenders." China faces particularly high tariffs, with a total tariff of 104% on goods imported into the US. Canada and Mexico are exempt from the baseline rate, and the US will deal with them using a framework set out in previous executive orders.</p>
