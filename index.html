          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases in June but Remains Above Central Bank's Target</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 23:09:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food prices, cooled to 3.3% in June, aligning with market expectations and down from a 29-month high. This marks the 39th consecutive month that inflation has surpassed the Bank of Japan's 2% target, indicating persistent price pressures despite some relief from easing rice costs. Economists note that while the moderation is welcome, risks from a depreciating yen and potential U.S. tariffs could complicate the economic outlook. These factors, combined with upcoming elections and slowing GDP growth, create uncertainty for future monetary policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fox News host Jesse Watters admitted on-air that his program made a mistake in its reporting about a phone call between California Governor Gavin Newsom and President Trump. The admission follows a $787-million defamation lawsuit filed by Newsom, who alleged Watters' show falsely claimed he lied about the call's timing. Watters stated he misunderstood a social media post from the governor, leading to the erroneous report. While Watters used the words "I'm sorry," his statement was delivered with his typical snark, and it remains uncertain if this will satisfy the conditions for dropping the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Veteran MP Diane Abbott has been suspended from the Labour Party for a second time after stating in a BBC interview that she did not regret comments she made about racism in 2023. Her original remarks, which appeared to downplay antisemitism compared to racism against Black people, led to her first suspension. In the new interview, Abbott reiterated her view on the differences between types of racism, prompting the party to take action while an investigation is pending. Abbott claims the Labour leadership wants her out, while colleagues and critics express disappointment over her failure to retract her controversial stance.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing a legislative package to rescind approximately $9 billion in funding, primarily targeting foreign aid and public broadcasting, at President Trump's request. The process has been complicated by intense debate over the release of government files related to Jeffrey Epstein, with Democrats attempting to force a vote on the matter. Republicans have resisted these efforts, offering a non-binding resolution instead, which Democrats have criticized as a hollow gesture. The spending cuts, already passed by the Senate in a slightly smaller version, now face a final vote in the House under a tight deadline.</p>

          <p>President Trump has instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to request the unsealing of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein, a move that requires court approval. This directive comes after the Justice Department faced backlash from some of Trump's supporters for previously stating there was no client list and that Epstein's death was a suicide. The order aims to quell the controversy and increase transparency amid sustained public and political pressure. It is unclear which specific grand jury records are being targeted for release or how long the judicial process might take to unfold.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has acknowledged that European nations have historically underfunded their own defense, effectively "free-riding" on U.S. security guarantees. In an interview, Merz stated that Europe has heard the message from Washington and is now committed to increasing its defense spending and capabilities. This shift in stance is driven by the threat posed by Russia's war in Ukraine and a desire for greater strategic independence. Merz emphasized a strengthening triangular alliance between Germany, the UK, and France to bolster European security, foreign policy, and economic growth in this new geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to sue The Wall Street Journal and its parent company, News Corp, over an article detailing his alleged relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. The report claims that a 2003 birthday album for Epstein contained a bawdy letter from Trump, which included a sketch of a naked woman and a joke about keeping "secrets." Trump has vehemently denied the letter's authenticity, calling the story "false, malicious, and defamatory" on his social media platform. This legal threat comes as Trump faces pressure from his own base to release all government files related to the Epstein case.</p>

Visibly upset, he turned and scolded the crowd, saying the timing was very poor.

The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), which resembles the U.S. military's MQ-35 V-BAT, was recently tested in a mountainous region, showcasing its reconnaissance and situational awareness capabilities. Developed by a state-owned aerospace firm, the drone's design offers significant tactical flexibility, as it does not require a runway for deployment or retrieval. Its intelligent control system also demonstrated autonomous functions like route planning and threat avoidance, key for potential swarm operations.</p>

Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the move as a "heartless attack on the Central Valley" that jeopardizes jobs.

          <p>President Trump has intensified his long-standing criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, recently asking lawmakers about the possibility of firing him. The conflict stems from the Fed's decision to maintain relatively high interest rates to combat inflation, a policy Trump believes is stifling economic growth. The Federal Reserve operates independently to set monetary policy, and the legality of a president firing its chair for policy disagreements is untested. While Trump has called firing Powell "highly unlikely," his public attacks on the central bank and its leader represent an unusual break from presidential norms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An ice core believed to be over 1.5 million years old has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey, where scientists will melt it to study Earth's ancient climate. Drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, the core contains trapped air bubbles, dust, and volcanic ash that hold crucial information about a previously unknown period of the planet's history. Researchers hope the data can help them understand a mysterious shift in Earth's glacial cycles and provide insights into how our climate system responds to high concentrations of greenhouse gases. The findings could revolutionize our understanding of long-term climate change.</p>

          <p>Starting next July, shoppers in the United Kingdom using 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) services will be subject to stricter affordability checks under new regulations from the Financial Conduct Authority. The rules are designed to protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt by ensuring they can afford the repayments before credit is approved. This means some shoppers may be denied this form of credit. The move, which brings BNPL services more in line with other forms of lending, will also grant consumers rights to complain to the Financial Ombudsman and receive clearer information.

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common vein condition, following speculation over photographs showing swollen legs and bruised hands. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the diagnosis came after a comprehensive exam and described the condition as benign. The bruising was attributed to frequent handshaking combined with taking aspirin. A letter from the White House physician confirmed the diagnosis, noting the condition is common in people over 70 and reiterated that the president remains in "excellent health" with no signs of more serious illness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labour Party's decision to suspend Diane Abbott again was largely unavoidable if it wished to maintain a consistent and firm stance against antisemitism, according to this political analysis. Abbott's recent statement that she does not regret her 2023 comments, which led to her first suspension, left the party with little choice but to repeat its disciplinary action. For leader Keir Starmer, who has made eradicating antisemitism a core promise, failing to act would have undermined his leadership and the party's efforts to move past the controversies of the Corbyn era. Abbott's lack of remorse effectively forced the party's hand.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced that "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" will conclude its run in May 2026, marking the end of the network's long-running late-night franchise. The decision is described as purely financial, driven by the challenging advertising market and shifting viewer habits, rather than the show's content or ratings, where it has been a leader. Colbert, who has hosted since 2015, informed his audience of the news, which he had only learned of the previous night. The cancellation reflects broader industry pressures as younger audiences increasingly consume short-form content online instead of traditional television.</p>

          <p>Beef prices in the United States have reached record highs, with the average cost of ground beef and steaks rising significantly over the past year. This surge is driven by a decades-long decline in the U.S. cattle herd, which is now at its smallest size since 1951 due to factors like drought, high feed costs, and market incentives. The situation is further exacerbated by a halt on cattle imports from Mexico and the potential impact of widespread tariffs on imported beef. With strong consumer demand during grilling season, experts do not expect significant price relief soon. (not investment advice)</p>
