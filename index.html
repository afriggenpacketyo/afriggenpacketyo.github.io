          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has publicly supported Senator Rand Paul's criticism of the major spending bill recently passed by Congress. Paul argued the legislation dangerously inflates the national deficit, a sentiment Musk has echoed by previously labeling it the "DEBT SLAVERY bill." The independent Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill could add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, though the White House disputes this figure. The legislation includes significant tax cuts but also reduces funding for green energy initiatives, such as electric vehicle tax credits, which directly impacts Musk's business interests and has been a point of contention between him and President Trump.

          <p>An international security expert has proposed that the United States could revitalize its rust-belt cities by adopting China's "Wuhan model" of economic development. This model focuses on integrating university research with private industry in second-tier cities to foster advanced manufacturing clusters, similar to Wuhan's Optics Valley. The suggestion comes from Robert Pape, who recently visited major tech hubs in China, including Wuhan, Hangzhou, and Shenzhen. This idea is being discussed amidst a temporary de-escalation in the US-China trade war, highlighting a potential avenue for constructive bilateral cooperation and economic rejuvenation for struggling American industrial regions.</p>

          <p>A powerful storm with winds exceeding 60 mph caused significant devastation in central New Jersey, leading to at least three deaths. In Plainfield, a 79-year-old man and a 25-year-old man were killed when a tree crushed their vehicle, prompting the mayor to declare a state of emergency due to widespread damage. Consequently, the city canceled its Fourth of July parade, concert, and fireworks, stating it is a time for recovery rather than celebration. Governor Phil Murphy urged residents to remain indoors to avoid dangers from fallen trees and downed power lines throughout the affected region.</p>

          <p>The annual Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, a Fourth of July tradition, is taking place today in Coney Island. This year's event features the highly anticipated return of 16-time champion Joey Chestnut, who was banned from last year's competition over a sponsorship dispute. He aims to reclaim his title from Patrick Bertoletti, who won in his absence. On the women's side, reigning champion Miki Sudo is defending her title after setting a new world record last year. Competitors have ten minutes to consume as many hot dogs and buns as possible for a $20,000 prize and the coveted Mustard Yellow Belt.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated he was "very disappointed" following a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, reporting that he made no progress on resolving the war in Ukraine. The conversation occurred shortly after the White House announced a halt to some weapons shipments to Ukraine, citing concerns over depleting U.S. military stockpiles. Trump also spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, agreeing to explore options for strengthening Ukraine's air defense. Despite the lengthy call with Putin covering multiple topics, including Iran, Trump conveyed frustration with the lack of a breakthrough toward a ceasefire in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has confirmed that discussions are underway to form a new left-wing political party in the United Kingdom. The announcement follows former Labour MP Zarah Sultana's decision to leave the party to co-found the new alternative with him. Corbyn praised Sultana's move and stated the new party aims to provide hope and a real alternative to the current political system, which he claims has failed to deliver necessary change. While some on the left of the Labour party have praised the move, it remains unclear who else will join, though the core is expected to be an existing alliance of independent pro-Gaza MPs.</p>

Webb stated the move aims to protect young people from "potentially harmful ideologies." The action has drawn sharp criticism from opposition leaders, LGBTQ+ advocates, and community members, who argue it amounts to censorship and creates an unsafe environment for transgender youth, potentially harming their mental health.</p>

Bukele countered these allegations by posting photos and videos of Ábrego García in detention, questioning how he could look well if he had been starved and tortured.

The target was reportedly Hisham Ayman Mansour, a mid-ranking Hamas field commander, who was killed in the blast. The Israel Defense Forces stated the strike targeted "terrorists" and that the incident is under review, but the high number of civilian casualties has intensified concerns over the proportionality of Israel's military actions in Gaza.</p>

Authorities stated the former middleweight champion was detained near his home and will be deported to Mexico, where he faces separate organized crime charges. The arrest comes just days after his high-profile fight against Jake Paul. U.S. Homeland Security officials said that no one is above the law and that Chávez is being processed for expedited removal from the country, a move that comes amidst a broader crackdown on immigration.</p>

          <p>After a decade-long fight for justice, the government's former independent adviser on a sexual assault review, Emily Hunt, has seen her abuser imprisoned. Christopher Killick was sentenced to three years for harassing Ms. Hunt, having previously pleaded guilty to voyeurism for filming her while she was unconscious in 2015. Despite a restraining order, Killick repeatedly breached it by posting about Hunt online, leading to a suspended sentence and eventually his final imprisonment. Hunt, who waived her anonymity to pursue the case and was awarded an OBE for her campaigning, expressed immense relief that he was finally jailed.</p>

          <p>A newly discovered interstellar object, designated 3I/ATLAS, is currently being tracked by astronomers as it passes through our solar system. This is only the third such object ever detected, following ‘Oumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. The comet, estimated to be about 12.4 miles wide, poses no threat to Earth and will make its closest approach in October at a distance of about 240 million kilometers. Scientists are studying its trajectory and composition to learn more about its origins from another planetary system within our galaxy, providing a rare opportunity to analyze pristine material from beyond our solar system.</p>

          <p>A powerful explosion at a petrol station in Rome's Prenestino neighborhood has injured at least 29 people, including nine police officers. The incident began when a tanker truck hit a pipe, causing a gas leak and an initial, smaller blast that drew emergency services to the scene. A second, much larger explosion followed, creating a massive fireball that was reportedly heard across the city and caused extensive damage to nearby vehicles and buildings. Rome's mayor stated that the timely evacuation of a nearby sports center shortly after the first blast likely prevented a more severe tragedy, as dozens of children were expected there later.</p>

The majority of these deaths occurred at or near sites run by the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). While the UN could not definitively assign responsibility for all deaths, it stated it is clear the Israeli military has shelled and shot at Palestinians trying to access these points. The World Health Organization described Gaza's Nasser Hospital as a "massive trauma ward" overwhelmed with patients, many of them young boys with severe traumatic injuries.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposed budget, which includes a nearly 25% cut to NASA's funding, is being called an "extinction-level event" for planetary science. These cuts severely threaten the development of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), a next-generation telescope designed specifically to find signs of life on distant exoplanets. The plan slashes HWO's development funding by 80% and forces the cancellation of 19 active missions, including the Juno probe at Jupiter. Critics warn that ceding leadership in space science could mean another nation, such as China or the European Space Agency, will be the first to answer the profound question of whether we are alone in the universe.

          <p>A prominent Chinese academic has stated that for a potential summit between President Trump and Chinese leadership to be successful, the US must clearly affirm it does not support Taiwan's independence. Wu Xinbo, a dean at Fudan University, emphasized that this clarification is a crucial prerequisite for stabilizing relations. The statement comes after the US State Department recently removed language from its website explicitly stating it did not support Taiwanese independence. Beijing considers Taiwan a rogue province to be reunified by force if necessary, making the issue a highly sensitive and pivotal point in US-China diplomacy.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart disease has outlined five types of food he avoids feeding his own children to promote lifelong health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like hot dogs and deli meats because of sodium and nitrates. He also strongly advises against sugary cereals and drinks that cause blood sugar crashes, as well as deep-fried foods prepared in industrial oils. Instead, he recommends healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, lean proteins, and air-fried foods to build healthy habits from childhood.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When deciding whether to hire professional movers, financial experts suggest considering several key factors beyond the initial cost. Homeowners should assess if they own valuable or fragile items that would be expensive to replace if damaged during a do-it-yourself move. It's also important to calculate the value of time saved by outsourcing the labor, which could be used more productively. Experts also highlight the mental benefit, as reducing the stress of moving can protect one's peace of mind and job performance. Ultimately, the decision should not jeopardize long-term financial goals or lead to high-interest debt.</p>

          <p>Two new books are advocating for a philosophy that values the body for its functionality rather than just its appearance. Casey Johnston's "A Physical Education" explores how weight lifting can help people unlearn restrictive diet culture by focusing on building strength and capability. Similarly, a biography of fashion designer Claire McCardell highlights her revolutionary approach to creating comfortable, practical clothing with features like pockets, viewing women as "doers." Both works suggest a refreshing shift in perspective, encouraging individuals to embrace their bodies as working objects and prioritize function and comfort over conforming to narrow, often constricting, aesthetic standards.</p>

The proposed new organization would initially form a coalition of like-minded nations, potentially by partnering with the CPTPP trade bloc in Asia, to liberalize trade and establish fair competition rules. The goal is to create a framework that can address modern trade challenges like US protectionism and Chinese state subsidies, while encouraging reform within the existing WTO structure.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international study has identified six personality traits consistently associated with people perceived as "cool" across a dozen different countries. Researchers found that individuals considered cool tend to be more extroverted, hedonistic, powerful, adventurous, open, and autonomous compared to those simply seen as "good." The study distinguished coolness from moral goodness, noting that cool people often push boundaries and spark change, which isn't always aligned with traditional or conforming behavior. The findings suggest that these core attributes of coolness are fundamental and universally recognized, transcending cultural and geographic differences.</p>

Brothers Mohammed Fahir Amaaz and Muhammad Amaad are on trial for allegedly assaulting three police officers with a "high level of violence" in the terminal's car park area. Prosecutors claim the incident with police occurred after the officers responded to an earlier confrontation where Mohammed Fahir Amaaz headbutted and punched another man in the cafe. The defendants deny all allegations, claiming they were acting in self-defense, but the prosecution states that CCTV footage will clearly show the events as they unfolded.</p>
