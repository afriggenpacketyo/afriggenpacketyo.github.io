          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's forthcoming biography, "Mark Twain," details the author's 1882 journey back to the Mississippi River. The passage explores Twain's complex feelings of nostalgia and disappointment as he revisited the scenes of his youth, which he had immortalized in his writing. He found the river and its towns profoundly changed, yet the return to a steamboat's pilot house reconnected him with a cherished sense of freedom from his past, solidifying the river's importance as a touchstone in his life.</p>

          <p>Devastating flash floods in Texas's Hill Country have caused a mass casualty event, with at least 48 fatalities reported across several counties. A significant focus of the ongoing search and rescue operation is on Camp Mystic, a children's summer camp where more than two dozen campers remain missing. Officials describe an unprecedented surge in the Guadalupe River, which rose over 20 feet in under an hour, overwhelming communities and prompting a large-scale emergency response involving state and federal agencies.</p>

          <p>The Chinese Communist Party has introduced new regulations that appear to standardize the policy-making process for its top leadership bodies. According to state media, these organs are now directed to focus on major strategic planning and oversight rather than day-to-day governance. Analysts suggest this move could indicate that President Xi Jinping is beginning to delegate more authority to his deputies, potentially as part of a long-term succession plan, which would mark a shift in his centralized leadership style.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been arrested for a second time in connection with the murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, after her remains were discovered in 2023. A new grand jury indictment reveals that a combination of tranquilizer drugs, which Barry was known to use for hunting, was found in her bone marrow. The initial murder charges from 2021 were dropped, but this new evidence has led to his rearrest, with prosecutors highlighting that he was the only private citizen in the area with access to the specific drug compound.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly flash flood in Texas, a hydrology expert explains why the Hill Country region is one of the most dangerous places in the U.S. for such events. The area's steep hills, shallow soils, and the geological Balcones Escarpment cause rainwater to run off rapidly, quickly overwhelming creeks and rivers. This geography, combined with powerful downpours often originating from Gulf moisture, creates fast-moving surges of water that can be catastrophic, a risk that is potentially increasing as the climate warms.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has formed off the coast of South Carolina, prompting tropical storm warnings for coastal areas of both North and South Carolina. The National Hurricane Center forecasts the storm to make landfall early Sunday, bringing heavy rainfall, potential flash flooding, and gusty winds. As of Saturday evening, Chantal had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph and was moving north. The storm is expected to see some slight strengthening before reaching the coast, after which it is predicted to weaken rapidly.</p>

          <p>A timeline of events leading up to the deadly Texas floods reveals that state and federal agencies issued escalating warnings in the hours before the disaster. The Texas Division of Emergency Management activated resources on Wednesday, and the National Weather Service issued a flood watch on Thursday afternoon. In the early hours of Friday, these were upgraded to flood warnings and, ultimately, a rare flash flood emergency, but the Guadalupe River surged catastrophically before many residents and camps could evacuate, raising questions about the timing and effectiveness of the alerts.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid secured a 3-2 victory against Borussia Dortmund to advance to the Club World Cup semifinal, where they will face Paris Saint-Germain. Goals from academy products Gonzalo García and Fran García gave Madrid a comfortable lead for most of the match. However, a chaotic stoppage time saw a spectacular acrobatic goal from Kylian Mbappé and a late red card for defender Dean Huijsen, who will now miss the anticipated semifinal clash against his former club. The win marks a strong start for new manager Xabi Alonso.</p>

          <p>A former CDC official is warning that recent Trump administration cuts to public health and scientific research funding are threatening progress toward ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. Dr. John Brooks stated that while treatments for current patients remain available, the cuts have severely impacted vital prevention research, including work on a vaccine and a cure. He expressed concern that the reduction in federal investment in prevention activities could lead to a resurgence in new HIV infections, undermining the goal of eliminating the virus by 2030.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Mark Green of Tennessee has officially resigned from Congress, further shrinking the already slim GOP majority in the House of Representatives. With his departure, the Republican majority is now 219-212, giving Speaker Mike Johnson even less room for defections on key votes. Green, who chaired the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is returning to the private sector to start a business focused on helping the U.S. compete with China. His seat in the solidly Republican district will be filled in a future election.</p>

          <p>A recent executive order from President Donald Trump aims to curb the influence of Chinese companies in the global drone market, but analysts and industry insiders believe it will be difficult to dislodge their dominance. Chinese firms are world leaders in the industry, and with few non-Chinese alternatives, a ban could significantly raise costs for commercial users in the U.S. While the order reflects ongoing efforts by Washington to counter China's technological rise, China's established position in the supply chain presents a formidable challenge for U.S. policy.

          <p>The U.S. Social Security Administration is facing criticism for sending an email claiming that President Trump's new spending bill eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for most recipients. Critics, including former SSA officials, have labeled the statement as "blatant misinformation," clarifying that the bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary deduction that phases out for higher earners. They argue the politically-toned communication from a traditionally apolitical agency is unconscionable and misleads seniors about the bill's actual impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has made his first public appearance since the start of the recent 12-day conflict with Israel, according to Iranian state media. He was shown on state television attending a religious ceremony at a mosque in Tehran ahead of the Shia festival of Ashura. During the war, which saw Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and retaliatory attacks from Iran, Khamenei had only appeared in pre-recorded video messages. His return to the public eye comes as the country observes a traditional period of mourning.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that exposure to high heat and wildfire smoke during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester and preconception period, is linked to adverse birth outcomes. Researchers at the University of Southern California found these exposures were associated with babies being smaller in the womb and at birth. The effects were nearly doubled for mothers living in "climate-vulnerable" neighborhoods, which are often hotter and have less access to air conditioning and filtration. Health experts are calling for more attention to these climate-related risks for pregnant people.</p>

This announcement follows a public feud between Musk and President Donald Trump, primarily over a major spending bill, and Musk's recent statements calling for a new political party that "actually cares about the people."</p>
