          <p>United Airlines is cutting 35 daily flights from Newark Airport due to persistent equipment and staffing shortages, as announced by CEO Scott Kirby. The FAA attributes the problems to equipment issues, runway construction, and staffing shortages in Philadelphia's air traffic control center, which oversees Newark's airspace. Travelers are experiencing significant delays, with some flights delayed by over three hours. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to revamp the air traffic control system, but travelers at Newark Airport remain frustrated by the disruptions, with ripple effects impacting airports nationwide.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, announced his retirement, naming Greg Abel as his successor by the end of the year. Buffett, known as the 'Oracle of Omaha,' has transformed Berkshire Hathaway into a $1.16 trillion investment firm over six decades. He intends to remain involved and will not sell his Berkshire stock, which will eventually be donated to charity. Apple CEO Tim Cook praised Buffett's legacy, noting Abel's readiness. The announcement came as Buffett criticized President Trump's trade policies, urging for global trade rather than using trade as a weapon.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing eligible students to use taxpayer funds for private school tuition. Most students attending accredited private schools will receive $10,000 per year, while students with disabilities will receive up to $30,000, and home-schooled students will get $2,000 annually. Democrats argue the legislation will hurt public schools by siphoning funds to wealthier students already in private education. Attorney General Ken Paxton hailed the bill as a victory for parents, while opponents like State Senator Jolanda "Jo" Brown decried it as welfare for the wealthy at the expense of public-school children.</p>

Governor Katie Hobbs contacted federal officials, expressing opposition to inhumane immigration enforcement practices. Erika was transferred to Ice Enforcement and Removal Operations with a court date to appear before an immigration judge, and the child remains with the mother.</p>

          <p>A vote is underway to incorporate a new city on the southern tip of Texas, dominated by Elon Musk's SpaceX company, called Starbase. The proposed city, covering 1.6 sq miles, was sparsely populated before SpaceX began buying land in 2012, with most of the 283 eligible voters being SpaceX employees. The new municipality would have power over planning, taxation, and local issues, but some nearby residents oppose the measure, citing environmental concerns. If approved, a state bill could give Starbase control over access to a local highway, nearby Boca Chica Beach, and Boca Chica State Park during rocket launches.</p>

Supporters say it empowers parents, while opponents argue it drains money from public schools and benefits wealthier families. Texas now joins 15 other states with universal school choice programs.
