          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new stake in UnitedHealth, acquiring over 5 million shares valued at approximately $1.6 billion. This investment comes as a surprise, given the insurer's recent challenges, including a 50% stock decline in 2025 and a Justice Department investigation. The move, potentially orchestrated by Buffett's investment lieutenants, aligns with Berkshire's history of value investing in embattled companies. Following the disclosure, UnitedHealth's stock saw a significant 6% increase in extended trading, signaling renewed investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AI software company Palantir has experienced a remarkable 1,700% surge since its 2020 public debut, recently surpassing a $430 billion market valuation. A significant driver of this growth has been U.S. government contracts, particularly with the military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. Despite its massive valuation, Palantir's revenue is a fraction of its megacap tech peers, leading to a high forward price-to-earnings ratio of over 280. The stock's strength is also bolstered by strong retail investor interest, who poured $1.2 billion into the company last month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Costco has announced that it will not sell the abortion pill mifepristone, citing a lack of demand from its members and patients. The wholesale retailer stated that individuals typically receive the medication directly from their medical providers rather than seeking it at a pharmacy. This decision was praised by the Alliance Defending Freedom, an anti-abortion advocacy group, which had actively campaigned for Costco to refrain from dispensing the drug. The group framed the move as a sound business decision that avoids alienating its family-oriented customer base.</p>

          <p>One year after the World Health Organization declared mpox a global health emergency, experts are sounding the alarm over a lackluster international response. The virus has spread rapidly in Africa, with outbreaks in 24 countries, fueled by a new, more transmissible strain. Critics argue that despite pledges of over $1 billion, the response has been hampered by conflict in the outbreak's epicenter, cuts to foreign aid, and significant delays in vaccine distribution. This failure to contain mpox raises serious concerns about the world's preparedness for future public health crises.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama virtually met with Texas House Democrats who left the state to prevent a Republican-led effort to pass gerrymandered congressional maps. Obama praised their actions, framing their protest as a crucial part of a larger national struggle to protect fair elections. He commended the lawmakers for their dedication and for inspiring others to fight against partisan gerrymandering ahead of the midterm elections. The meeting underscores the high stakes involved in the ongoing redistricting battles across the country, particularly in key states like Texas.</p>

          <p>Shares of Tapestry, the parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, plummeted nearly 16% after it announced that tariffs will significantly impact its profitability. The company projects that higher duties will cost it $160 million in the upcoming fiscal year, leading to an earnings forecast below Wall Street expectations. This financial pressure comes despite strong sales trends, with the company highlighting the unexpected end of the 'de minimis' rule for duty-free imports as a major factor. Tapestry is now focusing on mitigating these costs by adjusting its global manufacturing and operational efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

This move is a direct response to Republican efforts in states like Texas to gerrymander maps in their favor, which Democrats argue is an attempt by President Trump to rig the 2026 midterm elections. The proposed "Election Rigging Response Act" would temporarily set aside the maps created by California's independent commission to create a new, more Democrat-favorable map.

          <p>China has made substantial early purchases of soybeans from Brazil for September and October, effectively squeezing U.S. exporters out of their traditional peak selling period. This strategic shift highlights China's increasing trade reliance on South America amid ongoing political and commercial tensions with the United States. By securing roughly half of its projected demand from Brazil, China has shortened the critical export window for American farmers. The move is expected to keep downward pressure on global soybean prices, which are already hovering near five-year lows.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith has issued a new order expanding the scope of cooperation between D.C. police and federal immigration authorities. The change allows local officers to share information about individuals not in police custody and to transport federal agents and detainees. This move represents a significant shift from the city's previous sanctuary policies, which limited such collaboration. The order comes shortly after the Trump administration placed the D.C. police under direct federal control, raising questions about the future of the city's sanctuary status.</p>

          <p>David Zervos, chief market strategist at Jefferies and a potential candidate for Federal Reserve chair, has advocated for aggressive interest rate cuts. He argues that despite recent inflation data, monetary policy remains restrictive and that a significant rate reduction could stimulate the labor market and create jobs. Zervos joins a growing list of potential Fed nominees who believe the central bank should act decisively to ease its policy. He also expressed that having more market-savvy individuals involved in monetary policy decisions would be a significant benefit for the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel's far-right Finance Minister, Bezalel Smotrich, has announced plans to build over 3,000 new homes in the controversial E1 settlement area of the occupied West Bank. He stated the project would effectively "bury the idea of a Palestinian state" by cutting off the West Bank from East Jerusalem. The plan, long frozen due to international opposition, has drawn immediate condemnation from the U.S., U.K., E.U., and the U.N. Critics, including the Israeli NGO Peace Now, argue the move deepens the annexation of the West Bank and undermines any possibility of a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>A growing body of research suggests a strong link between the consumption of ultra-processed foods and the rising incidence of colon cancer, especially in younger people. Scientists have found that tumors are fueled by inflammatory compounds common in such foods, while lacking the healing compounds found in healthy alternatives. Diets rich in leafy greens, fish, and avocados provide bioactive lipids that help resolve inflammation. This research could pave the way for new cancer treatment strategies that focus on diet and natural healing processes to supplement traditional therapies.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate has fallen to 6.58%, its lowest point since October 2024, providing some relief for potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance. While significant drops are not expected, further declines could be on the horizon. Key dates to watch in September include the release of the unemployment report on the 5th and the inflation report on the 11th, as these economic indicators will heavily influence the Federal Reserve's next move. The Fed's policy meeting concluding on September 17th will be the most critical event, with any decision on interest rates directly impacting the mortgage market.</p>

Additionally, there are concerns that inflation could reignite due to tariffs, potentially leading to market volatility.

U.S. importers have front-loaded their freight to avoid higher duties, causing inventory to build up in warehouses and distribution centers, known as "the middle mile." This has created a temporary buffer, but as this inventory moves to retail shelves in the coming months, consumers should expect to see higher prices on goods.
