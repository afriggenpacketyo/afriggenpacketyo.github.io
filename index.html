          <p>President Trump's depiction of Los Angeles as being "under siege" due to immigration protests is being challenged by local officials, including Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom.

However, Bass and Newsom argue that the city's police and sheriff's departments are capable of handling the unrest, accusing Trump of inflaming tensions. The protests, primarily concentrated in downtown Los Angeles, have led to clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement, but the situation is not indicative of widespread chaos throughout the city. </p>

          <p>Federal immigration raids in California, coupled with existing trade tariffs, threaten the state's economy, which relies heavily on immigrant labor and international trade. Industries such as construction, agriculture, and hospitality depend on immigrant workers, both legal and undocumented. The raids could lead to labor shortages, increased costs, and project delays, while the tariff-related decline in port activity has already reduced job opportunities. A decrease in immigration would result in average annual wages decreasing by $970, according to a paper in the American Economic Review (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Violent protests have erupted in Los Angeles following immigration raids, leading to dozens of arrests and the deployment of National Guard troops. Protests began after ICE officers carried out raids in areas with large Latino populations, leading to clashes between protesters and law enforcement. California Governor Gavin Newsom has sued the Trump administration over the deployment of the National Guard. While the demonstrations started out as peaceful, some self-driving vehicles were set on fire and a major highway was shut down by protesters. </p>
