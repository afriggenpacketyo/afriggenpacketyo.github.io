          <p>Late-night show 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' has been preempted indefinitely by its network, ABC, following controversial comments the host made about the recent murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The decision came after Nexstar Media, a major station owner, announced it would stop airing the program, calling Kimmel's remarks offensive and insensitive. In his monologue, Kimmel accused the "MAGA gang" of trying to score political points from the tragedy and mocked President Trump's reaction to the event.</p>

          <p>A new report from the California Budget and Policy Center reveals that California's poverty rate remains the highest in the nation, tied with Louisiana at 17.7%. This figure, representing about 7 million residents, has shown little improvement since surging after the expiration of pandemic-era aid programs. The report highlights that poverty is a "policy choice," noting that child poverty has more than doubled since 2021 and that people of color and renters are disproportionately affected.</p>

          <p>A TikTok-coined term, "boomer panic," describes instances where older adults exhibit outsized frustration over minor inconveniences, such as technology issues or customer service problems. While not a clinical diagnosis, experts suggest this perceived behavior may stem from factors like the stress of adapting to a rapidly changing world. Additionally, an upbringing that stigmatized mental health concerns and did not emphasize emotional regulation skills could contribute to these visible displays of frustration.</p>

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has officially stated that he believes Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people in Gaza, making him the first U.S. senator to use the term. Citing a UN commission's findings, high civilian casualty figures, and inflammatory statements by Israeli officials, Sanders called the conclusion "inescapable." He urged the United States to end its complicity by halting military aid to Israel's government and demanding an immediate ceasefire.</p>

          <p>In an email to staff, acting CDC Director Jim O'Neill stated that the agency had suffered from "mission creep" and lost the American public's trust, particularly during the pandemic.

The memo signals a significant philosophical shift, urging staff to treat citizens as "adults who can make their own informed decisions."</p>

          <p>In response to controversial changes at federal health agencies, the states of California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii have formed the "West Coast Health Alliance" to issue their own joint vaccine guidelines. This move aims to provide a science-based alternative to the guidance from the Trump administration's CDC and HHS, which critics fear is being influenced by political ideology.
