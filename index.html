          <p>A mass stabbing at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, has left at least eleven people injured, with some in critical condition. Authorities have apprehended a 42-year-old male suspect, describing the incident as a "random act" carried out with a folding knife. The local sheriff praised citizens who assisted in subduing the suspect and providing aid to the victims before emergency services arrived. Governor Gretchen Whitmer and federal authorities have acknowledged the incident, with the FBI offering support to the local investigation into this brutal act of violence.</p>

          <p>Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to ceasefire negotiations in Malaysia after four days of deadly border clashes that have killed at least 33 people. The agreement for talks followed a call from U.S. President Donald Trump to both nations' leaders, urging an immediate end to the fighting. While Cambodia readily accepted the ceasefire proposal, Thailand maintained that dialogue must precede a formal truce. The conflict, rooted in a century-old border dispute, escalated recently, and Trump has linked a peaceful resolution to future trade agreement discussions with both countries.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have initiated a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in military operations in parts of Gaza to allow for the entry of humanitarian aid. The pause, scheduled from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. in Al Mawasi, Deir al Balah, and Gaza City, is intended to create secure corridors for aid convoys from the UN and other international groups. This move comes amid severe international pressure and warnings of a worsening malnutrition crisis in the enclave. Hamas-run health officials stated the pause must be used to evacuate the wounded and deliver critical supplies.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to discuss the urgent need for a ceasefire in Gaza during his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland. The discussion comes as aid agencies warn of mass starvation in the territory and international pressure on Israel mounts. The British government has been working with Jordan on aid drops and is accelerating efforts to evacuate critically ill children. The meeting highlights the ongoing diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict and address the severe humanitarian crisis, which has resulted in at least 127 deaths from malnutrition according to the Hamas-run health ministry.</p>

He argues that, unlike modern non-stick pans, cast iron can last for generations and even provides an unexpected health benefit by enriching food with iron. Rollins also demystifies the cleaning process, stating it is simple with hot water right after cooking, making it an accessible and enduring kitchen essential.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee is using billboards in several Republican-leaning states to blame President Trump for the financial struggles and closures of rural hospitals. The campaign highlights the impact of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" (OBBBA), which cut over $1 trillion from Medicaid, a key funding source for these facilities. While Republicans included a $50 billion rural health fund in the bill, analyses suggest it will not cover the long-term losses. This political tactic aims to draw voter attention to the real-world consequences of these healthcare funding cuts in communities that largely support Trump.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Donald Trump's administration, characterized by cronyism and policies favoring insiders, has inadvertently fueled a revival of socialist ideas in the United States. The author contends that as market economics appears to serve a select few, and with the memory of historical socialist failures fading, a younger generation is increasingly open to alternatives. The piece suggests that to counter this trend, proponents of market economics must address the system's current failings and cleanse it of corruption.

          <p>Despite a year of significant policy shifts and events, President Donald Trump's approval and favorability ratings have remained remarkably stable, according to an analysis of AP-NORC polling data. His job approval has consistently hovered around 40%, a figure lower than his predecessors but supported by a steadfast base of loyal voters. This stability persists even as many of his policies, such as those on immigration and tariffs, face broad public disapproval. The polling data suggests that opinions on Trump, both for and against, are deeply entrenched, making them resistant to change from current events.</p>

          <p>The near-disappearance of comprehensive arts and entertainment event listings from publications like The New York Times and The Village Voice has fundamentally altered how people discover cultural events. This article explores how the shift away from curated listings toward algorithm-driven social media feeds has created a feedback loop that promotes already popular artists while leaving niche subcultures struggling for visibility. The author argues that this change not only makes it harder for audiences to find new experiences but also harms emerging artists who once relied on these platforms for exposure. The loss of these detailed records also poses a challenge for future historians studying local cultural scenes.</p>

          <p>The practice of tipping in the United States has deep historical roots tied to the post-Civil War era and the abolition of slavery. According to the Economic Policy Institute, the custom persisted in the U.S. as a way for employers, particularly in the service and domestic sectors, to avoid paying fair wages to formerly enslaved Black workers. This system was later formalized with the creation of a sub-minimum wage for tipped workers, which under federal law remains at $2.13 an hour today. This history reveals that tipping is not merely a reward for good service but a structural component of a two-tiered wage system.</p>

The 39-year-old actor, who has had a lifelong passion for motorsports, is committed to proving himself in the highly competitive racing world. Muniz emphasizes that this is not a hobby funded by his Hollywood earnings but a serious career pursuit, requiring immense time and effort to compete at a high level.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An organizer in Augusta, Georgia, is facing significant hurdles in her six-year effort to open a freestanding birth center in a region considered a maternal healthcare desert. Despite community support and successfully lobbying for a change in state law, the initiative is stalled by a lack of cooperation from local hospitals and obstetricians, who are needed for patient transfer agreements. The article explores the complex reasons for this resistance, including financial competition and high malpractice liability concerns for OB-GYNs. The story underscores the growing demand for alternative birthing options and the systemic challenges in expanding access, particularly for Black women who face higher maternal mortality rates.</p>

          <h2>Climate Change and Human Activity Are Increasing the Frequency of Sinkholes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 06:50:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sinkholes, depressions in the ground caused by water erosion, are becoming more frequent due to factors intensified by climate change. Extreme weather patterns, such as severe droughts followed by heavy rainfall, weaken the ground and make collapses more likely, especially in regions with soluble bedrock like limestone. Human activities, including excessive groundwater pumping for agriculture and urban development, further exacerbate the risk. Experts in places like Turkey's Konya Plain have documented a dramatic rise in sinkhole occurrences, linking them directly to falling water tables and climate-driven drought, posing a growing threat to populated areas.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides an overview of how sunscreens work and why their use is crucial for preventing skin cancer and damage from the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation. It explains the two main types of sunscreens: organic (often called chemical) sunscreens that absorb UV rays, and inorganic (or physical) ones that use minerals like zinc oxide to block them. While there are some concerns about certain chemicals being absorbed into the bloodstream, experts emphasize that the risk is low and the benefits of using sunscreen far outweigh potential harms. The piece also warns against ineffective do-it-yourself sunscreens and notes that future products may utilize protective compounds found in plants.</p>

          <p>Despite criticism from some prominent right-wing figures over the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, many of the former president's supporters in middle America remain unfazed. Interviews in states like Pennsylvania and South Carolina reveal that these voters are prioritizing issues like the economy, border security, and cultural grievances over the Epstein matter. Many express deep loyalty to Trump, dismissing the controversy as a politically motivated distraction by Democrats and the media. This sentiment highlights a divide within the Republican base and shows the resilience of Trump's support among his core constituents.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the scientific community must abandon the myth of pure objectivity and honestly reckon with its inherent political nature. The authors use historical and contemporary examples, from 19th-century race science to modern studies of animal behavior, to show how dominant cultural values like patriarchy and capitalism have always shaped scientific inquiry. They contend that denying this entanglement leaves science vulnerable to political attacks and allows it to perpetuate harm against marginalized groups. The authors call for scientists to embrace political analysis as part of their work, which they believe will lead to more rigorous and resilient science.</p>

          <p>President Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown, including a ban on asylum, mass deportations, and border militarization, is profoundly transforming the U.S.-Mexico border region. Border crossings have plummeted to their lowest levels in decades, leaving migrant shelters in Mexican cities like Ciudad Juárez nearly empty. The policies have also spurred "self-deportations," with some migrants in the U.S. choosing to return to Mexico out of fear. This transformation extends to the local economy, where uncertainty over tariffs has led to factory layoffs in Juárez, compounding the challenges for both migrants and local workers.</p>

          <p>In this column, two writers debate Governor Gavin Newsom's threat to gerrymander California's congressional districts in retaliation for a similar Republican effort in Texas. One columnist argues against the move, warning that such a "fight-fire-with-fire" approach undermines the will of California voters who established an independent commission and could lead to unintended negative consequences for Democrats nationwide. The other columnist contends that in the face of a potential authoritarian threat, abandoning the high ground and using gerrymandering as a form of "peaceful resistance" may be a necessary, if drastic, measure to protect democracy by ensuring a check on power in Congress.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece draws a direct line from the historical racist trope of using Black babies as "alligator bait" to the modern-day moniker "Alligator Alcatraz" for an immigrant detention center in Florida. The author argues that both terms serve to dehumanize their targets, mock their suffering, and manufacture consent for cruelty by framing it as a joke or a necessary security measure. The article contends that this rebranding of old bigotry for a new target is a deliberate strategy to galvanize a political base and strip vulnerable people of their humanity.

          <p>A travelogue recounts a frustrating summer trip from Berlin to the North Sea island of Föhr, plagued by the notorious unreliability of Germany's national railway, Deutsche Bahn. The journey involved unexpected train changes, unexplained delays, and a complete service termination in Hamburg due to staff exceeding their work hours. The author notes that such issues stem from decades of underinvestment in the country's rail infrastructure, leading to dilapidated tracks and staff shortages. The experience reflects a broader problem with German infrastructure, turning what should have been a relaxing, eco-friendly trip into a stressful adventure.</p>

          <p>This article explores the reasons behind the underrepresentation of Eastern European teams in top-tier women's football, with Poland being the sole qualifier from the region for Euro 2025. Experts suggest a combination of historical, cultural, and economic factors are at play. The legacy of post-communist economic struggles limited investment, while persistent paternalistic cultural norms have discouraged female participation in the sport. Although UEFA initiatives and increased funding are beginning to show positive results, the region still lags behind Western Europe in infrastructure, professionalization, and societal acceptance of women's football.</p>

Gazans express a desperate need for a permanent solution and an end to the war, not just temporary measures. The crisis is particularly acute for those with specific dietary needs, like celiac disease, who cannot consume the wheat-based products that constitute the bulk of available food.</p>
