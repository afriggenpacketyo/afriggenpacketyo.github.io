          <p>President Trump commuted the federal prison sentence of Larry Hoover, the founder of the Gangster Disciples, who was serving six life sentences for conspiracy, extortion, and drug charges. Hoover, now 74, built the Gangster Disciples into a nationwide street gang and was convicted in 1973 for ordering the execution of a rival drug dealer, allegedly continuing to lead the gang from prison. While Hoover claims to have disavowed gang life and advocated for criminal justice reform, authorities allege he remained involved in promoting Gangster Disciples members even while incarcerated. His lawyer expressed hope that Illinois would also release him from his state-level murder sentence.</p>

The article argues that the bionic structure of humanoid robots allows them to navigate challenging terrains such as ruins and staircases, implying their potential use in combat scenarios.

          <p>A massive landslide caused by a glacier collapse buried a Swiss village in ice, mud, and rock, leaving a 64-year-old man missing and presumed dead. Authorities had evacuated Blatten earlier in the month due to concerns about the unstable glacier, but the landslide destroyed 90% of the village, according to a local official. Swiss glaciologists have expressed concerns about accelerated glacier retreat due to global warming, with Switzerland losing 4% of its glacier volume in 2023 alone. The regional government noted that the landslide also blocked the Lonza River, raising concerns about potential flooding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board argues that while President Trump's approach to the war in Ukraine has been disorganized, he is correct in recognizing the tragedy and the potential for economic development if the conflict ends. The board suggests that Trump should increase pressure on both Russia and Ukraine to reach a deal, rather than withdrawing from cease-fire talks. A potential agreement could involve Russia retaining control of territory in eastern and southern Ukraine, while Ukraine receives security guarantees and closer integration with the European economy. The editorial emphasizes that such a settlement would not be a complete victory, but would prevent Russia from achieving its initial goals.</p>

          <p>Ibram X. Kendi argues that the Trump administration is systematically attacking Black history by purging content, removing books, eliminating observances, and defunding institutions. Kendi draws a parallel to the Atlanta Race Massacre of 1906, where false accusations led to violence against Black Atlantans, highlighting the role of misinformation and suppression of Black voices. He cites the example of J. Max Barber, editor of *The Voice of the Negro*, who challenged the lies surrounding the massacre and faced threats for his efforts to document Black life accurately. Kendi contends that these actions undermine the opportunity for Americans to understand the history of racial inequity and the contributions of Black Americans to society.</p>

          <p>Hungary, under Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, has transitioned from a robust democracy to what some call an electoral autocracy, inspiring many U.S. conservatives. Orbán's government has been criticized for remaking the courts, financially starving independent press, and stifling civil society. Despite these concerns, Orbán's unapologetic style has resonated with American conservatives, influencing their approach to issues like immigration and minority rights. The Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) has convened in Budapest for four consecutive years, symbolizing this cross-cultural cooperation and admiration.</p>

          <p>Experts are worried about the safety of the U.S. food supply due to significant cuts by the Trump administration to federal agencies responsible for monitoring it. These cuts, affecting the FDA, USDA, and CDC, have led to staff shortages and policy rollbacks, potentially increasing the risk of foodborne illness outbreaks. Concerns are raised about the ability of inspectors to adequately oversee food production and the potential for delayed warnings to the public in case of contamination.

While the White House appealed the ruling, investors seemed encouraged by the prospect of reduced trade tensions, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index and South Korea's Kospi surging.

          <p>China is intensifying its efforts to bolster advanced manufacturing, potentially setting it on a collision course with the Trump administration's trade objectives. President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed the importance of self-reliance in advanced manufacturing, a strategy that has been criticized by the U.S. for exacerbating global trade imbalances. While China aims to reduce its dependence on foreign technology, particularly in high-tech sectors, this ambition clashes with Trump's demands for China to address trade imbalances and reduce state subsidies to domestic companies. Experts suggest there is limited room for China to compromise on this manufacturing-led strategy.</p>

          <p>Complaints about substandard living conditions in social housing in England have increased more than fivefold in the past five years, according to the Housing Ombudsman. The watchdog warns of "simmering anger" due to an imbalance of power between tenants and landlords, leading to a breakdown in trust. Issues such as asbestos, electrical and fire safety concerns, pest control, and dampness contribute to the growing frustration. The Housing Ombudsman calls for a transformative overhaul of the system, including an independent review of funding practices and a national tenant body to strengthen tenant voice and landlord accountability.</p>

The move has been criticized by Beijing, with a foreign ministry spokeswoman stating that the U.S. is unreasonably canceling visas under the pretext of ideology and national rights.
