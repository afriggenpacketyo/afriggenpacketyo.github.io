        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has invoked the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act to scrutinize wind energy projects, citing concerns over bird fatalities. However, this move is viewed by critics as a pretext to undermine renewable energy, a sector the former president has frequently opposed. The article points out that while wind turbines do pose a threat to birds, other factors like cats, buildings, and climate change are far more significant threats to avian populations. Furthermore, the bald eagle population has recovered robustly and is no longer considered endangered, contrasting with other species losing protections under the same administration.</p>

          <p>After a two-week standoff, a sufficient number of Texas House Democrats have returned to Austin, allowing the legislature to achieve a quorum. Their return paves the way for Republicans to advance a contentious redistricting bill that could create several new GOP-favorable congressional seats. While civil arrest warrants for the absent members remain active, Democratic leaders stated their return allows them to build a legal case against what they call a discriminatory map. The political battle is now expected to shift from the legislative floor to the courts.</p>

          <p>During a meeting at the White House, President Trump appeared to reverse his earlier stance on demanding a ceasefire in Ukraine, suggesting a peace deal could be brokered while fighting continues. The discussion with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was described as more amicable than their previous encounter, focusing on potential peace terms and security guarantees. Trump hinted at the possibility of a trilateral meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to help end the conflict. The shift in the U.S. position has raised concerns in Kyiv and European capitals about the nature of any potential peace agreement.</p>

Terms such as "skibidi," "delulu" (short for delusional), and "tradwife" are among the new entries, reflecting the evolving nature of the English language. Lexicographers noted that they only add words they believe will have lasting power and significance. The inclusion of these words highlights how online discourse and celebrity culture are increasingly shaping mainstream vocabulary and communication.</p>

          <p>While Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was meeting with President Trump in Washington D.C., Russian forces launched deadly drone strikes on the city of Kharkiv, killing at least seven people, including children. Ukrainian officials condemned the attacks as a deliberate message from Russian President Vladimir Putin, indicating no genuine interest in ending the war. The timing of the assault underscores the brutal reality on the ground in Ukraine, which continues even as high-level diplomatic talks are underway. The attacks targeted residential areas in the early morning hours.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from Bankrate reveals that, on average, American wages have lagged behind inflation by 1.2 percentage points since the pandemic began, diminishing the purchasing power of typical workers. The study highlights that some professions, particularly in education, have fallen further behind than others, while jobs in leisure and hospitality have seen wage growth outpace inflation. This persistent gap helps explain ongoing public dissatisfaction with the economy, as many households continue to feel financial strain despite a seemingly strong labor market.

          <p>A legislative effort is underway to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Ed Dwight, who was selected by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 as the nation's first Black astronaut candidate. Though he faced prejudice and ultimately resigned from the program, Dwight went on to a successful career as an entrepreneur and a renowned sculptor dedicated to Black history. At age 90, he recently became the oldest person to travel to space aboard a Blue Origin flight, finally fulfilling his astronautical journey. The proposed honor recognizes his trailblazing role in aviation and his significant contributions to art.</p>

          <p>The union representing over 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants has stated it will defy an "unlawful" back-to-work order from the Canada Industrial Relations Board, continuing a strike that has grounded hundreds of flights. The job action, now in its third day, has disrupted travel for tens of thousands of passengers. Union leaders expressed willingness to face penalties, including fines or jail time, insisting that a negotiated settlement is the only acceptable resolution. The flight attendants are demanding higher wages and compensation for time spent on the ground before and after flights.</p>

          <p>New research published in JAMA Network Open reveals that the availability of over-the-counter birth control pills is successfully reaching its target demographic. The study found that nearly a third of people who obtained the pill without a prescription had previously been using no method of contraception at all. An even larger portion, 41%, switched from less effective methods like condoms. These findings suggest that removing the prescription barrier is a powerful tool for improving reproductive autonomy and access to care, particularly for younger, uninsured, and rural individuals who face the greatest obstacles.</p>

          <p>The era of the "Great Resignation" appears to be over, replaced by a new trend consultants are calling "job hugging," where workers are clinging to their current roles. The U.S. quits rate has fallen to its lowest consistent level since 2016, reflecting decreased worker confidence in the labor market. This shift is attributed to a cooling job market, slower hiring rates, and broader economic uncertainty. While staying in a job provides stability, experts warn that this stagnation could lead to slower wage growth for individuals and make it harder for new entrants to find employment.</p>

          <p>An investment advice column highlights the power of dividend reinvestment plans, or DRIPs, as a simple yet effective strategy for wealth accumulation. By automatically using stock dividends to purchase more shares of the same stock, investors can harness the power of compound interest over the long term. The article uses the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) as an example, showing its total return was significantly higher with dividends reinvested compared to its price return alone over a decade. While not suitable for those needing dividend income for expenses, DRIPs offer a passive way to ensure investment returns are continuously working to generate further growth.

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire proposal presented by mediators from Egypt and Qatar. The framework reportedly involves an initial 60-day truce during which about half of the remaining Israeli hostages would be released, followed by negotiations for a permanent end to the conflict. Israel's response remains uncertain, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently stated he would only accept a deal that releases all hostages at once. The development comes amid intense Israeli military pressure on Gaza and large-scale protests in Israel demanding a deal to bring the hostages home.</p>

Her comments have drawn sharp criticism from Jewish groups, who support the IHRA definition as the accepted standard. The remarks highlight the persistent and divisive debates surrounding antisemitism and criticism of Israel within left-wing UK politics.</p>
