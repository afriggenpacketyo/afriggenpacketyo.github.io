          <p>Nearly 50 years after the sexual assault and murder of Jeannette Ralston in San Jose, California, authorities have arrested Willie Eugene Sims, 69, in Jefferson, Ohio. Ralston, a young mother, was found strangled in her car in 1977, and the case went cold due to a lack of leads. The break came when an upgraded F.B.I. fingerprint search algorithm matched Sims' thumbprint on a cigarette carton found at the crime scene. Sims, an Army private stationed nearby in 1977, had a prior conviction for assault to commit murder, and DNA evidence from Ralston's fingernails and the murder weapon further linked him to the crime. Ralston's son expressed gratitude for the renewed investigation that finally brought closure.</p>

          <p>Fulham Football Club has opened its new Riverside Stand, featuring high-end hospitality including Michelin star menus and a rooftop swimming pool, though the pool does not offer views of the pitch. The design of the stand, by architect Phillip Johnson, focuses on the River Thames rather than the field, drawing inspiration from rowing and boat houses. Fulham aims to create a private members' club on non-matchdays, appealing to wealthy locals. Chief executive Alistair Mackintosh emphasizes the club's commitment to sustainability and remaining at Craven Cottage, noting owner Shahid Khan's amplified vision for the project.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva to discuss trade, amid escalating tariffs that have disrupted global trade. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng led the talks, aimed at de-escalating tensions but expectations for a major breakthrough remain low. The Trump administration has accused China of unfair trade practices and fentanyl precursor exports, while China insists it won't concede under tariff pressure. Economists fear a prolonged trade war could slow global growth and raise consumer prices, though both sides have signaled a willingness to negotiate.</p>

          <p>China's strategic export controls on rare earth elements, critical for manufacturing military and space technology, are causing anxiety in the U.S. defense industry. These restrictions, implemented in response to increased U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, affect seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths. China, the world's largest producer of these elements, accounts for 90% of the global supply. The U.S. defense sector relies on rare earths for essential components in jet engines, radar, avionics, and electronic systems, raising concerns about potential disruptions to weapons production.</p>

          <p>The family of a 2-year-old U.S. citizen, "V.M.L," who was deported to Honduras with her undocumented mother and sister, has voluntarily dismissed its lawsuit against the Trump administration. The family's attorney cited the traumatizing experiences as the reason for needing time to consider all options. Despite a federal judge's suspicion that the deportation occurred without due process, the Department of Justice argued it was in the child's best interest to remain with her mother. The ACLU accused DHS of falsely claiming it deported a U.S. citizen, but the DHS stated the mother chose to bring her child with her.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's crypto agenda faces obstacles as lawmakers reject the GENIUS Act due to concerns about his personal cryptocurrency ventures creating conflicts of interest. The president's meme coin, $TRUMP, and his family's crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, raise concerns about influence and financial gain. Democrats have proposed the 'End Crypto Corruption Act' to prohibit officials from endorsing digital assets. Some in the crypto industry worry that Trump's pursuit of personal profits is hindering progress in the sector.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may face the "Too Late" label as he navigates volatile economic conditions and pressure from President Trump to cut rates. Economists note the Fed's historical tendency to act slowly, often resulting in delayed responses to economic shifts. With threats to both growth and inflation from Trump's tariffs, Powell's cautious approach is seen as potentially leading to a missed opportunity to adjust monetary policy proactively. Some analysts argue that waiting for labor market confirmation will inevitably be too late.</p>
