          <p>Ten inmates escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans, prompting a large-scale search operation involving local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. The inmates, some of whom face murder charges, are believed to have escaped through a compromised cell door and a hole in the wall, with taunting messages left behind. Authorities suspect that the escape was facilitated by assistance from within the jail system, leading to an internal investigation and the placement of three employees on administrative leave. The incident has highlighted the urgent need for repairs and increased staffing at the jail, with the sheriff's office requesting additional funding for security improvements.</p>

          <p>Leaked audio from a 2023 interview between then-President Joe Biden and Special Counsel Robert Hur has surfaced, revealing significant memory lapses and cognitive challenges. The audio recordings depict Biden struggling to recall key dates, including the year his son Beau died and the year Donald Trump was elected president. Conservative commentators and political figures have reacted strongly to the audio, calling for further scrutiny toward Democrats and highlighting the national security implications. The emergence of the recording comes as Democrats are grappling with new revelations about Mr. Biden’s health while in office, and efforts at that time by his aides and other party leaders to quash concerns about his ability to run for re-election.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, causing near-zero visibility and halting flights at Midway International Airport. The National Weather Service issued a dust storm warning, only the second time their Chicago office has done so, and the first time such a warning included the city itself. The storm was caused by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, collecting dust into the air, and pushing it through the Chicago area. While skies cleared up within 30 to 45 minutes, the event left residents in awe, describing it as something out of the history books.</p>

          <p>Audio snippets from a 2023 interview between President Joe Biden and Special Counsel Robert Hur have emerged, revealing Biden's difficulty remembering key dates and details. The audio, obtained by Axios, confirms Biden's halting tone and memory lapses, particularly when discussing the period around his son Beau's death. The release of the audio has reignited concerns about Biden's age and fitness for office, with Republicans pushing for the full audio to be released. A key part of Hur's report was that Biden sounded like a "sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory."</p>

          <p>Proposed cuts to Medicaid, a joint federal and state health insurance program for disabled and low-income Americans, have sparked fears among those who rely on it for healthcare. An analysis estimates that the cuts could increase the number of uninsured Americans by at least 8.6 million by 2034. While some Republicans insist the cuts will only eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse, many Americans worry about reduced access to care and having to choose between healthcare and necessities. The proposed bill would also impose work requirements on able-bodied Medicaid recipients, potentially jeopardizing care for those in recovery from substance use disorder.</p>

          <p>Cassie Ventura concluded her four days of testimony in the criminal trial of Sean Combs, detailing a decade-long relationship marked by violence, drug use, and power imbalances. Ventura, who filed the first prominent civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, alleged physical assault, sexual assault, trafficking, and coercion into drug-fueled sexual performances. She stated that Combs filmed these encounters and blackmailed her with them when she tried to move on from their relationship. The prosecution presented evidence, including items found in Combs' hotel room, that matched Ventura's testimony about the supplies used for these encounters.</p>

Now, Democrats are trying to grapple with the disastrous missteps that paved the way for Trump’s return.
