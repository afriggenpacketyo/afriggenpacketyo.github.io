        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares in Japan's SoftBank Group surged by 13% to a new record after the company reported fiscal first-quarter profits that significantly exceeded analyst expectations. The strong performance marks the firm's second consecutive profitable quarter, driven by a $4.8 billion gain in the value of its Vision Funds, the largest since 2021. This growth was attributed to successful investments in both private and publicly listed companies, including Grab Holdings and Swiggy. The positive results are further bolstered by the anticipated public offerings of several portfolio companies, such as Lenskart and PayPay, signaling continued momentum for the investment giant.</p>

          <p>Israel's security cabinet has officially approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal to occupy Gaza City, signaling a significant expansion of its military operations. The plan outlines five principles for ending the war, including the disarming of Hamas, the return of all hostages, and establishing Israeli security control over the territory. This decision has drawn immediate condemnation from Hamas, which accused Netanyahu of sabotaging ceasefire negotiations for personal political interests. The move also prompted pleas from hostage families, who fear the expanded conflict will directly endanger their captive loved ones.</p>

          <p>A violent incident in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, left a woman and the suspected gunman dead, while two state troopers sustained serious injuries. Police officials described the event as an ambush, where a 61-year-old man first shot and killed his 57-year-old female neighbor. When troopers arrived at the scene, the suspect opened fire with a rifle, wounding both officers before he was ultimately shot and killed by a specialized police team. The injured troopers are reported to be in stable condition, with one being praised for his heroic actions in providing aid to his partner despite his own injuries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has increased the financial reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to $50 million. This move escalates pressure on Maduro, whom the U.S. indicted in 2020 on charges of narco-terrorism and conspiracy, alleging he works with cartels to traffic drugs. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that Maduro would be held accountable for his crimes and noted that over $700 million in assets linked to him have already been seized. In response, Venezuela's foreign minister dismissed the increased bounty as a desperate and propagandistic political maneuver by the United States.</p>

This initiative is part of the 'Making DC Safe and Beautiful Task Force' established by an executive order earlier in the year.

Chief Executive Andrew Rees noted that some customers are no longer even visiting their stores, indicating a concerning trend for the second half of the year. The firm also cited potential negative impacts from high living costs and the administration's trade policies on its financial performance.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has issued another nationwide preliminary injunction, marking the fourth time a court has blocked the Trump administration's order to end birthright citizenship. The ruling prevents the government from denying citizenship to children born in the U.S. to parents who are in the country illegally or on temporary visas. The judge certified a class action, a legal path left open after a recent Supreme Court decision limited the scope of such injunctions. The core of the legal challenge argues that the president's order violates the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to nearly all individuals born on U.S. soil.</p>

The Secret Service confirmed it made the decision independently during standard planning, citing operational necessity after a public safety boat allegedly ran aground during a scouting mission.

          <p>New research published in Science Advances quantifies a trend long suspected by Californians: the state's fire season is beginning significantly earlier than it did decades ago. The study found that, due to human-caused climate change, fire season now starts an average of 24 to 46 days earlier across different regions compared to the 1990s. Researchers identified earlier snowmelt and increased drying of vegetation from rising temperatures as the primary drivers of this shift. This extension of the fire season underscores the growing, year-round threat of wildfires and the profound impact of a warming climate on the state's environment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent announcement of new tariffs on semiconductors and chips has raised concerns among analysts about the potential geopolitical fallout. Experts suggest that the policy, part of a broader 'America First' trade strategy, could inadvertently bolster China's economic influence in Southeast Asia. With regional economies already struggling to adapt to other US tariffs, the unpredictability of Washington's trade policies may push nations to seek more stable economic partnerships. The lack of clarity on which companies might receive exemptions further complicates the landscape for global manufacturers in the vital semiconductor industry. (not investment advice)</p>

She stated that repeated requests for funding to address security issues like broken locks had been ignored for years. While all but one of the inmates have been recaptured, the incident has prompted a major security audit of the facility.</p>

          <p>Following the implementation of new trade policies, the average tariff rate on products imported into the United States has reached 18.3%, its highest level in almost 100 years. According to analysis from the Budget Lab at Yale, this is the highest rate seen since 1934. The move has prompted international reactions, with countries like Brazil and Switzerland planning responses to mitigate the economic impact on their industries. The White House maintains that the protectionist measures are designed to re-energize the U.S. economy as a manufacturing power by encouraging domestic investment and hiring.

          <p>The United Kingdom has begun detaining migrants who arrive via small boats across the English Channel as part of a new pilot scheme with France. Under the 'one-in, one-out' agreement, for every migrant returned to France, the UK will accept one vetted asylum seeker who has not attempted an illegal crossing. A government source confirmed that several dozen migrants of various nationalities have been detained and could be returned within weeks. The policy, a key initiative of the new government, aims to deter illegal crossings, but critics from the opposition argue it will be less effective than previous proposals.</p>

          <p>Instagram's parent company, Meta, is facing significant user backlash following the launch of a new 'Instagram Map' feature that can share a user's location with their friends. While Meta insists the tool is off by default and requires users to opt-in, many have expressed alarm and confusion, with some claiming their location was shared without their explicit consent. Privacy advocates and users are concerned that the feature could be exploited by malicious actors for stalking or other harmful purposes. Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri, has responded to the complaints, stating the company is investigating but believes the issue is largely due to user confusion.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has announced that its experimental oral weight-loss drug, orforglipron, achieved significant success in a late-stage clinical trial. The once-daily pill helped adults with obesity lose an average of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks, with an efficacy and safety profile comparable to existing injectable GLP-1 therapies. The most common side effects were gastrointestinal issues like nausea and diarrhea. The company plans to submit the drug for FDA approval later this year, potentially making a more convenient and accessible pill-based treatment available to consumers by 2026, which could be a game-changer in the weight-loss market.</p>

          <p>The UK government is drafting new legislation that would impose stricter controls on serious violent and sexual offenders after their release from prison. The proposed system would confine offenders to specific, tailored geographical zones rather than simply using exclusion zones that bar them from certain areas. This shift aims to provide victims with greater peace of mind, allowing them to travel more freely without fear of encountering their attacker. While the government plans to use enhanced electronic tagging and monitoring technology, probation officers have raised concerns that the new zones will add significant pressure to their already strained service.</p>

          <p>A major political controversy has erupted after a U.S. senator from Texas claimed the FBI had agreed to help locate Democratic state lawmakers who fled to Illinois. The lawmakers left Texas to break quorum and block a Republican-led effort to pass a contentious redistricting bill. Democrats have fiercely condemned the suggestion of federal involvement, labeling it an authoritarian tactic to intimidate political opposition. Legal experts have questioned the authority of a federal agency to intervene in a state legislative matter, while the FBI has declined to comment on the senator's unconfirmed claim.</p>

His exit reportedly coincides with a decision by CEO Elon Musk to shut down the Dojo team and reassign its engineers to other initiatives.

          <p>Restaurant chain Texas Roadhouse announced mixed financial results for its second quarter, creating a complex picture for investors. The company reported strong comparable sales growth of 5.8%, driven by a welcome increase in customer traffic, indicating sustained brand popularity. However, these gains were offset by rising beef prices, which squeezed profit margins and caused the company to miss its earnings-per-share estimates. While strong consumer demand is a positive sign, the persistent pressure from high commodity costs remains a significant headwind, clouding the company's short-term financial outlook.
