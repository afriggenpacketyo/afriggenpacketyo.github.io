          <p>Yosemite National Park has implemented a ban on large flags from El Capitan, effectively criminalizing certain forms of protest within the park. Violators of the new rule could face up to six months in jail, indicating a strict stance on unauthorized displays. The regulation appears to have been formalized last month, signaling a deliberate effort to control expressions of dissent within the iconic national park. The ban raises questions about freedom of speech and the balance between preserving natural landscapes and allowing public expression.</p>

          <p>Approximately 700 active-duty Marines have been deployed to the Los Angeles area, joining National Guard troops in response to protests over federal immigration enforcement. California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the deployment of these troops, arguing it is an illegal use of military force for domestic law enforcement. The state's filing emphasizes that it does not seek to prevent the forces from protecting federal property but aims to prevent their use for immigration and law enforcement purposes.

Fetterman's message on X, formerly known as Twitter, condemned the violence and destruction, contrasting with some Democrats' attempts to characterize the anti-ICE riots as peaceful protests. His stance has resonated with conservatives who feel that Democrats have been reluctant to strongly condemn the violence. This is not the first time Fetterman has broken with his party, having previously praised Trump's Middle East policies and denounced anti-Israel protests.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department is adopting a narrower approach to prosecuting corporate bribery under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Officials stated that this move aims to align enforcement with the broader goal of enhancing the country's ability to compete overseas. The revised approach may focus on cases with the most significant impact on U.S. interests. The change could influence how multinational corporations conduct business internationally.

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves's upcoming Spending Review is expected to significantly impact life in the UK in the coming years. The review will allocate funds for essential public services, including healthcare, defense, and education. While the government aims to "fix the foundations" and emphasize stability, it acknowledges that many people are yet to feel the positive effects. The Institute for Fiscal Studies highlights that the key decision revolves around NHS funding, which constitutes a substantial portion of government spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves is preparing to announce her spending review, detailing funding allocations for public services like the NHS, schools, and police over the next few years. She will emphasize plans to "invest in Britain's renewal" by allocating an extra Â£113bn to infrastructure projects. However, some government departments are likely to face real-terms cuts, with priority given to health and defense budgets. The review will cover the Labour government's spending up to the next general election, likely in 2029. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has warned that "any" protesters at the upcoming military parade in Washington will be "met with heavy force." The parade, scheduled to honor the Army's 250th anniversary and coinciding with Trump's birthday, follows Trump's deployment of troops to Los Angeles to quell protests. The president's remarks have raised concerns about the potential suppression of free speech. Despite the warning, the U.S. Army has stated that it welcomes peaceful protests.</p>
