          <p>Jennifer Lopez is being sued for copyright infringement by a photographer and photo agency after she allegedly posted copyrighted photos of herself on social media without permission.

A federal judge is considering an emergency order to prevent further deportations, and the Department of Homeland Security has been contacted for comment.

          <p>Jim Cramer analyzed Tuesday's market activity, attributing stock movements to rising bond yields as Wall Street awaits congressional action on a federal budget bill. He noted that stocks, particularly those related to consumer discretionary spending and banks, are often influenced by the bond market, with higher yields typically leading to less economic activity. Cramer highlighted GE Vernova as a company resilient to bond market changes due to multiple secular trends, including the growing need for energy and new projects. He emphasized the importance of positive themes for stocks to overcome the gravitational pull of rising Treasury yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump urged House Republicans to support his legislative agenda, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," amid internal disagreements over Medicaid cuts and state and local tax deductions. Trump reportedly used strong language to dissuade Republicans from altering Medicaid and urged them to accept the current SALT deduction deal. Speaker Mike Johnson expressed confidence in securing enough votes for passage, though some hard-liners remain resistant, and the bill faces further hurdles in the Senate, where modifications are expected. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticized the bill's proposed Medicaid cuts and requested a daytime Rules Committee meeting.</p>

Congressional Budget Office estimates show this could occur by 2032, but a Republican tax and spending bill could accelerate this timeline. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that under the proposed bill, the nation’s debt could reach 129 percent of the economy by 2034. Elevated interest rates and potential risks to the nation's ability to borrow during crises are also contributing factors.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston pressed the Trump administration for answers regarding the alleged deportation of migrants to South Sudan, a move he stated would violate his previous order. The Justice Department confirmed that one migrant was deported to Myanmar but declined to disclose the destination of a second migrant, citing classified information. The judge expressed concerns about potential contempt of court and demanded information about the deportation flight, highlighting the administration's increasing reliance on third countries to accept migrants and raising questions about due process and transparency in immigration enforcement.</p>

The gutting of expertise and experience within the government is seen as catastrophic and may never be fully repaired.

          <p>The news of former President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s prostate cancer diagnosis has prompted questions about screening guidelines and the potential for late detection, as guidelines advise against screening after age 70. Despite the availability of PSA tests, some men may still develop aggressive cancers after recent checkups, and experts emphasize that the PSA test is not foolproof. Doctors say that there is a lack of robust evidence about the benefits of screening for prostate cancer, and that there are significant side effects that can arise from treatment. The circumstances raise awareness about the complexities of prostate cancer screening and the importance of individualized medical decisions.</p>
