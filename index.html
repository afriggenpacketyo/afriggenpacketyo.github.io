        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A survey conducted by the Carter Center and Emory University reveals that over half of mainland Chinese citizens oppose using force to unify with Taiwan under any circumstances. The online study, involving 2,211 participants aged 18 to 54, found that 55.1% disagreed with resolving the Taiwan issue through force. However, the survey also indicated stronger support for Russia's actions in Ukraine and maintaining China's border claims with India, highlighting varied perspectives on international relations among the Chinese populace. The study also showed that most Chinese citizens think that the Philippines and Vietnam should respect China’s sovereignty claims over the South China Sea and cease their objections, regardless of what international law says. Optimism that this will lead to decreased violence is not high.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks rebounded to close in the green after an early drop triggered by government data showing a 0.3% contraction in the U.S. economy during the first quarter. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both saw gains, while the Nasdaq Composite experienced a slight decrease. Economists suggest that the GDP figures may not fully represent the state of economic growth due to factors such as increased imports ahead of tariff implementations. Investors are also anticipating the Labor Department's upcoming jobs report for further insights into the economy, especially in light of President Trump's policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's conservative majority appeared ready to support the creation of the nation's first religious charter school directly funded by taxpayer dollars. The justices heard arguments in a case from Oklahoma, where the state Supreme Court blocked the Catholic Church from receiving a charter school contract. The court debated the First Amendment's religion clauses, considering both the prohibition of state establishment of religion and the protection of religious freedom. A ruling in favor of the school could have significant implications for charter schools nationwide, particularly in the 45 states that authorize them.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers gathered at the U.S. Capitol to denounce President Trump's first 100 days, accusing him of damaging the economy and democracy with the help of congressional Republicans. The party highlighted the recent economic data showing a contraction in the U.S. economy, attributing it to Trump's policies. Democrats are focusing on economic issues and affordability as they look toward the upcoming midterm elections. They promised to block any budget that targets social security, Medicare, or Medicaid and to hold the Trump administration accountable for its abuse of power.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's promises to cut spending, the federal government has spent over $200 billion more in his first 100 days compared to the same period last year. The rise is attributed to factors such as uncontrollable big-ticket expenditures, increases in military spending, and federal salaries. The increasing costs are direct payments to the military and seniors. While Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency has focused on smaller cuts, such as foreign aid, the vast majority of federal spending remains driven by military, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and debt payments.</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian Columbia student, has been released from ICE detention following a federal judge's order, after being detained during his U.S. citizenship interview. His attorneys argued that the Trump administration is seeking to deport Mahdawi due to his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests on campus, infringing on his First Amendment rights. The government had justified his detention by citing the Immigration and Nationality Act, stating that his presence would have serious adverse foreign policy consequences. This case is part of a trend of high-profile detentions of students involved in pro-Palestinian protests.</p>

          <p>The American Parents Coalition (APC) is supporting a lawsuit against a Florida middle school accused of socially transitioning a 13-year-old girl without parental consent. The APC argues that social transitioning is a form of medical treatment and that parents have the right to be informed about and refuse such treatments for their children. The lawsuit alleges that the school staff conducted a "gender support plan" with the girl behind closed doors, asking about bathroom and locker room preferences without notifying her parents. The APC argues that this violates the parents' due process rights and that social transitioning is the first step in a process that can lead to medical interventions.</p>

A smaller loan amount or credit line amount typically presents as less risky to the lender and be illustrated in lower rates for borrowers.
