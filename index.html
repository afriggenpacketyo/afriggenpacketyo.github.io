          <h2>CATL Stock Sale Excludes Onshore U.S. Investors Amid Rising U.S.-China Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 08:07:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. (CATL), the world’s largest electric car battery maker, saw its shares surge in its Hong Kong debut, but U.S. onshore investors were blocked from participating due to escalating tensions between the U.S. and China. CATL, labeled a Chinese military company by the Pentagon, faced pressure from U.S. lawmakers urging Wall Street banks to withdraw from the listing. This exclusion marks a significant shift from a decade ago when Chinese companies like Alibaba eagerly sought U.S. investment. Experts suggest this move signals a growing trend towards financial decoupling, potentially impacting other Chinese hardware and software producers and limiting U.S. investors' access to profitable opportunities.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, announced that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing its scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's plan to increase prices to offset tariff costs. McPhail noted that over half of Home Depot's sales originate in the U.S., and the company has diversified its import sources to reduce reliance on China. Home Depot reaffirmed its full-year sales forecast, anticipating a 2.8% increase, based on the continuation of temporarily lowered tariffs on imports from China and other countries. Despite missing first-quarter earnings expectations, Home Depot's sales estimates were higher than anticipated.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has charged New Jersey Congresswoman LaMonica McIver with assaulting federal agents during a clash outside a Newark immigration detention center. The charges stem from an incident on May 9 when McIver and other Democratic lawmakers attempted to conduct an oversight visit. The Justice Department also dropped a misdemeanor trespass charge against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested after being denied entry to the facility. McIver has accused federal law enforcement of instigating the clash, while Republican lawmakers have called for her expulsion from Congress. Ms. Habba also invited the mayor to tour Delaney Hall.</p>

          <p>Christopher Thuss, a fisherman, recently discovered the J.C. Ames, a tugboat intentionally sunk in Lake Michigan in 1923, near Manitowoc. The Wisconsin Historical Society announced the discovery, highlighting the significance of uncovering lost history. The J.C. Ames, built in 1881 for the lumber trade, was once a powerful tugboat. Maritime archaeologist Tamara Thomsen noted that abandoning ships was common practice then and estimates that 13 ships were abandoned in the area. The discovery is notable because Thuss's step-grandmother has a history of finding shipwrecks, and this recent find adds to the maritime history of the region.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg share an admiration for Iain M. Banks, a socialist science fiction writer known for his Culture series. The Culture series depicts a post-scarcity galactic society valuing empathy, pluralism, and cooperation, which contrasts sharply with the capitalist ideologies of Silicon Valley. Banks's Culture series envisions a society without billionaires or economic inequality, where powerful AIs handle governance, freeing citizens for leisure and personal pursuits. The article questions why tech billionaires are drawn to Banks's work, given its inherent opposition to their worldviews, suggesting they may focus on the technological aspects while overlooking the series' socialist underpinnings.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are hoping President Trump's intervention will help overcome internal divisions hindering the passage of their signature bill. The bill aims to advance Trump's domestic agenda, including tax cuts, spending cuts, deregulation, and border security funding. Disagreements among hard-line fiscal conservatives, members seeking to protect Medicaid access, and blue-state Republicans advocating for the repeal of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap have stalled progress. Trump is expected to visit Capitol Hill to persuade holdouts, leveraging his influence to unify the party behind the legislation, which faces a Memorial Day deadline.</p>

U.S. Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger expressed his disappointment with the Justice Department's decision to settle the wrongful death claim. Babbitt's death became a rallying point for Trump supporters who alleged unnecessary police force. The lawsuit claimed U.S. Capitol Police Lt. Michael Byrd was negligent in his use of force, but an internal review found Byrd's actions were justified and saved lives. Mr. Trump issued a blanket pardon for more than 1,500 Capitol riot defendants.</p>

Deputy Iran Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi warned that talks would fail if the US continues to demand Tehran cease uranium enrichment.

          <p>Senior government figures in the UK are discussing whether to reverse the decision to cut winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners. Chancellor Rachel Reeves restricted eligibility for the pension top-up last year, affecting over nine million pensioners. Discussions include changing the income threshold for eligibility or restoring payments to all pensioners. Some Labour MPs attribute recent election losses to the winter fuel policy, which could prompt a policy change as soon as the spending review on June 11. The winter fuel payment is a lump-sum amount paid to pensioners to help with increased heating costs over the winter.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned that markets and central banks are underestimating the risks posed by record U.S. deficits, tariffs, and international tensions. Dimon believes the stock market's values do not adequately reflect the potential for higher inflation and stagflation. He anticipates that Wall Street earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies will decline due to the uncertainty caused by President Trump's trade policies. Dimon also suggested that the odds of stagflation are higher than the market anticipates. Separately, JPMorgan reported that corporate clients are in a "wait-and-see" mode regarding acquisitions and other deals.</p>

          <p>Shipments of smartphones made in China to the United States, including Apple’s iPhone, experienced a significant decline in April, reaching their lowest levels since 2011. This drop underscores the impact of U.S. tariffs on trade between the two countries. Smartphone exports decreased by 72%, reflecting the disruption of tech supply chains and the shift of electronics production elsewhere due to the Trump administration’s tariffs campaign. The U.S. trade-weighted tariff rate on Chinese goods remains elevated, despite recent tariff reductions.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans, lifting a lower court's order that blocked the move. The decision enables the administration to proceed with ending deportation protections and work permits for Venezuelans, a move criticized by advocates as the largest single action stripping non-citizens of immigration status in modern U.S. history. Lawyers representing TPS holders expressed concern about the immediate impact and lack of clarity regarding the timeline for the rollback. The lawsuit challenging the decision alleges racial animus toward Venezuelans.</p>

          <p>Britain, France, and Canada issued a rare joint statement criticizing Israel's renewed military offensive in Gaza, calling it "wholly disproportionate." The allies also condemned Israel's restrictions on humanitarian aid, threatening further action if the offensive and restrictions are not ceased. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded, claiming the criticism gave a "huge prize" to Hamas. The European Union is urged to review its agreement with Israel based on human rights violations against Palestinians. France's foreign minister supported the call, describing Gaza as a "deathtrap" due to the violence and blockade.</p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly, the wife of a Conservative councillor, lost her appeal against a 31-month jail sentence for inciting racial hatred in a social media post. Connolly's post, made on the day of the Southport attacks, called for "mass deportation" and urged followers to "set fire" to hotels housing asylum seekers. The tweet was viewed 310,000 times before it was deleted. Appeal Court judges ruled that the original sentence was not manifestly excessive.

          <p>Ahmed Ebid, a UK-based people smuggler, was sentenced to 25 years in jail for organizing the movement of nearly 3,800 migrants into Europe between October 2022 and June 2023, some of whom made their way to Britain. The operation involved illegal boat crossings from North Africa to Italy, generating £12 million. Ebid arrived in the UK on a small boat in 2022 after serving time in Italy for attempted drug smuggling and applied for asylum. The judge emphasized Ebid's ruthless exploitation of desperate individuals for profit, with considerable risk of loss of life. Ebid will likely be deported after serving his sentence.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a 500-million-year-old predator with three eyes, named Mosura fentoni, in Canada's Burgess Shale. The fossil species, resembling the Japanese kaiju Mothra, was about the size of an index finger with spiny claws and a circular mouth. Mosura was a member of radiodonts, an extinct group distantly related to modern moths and arthropods like spiders and crabs. Researchers said it was "unlike any living animal" and had a unique abdomen-like body region with multiple segments. Scientists suspect this adaptation could be related to a specific habitat requiring more efficient respiration.</p>

Once considered a rising star in the Republican Party, DeSantis is now isolated from the national stage and experiencing conflicts with the Florida legislature.

DeSantis's weakened grip on Florida lawmakers is evident in open dissent and disagreements over various issues, including Medicaid and his wife Casey's involvement in a charity scandal.</p>
