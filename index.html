            <p>The UK government is in talks with France regarding a scheme to return illegal migrants who have crossed the English Channel in small boats, while simultaneously accepting legal migrants seeking family reunion in the UK. This pilot scheme, based on a "one-for-one principle," aims to discourage smuggling networks, according to the French interior ministry. While Conservative figures criticize Labour's decision to scrap the Rwanda deportation agreement, Liberal Democrats support the returns scheme as a positive step towards ending dangerous crossings. The UK government insists there is no single "silver bullet" for solving the problem of illegal migration.</p>

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that this option would only be considered for the most violent and egregious repeat offenders. The administration is currently examining the legal aspects and has already deported alleged foreign citizen gang members to El Salvador.

Wang was fired from his university post following questioning about alleged undisclosed funding from China, though he has not been charged with any offense.

            <p>Nvidia announced it expects to record a $5.5 billion charge related to exporting H20 graphics processing units to China and other destinations, following a U.S. government decision requiring a license for such exports.

This development signals a potential slowdown in Nvidia's growth due to increased export controls aimed at preventing the use of its chips for military purposes.

            <p>The UK Supreme Court has ruled that a woman is someone born biologically female, excluding transgender women from the legal definition of a woman under the Equality Act. This decision allows for the exclusion of trans women from some single-sex spaces and groups, including changing rooms and shelters. While the court stated that this ruling does not remove protection from trans people, who are protected from discrimination on the ground of gender reassignment, transgender rights advocates express concern that the ruling will be a setback for transgender rights and will make workplaces unwelcoming places for trans people.</p>

The decline is expected to be particularly pronounced in North America, with exports projected to fall by 12.6%.

            <p>The Justice Department has filed a civil lawsuit against Maine's Department of Education, alleging discrimination against women by failing to protect women in women's sports. Attorney General Pam Bondi claims the state violated Title IX by allowing transgender girls and women to compete on sports teams that match their gender identity. The move follows President Trump's executive order mandating that Title IX be interpreted as prohibiting the participation of transgender girls and women in female sports. The lawsuit cites examples of boys participating in girls' sports.</p>

            <p>The US government’s latest export restrictions on Nvidia’s H20 artificial intelligence (AI) chips are set to disrupt the plans of China’s Big Tech firms in the industry. This may force companies such as ByteDance and Tencent Holdings to accelerate their shift to domestic semiconductor alternatives. Nvidia disclosed that Washington will now require a license to export its H20 chips to China, a move the company expects to cost it US$5.5 billion. The H20 is a graphics processing unit (GPU) tailored for the Chinese market after earlier US export controls.</p>

The White House is also changing the makeup of the press pool to remove a spot designated for news wire services. The White House Correspondents' Association criticized the changes, stating they retaliate against news organizations for coverage the White House doesn't like.
