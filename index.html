          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, currently under investigation for mishandling sensitive military information, received a public show of support from President Trump during a visit to Michigan. Trump introduced Hegseth to members of the Michigan National Guard, praising his work, while Hegseth reciprocated with praise for the president's efforts to restore the warrior ethos within the military. Hegseth's office did not comment on his inclusion in Trump's entourage, which comes amidst allegations of financial mismanagement, sexual assault, and heavy drinking, all of which Hegseth denies. The article also notes the departure of several top aides and Hegseth's decision to end a Defense Department program aimed at bolstering the participation of women in resolving overseas conflicts, calling it a "woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative."</p>

          <p>A federal judge criticized the Trump administration's decision to terminate immigration records for thousands of foreign students, deeming it "arbitrary and capricious." The judge, Ana Reyes, questioned the process used to terminate the records, citing the case of Akshar Patel, whose record was terminated due to a speeding ticket. Reyes highlighted the lack of individualized determination in the terminations and expressed concern over the impact on international students and the legal costs incurred due to the administration's actions. The judge did not rule on Patel's motion for a preliminary injunction after the government stated his student status had not been terminated.</p>

Harvard pledged to review its academic offerings and admissions policies in response to the findings.

The prosecutors explained that the Metropolitan Detention Center, where Mangione is held, regularly records and monitors jail lines, and Mangione used one of those lines instead of a designated attorney line. As a result, the detention center mistakenly sent recordings of the calls to prosecutors, who then notified the defense and segregated the recordings without listening to them.
