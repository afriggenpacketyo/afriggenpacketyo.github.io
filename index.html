          <p>The White House has withdrawn Jared Isaacman's nomination to be the next NASA administrator, just days before a scheduled Senate confirmation vote. President Trump announced the decision on Truth Social, stating that he would soon announce a new nominee who is "Mission aligned, and put America First in Space." Isaacman, a veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and SpaceX, had previously expressed his commitment to making America a leader in space exploration and inspiring future generations. Musk responded to the withdrawal by stating that Isaacman was both competent and good-hearted. The nomination had advanced through the Senate's Commerce Committee in April, and the Senate was set to vote after returning from the Memorial Day recess.</p>

Hegseth drew parallels to the Trump administration's push for European countries to increase their defense spending.

          <p>This article recounts an incident during John Boehner's first race for Congress in 1990, when actor George Wendt, best known for his role as Norm on "Cheers," inadvertently libeled Boehner on national television. Wendt, whose brother-in-law was Boehner's opponent, Greg Jolivette, confused Boehner with another politician involved in a sex scandal. The gaffe created a stir in the campaign, with Boehner's team responding with a statement questioning Jolivette's own past. Boehner ultimately won the election, and later reconciled with Wendt, with the former Speaker explaining how Wendt was the brother-in-law of his opponent and "went on a late-night TV show and said some tough things."</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities initially reported that 250 million bees had escaped, but later corrected the number. The public was advised to avoid the area, and beekeepers assisted in recovering the hives. The road was closed for about 24 hours to allow the bees to re-hive and find their queen. By the next morning, most of the bees had returned to their hives, and those responsible for their delivery took charge.</p>

          <p>Blue Origin successfully launched six passengers on a sub-orbital trip to the edge of space, marking the company's twelfth crewed flight. The international crew experienced a few minutes of weightlessness and stunning views before returning to Earth. The New Shepard rocket climbed to nearly 65 miles above Earth, allowing passengers to float weightlessly and view the curvature of the Earth through large windows. Blue Origin has now launched 68 passengers into space since July 2021, and Jorge's seat was sponsored by Farmacias Similares, a Mexican company focused on accessible healthcare across Latin America.</p>

The proposed agreement includes the release of living Israeli hostages and the remains of deceased hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. A senior Hamas official noted that there are some points that need to be amended, especially on U.S. guarantees, the timing of hostage release, the delivery of aid and the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Meanwhile, the U.N. Food Program reported that aid trucks were stopped and offloaded by hungry Palestinians due to the severe blockade on Gaza.</p>

          <p>The Hollywood film and television industry is facing growing concerns about its ability to survive in California due to job losses and a decline in production. The strikes in 2023 caused a halt in production, leading to the loss of roughly 40,000 jobs in California. Television production in the Los Angeles area has decreased by 58% since 2021, as productions move to other states and countries offering generous tax incentives. Governor Newsom is proposing to more than double the state's film and TV tax credits to combat the issue, but some believe it may be too late to offset the high cost of working in California.</p>

The government's commitment to reducing patient waiting times and improving access to dental care could pull funding from other areas.

          <p>Artists are increasingly emphasizing the role of art in influencing climate change policy and making direct interventions to protect the environment. The United Nations Ocean Conference (UNOC) is incorporating art to raise awareness of regenerative practices and sustainability. Artists are creating installations and sculptures that evoke the experience of pristine nature, aiming to inspire care and agency among individuals. Historically, artists have reminded society of what might be lost due to environmental risk, bridging the gap between abstract climate change concepts and tangible action.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has sent Iran a proposal for a nuclear deal, confirmed by the White House, following a UN nuclear watchdog report indicating Iran has increased its production of enriched uranium. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he had been presented with "elements of a US deal" by his Omani counterpart. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated it was in Tehran's "best interest to accept" the deal. The proposal comes amid concerns about Iran's uranium enrichment levels, which are close to weapons-grade purity.</p>

          <p>Taiwanâ€™s Kuomintang (KMT) party is preparing for a leadership election in September, aiming to regain power after years on the political sidelines. Before the leadership race, the KMT faces a mass-recall campaign by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that could weaken its legislative majority. Analysts warn that failure to contain the recall challenge could disrupt the leadership transition. KMT chairman Eric Chu Li-luan signaled his readiness to step down and hinted that Taichung mayor Lu Shiow-yen could be a promising successor.</p>

          <p>A viral TikTok trend suggesting that a McDonald's meal of full-fat coke and salty fries can cure migraines is being examined by health experts. While some migraine sufferers report temporary relief from the caffeine and sugar in coke or the salt on fries, experts caution that these are not cures and may even trigger migraines in some individuals. Migraines are complex neurological conditions with no simple solution, and experts emphasize the need for more research into effective treatments. One neurologist advises listening to your body and avoiding TikTok advice, emphasizing the importance of regularity and avoiding extremes.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses Donald Trump's political resilience, attributing it to his willingness to swerve, backpedal, and contradict himself, which is encapsulated by the Wall Street acronym "TACO" (Trump Always Chickens Out). The author argues that this promise of chickening out reassures swing voters that anything extreme is provisional. Recent actions, such as easing on China tariffs and distancing from Elon Musk, have helped Trump's poll numbers recover. Seeing Trump check himself and be checked by others is what an important group of voters expect from his presidency.</p>
