          <p>The article argues that a big government is still beneficial, even with Donald Trump in power, because the issue lies not with the government's size but with the lack of oversight. It counters the idea that a smaller government would be less harmful, stating that Trump has been consolidating power by reducing the size of government agencies that impede him. The author contends that a robust state is essential for providing a social safety net and responding to crises, and that oversight mechanisms are crucial for constraining government power and protecting against abuse.</p>

The increased tariffs have been praised by some of the nation's largest steel makers but are expected to raise manufacturing costs and consumer prices.
