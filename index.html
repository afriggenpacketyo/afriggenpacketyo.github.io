          <p>Alphabet, YouTube's parent company, is contributing $22 million towards the construction of a new White House ballroom as part of a legal settlement with Donald Trump. The settlement resolves a dispute over Trump's ban from the platform following the January 6th Capitol riot. This contribution covers nearly ten percent of the project's estimated $250 million cost, which has drawn public criticism following the demolition of parts of the White House's East Wing. Trump has stated that the ballroom will be privately funded by donors and "Great American Companies" without using taxpayer money.</p>

          <p>Graham Platner, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in Maine, has apologized for and covered up a chest tattoo that resembled a Nazi symbol. The tattoo, which he claims he got with fellow Marines in 2007 without knowing its connotations, sparked significant backlash after being seen in a social media video. This controversy adds to existing scrutiny over his past online remarks, where he downplayed sexual assault in the military and described himself as a communist. Platner has since apologized for those comments as well, attributing them to a difficult period after returning from war.</p>

          <p>A prominent child abuse expert has withdrawn from chairing the UK's national inquiry into grooming gangs, citing political "point scoring" and a lack of confidence from some survivors due to his past police career. His departure follows another candidate's withdrawal and the resignation of several survivors from the inquiry's oversight panel, who fear its scope is being diluted. The controversy has ignited fierce debate in Parliament, with accusations of the government mishandling the process and survivors being used for political leverage. The government has pledged that the inquiry will not be watered down and will proceed with finding a suitable chair.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led legislature in North Carolina has passed a new congressional map designed to make a key Democratic-held district more favorable for the GOP. The redrawn map specifically targets the district of moderate Democrat Rep. Don Davis, aiming to bolster Republican chances of maintaining control of the House in the 2026 midterm elections. This move is part of a broader national trend where both parties are using the redistricting process in states they control to gain a political advantage. The state's Democratic governor lacks the power to veto a standalone map.</p>

          <p>A growing trend in the tech industry involves major companies like Meta and HP acquiring or heavily investing in promising AI startups, only for those startups to subsequently lay off a significant portion of their staff. This pattern reflects a strategic shift where large tech firms are prioritizing the rapid integration of AI technology and eliminating redundant roles over preserving the startup's original culture and workforce. Analysts suggest this is driven by Wall Street scrutiny and a broader recalibration of tech workforces after pandemic-era hiring sprees. The volatility is creating job uncertainty for employees in the AI sector.</p>

          <p>Meta is laying off approximately 600 employees within its AI units as part of a broader strategy to streamline operations and become more agile in the competitive AI landscape. The cuts affect workers in AI infrastructure, research, and product-related roles, and come just months after Meta's significant investment in Scale AI, whose founder now leads Meta's AI division. The move aligns with CEO Mark Zuckerberg's push for a more aggressive AI overhaul following a lukewarm reception to the company's Llama 4 models. This restructuring occurs as Meta continues to invest billions in AI infrastructure, including a massive new data center.</p>

This response addresses accusations from Republicans that Smith improperly spied on them during his investigation into Donald Trump's efforts to subvert the 2020 election.

While no group has claimed responsibility, regional security officials speculate it could be the work of an ISIS affiliate active in the area. The U.S. State Department has been asked for information, but there has been no official response from either the Nigerien government or the U.S. Embassy.</p>

          <p>Celebrated Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi revealed that his latest film, "It Was Just an Accident," was inspired by his time in prison during the "Woman, Life, Freedom" protests. The film explores the internal conflicts among dissidents about the use of violence and how to live under an oppressive regime. Panahi, who has been banned from filmmaking and imprisoned for his work, insists he makes social, not political, films that avoid judgment and allow the audience to decide. In a recent interview, he expressed concern about the "cycle of violence" continuing in Iran even after a potential regime change.</p>

          <p>Corporate executives across major industries are increasingly vocal about artificial intelligence's role in reshaping their workforces, with many warning of significant white-collar job replacement. While recent data shows minimal broad economic disruption so far, firms like JPMorgan and Salesforce are already using AI to reduce head count in areas like customer support and coding. Economists suggest this is the start of a multi-decade trend that could displace millions of jobs, even as it creates new roles. The Stanford Digital Economy Lab found that entry-level hiring in jobs exposed to AI has already dropped by 13%.</p>

The judge lifted the anonymity order on the killer, citing the substantial public interest in knife crime. During the trial, the prosecution argued Khan acted to "show he was hard," while the defense claimed he "snapped" after experiencing bullying and abuse.

          <p>Claire-Louise Bennett's third book, "Big Kiss, Bye-Bye," delves into the complexities of modern romance, offering a subtle counterargument to the growing sentiment of "heteropessimism." The novel follows an unnamed writer navigating the aftermath of a breakup, using Bennett's signature inventive and meandering prose to explore her inner world. The article suggests the book questions whether abstract, social-media-fueled debates about gender politics are productive. Instead, the novel seems to argue for the profound, specific reality of individual relationships, which exist both within and apart from broader societal trends, emphasizing the importance of lived, personal experience.</p>

Vance affirmed the U.S.-Israel partnership while stating a goal for Israel to take a leadership role that allows the U.S. to "care less about the Middle East." Concurrently, the International Court of Justice issued an advisory opinion stating Israel must allow UN aid agencies to provide humanitarian assistance in Gaza, a ruling Israel's Foreign Ministry rejected as political.

This potential disruption could be devastating for the over 40 million Americans who rely on the program for groceries.

Although she had limited playing time during the final tournament, she emphasized the importance of her role supporting the team from the sidelines.

          <p>Amid rising debt and economic pressures, this article clarifies a common misconception about Chapter 13 bankruptcy, explaining that it does not require filers to surrender all of their income. Instead, the process involves creating a three-to-five-year repayment plan funded by the filer's "disposable income." This is the amount left over after accounting for reasonable and necessary living expenses such as housing, food, and transportation. The goal is to create a sustainable payment structure, allowing individuals to maintain a basic standard of living while systematically addressing their debts, making it a viable option for those with regular income.</p>

However, the company faces headwinds from increased tariff costs and the expiration of federal electric vehicle tax credits, which had previously pulled sales forward. Investors will be focused on updates regarding the company's Robotaxi service, production of new lower-cost models, and the adoption of its driver assistance systems in key markets. The report comes as Tesla's brand ranking has slipped and competition from other EV makers in Europe has intensified. (not investment advice)</p>
