          <p>The United States has lifted export restrictions on chip-design software for China, allowing American companies like Synopsys and Cadence to resume business. The move reverses a policy implemented in May that required licenses for exporting such technology. This decision follows signals of a trade truce between the two nations and has positively impacted the stock prices of the affected companies, which dominate the global electronic design automation market. The policy shift is a significant development in the ongoing tech and trade relationship between the US and China.</p>

          <p>With a razor-thin Republican majority in the House, the possibility of a tie vote on major legislation has become more prominent. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. According to House rules, if a vote on a question or a bill results in a tie, the measure is considered to have failed and is lost. This procedural reality highlights the challenges for the majority party when dealing with internal defections, as even a small number of opposing votes can defeat legislation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration executive order that suspended the ability of migrants who cross the southern border to seek asylum. In his ruling, Judge Randolph Moss stated that the president does not have the unilateral authority to create an "alternative immigration system" that bypasses laws enacted by Congress. The judge granted a nationwide injunction but stayed his decision for 14 days to allow the administration time to appeal. The ruling is a significant legal blow to one of the administration's key immigration policies.</p>

Emergency services are battling the blaze in difficult, rugged terrain, and hospitals have been placed on alert.

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called for Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to resign immediately, intensifying his long-running criticism of the central bank's head. Trump, who appointed Powell during his first term, has repeatedly attacked him for not cutting interest rates more aggressively to boost the economy. The demand for resignation raises questions about the independence of the central bank, as board members can typically only be removed "for cause." Powell has previously stated he would not step down if asked by the president.</p>

          <p>A report from His Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services found that historical child grooming investigations in Manchester were significantly delayed by the city council. The council provided heavily redacted documents to the police, with some pages containing only a few words, making it impossible for investigators to assess the evidence. The council cited complex data-sharing rules as the reason for the redactions. A new, more efficient process for sharing unredacted information has since been established between the agencies.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in The Lancet Oncology has found that menopausal hormone therapy combining estrogen and progestin is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in women under 55. Conversely, the study found that estrogen-only therapy, typically given to women who have had a hysterectomy, actually reduces the risk. This research provides a more nuanced understanding of hormone replacement therapy, distinguishing between different treatment types. It refines older research and underscores the importance of personalized medical consultation for menopausal symptoms.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, a former criminology PhD student, has pleaded guilty to the murders of four University of Idaho students in November 2022. The admission is part of a plea deal that allows him to avoid the death penalty; he is expected to receive four consecutive life sentences without parole. The brutal stabbings of the four students in their off-campus home shocked the nation. The plea deal has caused a division among the victims' families, with some supporting the closure it brings while others expressed anger at the state for not pursuing a trial.</p>

          <p>Following Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea, the lead prosecutor detailed the key evidence that linked him to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students. The case was built on a combination of cell phone tracking, surveillance video, and crucial DNA evidence from a knife sheath left at the scene. Investigators obtained a familial DNA match by secretly collecting a Q-tip from the garbage of Kohberger's parents' home. The prosecutor also noted that Kohberger's car and apartment had been meticulously cleaned, but the evidence was sufficient to secure the case against him.</p>

          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals that President Trump secured nearly half of the Latino vote in the 2024 election, a significant increase from 2020. Political experts suggest this shift is not necessarily ideological but reflects a move toward economic populism. Analysts point to disillusionment with the Democratic Party's handling of the economy and immigration as key factors. The findings challenge long-held assumptions about the Latino voting bloc, indicating it is more dynamic and less monolithic than often portrayed by political campaigns.</p>
