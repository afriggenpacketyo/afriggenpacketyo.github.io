          <p>Tesla is carefully planning its entry into the Indian market, according to CFO Vaibhav Taneja, who cited high import tariffs and luxury taxes as significant obstacles. While India presents a promising market due to its large middle class, the cost of importing EVs could double due to these tariffs. Tesla is working to determine the optimal timing for expansion, navigating the challenges posed by India's protectionist policies. CEO Elon Musk recently discussed technology collaboration with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, indicating ongoing interest in establishing a presence in the country.</p>

          <p>Chinese state-backed energy firms may need to renegotiate long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) procurement contracts with US providers due to the escalating US-China trade war. Trade flows of US LNG to China have ceased since February 10, following Beijing's retaliatory tariffs. Chinese buyers hold 21 long-term contracts with US producers, covering 25.6 million tonnes of annual volume, with the majority of this year's expected deliveries easily resold to other markets.

          <p>International news outlets are highlighting reports of a potential peace plan for Ukraine, with Donald Trump reportedly willing to allow Russia to retain seized territory. The IMF has warned that Trump's tariffs have unleashed a “major negative shock” into the world economy, leading to reduced growth forecasts. The death of Pope Francis continues to be a prominent story, with his body laid in state in the Vatican. Other headlines include police reform efforts in the UK and concerns over solar panels linked to Chinese slave labor.</p>

The first step is for the FDA to revoke authorization of citrus red No. 2 and orange B. After that, the Department of Health and Human Services said, it will work with industry to eliminate six petroleum-based food dyes: blue 1, blue 2, green 3, red 40, yellow 5 and yellow 6. California passed a law banning those six dyes last year, citing developmental and behavioral harms in children. The state law is set to go into effect the end of 2027.</p>

Musk defended his focus on downsizing the federal government and dismissed protests against Tesla as being “paid for.” The company's quarterly earnings report revealed a significant drop in net income and revenue from car sales. The company has been affected by President Trump's sweeping tariffs plan. Musk said that Tesla is "not on the ragged edge of death," and maintained that the company's long-term profitability relies on robotaxis and autonomous robots.</p>

The court's conservative majority seemed ready to side with the families. The case centers on whether public schools unconstitutionally burden parents' First Amendment right to exercise their religion freely when they require children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality that violate the families' religious beliefs.</p>
