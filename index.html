          <p>A detailed timeline reconstructs the chaotic two hours of a mass shooting inside a Park Avenue skyscraper, initiated by a 27-year-old gunman from Las Vegas. The attacker, wearing a jacket and sunglasses, entered the building around 6:30 PM and began firing an assault-style rifle in the lobby, killing four people, including a police officer and a security guard. The narrative describes the panic among employees who barricaded themselves in offices and the gunman's mistaken elevator ride to the wrong floor, which prevented him from reaching his apparent target, the NFL headquarters.</p>

          <p>A critical report examines the leadership of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is overseen by Johnnie Moore, an evangelical leader and public relations professional with strong ties to Republican politics. The article questions his suitability for the role, given his limited experience in humanitarian aid, and highlights the controversies surrounding the GHF's operations, including a drastic reduction in aid distribution sites and violence at those locations. Moore defends the GHF, blaming criticism on the UN and Hamas, suggesting his primary role is to manage the public perception of the U.S. and Israeli-backed aid effort amid a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed that he severed ties with Jeffrey Epstein after the financier "stole" employees from his Mar-a-Lago club, specifically identifying Virginia Giuffre as one of the workers. Trump stated that he had warned Epstein against recruiting his staff, and when it happened again, he banned him from the property. Giuffre, who later accused Epstein of sexual abuse, had previously said she was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell while working at the club's spa. The comments come as Trump is also engaged in a lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch over a story about a letter he allegedly sent to Epstein.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon, under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has suspended all participation in conferences and events hosted by think tanks and other civilian policy research organizations. The department justified the move by claiming these forums promote "globalism" and are not aligned with its focus on increasing military lethality and projecting strength. The article suggests the ban, which affects long-standing events like the Aspen Security Forum, stems from a combination of bureaucratic resentment, insecurity about facing policy experts, and a fear of officials misspeaking in a way that would anger President Trump. This policy risks damaging civil-military relations and isolating defense officials from crucial external expertise.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, has informed the House Oversight Committee that she will only testify if she is granted immunity or a presidential pardon. Her attorney stated in a letter that without such protections, Maxwell would invoke her Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination, citing her ongoing legal appeals. The committee, which subpoenaed Maxwell to inform legislative efforts against sex trafficking, responded that it will not consider granting congressional immunity. Maxwell's lawyer added that she would be "eager" to testify publicly if her sentence were commuted.</p>

          <p>UCLA has agreed to a $6.45 million settlement in a federal lawsuit filed by Jewish students and a professor who alleged the university enabled antisemitism during pro-Palestinian encampments in 2024. The plaintiffs claimed they were barred from parts of campus by a "Jew Exclusion Zone" created by protesters, violating their civil rights. As part of the deal, UCLA is prohibited from allowing the exclusion of Jewish individuals from campus areas and will donate funds to Jewish community groups and a campus initiative to combat antisemitism. The settlement is one of the largest payouts to date related to campus antisemitism lawsuits since October 2023.</p>

          <p>The new film "Together," starring real-life couple Dave Franco and Alison Brie, is reviewed as a unique blend of body horror and relationship therapy. The plot centers on an unhappy couple who move to a remote forest and discover a mysterious pool of water that causes a biological urge to physically merge with each other. The review praises the film's clever metaphor for codependence, drawing parallels to Plato's "Symposium" and John Carpenter's "The Thing." Director Michael Shanks is commended for his expert misdirection and for fusing gross-out visuals with empathetic performances, creating a film that is simultaneously tragic, darkly humorous, and squirm-inducing.</p>

While Trump held court at his golf resorts, demonstrators gathered with signs reading "Deport Donald!" reflecting polling data that shows his politics are unpopular with most Scots. First Minister John Swinney, who had previously criticized Trump, engaged with the president on issues like Gaza and trade tariffs on Scotch whisky but remained carefully neutral in his public assessment.

The article analyzes the political pressures from within the Labour party that led to the decision and questions the feasibility of the conditions placed on Israel and Hamas. Given the current Israeli government's composition and Hamas's position, meeting these demands for a ceasefire and a two-state solution commitment by September seems unlikely. The move is seen by some as a symbolic gesture aimed at appeasing domestic allies, with its ultimate effect on the conflict dependent on powers like the United States.</p>
