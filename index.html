Musk stated that Samsung's new factory in Texas will be dedicated to producing Tesla's next-generation AI6 chip, a move he described as strategically critical. The deal, which Musk suggested could exceed the initial value, also involves Tesla assisting Samsung in maximizing manufacturing efficiency, boosting Samsung's stock price.

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a framework agreement on trade, averting a larger conflict ahead of a key deadline. The deal sets a 15% US tariff on many EU goods, a reduction from a threatened 30% but still a significant increase. As part of the agreement, the EU will reportedly increase investment in the US and purchase American energy and military equipment, marking a victory for the Trump administration's trade renegotiation strategy.

          <p>The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in England is expected to announce an overwhelming rejection of the government's 3.6% pay award, according to BBC sources. The union has described the offer as "grotesque" and is demanding further negotiations over the summer to avoid a formal strike ballot in the autumn. This development follows a similar rejection by the GMB union, representing other health workers, increasing pressure on the government amid ongoing pay disputes across the public sector.</p>
