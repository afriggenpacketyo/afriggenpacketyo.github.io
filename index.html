          <p>Elon Musk publicly denounced President Trump's tax-and-spending-cut bill, labeling it a "disgusting abomination" on his social media platform, X. Musk argued that the bill would drastically increase the federal budget deficit to $2.5 trillion, burdening American citizens with unsustainable debt. The White House dismissed Musk's criticism, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt defending the bill as "one big, beautiful bill" and refuting claims that it adds to the deficit. Musk's remarks follow an earlier interview where he stated the bill "undermines" the DOGE effort to cut government spending, despite previously leading the Trump administration's DOGE initiative. Optimism regarding the financial situation is low given Musk's stark assessment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has unveiled a new official portrait of President Trump, replacing the previous image that had drawn comparisons to a mugshot. In the new portrait, Trump stares directly into the camera with a serious expression, dressed in a blue suit and red tie against a dark backdrop. This contrasts with the earlier portrait from January, which featured lighting from below and an American flag backdrop, leading to unflattering comparisons. A White House official stated that the original portrait was always intended as a placeholder, and the new portrait reflects the "optimism and resolve of America."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is threatening California with legal action and potential fines over its policies allowing transgender athletes to compete in sports consistent with their gender identity. This action follows a transgender athlete's success in statewide high school track-and-field events. The Justice Department, led by Harmeet Dhillon, claims California's policies are "unconstitutional" and discriminate against female athletes. President Trump has singled out the athlete on social media, promising "large scale fines" for the state, escalating the conflict between the federal government and California over transgender rights.</p>

          <p>President Trump has formally requested Congress to rescind $1.1 billion in funding allocated for public broadcasting over the next two years, intensifying his conflict with NPR and PBS. This request is part of a larger $9.4 billion clawback package that includes cuts to foreign aid programs. Republicans have accused NPR and PBS of partisan bias, while Democrats have voiced strong support for maintaining financial subsidies for public broadcasting. The rescission request has triggered lobbying efforts from public radio stations, who argue their vital role in providing local news and educational content, especially in rural areas.</p>

Morales-Reyes, who has a criminal record, cannot read, speak, or write English fluently, raising suspicions about the letter's authenticity. Investigators found a pen matching the ink used in the letters and a note with the Wisconsin Attorney General's address in Scott's jail cell.

          <p>Federal authorities have charged two Chinese nationals, Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu, with conspiracy and smuggling after an attempt to bring a toxic fungus into the U.S. The fungus, Fusarium graminearum, is considered a potential agroterrorism weapon due to its ability to attack crops and sicken livestock and people. Liu was initially turned away at the Detroit airport after changing his story about the red plant material in his backpack. The FBI alleges that Jian, who worked at a University of Michigan lab, was assisting Liu with the pathogen, even though the university lacks the permits to handle it.</p>

          <p>The New York Knicks have fired coach Tom Thibodeau days after their loss in the Eastern Conference finals. The team president stated the organization is singularly focused on winning a championship. Thibodeau led the team to the postseason in four of his five seasons in New York, but the conference finals run was the teamâ€™s first since 2000. There were criticisms that his hard-driving style and overreliance on his starters wore down his players, but the Knicks had won a playoff series in three straight seasons under his leadership.</p>
