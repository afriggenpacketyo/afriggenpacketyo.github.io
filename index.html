          <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has lowered its benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%, marking the lowest level since August 2022 and surpassing market expectations. This move represents the third consecutive rate cut since February, driven by positive GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, which exceeded estimates at 7.4% year-on-year. Despite the rate cut, the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, indicating a projected slowdown compared to the previous financial year. The RBI's decision also considers the ongoing downtrend in India's inflation, with the most recent reading for April at 3.16%, providing room for monetary easing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf's resignation as Reform UK's chairman highlights the challenges the party faces in its rapid scaling up and organizational development. Yusuf, a self-made millionaire, joined Reform UK a year ago as a donor and later became chairman, contributing financially and strategically to the party's rise. His departure underscores the difficulty of hiring and retaining staff crucial for transforming the party into an election-winning machine. Yusuf's heritage and organizational skills were seen as valuable assets for Reform UK, but his approach also caused friction within the party, raising concerns about its long-term stability.</p>

          <p>A Japanese high court has overturned a previous ruling that held former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO) liable for damages related to the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant disaster. The court determined that the executives could not have foreseen the massive tsunami that caused the crisis, thus reversing the 2022 decision that ordered them to pay approximately 13 trillion yen ($90 billion) in compensation. The focus of the trial was on whether the management's inaction regarding tsunami countermeasures was acceptable, given a 2008 TEPCO estimate of a potential 15.7-meter tsunami. The lawyer for the shareholders has criticized the ruling and intends to appeal the decision.</p>

The bill, sponsored by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, would allow terminally ill adults with less than six months to live to receive medical assistance to die. Concerns have been raised about protecting vulnerable individuals and ensuring that assisted dying is not extended to those with alternative options for improving their quality of life. Amendments aimed at preventing coercion have been blocked by supporters of the bill, leading some MPs to switch their stance.</p>

The mission aimed to deliver a mini rover and a Swedish artist's Moonhouse to the lunar surface.

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, has reiterated the need to reconsider higher import duties imposed by the United States during a meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Akazawa is in Washington for ongoing tariff talks at the ministerial level, aiming to facilitate a meeting between the leaders of both countries in mid-June. He "strongly" urged the United States to reconsider the tariff measures announced by President Donald Trump, while also discussing cooperation on trade, nontariff barriers, and economic security. Japan is weighing whether to accept a cut in the rates, as the United States resists a full removal of the duties. (not investment advice)</p>

While there were restrictions on his parenting due to mental health concerns, there were no apparent red flags before the incident. The attorney and ex-wife are now advocating for changes in mental health resources for veterans and reforms to the Amber Alert system.</p>

Kim had described the initial incident as a result of "absolute carelessness, irresponsibility and unscientific empiricism," leading to the arrest of several officials. Analysts suggest that Kim's swift and severe response indicates Pyongyang's commitment to advancing its military capabilities.</p>

While some nutritionists express concern that this trend may prioritize fewer ingredients over essential nutrients, others argue that the term UPF is not a helpful indicator of health. Food brands are advised to simplify formulas and utilize new processing technologies to create less processed products, with marketing expected to emphasize the virtues of these items.</p>
