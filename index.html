          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has invested at least $100 million in bonds since taking office, according to 33 pages of filings with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics made public this week. The investments span various entities, including local governments, gas and water supply districts, hospital authorities, school boards, and major corporations like T-Mobile, United Health, Home Depot, Facebook, and Instagram parent Meta. Some of these companies have been directly impacted by his administration's policies. This substantial bond-buying spree highlights the President's personal financial activities while in office.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly called for Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign, following allegations of mortgage fraud made by Bill Pulte, Director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency. Pulte claims Cook falsified documents to secure more favorable loan terms on two properties designated as primary residences. This demand comes as Trump pressures the Fed to lower interest rates, and Cook holds a vote on the Federal Open Market Committee, influencing rate decisions. A Justice Department investigation is anticipated, though Cook's resignation before the next Fed meeting is considered unlikely.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has rejected the government's request to unseal grand jury material related to the case of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who died in custody in 2019. Judge Richard Berman ruled that the Justice Department failed to demonstrate the "special circumstance" required to disclose the typically secret grand jury transcripts and exhibits. This decision maintains the confidentiality of the proceedings, preventing public access to details from the grand jury investigation into Epstein's activities. The ruling underscores the strict legal precedents governing grand jury secrecy.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul urged China to play a more active role in facilitating Ukraine peace negotiations, highlighting Beijing's significant influence over Russia. During his Asia tour, Wadephul noted positive signals from various leaders but emphasized the need for a clear commitment from Vladimir Putin to end the war. He warned of further sanctions if Russia remains unwilling to negotiate, while also connecting the Ukraine conflict to broader global stability concerns. Germany seeks diversified trade partners like Indonesia to "de-risk" from China, though it does not aim to host peace talks.</p>

          <p>Ernesto Barajas, a popular Mexican musician from the group Enigma Norteno, was fatally shot in a Zapopan parking lot in Jalisco state. Barajas was known for performing "narco-corridos," a controversial music genre that glorifies drug cartel activities and leaders like "El Mencho" and "Los Chapitos." This incident marks another in a series of killings targeting performers of this genre, with police reporting two men on a motorcycle opened fire. The article notes that Mexican criminal groups often pay musicians to compose such songs, and singers can become entangled in turf wars, with Barajas reportedly having received past threats.</p>

          <p>The Texas House of Representatives has reconvened and is poised to advance a controversial Republican redistricting plan, House Bill 4, after Democrats returned following a two-week quorum break. Governor Greg Abbott called a second special session to push through priority items, including this redistricting bill, which aims to secure more Republican seats. The bill has already cleared a House committee and is on the Senate agenda. Democrats protested police escorts upon their return, highlighting the intense partisan struggle over legislative priorities, which also include disaster relief, property tax relief, and abortion restrictions.</p>

          <p>Small, four-wheeled robots are transforming the construction of solar farms by automating meticulous surveying and marking tasks. Developed by California-based Civ Robotics, the CivDot machine can mark up to 3,000 layout points daily with high accuracy, navigating rugged terrain and adverse weather. This technology significantly reduces the need for manual labor, saving both time and money for renewable energy companies like Bechtel Corporation, which reports a quadrupling of daily pile marks. The innovation is seen as a key factor in making solar farm development more efficient, even with reduced government support for renewable projects.</p>

          <p>Reverse mortgages, which allow homeowners 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, have strict eligibility criteria. Common disqualifying factors include not meeting age requirements, especially for younger spouses, which can reduce loan amounts. Insufficient home equity (less than 50%) or existing mortgage balances that cannot be fully covered by the reverse mortgage proceeds also pose hurdles. Additionally, homes must meet FHA property standards, and severe financial events like unresolved bankruptcies or federal debt can lead to denial, alongside mandatory counseling requirements.</p>

          <p>Six individuals, including prominent rhino breeder John Hume, have been arrested in South Africa in connection with an international rhino horn trafficking network. The arrests follow a seven-year investigation into the smuggling of 964 horns valued at $14.1 million to illegal markets in Southeast Asia. The suspects face charges of fraud, theft, and violating national biodiversity law, as South African law permits domestic horn trading but bans export due to an international prohibition. Conservation groups praised the arrests, emphasizing their importance in disrupting organized crime and protecting the endangered rhino population from poaching.</p>

          <p>MSNBC host Joe Scarborough criticized both the Republican Party and California Governor Gavin Newsom, urging Democrats to shift focus from cultural issues to affordability. Scarborough argued Republicans distract from economic struggles by emphasizing topics like immigration, while Americans face difficulties with healthcare and housing costs. He also criticized Newsom for trying to "own" former President Trump and acting "Trump-like" instead of addressing affordability. Scarborough highlighted Newsom's countermeasure to Texas's redistricting plan and his press office's Trump-mimicking social media posts.</p>

          <p>A non-binary park ranger and biologist, Shannon “SJ” Joslin, was fired from Yosemite National Park after hanging a 66-foot transgender pride flag from El Capitan. Joslin stated the act was a response to current administration policies targeting trans people, aiming to signal safety in national parks. Park officials cited "failing to demonstrate acceptable conduct" and are pursuing action against other employees and visitors involved. This incident occurred shortly before a new rule was signed prohibiting large banners in wilderness areas, and raises concerns about federal workers' freedom of expression under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Over 750 current and former federal health employees have accused Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of fueling harassment and violence against government healthcare staff. In a letter, they linked his rhetoric, including questioning vaccine safety and firing CDC staff, to an August 8 attack at CDC headquarters where a gunman, blaming a Covid-19 vaccine, killed a police officer. The workers urged Kennedy to publicly disavow misleading claims about vaccines and ensure a safe environment for HHS staff.

          <p>The UK government is preparing to take control of Speciality Steels UK (SSUK), the country's third-largest steelworks owned by Liberty Steel, to protect 1,500 jobs. The plant faces potential liquidation due to mounting unpaid debts, especially after its main lender collapsed. SSUK is crucial as it houses the UK's only working electric arc furnaces, vital for the industry's energy transition. While the government previously resisted direct support for Liberty's owner, it now faces the "unappealing choice" of intervention to prevent the plant's closure, mirroring a past nationalization of British Steel.</p>

Suleyman emphasized the need for better "guardrails" and for companies not to promote AI consciousness.

The lawsuit, filed by diverse families, argued the measure infringed on parental rights and forced religious mandates.
