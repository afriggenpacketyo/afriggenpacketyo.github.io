            <p>Tyler Glasnow, the Dodgers' starting pitcher, left Sunday's game against the Texas Rangers in the fifth inning due to lower leg cramping, raising concerns given his injury history. Glasnow had been performing well, striking out the side in the fourth inning, but his discomfort was evident as his fastball velocity decreased. While the diagnosis suggests the issue isn't serious, the Dodgers are already dealing with injuries to other key players like Blake Snell and Blake Treinen. The team is assessing Glasnow's condition, hoping he won't miss significant time, as his health is crucial for their playoff aspirations.</p>

            <p>Jose Hermosillo, a 19-year-old US citizen, was wrongfully arrested and detained by border patrol agents in Arizona for nearly 10 days, despite claiming his citizenship. Border patrol officials initially alleged that Hermosillo admitted to entering the US illegally from Mexico. His family provided his birth certificate and social security card, but officials were initially disbelieving. This incident highlights concerns about wrongful detentions of US citizens by immigration officials, a problem that has persisted across multiple presidential administrations, with hundreds of citizens being wrongly arrested and even deported.</p>

            <p>Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of breaking a 30-hour "Easter truce" announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky claimed Russian troops had violated the ceasefire "more than 2,000 times" since the start of Sunday, while Russia's defence ministry said it had "repelled" assaults by Ukraine and accused Kyiv of launching hundreds of drones and shells. The BBC has not independently verified claims by the warring sides. The truce was set to expire at 22:00 BST (00:00 Moscow time) on Sunday.</p>
