          <p>Varda Space Industries has successfully raised $187 million in a Series C funding round to advance its mission of manufacturing pharmaceuticals in orbit. The company aims to leverage the unique microgravity environment of space, which allows for the creation of drug crystals that are difficult to produce on Earth. This new capital will support the expansion of Varda's operations, including increasing its flight cadence and building out a new lab in California. Having already completed three space launches and with a fourth in orbit, Varda is the first company to process materials beyond the International Space Station.</p>

          <p>Wedbush analyst Dan Ives forecasts that Microsoft is poised to become the next company to achieve a $4 trillion market capitalization, potentially as early as this summer. The prediction is driven by accelerating large-scale artificial intelligence deals and strong growth in the company's cloud services. Ives raised the 12-month price target for Microsoft to $600 per share, suggesting the stock has yet to fully price in its future growth potential in the AI and cloud sectors. This optimistic outlook positions Microsoft to follow Nvidia in reaching this significant financial milestone. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official testified in federal court that the agency has not determined where it would send Kilmar Abrego Garcia if he were released from pretrial detention. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was erroneously deported in March, is currently detained in Tennessee on criminal charges from a 2019 traffic stop. His attorneys are concerned he could be removed to a third country without due process, a fear the presiding judge has echoed. The government has offered a stipulation to follow due process but has not provided concrete plans, frustrating the court.</p>

          <p>The White House has intensified its criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, with the Office of Management and Budget accusing him of mismanaging the central bank. OMB Director Russell Vought alleged that a renovation of the Fed's headquarters is significantly over budget, now costing $2.5 billion, and claimed Powell may have misled Congress about the project's luxurious features. This new line of attack focuses on Powell's administrative oversight, adding to President Trump's previous complaints about interest rate policy. The move raises questions about whether the administration will seek to remove Powell for cause, a legally complex proposition.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's proposal to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods threatens to drive up the cost of coffee in the United States. Brazil is the largest supplier of green coffee beans to the U.S., and such a significant duty would likely force roasters like Starbucks and J.M. Smucker to pass the increased costs on to consumers. This comes after years of already-rising coffee prices due to inflation and weather-related supply issues. While the White House is reportedly considering exemptions for commodities that cannot be grown in the U.S., the potential tariff adds significant uncertainty for the coffee industry.

          <p>A White House request to rescind $1.1 billion in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is facing resistance from some Senate Republicans. Lawmakers from rural states like South Dakota, Montana, and Alaska are concerned that the cuts would devastate local radio and television stations that serve as the sole source of news and emergency alerts for many communities, including Native American tribes. The recent deadly flash floods in Texas have heightened these concerns about maintaining robust emergency communication systems. While the House approved the cuts, the Senate is considering amendments to protect these vital rural services before a July 18 deadline.</p>

          <p>The federal tax credits for electric vehicles, worth up to $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used EVs, are set to expire on September 30, a move expected to trigger a surge in consumer purchases this summer. The credits, part of the Inflation Reduction Act, were eliminated by President Trump's recent legislative package. Automakers like Tesla are already urging customers to buy soon to take advantage of the disappearing incentive.

          <p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve's June meeting show that officials are grappling with significant economic uncertainty, largely driven by President Trump's tariff policies. The word "uncertainty" appeared 28 times in the document, as policymakers expressed concern about potential stagflation and the impact of tariffs on lower-income households. This cautious "wait-and-see" approach contrasts sharply with President Trump's public calls for a three-percentage-point rate cut and his repeated criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The minutes suggest the Fed is in no hurry to lower rates while the economic outlook remains so unclear. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of Latin American migrants are undertaking the dangerous journey back to their home countries after giving up on making a life in the United States. This "reverse migration" is driven by the Trump administration's aggressive deportation push, which has created a climate of fear and hopelessness. The administration has ended programs like humanitarian parole, transforming legally present individuals into targets for deportation overnight. Consequently, a once-unthinkable trend has emerged, with many migrants who braved the treacherous Darién Gap to reach the U.S. now making the same perilous journey in the opposite direction.</p>

The removal of a key tax exemption has hurt their price advantage, but their highly flexible, low-cost business models could prove resilient. As tariffs increase prices on goods from all manufacturers, budget-conscious consumers may increasingly turn to these cheaper alternatives, even with the added duties. This dynamic could create an unintended consequence where the trade policies designed to weaken these Amazon rivals instead solidify their position in the U.S. market. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposal would allow a bank to still be considered well-managed even if it has one "deficient" rating across criteria like capital, liquidity, and governance. This status is crucial as it permits banks to engage in certain activities, such as acquisitions. The proposal has created a division among Fed officials, with Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman supporting it as pragmatic, while her predecessor Michael Barr warned it would introduce greater risk to the banking system.

          <p>President Donald Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazil is being widely interpreted as a political maneuver to support his ally, former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro. Trump's justification included criticism of a "witch hunt" against Bolsonaro, who is facing prosecution over an alleged coup attempt. The move could energize Bolsonaro's base but may also backfire by harming Brazilian industries, like agribusiness, that are politically aligned with him. The tariff threat could also create a rally-around-the-flag effect for current President Lula da Silva, who is struggling with low approval ratings, by framing the issue as an attack on Brazil's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Annuities can serve as a powerful tool to supplement Social Security and create a more secure retirement. By providing a guaranteed income stream, an annuity can allow a retiree to delay claiming Social Security benefits, which increases the eventual monthly payout by about 8% for each year of delay past full retirement age. This strategy creates a higher lifetime income. Furthermore, annuity payments can fill the financial gaps left by Social Security, covering essential expenses and helping to manage taxes on retirement income by offering more control over annual taxable distributions.
