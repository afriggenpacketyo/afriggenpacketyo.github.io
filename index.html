          <h2>Fatal Mass Shooting in Philadelphia's Grays Ferry Neighborhood Leaves Three Dead and Nine Injured</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 09:20:39 EDT</div>

          <p>A mass shooting in Philadelphia's Grays Ferry neighborhood tragically left three people dead and nine others injured, including two juveniles, early Monday morning. Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel reported the incident occurred after officers, already monitoring the area due to prior disturbances, heard gunfire while responding to a nearby call. Investigators recovered dozens of shell casings and took one person into custody, though their role remains unclear. This event marks a grim continuation of a violent Fourth of July weekend in the city, which also saw six homicides and numerous shootings. The victims' ages ranged from 15 to 24, with some suffering critical head wounds, underscoring the severe impact on the community.</p>

          <h2>Johns Hopkins Students Develop Braille Printer for Brewery Labels, Enhancing Accessibility</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 09:17:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Engineering students at Johns Hopkins University have innovated a specialized printer for a Maryland brewery, designed to add braille writing to beer labels. This project, a collaboration with Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), addresses a significant accessibility need by creating a machine capable of punching braille onto plastic labels, a task commercial printers cannot easily perform. The students prioritized user-friendliness, developing open hardware and software that integrates with BISM's existing systems, empowering employees with low or no vision. This invention not only streamlines the labeling process but also supports an annual fundraiser for individuals with vision loss, demonstrating practical application of engineering for social good.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former US President Donald Trump has announced a new threat of an additional 10% tariff on nations aligning with what he terms the "Anti-American policies" of the BRICS alliance. This declaration follows BRICS finance ministers' criticism of US tariff policies and proposals for IMF reforms. The original July 9th deadline for trade deals has been extended to August 1st, creating continued uncertainty for international trading partners like the European Union, which is actively negotiating to avoid these duties. Trump's stance reiterates his protectionist trade agenda, previously including a threat of 100% tariffs if BRICS developed a rival currency (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Doris Garcia, a 96-year-old Coloradan, realized a lifelong dream of meeting penguins, 70 years after being denied an Antarctica research trip solely because of her gender. In the 1950s, Garcia, a George Washington University mathematics graduate working for the US government in Argentina, was on the boat for the expedition when she was told she couldn't go. Compassionate Hospice and the Denver Zoo Conservation Alliance collaborated to arrange a special, behind-the-scenes encounter with African penguins at the zoo. This heartwarming event brought immense joy to Garcia, fulfilling a long-held aspiration.</p>

          <p>The jury in the retrial of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon has retired to consider its verdicts on charges of manslaughter by gross negligence and causing or allowing the death of their newborn baby, Victoria. The couple, who deny the charges, became subjects of a police manhunt in 2023 after their car caught fire and a placenta was found, leading to the discovery of their baby's body in a shopping bag. Marten testified that Victoria died after she slumped over her in a tent. The prosecution alleges the baby succumbed to cold, damp conditions due to inadequate care.</p>

          <p>An autopsy report has confirmed that Juliana Marins, a 26-year-old Brazilian tourist, died from severe internal bleeding and bone fractures within 20 minutes after falling 600 meters into Indonesia's Mount Rinjani volcano. Marins had slipped during a group trek, surviving the initial fall and calling for help, but challenging conditions like fog and unstable terrain hampered rescue efforts. Her body was located three days later using a thermal drone. Her family has publicly criticized the rescue team's speed, arguing she could have been saved, while Indonesian officials have explained the significant logistical difficulties faced during the operation.</p>

          <p>British teenager Marcus Fakana, aged 19, has been released from a Dubai jail and returned to the UK after receiving a royal pardon. Fakana was sentenced to a year's imprisonment for a consensual relationship with a 17-year-old British girl, which is illegal in the UAE where the age of consent is 18. The girl's mother reported him to authorities. The campaign group Detained in Dubai highlighted the strictness of UAE laws for tourists, noting that Fakana was unaware of the girl's age. This case serves as a warning about differing legal standards for visitors abroad.</p>

The article also points to the sale of "Alligator Alcatraz"-themed merchandise as a cynical exploitation of migrant suffering, linking it to previous stunts by Governor Ron DeSantis.

          <p>This article uncovers the decades-long struggle for recognition faced by Janet Bennett, the 96-year-old designer of the iconic mosaic murals at Los Angeles International Airport. Completed in 1961, these colorful installations have been mistakenly attributed to others, with LAX still refusing official credit due to old records. In a heartwarming turn, the Los Angeles Dodgers reached out to Bennett, whose work inspired a new tile wall at Dodger Stadium, and have explicitly credited her for the design. This act of recognition by the Dodgers highlights the artist's overlooked legacy, contrasting sharply with the airport's continued silence.</p>

          <p>This article critically examines the Medicaid work requirement within the Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill," arguing it is a burdensome "work-reporting requirement" designed to "annoy people to death." The author contends that this policy will not spur employment but instead impose billions in costs and cause millions of low-income Americans to lose health coverage due to bureaucratic red tape and faulty systems. Citing data that most Medicaid recipients are already working or have valid reasons for not doing so, the article asserts that the requirement primarily serves to weed out eligible participants rather than motivate non-compliant ones, leading to unnecessary suffering and even death.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying efforts to strip naturalized US citizens of their citizenship through denaturalization proceedings, a move critics argue is a tool of political repression echoing the Red Scare era. While ostensibly targeting individuals deemed national security risks or those with misrepresentations on their applications, the policy raises significant due process concerns by pursuing cases in civil court, where individuals lack the right to an attorney. Legal scholars like Amanda Frost warn this push aims to target dissenting speech and chill all naturalized citizens.

          <p>International LGBTQ+ travelers are increasingly reconsidering trips to the United States, citing concerns over rising anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and policies under the Trump administration, alongside ongoing trade tensions. Data from the LGBTQ+ travel platform misterb&b indicates a decline in US bookings from Canada and Europe, with travelers opting for "blue states" or other countries as a form of activism. Organizations like Egale Canada are advising members against US travel due to safety concerns and perceived "economic warfare." This trend impacts the significant LGBTQ+ travel market, valued at over $1.4 trillion, despite some US Pride celebrations still reporting strong attendance.</p>

          <p>Russia launched over 100 drones at civilian areas across Ukraine, resulting in 10 deaths and 38 injuries, as part of intensified airstrikes that included thousands of drones, missiles, and glide bombs over the past week. Ukraine is urgently seeking more military aid and boosting its own drone production to counter these attacks. Meanwhile, the Kremlin dismissed Transport Minister Roman Starovoyt following widespread travel chaos in Russia, where hundreds of flights were grounded over the weekend due to Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian regions. This development highlights the ongoing severe impact of the conflict on both nations.</p>
