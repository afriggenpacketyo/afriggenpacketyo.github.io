          <p>President Donald Trump has directly appealed to Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop the bombing campaign in Ukraine after a deadly attack on Kyiv. Trump's appeal comes as he pushes for a peace deal, reportedly on terms favorable to Russia. Meanwhile, a federal judge has blocked Trump's attempts to change voting requirements, which advocates say would disenfranchise millions. The judge's decision is the latest legal setback for the Trump administration.</p>

          <h2>Alphabet Expects Ad Business Headwind Due to Trade Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 19:50:49 EDT</div>

          <p>Alphabet executives anticipate a "slight headwind" to their advertising business this year due to President Trump's trade policies. The company, while reporting strong revenue, faces concerns about how tariffs will affect the economy and business spending. Google's chief business officer mentioned that the changes to the de minimis exemption will cause a headwind to their ads business, particularly from APAC-based retailers. This may lead to cuts in spending on technical infrastructure like data centers. (not investment advice)</p>
