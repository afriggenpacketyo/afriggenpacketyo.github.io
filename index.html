          <p>Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates discussed President Trump's foreign policy, particularly in the Middle East, noting both opportunities and challenges. Gates highlighted the weakened state of Iran due to Israeli attacks and the potential for a nuclear deal, emphasizing that Iran must cease all enrichment activities. He also addressed the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict, suggesting that while cutting off military supplies to Israel would be difficult politically, pressure should be applied to end the war in Gaza. Gates further commented on the situation in Ukraine, expressing skepticism about Putin's intentions and advising President Trump to leverage pressure in any potential meetings.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to the bone. The diagnosis was made after Biden reported urinary symptoms, leading doctors to discover a nodule on his prostate. While the cancer is characterized as aggressive, it is reportedly hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. Biden and his family are currently reviewing treatment options with his physicians, and further updates are expected as the situation develops.</p>

          <p>Rafal Trzaskowski, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, has emerged as the frontrunner in the first round of Poland's presidential election, though falling short of a majority.

The election is viewed as a crucial test of Tusk's ability to reverse hard-right policies implemented by the previous administration. The outcome will significantly impact Tusk's agenda, given the presidency's veto powers, as he seeks to restore judicial independence, media pluralism, and civil rights.</p>

          <p>New York City and federal officials have launched an investigation into the fatal crash of a Mexican tall ship into the Brooklyn Bridge, which killed two people and injured at least 19 others. The National Transportation Safety Board has dispatched a team to investigate, while local agencies are restricting access to Pier 36, where the ship was moved. Senator Charles Schumer is questioning whether cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency may have contributed to the incident, particularly regarding staffing and functionality of the Coast Guard's vehicle traffic service.</p>

Trump has defended the gift, stating it is for the U.S. and not for personal use, but critics remain skeptical.</p>
