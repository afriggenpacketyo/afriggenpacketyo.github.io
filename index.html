          <p>A federal judge has lifted a stop-work order imposed by the Trump administration, allowing Danish company Orsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind project. The offshore wind farm, located off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut, was over 80% complete when the Interior Department halted its progress. Orsted successfully argued that the order was arbitrary and unlawful. This ruling represents a significant development for the U.S. offshore wind industry and a setback for the administration's efforts to curtail it.</p>

The network indefinitely pulled the show after its host, Jimmy Kimmel, made controversial comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, drawing pressure from the Trump administration and the FCC. Mamdani stated his withdrawal is a response to corporate leaders prioritizing their bottom line over press freedom, a sentiment echoed by the ACLU and numerous Hollywood figures who have voiced support for Kimmel.</p>

This monumental partnership deepens the symbiotic relationship between the two AI giants, with Nvidia's stock surging nearly 4% following the announcement. The investment will be deployed progressively as the infrastructure is built, starting in the second half of 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Anheuser-Busch's Michelob Ultra has become the best-selling beer in the U.S., overtaking Modelo Especial, according to new sales data. This shift marks a significant comeback for AB InBev, whose Bud Light brand lost the top spot two years ago following a controversial marketing partnership. Modelo's decline is attributed to challenges faced by its parent company, Constellation Brands, including tariffs and reduced spending among its core Hispanic consumer base. The change in market leadership reflects evolving consumer preferences and the lingering impact of brand controversies in the beverage industry.</p>

          <p>A violent clash between rival gangs at a prison in Machala, Ecuador, has resulted in the deaths of 13 inmates and one guard, with 14 others injured. The riot involved gunfire and explosives, allowing an unconfirmed number of prisoners to escape, though 13 have since been recaptured. This incident is the latest in a series of deadly conflicts within Ecuador's overcrowded and gang-controlled penitentiary system, which has been under military control since January 2024. The violence highlights the nation's ongoing struggle with powerful drug trafficking organizations and systemic instability.</p>

          <p>Thousands of people participated in a nationwide strike across Italy to show solidarity with Palestinians, leading to clashes, particularly in Milan where around 60 police officers were injured. The protests, coordinated by trade unions, caused widespread disruption to public transport and ports. The events occurred as France, alongside the UK, Canada, and Australia, formally recognized a Palestinian state, a move Italy and Germany have not yet followed. This highlights growing public pressure and political division within Europe regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

His view, which places the ideal federal funds rate in the low-2% range, is a significant departure from the more cautious consensus among his colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.

Investors are flocking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset during periods of financial uncertainty and in anticipation of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. Experts suggest that investors seeking exposure to gold should consider exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track its price, as they offer a more liquid and cost-effective option than owning physical bullion.

          <p>Google is set to begin its second antitrust trial against the U.S. Department of Justice, focusing on the company's dominance in the digital advertising market. The case follows a federal judge's prior ruling that parts of Google's ad technology constitute an illegal monopoly that harms online publishers. This new phase of the trial will determine the remedy, with the Justice Department advocating for Google to be forced to sell off parts of its ad-tech business to restore competition. Google argues that such a move would be disruptive and that recent market changes, including the rise of AI, make it unnecessary.</p>

          <p>As part of a deal to avoid a U.S. ban, TikTok's powerful content recommendation algorithm will be copied and re-trained exclusively using American user data. A new U.S.-based joint venture, involving investors like Oracle and Silver Lake, will operate the app, with Oracle also serving as the security provider auditing the source code and system. This arrangement is a key component of the White House's plan to address national security concerns related to the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The deal aims to isolate U.S. operations and data while allowing the popular app to continue serving its 170 million American users.</p>

          <p>Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has issued a pardon for Alaa Abdel Fattah, a high-profile British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist who has been imprisoned for six years. Abdel Fattah, a leading figure in the 2011 uprising, was serving a five-year sentence for "spreading false news." His case had drawn significant international attention and condemnation from human rights groups, with his mother recently ending a nine-month hunger strike to advocate for his release. The pardon was welcomed by his family and human rights organizations, who hope it signals a broader shift in the country's approach to political prisoners.</p>

          <p>Moldova is heading into a crucial general election that is seen as a referendum on the nation's future geopolitical alignment, pitting President Maia Sandu's pro-European party against several pro-Russian rivals. The campaign is dominated by the choice between closer integration with the European Union, which granted Moldova candidate status in 2022, and renewing ties with Moscow. The ongoing war in neighboring Ukraine, high inflation, and the presence of Russian troops in the breakaway region of Transnistria have intensified the stakes, with many voters fearing for the country's economic stability and security.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has dramatically increased the cost for companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers by imposing a new $100,000 fee for each H-1B visa application. This one-time payment is a substantial hike from the previous fees, which ranged from $2,000 to $5,000. The change applies only to new applicants, not renewals, and is intended to impact the upcoming visa lottery cycle. The H-1B program is heavily utilized by the technology and finance sectors to fill specialized roles, with a large percentage of visas going to professionals from India and China.</p>

          <p>On CNBC's "Morning Meeting," Jim Cramer advised investors to view recent weakness in Boeing's stock as a buying opportunity to build a position in the aerospace giant. He also expressed continued optimism for two other industrial companies, DuPont and Honeywell, citing their planned business spinoffs as a catalyst for future growth. Cramer noted that both companies are performing well and that such corporate separations have historically been successful for shareholders. His commentary comes as the broader market takes a pause after reaching record highs, driven largely by megacap technology stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Trump administration prepares to assert a causal link between the painkiller Tylenol and autism, the scientific consensus remains that the condition has complex, polygenetic origins. Experts emphasize that hundreds of gene variants and potential environmental factors contribute to autism, making it highly unrealistic to blame a single medication. The rising number of autism diagnoses is largely attributed to increased awareness and broader diagnostic criteria, not a single external cause. The long-debunked theory linking vaccines to autism serves as a cautionary tale against simplistic explanations for complex neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

          <p>The memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk offered a potential glimpse into the future of the MAGA movement, mixing elements of a Christian revival with a political rally. The event highlighted a contrast between two possible paths: one of forgiveness, embodied by Kirk's widow, Erika, and one of retribution, voiced by Donald Trump, who declared he hates his opponents. The service's strong evangelical theme suggests a desire to place Christianity more centrally in American political life, while also serving as an early platform for potential 2028 Republican presidential contenders like J.D. Vance and Marco Rubio.</p>

          <p>The price of the meme cryptocurrency Dogecoin fell by over 8% in a recent 24-hour period, mirroring a downturn across the broader crypto market. The sell-off appears to be linked to significant forced liquidations of long positions, with over $1 billion in Bitcoin long positions reportedly wiped out. According to market analysts, these large-scale liquidations have become a recurring trend during low-liquidity Sunday night trading sessions. The volatility follows the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, which some investors interpreted with a hawkish tone, potentially dampening sentiment for risk assets like cryptocurrencies.
