          <p>President Trump has abruptly terminated all trade negotiations with Canada, citing an advertisement sponsored by the province of Ontario. The ad features a 1987 speech by former President Ronald Reagan criticizing protectionist tariffs, which Trump labeled as "FAKE" and misleading. The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation also criticized the ad for misrepresenting the former president's remarks, which were originally made while he was defending his own administration's decision to impose tariffs on certain goods from Japan.</p>

          <p>A detailed comparison reveals that the Canadian ad causing a trade dispute with the U.S. used authentic quotes from Ronald Reagan's 1987 speech but altered their original context and order. While Reagan did express a strong preference for free trade and warned against the long-term harm of tariffs, the ad omitted the fact that he was simultaneously justifying his administration's imposition of tariffs on Japanese goods. The editing presented Reagan's anti-tariff sentiments without the specific nuances of the situation he was addressing at the time.</p>

          <p>Construction crews have completely demolished the historic East Wing of the White House to make way for President Trump's planned $300 million ballroom. The demolition contradicts Trump's previous assurances that the existing structure would remain untouched and has proceeded without the required public review from the National Capital Planning Commission, sparking outrage from historians. Senior administration officials have indicated that the new venue will likely be named "The President Donald J. Trump Ballroom," funded by private donors including major tech companies.</p>

          <p>Zhi Dong Zhang, a Chinese citizen known as "Brother Wang" and accused of being a major fentanyl trafficker, has been extradited from Cuba to the United States. Zhang allegedly ran a vast international drug trafficking and money laundering operation, working closely with Mexico's Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels to import fentanyl into the U.S. His capture and transfer, facilitated by Mexico, represent a significant development in the U.S. crackdown on the global fentanyl supply chain, which the Trump administration has made a top priority.</p>

          <p>A coalition of over 20 nations has pledged to eliminate Russian oil and gas from the global market to cut off funding for President Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine. The announcement came after a summit in London, where leaders also committed to strengthening Ukraine's air defenses against ongoing Russian attacks. Despite these economic and military support measures, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's request for long-range missiles to strike targets deep inside Russia has not yet been granted by key allies like the United States.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 15:06:05 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior administration officials have indicated that President Donald Trump is expected to name the new, controversial White House ballroom after himself. The venue, which is being built on the site of the recently demolished East Wing, is already being referred to internally as "The President Donald J. Trump Ballroom." This branding is consistent with Trump's lifelong practice of putting his name on his construction projects, and the project's funding has reportedly exceeded its $300 million goal through private donations.</p>

          <p>A judge has ordered the permanent closure of the S&W Atlas Iron & Metal recycling facility in Watts and imposed $2 million in penalties for its hazardous operations next to Jordan High School. For years, the facility caused explosions, coated the campus in toxic dust, and pelted it with shrapnel, leading to criminal charges against its owners. The ruling provides a long-awaited victory for the community and requires the company to pay restitution to the school district and conduct a full environmental cleanup of the contaminated site.</p>

          <p>The UK's director of public prosecutions revealed that a high-profile espionage case collapsed because a senior national security official was unwilling to testify that China was officially considered an "enemy" of the state. To secure a conviction under the Official Secrets Act, prosecutors needed to prove that the UK government viewed China as hostile during the period of the alleged spying (2021-2023). The Deputy National Security Adviser's refusal to make this classification in court was deemed "fatal to the case," highlighting diplomatic complexities.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index indicated that inflation rose at a 3% annual rate in September, a figure slightly below economists' predictions. This data is crucial as it influences the Social Security Administration's annual cost-of-living adjustment. While the impact of President Trump's tariffs has contributed to some upward price pressure, the overall rate remains far below its 2022 peak. The slightly cooler-than-expected inflation, combined with a slowing labor market, may provide the Federal Reserve with additional justification to consider another interest rate cut.

The case gained political significance because Benkired, an Algerian immigrant, was under a deportation order at the time of the murder, leading to criticism from right-wing politicians about immigration policy.</p>
