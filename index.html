          <p>Pop singer Charli XCX has officially confirmed her marriage to George Daniel, the drummer for the band The 1975. Speculation began after a passerby filmed the couple outside Hackney Town Hall in London. The singer later verified the news through a series of lighthearted social media posts, celebrating the occasion with her new husband. The marriage follows the massive success of her recent album "Brat" and a headline performance at Glastonbury. The couple has been public about their relationship for years and collaborated on several musical projects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Milwaukee Brewers 8-7, marking their ninth defeat in the last eleven games. Despite a late-game rally that included back-to-back home runs, the Dodgers' offense couldn't overcome an early deficit and inconsistent pitching. Shohei Ohtani contributed three RBIs, but the team squandered key opportunities to take the lead, particularly in the third inning. The loss secures another series defeat against the Brewers, highlighting the team's ongoing struggles to find consistent momentum this season.</p>

          <p>Deadly sectarian clashes between Druze and Bedouin groups persist in southern Syria, particularly in the Suweida province, despite a ceasefire declared by the interim president. Over 900 people have reportedly been killed in the past week, with government forces accused of participating in attacks on the Druze community. The violence, which erupted after a merchant's abduction, has prompted international concern, with the U.S. demanding an end to the atrocities. Israel has also intervened militarily to support the Druze, adding another layer of complexity to the escalating regional conflict.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have significantly lowered the number of individuals listed as missing following the devastating floods earlier this month. Through extensive follow-up work by local and state agencies, the count has dropped from nearly 100 to just three. Initially, over 160 people were unaccounted for in the county. While this represents a major relief, the overall death toll from the statewide flooding stands at 134, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County alone, underscoring the tragedy's severe impact on the community.</p>

          <p>Recent congressional cuts to federal funding for public media are disproportionately impacting small, rural radio stations that provide essential local news and information. Allegheny Mountain Radio, a cooperative serving remote areas in West Virginia and Virginia, relies on this funding for up to 65% of its budget and now faces potential staff cuts or closure. These stations often serve as the primary source of daily information, from emergency alerts to community news, in regions with limited internet and cell service. The cuts, intended to target perceived political bias in national networks, are hitting vital community lifelines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the persistent failure to achieve peace in conflicts like those in Gaza and Ukraine stems from a deep-seated global crisis of moral relativism. The author argues that without a shared, universal moral order, justifications for violence become permissible, and atrocities continue unchecked. The piece criticizes the lack of impartial mediators and the fracturing of ethical standards, which mirrors the collapse of the international rules-based system. It concludes that a collective recommitment to universal ethical principles, as defined by international law and social contracts, is imperative for resolving conflicts.</p>

Investigators then used DNA evidence from the crime scene to identify George Burch, a man with no known connection to the victim.

The provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if visitors comply with their visa conditions, such as not overstaying.
