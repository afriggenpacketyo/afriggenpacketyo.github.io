        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's chief negotiator is heading to the United States for another round of tariff negotiations, reiterating that the 25 percent additional auto tariffs imposed by Washington remain unacceptable. Ryosei Akazawa, minister in charge of economic and fiscal policy, hopes to convince the United States to review the duty, especially as the 90-day pause on part of the reciprocal tariffs imposed on Japan and other countries expires on July 9. Meanwhile, Tokyo stocks climbed, with the Nikkei index ending at a five-month high, boosted by semiconductor-related shares amid hopes for robust demand for artificial intelligence. Japan is hoping to come to an agreement to avoid the tariffs. </p>

          <h2>US Economy Contracts More Than Expected in First Quarter Due to Tariff-Induced Import Surge (not investment advice)</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-26 09:59:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US economy contracted more than previously estimated in the first three months of the year, with real gross domestic product falling by 0.5%, according to the Commerce Department. This decline primarily reflects downward revisions to consumer spending and exports, which were partly affected by a downward revision to imports. The data came after an import surge triggered by former US President Donald Trump's tariffs, resulting in businesses stockpiling goods ahead of the tariffs, especially goods from China. While the import influx is not likely to be repeated in the second quarter, uncertainty remains as the July deadline for higher tariffs approaches, adding pressure to the economy. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has described the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites as a "historically successful attack," while criticizing media coverage as overly focused on discrediting President Trump. Hegseth condemned the leak of a preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency report that downplayed the damage, asserting that the Iranian program was "totally obliterated." CIA Director John Ratcliffe stated Iran's nuclear program has been "severely damaged" and any attempt to rebuild it would take years, while the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, confirmed the strikes went according to plan. Hegseth accused several news organizations of irresponsible reporting. </p>

          <p>Two Metropolitan Police officers have been found to have committed gross misconduct for the "humiliating" strip-search of a 15-year-old black schoolgirl, known as Child Q, at her school in Hackney, east London, in 2020. The panel deemed the search unjustified, inappropriate, disproportionate, humiliating, and degrading, and noted that Child Q's position as a vulnerable child was not adequately considered. The officers failed to get authorization at sergeant level or higher before they took action, going against police policy, and no adequate concern was given to Child Q's age and sex, especially after she removed her sanitary towel. The Met Police acknowledged organizational failings in the search, stating that training to officers around strip-search was inadequate. </p>

          <p>A majority of CFOs surveyed by CNBC believe that significant changes will be made to President Trump's tax cut bill, but it will ultimately become law, with corporate tax breaks temporarily made law by Trump's 2017 tax act expected to remain in place. Despite concerns about the deficit, CFOs anticipate the corporate tax cuts will be extended, providing certainty for businesses amid expected economic headwinds from tariffs. The survey also revealed that CFOs expect bond yields to remain elevated, inflation to remain above the Fed's target, and a potential recession in the near future. The CFOs are remaining optimistic about the cuts. </p>

The IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi stated that the strikes caused "very significant physical damage" to key Iranian nuclear sites, expressing concern over Iran's decision to halt cooperation with the agency.

This pattern extends beyond Pixar to other animation studios and live-action films, with studios increasingly relying on familiar franchises. Experts attribute this trend to heightened competition, changing consumer habits, and studios' desire to deliver films audiences are already familiar with.

          <p>The Trump Organization has removed the claim that its recently revealed T1 smartphone would be made in the U.S., amid doubts about the feasibility of manufacturing such a device domestically at its price point. While a spokesperson maintained the handset would be made in the U.S., the website now states the phone has "American-Proud Design" and is "brought to life right here in the USA." Experts previously suggested the phone would likely be made in China due to the lack of an advanced supply chain in the U.S. The website has also been updated to reflect changes in the phone's features and specs. </p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed Lyn Redwood, an anti-vaccine advocate and former president of Children's Health Defense, to a position at HHS. Redwood has long believed that mercury exposure through thimerosal-containing vaccines causes autism, a claim refuted by decades of research. Her appointment has raised concerns among health experts, with one expert stating that Redwood is well-known for spreading vaccine misinformation. Redwood is expected to deliver a presentation at the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting using a report on thimerosal that contains misleading information. </p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, in his first major interview since his upset victory in the Democratic partyâ€™s mayoral primary in New York, said his brand of campaigning and leftist political stances can translate to anywhere in the US. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, stunned many observers by beating Andrew Cuomo, delivering a devastating blow to the former New York governor who ran a centrist campaign backed by most of the party establishment. Mamdani told MSNBCâ€™s Jen Psaki that his populist campaign â€“ which focused on inequality and promised radical moves on rent, the price of food and free public transport â€“ could be deployed anywhere in the US as Democrats seek to combat Donald Trump and his Maga movement. He is now favored to win the mayoral election. </p>

          <p>Experts recommend considering supplemental life insurance to augment basic workplace policies, especially as financial obligations evolve. Supplemental policies can be obtained through employers or purchased privately, with advantages and disadvantages to both options. Term life insurance is generally recommended for its affordability and substantial coverage during high-need years. Major life events, such as starting a family, should prompt a reevaluation of life insurance coverage to ensure adequate protection. The article also discusses calculating life insurance needs based on factors like income replacement, debt coverage, and education funding. </p>

          <p>Family offices are increasingly allocating capital to alternative assets like real estate and venture capital, with a focus on private credit and infrastructure, according to a BlackRock survey. Nearly one-third of single-family offices plan to increase their allocations to private credit this year, while 30% intend to invest more in infrastructure. Liquidity is a key factor driving this shift, as the slowdown in exits means private equity investors have to wait longer for returns. Infrastructure investing offers a lower-risk appeal with private-equity-type returns, and it provides a way for family offices to invest in the artificial intelligence boom. </p>

However, Anthropic still faces a separate trial in December over allegations that it downloaded millions of pirated books, with court documents revealing employee concerns about the legality of using pirate sites.

          <p>Saving money can be a challenge in an economy with persistent inflation, but certificates of deposit (CDs) can help by offering higher returns than the current inflation rate. CD rates vary depending on the CD type, terms, and other details, with national averages for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year CDs being 2.02%, 1.71%, and 1.72% APY, respectively. Online banks often offer the most competitive CD rates due to lower overhead costs, and short-term CDs can be a good way to get a top rate. Laddering CDs is a practical approach to take advantage of high rates while saving for the long-term. </p>
