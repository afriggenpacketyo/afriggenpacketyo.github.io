          <p>James E. Ryan, the president of the University of Virginia since 2018, has resigned from his position following intense pressure from the Trump administration. The administration had reportedly demanded his removal as part of a Justice Department investigation into the university's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Ryan stated he chose not to fight the federal government to save his job, citing the potential negative impact on employees, researchers, and students. The White House affirmed its commitment to eliminating DEI practices, which it described as divisive and contrary to federal civil rights laws.</p>

          <p>Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral primary has exposed a significant rift within the Democratic party. Following his win, moderate Democrats and business leaders began strategizing on how to oppose him in the general election, with some considering backing an independent candidate. In contrast, progressive figures like former Mayor Bill de Blasio have dismissed concerns about Mamdani's platform being too radical, arguing the decisive victory legitimizes his positions. Mamdani has initiated outreach to the business community, signaling a commitment to engage with all stakeholders ahead of the November election.</p>

The pandasâ€”a 24-year-old female named Rauhin and her three offspringâ€”were sent to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. Their departure leaves just two giant pandas remaining in Japan, both located at Tokyo's Ueno Zoological Gardens, who are also scheduled to return by next February. The Wakayama-based zoo has had a successful joint breeding program with China since 1994, raising 17 cubs, the most outside of China.</p>

According to local officials, the attacker rammed a vehicle filled with explosives into the convoy. The blast also caused the collapse of roofs on two nearby houses, injuring several civilians, including children. A militant group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban, the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, has claimed responsibility for the deadly attack, which marks a continuation of escalating violence in the region bordering Afghanistan.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on President Trump's recent on-camera use of an expletive when discussing the conflict between Israel and Iran. The author suggests that while unconventional for a president, the moment came across as authentic and effectively conveyed a frustration shared by many observers. The piece argues that in an era of scripted political spin, judicious and genuine use of strong language can make politicians seem more human and trustworthy to the public. While not advocating for constant profanity, the author posits that such moments can cut through political noise and powerfully emphasize a message during critical times.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American consumers may face higher prices and potential shortages of fireworks for this year's Fourth of July celebrations due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods. The U.S. imports nearly all of its consumer and professional display fireworks from China, which were hit with significant tariffs this spring. Industry experts warn that these added costs will likely be passed on to consumers, resulting in "less bang for their bucks." The uncertainty surrounding future tariff rates is also complicating planning for the nation's 250th birthday celebrations in 2026, a year the industry anticipates will be huge for sales.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has deferred a decision on a pivotal Louisiana congressional redistricting case, scheduling it for re-argument in the next term. The case, which could significantly impact the Voting Rights Act of 1965, centers on whether a new map with a second majority-Black district constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. Legal experts are puzzled by the delay, speculating it may signal deep debate among the justices about the future of protections against racial discrimination in elections. This postponement leaves the current map in place for now but adds to the uncertainty surrounding the law's scope.</p>

          <p>Facing a surge in Russian airstrikes using modernized Shahed drones, Ukraine is intensifying its focus on developing and deploying interceptor drones as a key defensive strategy. These specialized drones are designed to be faster and more agile, capable of pursuing and destroying Russian drones that now fly at higher altitudes, evading traditional ground-based defenses. Experts and officials, including President Zelenskyy, highlight that interceptor drones offer a more cost-effective and efficient solution compared to expensive anti-aircraft missiles.

Among the bodies to be abolished are Healthwatch England, a patient advocacy group, and the National Guardian's Office, which supports whistleblowers.

          <p>A growing divide on energy policy is emerging within Germany's coalition government, particularly concerning the role of nuclear power. The issue was highlighted when Economy Minister Katherina Reiche, from the conservative CDU, attended a meeting of pro-nuclear EU states, drawing criticism from Environment Minister Carsten Schneider of the SPD. While Germany officially phased out its last nuclear plant in 2023, the Economy Ministry appears open to all low-emission technologies, aligning with France's nuclear-heavy strategy. This disagreement reflects deeper tensions over how Germany will balance its transition to renewables with energy security and climate goals.</p>

This existing infrastructure, which requires customer funds to be backed by central bank money, offers inherent stability. The analysis comes as Chinese state media encourages policymakers to remain competitive in the evolving landscape of digital finance. (not investment advice)</p>

While top pick Matthew Schaefer said the experience was still an honor, some GMs lamented the loss of the spontaneous, emotional moments that characterized the old, centralized draft. The Kings traded down in the first round to select defenseman Henry Brzustewicz, while the Ducks used their 10th overall pick on forward Roger McQueen.</p>
