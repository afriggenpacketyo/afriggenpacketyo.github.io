          <p>UK authorities have launched a major manhunt for Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, an asylum seeker who was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford. Kebatu had been sentenced to 12 months in prison for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and was scheduled for deportation following his sentence. An investigation into the erroneous release is underway, and a prison officer has been suspended from duties. The incident has drawn sharp criticism from officials, who are working with police to urgently locate the individual and ensure public safety.</p>

          <p>An anonymous ally of President Trump has donated $130 million to the Department of War to help pay U.S. service members' salaries amid the ongoing government shutdown. While the Pentagon has accepted the gift, its direct use for payroll is complicated by legal restrictions, as Congress holds the authority to appropriate funds for federal salaries. Experts suggest that legislative action would be required to bypass these limitations and allocate the donated money to troops. The White House has not identified the donor, stating the individual did not seek recognition for the contribution.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has officially endorsed Democratic assemblyman Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor, a significant show of party unity just before early voting begins. Jeffries' backing follows Mamdani's primary victory and consolidates support from key Democratic figures, including Governor Kathy Hochul and Senator Bernie Sanders. The endorsement comes after Mamdani's opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, received support from outgoing Mayor Eric Adams. Mamdani's campaign, focused on the city's affordability crisis, continues to build momentum with this crucial endorsement from a powerful party leader.</p>

          <p>A judge has ordered the permanent closure of the S&W Atlas Iron & Metal recycling facility in Watts, Los Angeles, and imposed a $2 million penalty on its owners for endangering the adjacent Jordan High School. For decades, the scrap yard's operations resulted in explosions, toxic dust, and flying shrapnel, posing a significant risk to students and staff. The ruling follows multiple criminal charges against the owners for illegal hazardous waste handling. The company must also perform an environmental cleanup of the site and give the school district the first option to purchase the land.</p>

          <p>The UK's director of public prosecutions revealed that a high-profile espionage case involving China collapsed because a senior national security official was unwilling to classify China as an "enemy" of the state. Deputy National Security Adviser Matt Collins reportedly stated that such a label did not reflect the Conservative government's official policy between 2021 and 2023, the period of the alleged offenses. This testimony was deemed crucial for prosecutors to meet the legal standard required by the Official Secrets Act, and its absence proved fatal to the case, leading to its dismissal before trial.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated a 3% annual inflation rate for September, a figure slightly below economists' predictions of 3.1%. This data, crucial for determining the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment, suggests that the economic impact of President Trump's tariffs has been somewhat muted so far. Despite being above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, the benign report is not expected to deter a potential interest rate cut at the upcoming Fed meeting. Economists note that rising inflation combined with a slowing job market presents a complex challenge for the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fourth Metropolitan Police officer, PC Jason Sinclair-Birt, has been dismissed for gross misconduct after being secretly filmed for a BBC Panorama investigation. The officer was recorded boasting about using excessive force on a detainee, an account he later claimed was a false embellishment for "comedic effect." A disciplinary panel found that although body camera footage showed he did not use a baton as claimed, sharing a false account that reveled in violence was a serious breach of professional standards. Three other officers implicated in the same investigation were dismissed a day earlier.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has dismissed President Trump's suggestion to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco as "laughable," stating there is no pretense for such an action. Newsom asserted that the city is effectively confronting crime, pointing to data showing a potential 70-year low in homicides and an overall decrease in violent crime. He also vowed to immediately challenge any such deployment in court, noting the state has already filed numerous lawsuits against the Trump administration. The president ultimately called off the plan after speaking with local leaders.</p>

          <p>Surgeons in New Zealand successfully removed between 80 and 100 high-powered magnets from the stomach and intestines of a 13-year-old boy, who lost part of his bowel as a result. The magnets, which the teen said he purchased online from Temu, had clamped together inside his digestive tract, causing tissue death. The case highlights the severe danger of ingesting multiple magnets, which are often sold as desktop toys. Despite a ban on their sale in New Zealand, such products remain easily accessible online, posing a significant challenge for enforcement and public safety.</p>

          <p>In light of the major NBA gambling scandal involving players, a coach, and organized crime, an opinion column argues that the NCAA should reverse its recent decision to allow student-athletes to bet on professional sports. The author contends that the professional sports world has a long history of betting-related corruption, from the Black Sox scandal to modern match-fixing. Allowing college athletes, whose brains are still developing, to engage in sports betting could expose them to addiction, debt, and predatory influences, posing a significant threat to their futures and the integrity of collegiate sports.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026, which will increase monthly payments for approximately 71 million beneficiaries. The adjustment, based on recent inflation data, will raise the average monthly benefit by about $56 to $2,071 starting in January. While the COLA is intended to help recipients keep pace with rising costs, some advocates argue it is insufficient, particularly as projected increases in Medicare premiums could consume most of the additional benefit. This year's COLA is slightly higher than the 2.5% increase for 2025.</p>

Inflation expectations also edged higher, with high prices remaining a primary concern for consumers.

          <p>The NFL and NFL Players Association have collectively fined the New York Giants organization, head coach Brian Daboll, and a player a total of $315,000 for violating the league's concussion protocol. The incident occurred during an evaluation of quarterback Jaxson Dart, when Coach Daboll and running back Cam Skattebo improperly entered the sideline medical tent. While a review found their actions did not affect the medical care Dart received, their presence created a perception of interference. The Giants have since implemented remedial training and procedural changes to prevent future breaches of the protocol.</p>
