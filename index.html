          <p>A growing number of couples are incorporating their pet dogs into their wedding ceremonies, treating them as integral family members. Dogs are taking on roles such as ring bearers, "flower girls," and greeters, reflecting a cultural shift where pets are seen as best friends and sources of emotional support. This trend has spurred the growth of specialized "dog chaperone" services that manage the pets on the wedding day, from consultations and training to grooming and handling during the event. The article highlights several personal stories, including a guide dog walking his owner down the aisle, underscoring the deep bond between humans and their canine companions.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has reportedly instructed its component suppliers to halt production of the H20 AI chip, which was specifically designed for the Chinese market to comply with U.S. export controls. This move follows reports that the Chinese government advised local tech companies to stop purchasing the chips due to national security concerns, including fears of potential "backdoors" for remote access. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang acknowledged discussions with Beijing about these security queries, expressing hope for a resolution. The situation highlights the significant challenges Nvidia faces in navigating the escalating technological and trade tensions between the United States and China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent court filings show that Elon Musk asked Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to participate in financing a $97.4 billion takeover of OpenAI in early 2025. The proposal was part of Musk's effort, through his company xAI, to acquire OpenAI after becoming critical of its shift towards a for-profit model with significant backing from Microsoft. The revelation comes from a legal battle between Musk and OpenAI, where OpenAI alleges Musk's bid was a "sham" designed to harm its business. According to the filing, neither Zuckerberg nor Meta signed the letter of intent, highlighting the complex rivalries and strategic maneuvers among top tech leaders in the competitive AI landscape.</p>

While details of the agreement are not yet public, the court filing indicates that both parties are negotiating the final terms, potentially concluding a major legal dispute stemming from the mass layoffs.</p>

          <p>Erik Menendez, who has been imprisoned for over three decades for the 1989 murder of his parents, was denied parole by a California board. The decision was primarily based on his behavior in prison, which included rules violations like illegal cellphone use, rather than the severity of the original crime. Commissioners also noted a perceived lack of empathy, particularly in the killing of his mother, and stated that he continues to pose an unreasonable risk to public safety. While several family members spoke in support of his release, the board concluded that he is currently unsuitable for parole and will be eligible for another hearing in three years.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old from Northern California, Julian Her, had an unforgettable summer experience by catching a massive 63.7-pound white sea bass in Tomales Bay. The impressive catch, which outweighs the young angler by only about 15 pounds, is now being submitted to the International Game Fish Association for record verification. If certified, the catch would break the junior world record for white sea bass, which has stood since 2002. The story captures the excitement of the "once-in-a-lifetime moment" for Julian and his family, who were initially fishing for halibut when the giant fish took the bait, leading to a memorable struggle and a celebrated haul.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation, which excludes fresh food prices, registered at 3.1% in July, slightly cooling from the previous month but still surpassing economists' expectations of 3%. While headline inflation also dipped, this marks the 40th consecutive month that the rate has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, fueling debate about potential interest rate hikes. A key factor in the slight moderation was the easing of rice price inflation, which had previously skyrocketed. The persistent inflation, particularly in the "core-core" metric that holds steady, puts continued pressure on the central bank to adjust its long-standing accommodative monetary policy.

Analysts widely anticipate that he will lay the groundwork for a potential interest rate cut in September, though he is likely to maintain a data-dependent stance.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's dissent criticized the majority's reasoning as "Calvinball jurisprudence," suggesting the rules were being manipulated to ensure the administration wins. The practical effect of the convoluted decision is that researchers will likely lose their funding and be unable to continue their work while navigating a lengthy and complicated legal process.</p>

          <p>Families campaigning for an independent inquiry into maternity care at University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust have expressed feeling "ignored and dismissed" after a meeting with Baroness Amos, the chair of a new national review. The group, who lost babies due to alleged medical errors, claims the meeting made no progress and that the chair was not adequately briefed on their case or their specific request for senior midwife Donna Ockenden to lead the investigation. Their frustration was compounded by the appointment of a former regulator to the review team, which they believe compromises its independence. The families argue the system that failed them cannot be trusted to investigate itself.</p>

          <p>French authorities have opened an investigation into the death of Raphaël Graven, a 46-year-old streamer known as Jean Pormanove, who died live online during an extreme, multi-day challenge. Graven had a large following and frequently participated in streams where he appeared to be subjected to humiliating and physically abusive treatment by other streamers for viewer donations. His death on the 12th day of the broadcast has sparked horror and raised questions about the responsibility of streaming platforms and the nature of the content. While an autopsy indicated no traumatic injury, the investigation is examining the circumstances surrounding his death and the pattern of apparent mistreatment he endured.</p>

          <p>The online message board 4chan has stated it will not pay fines proposed by Ofcom, the UK's media regulator, for failing to comply with the country's new Online Safety Act. A lawyer for the U.S.-based company argued that Ofcom's requests for information create no legal obligations in the United States and are part of an "illegal campaign of harassment." The firm asserts that as an American company, 4chan is protected by the First Amendment and that U.S. courts will not enforce foreign censorship codes or penal fines. This defiant stance sets up a significant international clash over the extraterritorial reach of national internet regulations and the conflict between content moderation laws and free speech principles.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new guidance for baby food manufacturers, urging them to reduce sugar and salt levels and to cease marketing snack products for infants under one year old. The guidelines, which are currently voluntary, also aim to restrict health claims on packaging that are not supported by scientific evidence. This action follows a BBC investigation that found many popular baby food pouches were high in sugar and lacked key nutrients. Companies have been given an 18-month period to comply, after which the government may consider "additional or alternative measures" if the industry fails to make sufficient changes to improve the nutritional quality of their products.</p>

          <p>During a visit to a U.S. Park Police station in Washington D.C., Donald Trump declared his administration's takeover of the city's policing to be a success. Flanked by cabinet members, he promoted the crime crackdown and also made unrelated remarks, including a promise to re-landscape the city's parks with high-quality grass similar to his golf courses. The event was framed as an effort to highlight reduced crime rates since the federal intervention, which saw the deployment of National Guard troops and federal agents across the city. The move has been controversial, with the city's mayor and critics questioning the necessity and methods of the federal takeover.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart's U.S. division, expressed puzzlement over the company's stock dropping 4.5% despite what he described as an exceptionally strong quarterly performance. The retail giant raised its full-year sales and earnings forecast, demonstrating robust top-line growth and expanding margins even while absorbing the impact of tariffs. Simon suggested that investors might have overreacted to a rare earnings miss, which was primarily due to one-time expenses rather than systemic issues with the business. He argued that Walmart's ability to attract and retain shoppers with low prices and convenience makes the company's outlook very strong, making the market's negative reaction illogical.

          <p>In an effort to reverse a six-year sales decline for the Jeep brand, parent company Stellantis has unveiled a redesigned 2026 Jeep Cherokee. The new model, which was discontinued in 2023, returns as a larger midsize SUV featuring Stellantis's first hybrid powertrain in North America, promising over 500 miles per tank of fuel. The vehicle aims to be highly competitive in a key market segment with a technology-focused interior and increased cargo capacity. This relaunch is a central part of the strategy under new CEO Antonio Filosa to recover Jeep's market share and navigate broader industry challenges, including the impact of tariffs.</p>

          <p>The international race to develop hypersonic missiles, which travel at over five times the speed of sound and are highly maneuverable, is intensifying. China and Russia are considered the current leaders in this advanced weapons technology, having invested heavily in their programs while Western nations were focused on counter-terrorism efforts. These weapons pose a significant strategic threat because their speed and unpredictable flight paths make them extremely difficult to detect and intercept with current defense systems. The U.S. and UK are now working to catch up, developing their own hypersonic capabilities and space-based sensors to counter the advantage held by their geopolitical rivals.</p>
