          <p>A Chinese national, Shenghua Wen, has been sentenced to eight years in prison for conspiring to illegally smuggle guns, ammunition, and sensitive U.S. technology to North Korea. Wen, who pleaded guilty to violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and acting as an illegal foreign agent, admitted to concealing contraband in shipping containers falsely declared as consumer goods. North Korean officials reportedly wired him about $2 million for these purchases. Federal agents seized a chemical threat identification device and eavesdropping detectors from his home, intended for North Korea's military, alongside 50,000 rounds of 9mm ammunition from his van.</p>

In a letter from the American Soybean Association, farmers warned of severe long-term economic consequences if China continues to favor Brazilian soybeans, highlighting the current financial stress from dropping prices and rising input costs. China historically bought 54% of U.S. soybean exports, valued at $13.2 billion in the 2023-2024 marketing year, making a deal crucial for the industry's survival. The farmers emphasize that they cannot withstand a prolonged trade dispute with their largest customer.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin's approach has led to mandatory evacuations on North Carolina's Outer Banks, including Hatteras and Ocracoke islands, disrupting the peak tourist season. While the season's first Atlantic hurricane is expected to remain offshore, it threatens to generate dangerous rip currents and high surf from Florida to New England. Local businesses, like a newly purchased inn, are bracing for impact, with some residents recalling past destructive storms like Hurricane Dorian. Beaches along the East Coast, including those in New Jersey, have closed to swimming, and authorities reported dozens of swimmer rescues in North Carolina due to rough waters.</p>

          <p>Epping Forest District Council has secured a temporary High Court injunction, mandating the removal of asylum seekers from The Bell Hotel in Epping by September 12. The council argued the hotel's use for asylum housing was not in line with planning regulations and cited escalating tensions from recent protests, some of which turned violent. The Home Office had warned this ruling could significantly impact its ability to house asylum seekers across the UK. The decision follows charges against an asylum seeker from the hotel for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl, intensifying community concerns.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, now a Category 3 storm, is expected to grow as it moves northward in the western Atlantic, prompting warnings of life-threatening flooding and dangerous currents along the U.S. East Coast. Though not forecast to make direct landfall, the unusually large storm is predicted to bring severe conditions to the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Canada's Atlantic coast. Mandatory evacuations are underway for North Carolina's Outer Banks, with concerns about the main highway becoming impassable. High winds and waves have already caused power outages in Puerto Rico and numerous rip current rescues along the coast, highlighting the storm's widespread impact.</p>

          <p>Constance Marten is seeking permission to appeal her conviction for gross negligence manslaughter, following the discovery of her baby daughter Victoria's decomposing body in a shopping bag in Brighton. Marten, 38, and her partner Mark Gordon, 51, were found guilty at the Old Bailey in July after a retrial. Pathologists remain uncertain of the exact cause of death, though hypothermia or smothering while co-sleeping in cold conditions were suggested. The couple had gone on the run to avoid their child being taken into care, as their four other children had previously been removed. Sentencing for Marten and Gordon is scheduled for September 15.</p>

The columnist advises showing kindness and checking on him, suggesting that acting generously can be a form of 'rebalancing the scales' rather than harboring 'petty grievances.'

These deals often provide significant payouts for founders and top researchers, but leave other employees and investors in limbo, with the remaining company hollowed out. Critics argue this practice allows tech giants to skirt regulatory scrutiny while stifling innovation, as founders abandon their projects for roles at larger firms. The Federal Trade Commission has opened probes into some of these transactions, raising concerns about antitrust implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Column: Trump's Foreign Policy Characterized by Chaos, Not a 'Doctrine'</h2>

          <p>This opinion article by Sidney Blumenthal asserts that President Trump's foreign policy lacks a coherent 'doctrine,' instead being characterized by chaos and self-aggrandizement. It critically analyzes Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, arguing that Trump's approach empowered Putin and undermined Western unity, despite European efforts to secure a ceasefire in Ukraine. The author highlights perceived diplomatic blunders by Trump's envoy and alleged economic advantages offered to Russia. The piece concludes that Trump's foreign policy primarily serves his personal interests, leading to a 'shambolic scene' rather than strategic diplomacy.</p>

          <p>S&P Global has maintained its AA+ rating on long-term U.S. sovereign debt, expecting 'meaningful' federal government revenue from President Donald Trump's broad tariff policies to largely offset weaker revenue from his recently enacted tax-and-spending bill. The agency cautioned that the rating could be lowered if deficits increase due to political inability to contain spending or manage tax code changes. It also warned against political developments that could undermine American institutions or the Federal Reserve's independence, potentially jeopardizing the dollar's status as the world's leading reserve currency. The Treasury Department reported a significant increase in customs duty collections in July due to tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has accused India of 'profiteering' from cheap Russian oil imports during the Ukraine war, describing their practice of refining and reselling it to sanctioned regions as 'arbitrage.' India's imports of Russian oil have surged dramatically since February 2022, making it Russia's biggest customer, importing 1.5 million barrels per day in July. The Trump administration is imposing additional tariffs on Indian exports to the U.S. to penalize New Delhi for this trade. Bessent noted that China's imports are viewed differently as they were a major buyer before the invasion, while a former advisor suggests the Biden administration initially encouraged India's purchases to stabilize oil prices.

          <p>The Trump administration's insistence on 'scientifically justifiable' research has led to significant disruption and defunding of hundreds of studies at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Critics argue this vague standard is a subjective tool for political meddling, allowing the administration to halt research on systemic racism, gender identity, and women's health. Despite NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya's claims of supporting academic freedom, internal documents suggest a push to restrict data collection on gender and prioritize research into 'regret and detransition.'

          <p>Viking Therapeutics shares plummeted by 40% after the company released midstage trial data for its obesity pill, VK2735, which disappointed investors. The results showed patients lost up to 12.2% of their weight in about three months, but the high discontinuation rate (28% over 13 weeks) due to gastrointestinal side effects raised concerns. Analysts suggest the data appears inferior to competitors like Eli Lilly's oral drug, which achieved similar weight loss with lower discontinuation rates over a much longer trial period.

In contrast, the CDC, under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., does not recommend COVID-19 shots for healthy children of any age.

These conditions are seen as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on 'sanctuary states.'
