          <p>As the Dalai Lama's 90th birthday nears, the question of his successor remains a point of contention between the Tibetan government-in-exile and China.  China asserts the sole authority to choose the next Dalai Lama, while the current Dalai Lama, residing in India since 1959, insists Tibetans won't recognize a Chinese-appointed successor. While there's speculation he might choose his successor while alive, the president of the Tibetan government-in-exile believes a traditional reincarnation-based selection after his death is more probable.  The Dalai Lama will deliver a video message at a meeting of Tibetan Buddhist monasteries on July 2nd, though it's uncertain if succession will be addressed.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump voiced his support for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is currently facing trial for bribery, fraud, and breach of trust. Trump referred to the trial as a "witch hunt" and "horror show," echoing the language he used in his own legal battles.  He called for the trial to be canceled or for Netanyahu to be pardoned, praising the prime minister as a "warrior" and highlighting their close working relationship.

          <p>U.S. intelligence leaders assert that recent strikes have significantly damaged Iran's nuclear facilities, potentially setting back the program by years. CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard cited new intelligence indicating the destruction of key facilities.  This contradicts a leaked DIA assessment that suggested a shorter setback.  The statements didn't address Iran's remaining nuclear capabilities or whether enriched uranium was moved before the strikes.  President Trump, however, claimed the strikes were so swift that Iran couldn't relocate materials and announced upcoming talks with Iran.</p>

          <p>New Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano addressed lawmakers' concerns about staffing, benefit payments, and data privacy at the Social Security Administration.

He emphasized technology investments to improve efficiency with a smaller workforce, rather than increasing staffing levels.  Bisignano also refuted claims made by Elon Musk, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency, that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme. He reaffirmed the agency's commitment to paying benefits, though funding from Congress remains crucial to avoid future benefit cuts.</p>

          <p>The LAPD's involvement in a recent ICE raid in downtown Los Angeles has sparked controversy.  A video shows LAPD officers separating an angry crowd from ICE agents, leading to accusations of collaboration.  The LAPD claims it was responding to a kidnapping report and only intervened to de-escalate tensions.  Immigrant rights groups, however, argue the police actively assisted ICE, violating the city's sanctuary ordinance. The incident has further strained relations between the LAPD and the Latino community.</p>
