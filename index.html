          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose a 30% tariff on all imports from Mexico and the European Union, effective August 1st. The justification for the tariffs cites Mexico's perceived inaction against drug trafficking and the EU's non-reciprocal trade relationship with the U.S. This move is part of a broader campaign strategy to overhaul the U.S. economy and represents a significant departure from long-standing global trade rules, such as the "most favored nation" principle. The administration has now issued tariff conditions on 24 countries in addition to the 27-member EU bloc. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Martin Frizell, the husband of UK television presenter Fiona Phillips, has spoken out about the social isolation they have experienced since her Alzheimer's diagnosis in 2023. He described how friends have become distant, possibly due to discomfort or a confrontation with their own mortality. Frizell also shared the heartache of seeing his wife, once a vibrant personality, lose interest in activities like cooking and fashion. He contributed extensively to her new memoir, expressing anger at the lack of support for families affected by the disease, which has impacted multiple generations of Phillips' family.</p>

          <p>Two 21-year-old men, Sam Asgari-Tabar and Reece Parish, have appeared in court following a police chase that ended with a stolen BMW crashing into a care home in Sunderland, UK. Two female residents of the home, in their 80s and 90s, died the following day, and police are investigating if the crash contributed to their deaths. The men are charged with robbery and kidnapping related to the car theft, with one also facing charges for causing serious injury to another resident.

          <p>A 20-year-old Palestinian-American, Saif Musallet, was reportedly killed in the West Bank after being beaten by Israeli settlers while protecting his family's land. His family stated that paramedics were blocked from reaching him for hours, and they have called for a U.S. State Department investigation. This incident occurs amid rising violence in the West Bank and continued Israeli military operations in Gaza, where recent airstrikes have killed at least 28 Palestinians, including women and children. The Israeli military reported striking numerous Hamas targets, while the Gaza Health Ministry's death toll from the conflict has surpassed 57,000.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research published in Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine suggests a link between the painkiller gabapentin and a higher risk of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The observational study, which analyzed health records of over 26,000 patients, found that individuals with six or more prescriptions for the drug had a significantly increased risk within 10 years. The risk was particularly pronounced in younger adults, with those aged 35 to 49 facing more than double the risk of dementia. While the study cannot establish direct causation, researchers emphasize the need for close monitoring of patients prescribed gabapentin for potential cognitive decline.</p>

          <p>The newly signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" will significantly reform the U.S. federal student loan system, reducing repayment options from seven to two and setting new borrowing caps. Starting in 2026, new borrowers will choose between a standard 10-25 year plan or a new income-driven "Repayment Assistance Plan," which could extend payments up to 30 years. The law phases out existing plans like SAVE and tightens eligibility for Pell Grants, while also eliminating Grad PLUS loans for new students. Critics express concern that the longer repayment timelines could keep borrowers in debt for longer, though some experts praise the simplification of the system. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece notes Eric Trump's recent suggestion that he might consider a future presidential run, alongside Lara Trump's own political ambitions. Lara Trump, who was briefly co-chair of the Republican National Committee and now hosts a Fox News show, is reportedly considering a 2026 Senate run in North Carolina. The author argues that Lara is taking on Ivanka's former role of softening Donald Trump's image, while leveraging her family connections for her own political advancement.</p>

          <p>Securing a salary increase is rarely accomplished in a single meeting, according to negotiation expert Kathryn Valentine, CEO of Worthmore Strategies. The process often takes several weeks of discussions, follow-ups, and documentation. Valentine advises initiating the conversation during a mid-year check-in rather than an annual review, as budgets are often set by year's end. The goal of the first meeting should be to open the dialogue and set the stage, not to reach a final agreement. She stresses the importance of scheduling a follow-up meeting and documenting the conversation to maintain momentum and hold both parties accountable.</p>

These include the constant distraction of phones, unresolved emotional attachments to an ex-partner, a persistent negativity bias that leads to self-rejection, and the physiological impact of stress.

Residents near the Kok and Sai rivers report skin rashes and have been warned against using the water after tests revealed dangerously high levels of arsenic and other hazardous metals. This pollution affects local communities, agriculture, and eventually flows into the Mekong River.

However, these findings, based on what they call the only direct evidence from the basin, were reportedly rejected twice for publication by a peer-review panel at the journal Nature. This has sparked a debate over the interpretation of the data and the dynamics of international scientific validation.</p>

          <p>When 13-year-old Micah Clayborne complained of chest pains, his mother, a heart transplant recipient herself, sought immediate medical help. Micah was diagnosed with Danon disease, a rare genetic condition that had caused his heart to function at only 7%, putting him at risk of sudden cardiac death. After receiving a pacemaker and defibrillator, Micah was placed on the transplant list and successfully received a new heart nine months later. Inspired by the lack of resources for teenagers in his situation, Micah and his mother launched Transplant Teenz, a non-profit providing a virtual support community for young people awaiting organ transplants.</p>

          <p>This article advocates for allowing children more freedom for unstructured physical play, arguing that modern society increasingly restricts this vital activity. The author notes that while wild animals spend their youth honing movement skills, human children are often kept sedentary due to safety fears and social norms. This lack of free play can have negative consequences for physical health, cognitive skills, and mental well-being. Citing injury-prevention experts, the piece suggests that encouraging kids to climb, run, and wrestle helps them develop a robust "movement vocabulary," which is crucial for long-term athletic durability and injury prevention.</p>

          <p>In Florida, many immigrants are adopting a new set of informal rules for driving out of fear of being detained during routine traffic stops, following a new law granting highway patrol such authority. These self-imposed guidelines include avoiding Spanish-language music or stickers, not wearing work uniforms, and trying to travel only with U.S. citizens. The climate of fear has reportedly caused some to stop driving altogether, impacting their ability to work and creating labor shortages. Human rights advocates argue this reflects an administration goal to expand border-style enforcement nationwide, creating widespread anxiety within immigrant communities regardless of legal status.</p>

          <p>Germany's Interior Minister, Alexander Dobrindt, has dismissed the severity of a recent coalition dispute over judicial appointments, stating he sees no damage to the country's Federal Constitutional Court. The controversy arose when the conservative CDU/CSU bloc unexpectedly withdrew its support for a Social Democrats (SPD) candidate for the court, causing the vote to be postponed. This move drew sharp criticism from within the ruling coalition, with the SPD accusing their partners of deliberately undermining democratic institutions. Dobrindt, however, described the postponement as a normal parliamentary procedure, attempting to quell accusations of a brewing political crisis.</p>

          <p>Katie Gatti Tassin, author of "Rich Girl Nation," describes the high cost of beauty maintenance as an "insidious force" in women's financial lives, dubbing it the "hot girl hamster wheel." She argues that spending on aesthetic enhancements like hair, nails, and skincare functions as a commitment to future spending, as these are depreciating assets that require constant upkeep. Tassin suggests that while "pretty privilege" is real, women are socialized to over-invest in beauty as their primary form of social capital. She advocates for a "hot girl detox," where women critically evaluate these expenses and redirect the saved money toward building actual wealth.</p>

          <p>Conservationists are raising alarms about the declining reproductive success of ospreys around the Chesapeake Bay, a key population center for the once-endangered bird. Biologist Bryan Watts has documented that osprey pairs are failing to fledge enough chicks to maintain their population, a trend he links to the decline of menhaden, a small fish crucial to their diet. This claim has sparked a conflict with the fishing industry, which harvests menhaden for fish oil and bait and disputes the connection. Regulators are now considering new management approaches, as environmental groups warn that the iconic raptor's population could plummet without intervention.</p>

          <p>Sharon Graham, the general secretary of the Unite union, has stated that the UK's Labour Party is failing to defend working people, leading them to turn away from the party. The criticism follows a vote by the union to potentially rethink its relationship with Labour, which could involve cutting its £1.2 million in annual funding. The immediate catalyst for the dispute is the union's suspension of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's membership over her handling of bin strikes in Birmingham. Graham warned that disaffiliation is a possibility, arguing it is hard to justify the union's financial support when the party's decisions do not align with workers' interests.</p>
