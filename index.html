          <p>A mother and her three children tragically died in a house fire in Brent, north-west London, prompting the arrest of a 41-year-old man on suspicion of murder. Emergency services responded to the blaze in Tillett Close, Stonebridge, finding the 43-year-old woman, a 15-year-old girl, and two boys aged eight and four deceased. Another woman in her 70s and a teenage girl were hospitalized, and the cause of the fire is under investigation. Neighbors expressed their shock and grief, describing the family as "really good people" who had lived in the community for over 20 years, and the incident is described by police as extremely tragic.</p>

          <p>CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios' Alex Thompson have authored a new book, "Original Sin," which explores the emergence of concerns about Joe Biden's cognitive decline during his time in office. In a discussion on Washington Week With The Atlantic, Tapper noted a divergence between a "fine Joe Biden" and a "nonfunctioning Biden," with the latter becoming increasingly prevalent. The book delves into when these instances of cognitive decline became frequent enough to raise legitimate questions about his ability to serve as president. The discussion also involved Jeffrey Goldberg, providing context for the book's claims and its implications for Biden's legacy.</p>

          <p>Swiss brand On is emerging as a strong competitor in the sportswear market, reporting a 40% increase in net sales for the first quarter of 2025. Analysts attribute On's success to its unique shoe aesthetics and well-timed market entry, capitalizing on Nike's sales decline and Adidas's partnership issues. While Nike and Adidas still dominate the market share, On's rapid earnings growth is outpacing both companies. The article notes that On faces potential headwinds from Nike's turnaround plan and uncertainty surrounding tariffs, given that 90% of its sneakers are manufactured in Vietnam.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder, Minneapolis is still addressing police reform, with Police Chief Brian O'Hara implementing changes to improve safety and community relations. Despite shootings trending down, violent crime remains a challenge, exacerbated by officer shortages and diminished police force numbers. O'Hara focuses on "getting back to the basics," emphasizing crime reduction and community trust, and is working to restore pride in the profession and change the department's culture. The Justice Department is ending investigations of six police agencies, including Minneapolis, though reform efforts will continue despite the lack of federal oversight.</p>

          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers will be established across England over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in A&E departments, according to NHS England. These centers will be accessible to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, staffed by specialists to provide immediate care for individuals in acute mental distress. NHS England highlights that these centers aim to expedite access to appropriate care, keeping people out of hospitals, while critics emphasize the need for thorough testing and proper funding. The scheme is part of a 10-year NHS plan and will include both new, self-contained units and integration into existing A&Es.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to David Marcus, a provision in the GOP's "big beautiful bill" that eliminates taxes on overtime could be politically advantageous for Republicans in the upcoming midterms. This policy change is reportedly highly desired by working Americans and employers, and could serve as a significant measure to gain support. Marcus argues that reducing overtime tax would be more impactful than stimulus checks, as it provides a consistent raise that workers can rely on. He suggests that Republicans should emphasize their commitment to eliminating overtime tax in their campaigns, as it addresses a key concern of the working class.</p>

          <p>The Catholic Archbishop of New Orleans, Gregory Aymond, made a rare court appearance in a federal bankruptcy case involving claims from hundreds of clergy sexual assault survivors. Aymond stated his concern for the survivors and the need to expedite negotiations, acknowledging the prolonged bankruptcy has delayed compensation. Attorneys representing a portion of the claimants criticized the proposed settlement plan, while the lead attorney for the survivors' committee defended the deal as a starting point. The proposed settlement would provide $130 million in cash and up to $110 million from insurance and property sales, falling short of a comparable case in Long Island.</p>

          <p>A record number of Americans are seeking residency in the UK, with over 6,000 applications for British citizenship or indefinite leave to remain in the past year. The surge is partly attributed to the polarized political climate in the US under the Trump administration, with some immigration lawyers reporting increased inquiries following recent pronouncements. While the UK government aims to reduce overall immigration, there are provisions to expedite qualifications based on contributions made. Most applications are from individuals eligible through spousal or family links, with language requirements being emphasized for integration.</p>

          <p>Cerro San Cristobal in Santiago, Chile, provides a scenic hiking experience with stunning views of the city and the Andes Mountains.

The summit features a statue of the Virgin Mary, but a side path leads to quieter spots with expansive views of the city and the snow-capped Andes.</p>

          <p>The UK government is preparing for a difficult Spending Review, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves set to outline budget plans up to 2029.

Ministers are engaged in tense negotiations, with some sources describing the process as "ugly" and services potentially at risk. The government aims to highlight infrastructure investments while facing challenges in areas like council budgets, affordable housing, and police funding.</p>

Trump's recent trip to the Middle East excluded Israel, signaling a shift in priorities. Disagreements have surfaced over Iran, Gaza, and Syria, with the US pursuing its own interests, and the administration is also less inclined to take on a traditionally assertive role in the Middle East.
