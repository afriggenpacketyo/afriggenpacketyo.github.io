          <p>Deutsche Bank announced second-quarter net profits of €1.485 billion, significantly surpassing analyst predictions. This positive result was achieved despite mixed performance in its investment banking division and the negative impact of a strong euro against the U.S. dollar. The bank's CEO, Christian Sewing, affirmed that the company is on course to meet its 2025 financial targets, citing a strong CET 1 capital ratio of 14.2%. However, the lender faces headwinds from a lower interest rate environment in Europe and ongoing trade uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is set to launch a program offering monthly subsidy vouchers to its senior citizens to alleviate financial burdens and stimulate the elderly-care service market. The electronic coupons, valued between 500 and 800 yuan, will be provided to seniors assessed as having moderate to severe disabilities. This initiative represents a rare form of direct fiscal support from Beijing, aimed at strengthening the social safety net as the country grapples with a rapidly aging population. Economists see this as a positive step toward unlocking domestic consumption by reducing households' precautionary savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spain's Deoleo, the world's largest producer of olive oil, has warned that potential 30% tariffs threatened by the Trump administration could lead to higher prices for American consumers. The company, which makes brands like Bertolli, highlighted that the U.S. imports approximately 95% of its olive oil, making consumers particularly vulnerable to trade policy impacts. Deoleo CEO Cristóbal Valdés emphasized that such tariffs would penalize access to a healthy food staple. The uncertainty looms as the European Union and the United States rush to negotiate a trade deal before an August 1 deadline.</p>

While these measures aim to address a critical housing shortage, they often face significant pushback from local communities concerned about overcrowding, infrastructure strain, and loss of local control.

          <p>The Trump administration has directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials to offer migrant teenagers aged 14 and older the option to voluntarily return to their home countries. This new policy upends the long-standing practice of transferring all unaccompanied minors from non-contiguous countries to government-run shelters overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services. Previously, this voluntary departure option was limited to children from Mexico and Canada. The Department of Homeland Security stated the change was enabled by new authorities in a recent spending law, aiming to prioritize returning children to their families.</p>

          <p>The Environment Agency (EA) in England has cancelled thousands of water tests intended to detect harmful pollution in rivers and lakes over the last three months due to severe staff shortages. Internal documents reveal that 10,000 scheduled tests for inorganic pollutants like nitrates and phosphates were not conducted at the main laboratory in Devon. Campaigners and former employees warn that these cuts undermine the ability to monitor river health and identify pollution from sewage or agriculture. The EA confirmed the cancellations, blaming "fluctuations in staffing capacity" amid criticism of its oversight of the water system.</p>

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that EU-China relations have reached an "inflection point," highlighting the EU's record €306 billion trade deficit with China last year. She emphasized that rebalancing the relationship is essential and urged for real solutions to address the EU's concerns about market access and industrial subsidies favoring Chinese companies.

          <p>A rare violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, has been discovered on a La Jolla beach, marking the first time in a decade that Scripps Institution of Oceanography researchers have seen one locally. These pelagic snails, known for their striking purple shells and bubble rafts for flotation, are typically found in warmer tropical waters. Their appearance in Southern California often coincides with warmer ocean currents, leading to questions about a potential link to climate change. Researchers are urging the public to report any further sightings as they study whether this is a sign of shifting marine ecosystems.</p>

The Wall Street Journal had reported that Trump's name, along with other high-profile figures, appeared multiple times in the records, though being named is not evidence of wrongdoing. This development comes as a Florida judge denied the DOJ's request to unseal grand jury files from Epstein's 2006 case, citing secrecy rules.

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the legendary and wildly influential frontman of the band Black Sabbath, has died at the age of 76. As the voice of Sabbath, Osbourne was a principal architect of the heavy metal genre, with his distinctive wail and the band's heavy, detuned sound setting a template for countless rock acts that followed. This article provides a retrospective on how the working-class musicians from Birmingham reacted against the pop music of their era to create a new, darker sound. Osbourne's career was defined by his electrifying stage presence and a mythological rock-and-roll lifestyle.</p>

          <p>South Korea's economy expanded by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the previous one, successfully avoiding a technical recession. The growth, which beat analyst expectations, was primarily driven by a strong 4.2% increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products. This performance marks a reversal from the 0.2% contraction seen in the first quarter of the year. However, economists remain cautious, noting that domestic demand is still soft and that the export-led growth could be threatened by potential U.S. tariffs if a trade deal is not reached.
