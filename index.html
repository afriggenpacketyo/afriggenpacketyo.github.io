          <p>Taiwan is set to conduct combat capability evaluations on its domestically developed kamikaze sea drone, known as the "Kuai Chi Project," later this month. The island's defense ministry has allocated over $25 million for the project, tasking the National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (NCSIST) with leading development. The attack vessel, equipped with an AI-enabled targeting system, aims to autonomously strike enemy ships, aligning with Taiwan's asymmetric defense strategy. Mass production of over 200 units is expected to begin in 2026 to bolster coastal assault operations.</p>

          <p>MI5 is under renewed scrutiny after a High Court judge expressed a lack of confidence in the Security Service's account of false evidence provided in the case of a violent neo-Nazi agent. The BBC revealed that MI5 had lied to three courts about the agent, known as X, who used his position to coerce and terrorize his girlfriend. The court ordered MI5 to hand over secret documents regarding the case, and a panel of High Court judges will consider potential actions, including contempt of court proceedings against MI5 or individual officers. The situation raises concerns about the accuracy of information presented to the court and the integrity of MI5's internal investigations.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity contracted in May at its fastest pace since September 2022, according to a private survey, as new export orders declined due to U.S. tariffs.

The decline in foreign demand accelerated, and the job market remained grim with employment shrinking for the second consecutive month.

          <p>The UK government is threatening to sue Roman Abramovich to ensure the Â£2.5 billion from the sale of Chelsea Football Club goes to Ukrainian humanitarian aid. The funds have been frozen in a UK bank account since the sale, with Abramovich sanctioned after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The disagreement centers on Abramovich's desire for the funds to benefit "all victims of the war in Ukraine," including those in Russia, while the UK government insists the money should only be used for humanitarian efforts inside Ukraine. The situation has created an impasse, with the government seeking to resolve the issue through legal means.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department is intensifying its efforts to prevent transgender athletes from competing in school sports in California, threatening legal action against districts that do not comply. Assistant Atty. Gen. Harmeet Dhillon argued that allowing transgender athletes to compete deprives cisgender girls of athletic opportunities. The move comes after a transgender athlete won multiple medals at the state high school track and field championships, despite opposition from the Trump administration. The situation has sparked controversy and debate over the rights and inclusion of transgender athletes in sports.</p>
