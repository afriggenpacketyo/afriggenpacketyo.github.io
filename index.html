            <p>Shanghai is experiencing a surge in sports-related economic activity, highlighted by the recent Formula One Chinese Grand Prix, which attracted a record 220,000 spectators and is projected to generate over $685 million in direct and indirect economic benefits for the city. Local policymakers across China are increasingly focusing on the sports industry to stimulate consumption and drive economic growth, especially as traditional sectors like real estate face challenges. The central government is supporting this trend, recognizing the sports industry's potential for integration with other fields and its resilience amidst an overall economic slowdown. This shift indicates a strategic move towards leveraging sports as a significant economic driver in China.</p>

            <p>An Ohio pastor, Andrew Edwards, was critically injured, and a passenger, Richard Miller, was killed when a tree fell on their car after a Bible study. The incident, described as a "freak accident" by local authorities, occurred while they were stopped at a traffic light in Toledo. Pastor Edwards sustained fractures but is now stable and responsive, while Miller was pronounced dead at the scene. The church community has expressed grief and support for the families affected, and Edwards has expressed a desire to return to his pastoral duties following his recovery.</p>

            <p>President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador has offered to repatriate 252 Venezuelans deported by the U.S. and imprisoned in his country in exchange for the release of an equal number of political prisoners held in Venezuela. This proposal comes after the U.S., under President Trump, deported these Venezuelans, accusing them of being members of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang. Bukele directly appealed to Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on social media, also mentioning nearly 50 prisoners of other nationalities, including U.S. citizens, as part of the proposed swap. The Venezuelan government has not yet publicly responded to Bukele's offer.</p>

            <p>In Japan, "friendship marriages," nonsexual partnerships offering practical benefits, are gaining recognition, driven by societal pressures and social security advantages. A Tokyo-based marriage agency reports over 300 such unions in the last decade, with couples like Satsuki and Minato, who are in their 30s, choosing companionship without romantic or sexual involvement. Satsuki, attracted to women, and Minato, sexually attracted to men, met online and married to fulfill societal expectations and gain benefits, later having a child through fertility treatment. These arrangements highlight evolving attitudes toward marriage and family structures in Japan, where same-sex marriage is not legally recognized.</p>

            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has maintained its loan prime rates (LPR) steady, with the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6%, as it focuses on stabilizing the yuan amidst ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. This decision follows recent economic data indicating better-than-expected growth in China, with a first-quarter GDP increase of 5.4% year-on-year, providing the PBOC with room to maintain current rates. The move aligns with expectations from economists, as the PBOC balances supporting economic growth with managing currency stability in the face of external pressures.</p>

            <p>Alessandro Paredes, a 19-year-old Venezuelan migrant, spoke from a detention center in Texas after the Supreme Court temporarily blocked his deportation. He claims he and others were coerced into signing documents stating they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang. The White House defends its actions, asserting the administration's right to remove dangerous illegal aliens. Paredes' mother denies the gang affiliation, and expresses fear for her son's safety if deported to El Salvador.

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing scrutiny after reportedly sharing classified details about a U.S. airstrike in Yemen with a private Signal group that included his wife, brother, and personal attorney.

The messages allegedly contained flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets tasked with striking Houthi targets. These incidents raise concerns about the handling of sensitive military information by senior officials and the use of unsecured communication channels for classified discussions.</p>

            <p>As the economic war between the United States and China intensifies, China is preparing for a prolonged period of trade tensions with the U.S. China recognizes that the U.S.'s strategic goal is to weaken China's economic growth rather than simply rebalance trade. To mitigate the impact of tariffs, China may implement fiscal stimulus and address its economic weaknesses, such as domestic market fragmentation. Despite the challenges, this situation could ultimately make China more resilient and self-reliant in the long term.</p>

            <p>Despite government efforts to expand access to "free hours" of childcare in England, parents continue to struggle with finding available nursery places and affording childcare costs. Many areas are considered "childcare deserts" with limited access, particularly affecting lower-income families. While the government aims to provide 30 hours of childcare per week for eligible working parents, hurdles remain, including staffing shortages, financial pressures on private nurseries, and eligibility restrictions. These challenges raise concerns about equity in early childhood education and the strain on working families.</p>

            <p>With mortgage rates expected to decrease, first-time home buyers are exploring various strategies to enter the housing market, including saving early, considering low-deposit mortgages, exploring shared ownership, and using 'income boost' mortgages. Experts recommend starting savings as early as possible, utilizing Lifetime ISAs for government bonuses, and exploring options like Yorkshire Building Society's £5,000 deposit mortgage or Skipton's Track Record mortgage. Shared ownership allows buyers to purchase a share of a property and pay rent on the remainder, while 'income boost' mortgages enable family members to increase borrowing potential. These strategies offer pathways for first-time buyers to overcome deposit hurdles and achieve homeownership. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Men are less likely to visit doctors compared to women, often delaying medical help until symptoms become severe, influenced by societal expectations of masculinity and self-reliance. NHS data indicates that fewer men contact their GP or use pharmacies, and a survey reveals that many feel pressured to "tough it out" when facing health issues. This reluctance affects health outcomes, with experts pointing to factors like appointment systems that don't accommodate work schedules and a lack of preventative check-ups for younger men.

Despite having the world's second-largest road network, India's chaotic traffic mix, including motorized and non-motorized vehicles, pedestrians, and stray animals, exacerbates the problem. Experts emphasize that addressing this crisis requires improvements in infrastructure, human behavior, and systemic enforcement of safety regulations to reduce the economic burden of road crashes, which costs India 3% of its annual GDP.</p>

            <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has condemned the vandalism of statues in Parliament Square, including one of women's votes campaigner Dame Millicent Fawcett, calling it "disgraceful." The vandalism occurred during a protest by transgender campaigners against a Supreme Court ruling on the definition of a woman. Cooper has welcomed the Metropolitan Police's investigation and pledged to strengthen the law to protect important memorials. The Met is investigating the incidents as criminal damage, and the Greater London Authority is working to remove the graffiti.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the deportations of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, following an emergency appeal from the ACLU. The court directed the Trump administration to halt removals from the Bluebonnet Detention Center until further notice. The ACLU argued that immigration authorities were moving to restart removals without giving detainees a chance to argue their case in court, violating a previous Supreme Court order. The White House maintains that those being held are "foreign terrorists," while the ACLU claims they are being denied due process.</p>
