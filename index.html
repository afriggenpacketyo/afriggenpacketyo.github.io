          <h2>Bristol Myers Squibb Faces Investor Skepticism Despite Strong Quarter</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bristol Myers Squibb reported second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, yet its stock price declined due to investor hesitancy. This concern stems from wavering confidence in the growth trajectory of its new schizophrenia drug, Cobenfy, following a previous trial failure. The company's future stock performance is heavily tied to upcoming trial data for Cobenfy's use in Alzheimer's psychosis patients. Analysts have lowered the price target, citing uncertainty around the drug and broader concerns about potential U.S. pharmaceutical policy changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ahead of Apple's third-quarter results, users on the prediction platform Kalshi are betting on which words will be mentioned during the earnings call. There is a high probability placed on terms like "China" and "Tariff," reflecting the ongoing pressure on Apple to navigate U.S.-China trade tensions and boost domestic manufacturing. President Trump has threatened significant tariffs on iPhones not made in the U.S., prompting Apple to expand production in India and Vietnam. Analysts anticipate that these macroeconomic challenges and market share losses in China will be central topics of discussion. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Brazilian government has granted Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD a short-term exemption from import tariff hikes, though for a shorter period than the company sought. BYD will be allowed to import up to $463 million in semi-assembled vehicles tax-free during the first half of 2026 to support the ramp-up of its new plant in Bahia. However, Brazil also accelerated its long-term plan, with import tariffs on EV kits set to reach 35% by January 2027, earlier than planned. This decision balances BYD's needs against concerns from traditional automakers about potential job losses and investment risks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of stick insect, Acrophylla alta, in a remote rainforest in Far North Queensland, Australia, which is now considered the country's heaviest insect. Weighing 44 grams and measuring 40 centimeters long, the insect was found high in the canopies of the Wet Tropics region. Its large size is believed to be an evolutionary adaptation to the colder, high-altitude environment. The discovery was confirmed through its distinctive eggs, and two specimens have been added to the Queensland Museum for further research.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate of high interest rates and market volatility, some pre-retirees are considering rolling over their 401(k) funds into an annuity to secure a guaranteed income stream. While annuities can offer protection against inflation and market downturns, the decision involves significant trade-offs, including high fees, limited liquidity, and potentially lower growth compared to a diversified portfolio. The article suggests that while elevated rates make annuities more attractive, a rollover should be part of a comprehensive retirement strategy, not a standalone solution. (not investment advice)</p>

This information is vital for real-time storm monitoring, allowing for more accurate and timely warnings that help people prepare and evacuate. The data is also essential for monitoring sea ice in polar regions, which impacts global weather patterns and climate change research.</p>

          <p>An opinion article in The Atlantic posits that Hamas is intentionally exacerbating the famine in Gaza as a strategic final play to end the war on its terms. The author argues that the widespread suffering generates international outcry, which pressures Israel and improves Hamas's leverage in negotiations. This perspective is supported by conversations with Gazans who are reportedly angry at Hamas for its intransigence and for attacking aid convoys. The article suggests the best way to undermine this strategy is for Israel to flood Gaza with food and alleviate the humanitarian crisis, thereby removing Hamas's key bargaining chip.</p>

The interference has angered many Brazilians and drawn criticism from political scientists, who compare the weaponization of trade policy to authoritarian tactics.

However, the judge ruled that the CQC's assessment was rationally focused on patient safety and scrutinized the clinic's processes in detail.

          <p>The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has voted to advance a bill that would ban members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks. Republican Senator Josh Hawley joined all committee Democrats in the 8-7 vote, while all other Republicans voted against it. The bill sparked a heated exchange, with Senator Rick Scott defending the right of lawmakers to be wealthy. President Trump gave a mixed response, initially supporting the concept before criticizing Hawley on social media, though Hawley claims the president was misinformed about the bill's scope.</p>

          <p>A magnitude 4.3 earthquake struck near Rialto in San Bernardino County, with shaking felt across a wide area of Southern California, including Los Angeles and Orange counties.

However, existing 25% tariffs related to fentanyl smuggling and on certain goods like autos, steel, and copper will remain in place.
