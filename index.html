          <p>Conservative candidate Karol Nawrocki has reportedly won the Polish presidential election, according to Polish media outlets, securing 50.89% of the vote against Trzaskowski's 49.11%. The Polish National Electoral Commission is expected to officially announce the results later today. While the president's role is mainly ceremonial, they command the armed forces, can veto government bills, influence foreign policy, and propose legislation. The new president will likely face challenges from Donald Tusk's pro-EU coalition government, which has been blocked by the current conservative president, Andrzej Duda.</p>

          <p>Shares of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks have significantly increased after announcing a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger. The merger will create a new company listed in Sydney, acquiring all outstanding shares of both entities with holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. The deal aims to simplify the structure, add scale, and create a more investable company by unwinding a 56-year mutual ownership designed to fend off hostile takeovers. The merger is expected to provide Brickworks shareholders with an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium over the stock's closing price last Friday.

          <p>A shooting at a house party in Hickory, North Carolina, resulted in the death of a 58-year-old man and injuries to eleven others, with victims ranging in age from 16 to 58. At least 80 shots were fired, causing people to run and seek cover, and the incident occurred in a normally quiet residential neighborhood. Authorities believe there was more than one shooter, and the investigation is ongoing with the assistance of the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation, the Hickory Police Department, and the FBI. The shooting took place approximately two hours after a noise complaint was filed regarding the party, though investigators do not believe the complaint was the motive.</p>

          <p>The United States' dependence on China for rare earth metals is causing significant shortages, as the US allowed its rare earth metals industry to relocate to China. This reliance now poses a threat to economic stability as China potentially restricts the supply of these critical materials. The shortages could impact various sectors, including technology and manufacturing, which rely on rare earth magnets for essential components. This situation highlights the need for the United States to re-establish its domestic rare earth metals industry to mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p>China has refuted accusations from the U.S. that it violated the Geneva trade agreement, claiming instead that the U.S. is undermining the deal by imposing export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals. A Chinese commerce department spokesperson stated that these actions "seriously undermine" the agreement reached in Geneva, and vowed to take measures to protect China's interests. Tensions between the two countries have escalated beyond trade, with the U.S. raising concerns about China's military pressure in the Indo-Pacific region, further complicating the already strained relationship. Despite these challenges, discussions between the two countries are still ongoing to come to a more stable agreement.</p>

Turnout appeared to be low, with voters struggling to choose from hundreds of largely unknown candidates, and some voters expressed feeling pressured to vote.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has amplified another outlandish conspiracy theory by reposting a user's false claim that President Biden was "executed" in 2020 and replaced by a robotic clone. This action is consistent with Trump's history of promoting unsubstantiated claims and misinformation. The spread of such theories contributes to political division and undermines public trust in institutions. The incident highlights the ongoing challenge of combating false narratives in the digital age.</p>

However, the current collective bargaining agreement stipulates that players can only earn 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, capped at $1m for the entire team. The MLSPA stated that the players have sought to meet with MLS to make changes, but the league has failed to bring forward a reasonable proposal.</p>

Gálvez advises residents planning extended stays abroad to apply for a re-entry permit and to consult with an immigration lawyer if they have a criminal history.
