          <p>The search for Madeleine McCann has entered its third day near Praia da Luz, Portugal, where she disappeared 18 years ago. German and Portuguese investigators are looking for evidence related to her disappearance, focusing on a 21 sq km site between where she went missing and where Christian Brückner, the prime suspect, stayed. Brückner is currently serving a prison sentence in Germany for an unrelated sexual assault case and has denied any involvement in McCann's disappearance. The investigation continues with the determination to uncover any new leads, despite no major discoveries being reported thus far. The ongoing search highlights the enduring mystery surrounding the case. </p>

Williams, who was nine weeks pregnant at the time, defeated her sister Venus in the final. She recalled having to rely on aces and winners due to her limited stamina and not telling many people about her pregnancy. Williams, who already achieved the "Golden Slam" in both singles and doubles tennis, said she had to intentionally lose points to regain her energy during the tournament. </p>

Germany is adapting its military posture in response to NATO's plans for collective defense, particularly on the alliance's eastern flank. Pistorius has proposed a model that relies on voluntary service but allows for compulsory conscription if needed. The plan involves sending questionnaires to all 18-year-olds to gauge their interest in the army, with a selection process for potential recruits. </p>

This change is projected to make 500,000 more pupils eligible, saving parents £500 a year and lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The Department for Education has allocated £1 billion to fund the change up to 2029, along with £13 million for food charities.

Sanjiv Singh, counsel for some victims' families, said the deal allows Boeing to avoid true criminal accountability.

          <p>Prosecutors in the mushroom trial allege that Erin Patterson, accused of murdering relatives with beef Wellington, documented herself using kitchen scales to calculate a lethal dose of toxic mushrooms. Patterson has pleaded not guilty to killing three people and attempting to murder another in July 2023, claiming it was a tragic accident. The prosecution presented photos from Patterson's phone depicting mushrooms being weighed, suggesting she measured the amount required to kill her guests. Patterson denied she knowingly foraged death cap mushrooms or that she intended to harm anyone. </p>

          <p>The US and China's fragile trade truce is showing signs of unraveling, with both sides accusing the other of violating the agreement. The US is seeking to cut its trade deficit with China, urging Beijing to boost purchases of American goods and eliminate non-tariff barriers. Washington has also demanded economic reforms and an end to the manipulation of the Chinese yuan. The Trump administration has prioritized maintaining the US’s technological edge over China, but there are growing concerns that the tariff policies are diverting resources and focus from US firms’ ability to achieve this goal.

A poll found younger people were more likely to disagree with the supreme court ruling that the legal definition of “woman” in the Equality Act is based on biological sex. The progressive explanation is that younger people are more relaxed about sex and sexuality and committed to personal freedoms. However, some argue that valuing inclusion over bodily privacy and fairness is sexist, as it disadvantages women more than men. </p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan has made a pitch to WWE legend Paul "Triple H" Levesque to bring WrestleMania, the wrestling promotion's biggest event, to London. Khan told CNBC's Tania Bryer that he would "love for WrestleMania to come to London." Speculation about London as a potential destination has been ongoing since 2023, when John Cena supported the idea. If the event were to come to London, it would be the first time it is hosted outside of North America, opening a completely new market for the WWE. </p>
