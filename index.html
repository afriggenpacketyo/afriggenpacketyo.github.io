          <p>The price of ether has notably climbed, outperforming bitcoin as President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major piece of crypto legislation in the U.S. Ether-based ETFs saw record inflows, surpassing those of bitcoin for the first time, signaling a potential shift in market leadership. This momentum is fueled by the new regulatory clarity for stablecoins and BlackRock's move to add staking to its ether ETF, boosting investor confidence in the crypto asset.

          <p>President Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, creating a regulatory framework for the stablecoin market and marking a significant milestone for the U.S. digital currency industry. During the White House ceremony, Trump hailed the legislation as a revolution in financial technology that would strengthen the U.S. dollar and unleash the promise of dollar-backed stablecoins. The bill, which passed with broad bipartisan support, is seen by the administration as a major validation for the crypto community.</p>

          <p>The UK's Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for south-east England, forecasting torrential rain and thunderstorms that could lead to dangerous flash floods over the weekend. Following a recent heatwave, the parched ground is less able to absorb water, increasing the risk of fast-flowing floodwaters, transport disruption, and power outages. More than a month's worth of rain is expected to fall in just a few hours, creating hazardous conditions for homes and travel.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has imposed sanctions on three Russian military intelligence (GRU) units and 18 individual officers for conducting a sustained campaign of malicious cyber activity. The Foreign Office stated that these spies were working to destabilize Europe by targeting UK media, infrastructure, and political institutions, linking the activity to Britain's support for Ukraine. This action runs parallel to new, stringent EU sanctions aimed at further pressuring Russia's economy and war machine.</p>

          <p>A new law enacted by the Trump administration will require visitors to the United States needing a nonimmigrant visa to pay a new "visa integrity fee" of at least $250. This charge is in addition to existing visa application fees and applies to tourists, business travelers, and international students. While the provision suggests the fee could be reimbursed if visitors comply with their visa terms, details on how the fee will be collected and refunded remain unclear, creating uncertainty for travelers.</p>
