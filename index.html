The royal couple fondly remembered their meeting with the pontiff during a state visit to Italy earlier this month. Cardinal Vincent Nichols and Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell also shared tributes, highlighting the Pope's dignity and service.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case challenging the Affordable Care Act's requirement for insurers to cover preventive care services without cost-sharing. The case, Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, focuses on the structure and authority of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which recommends these services. A lower court ruled the task force's structure unconstitutional, potentially limiting access to essential preventive care. Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett questioned the interpretation of "independent" regarding the task force's operations.</p>

The New York Times reported last week that the acting commissioner of the IRS was being replaced after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent complained that Musk had his preferred candidate installed without Bessent’s support.
