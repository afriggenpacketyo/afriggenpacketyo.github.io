          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated in an ABC News interview that targeting Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei could end the conflict between Israel and Iran, rather than escalate it. He dismissed concerns about escalating the conflict, arguing that Iran has been spreading terror and seeking nuclear weapons for half a century. Netanyahu affirmed Israel's commitment to doing what is necessary, including targeting Iranian nuclear scientists, likening them to "Hitler's nuclear team." He emphasized the importance of American support, framing the conflict as a battle between good and evil, and dismissed reports of Iran seeking negotiations as insincere. The State Department has issued a Level 4 travel advisory for Israel and the West Bank. Optimism regarding the situation remains low given the potential for further conflict. </p>

Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and wounding Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette.

          <p>Borrowing $1,000 from a payday lender can have a significant financial impact due to high fees and interest rates. Payday loans charge flat fees per $100 borrowed, which can result in APRs close to 400%.

          <p>The State Department has elevated its travel advisory for Israel to Level 4, advising U.S. citizens not to travel there due to "armed conflict, terrorism and civil unrest." This escalated warning follows the fourth day of attacks between Israel and Iran. The department also cautioned against travel to the West Bank and Gaza, citing similar dangers. The U.S. Embassy in Israel was closed due to the ongoing situation, with the American consulate in Tel Aviv sustaining minor damage from a nearby Iranian missile strike. </p>

The flight data recorder was recovered on Friday, and it is hoped the voice recorder will help determine the cause of the crash. The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau is leading the probe, assisted by teams from the U.S. and the U.K. At least 33 people on the ground were killed in the crash, and families are waiting for the remains of their loved ones. </p>

          <p>A review into abuse by grooming gangs in England and Wales highlights flaws in data collection, making it difficult to assess the scale of the issue. The report cites a lack of reliable data on ethnicity of perpetrators, though police data in some areas show disproportionate numbers of men from Asian ethnic backgrounds among suspects. It recommends a national inquiry into child sexual exploitation and tightening laws to ensure adults who have sex with a child under 16 are always charged with sexual assault. The report also calls for closing loopholes in taxi licensing standards. </p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has issued a warning about ticks due to the current warm weather, advising people to be tick aware when in grassy or wooded areas. If bitten, it's advised to remove the tick promptly using a tick removal device or fine-tipped tweezers, clean the area, and watch for a spreading bullseye rash, a symptom of Lyme disease. Precautions include using insect repellent, wearing long sleeves and trousers tucked into socks, and checking for ticks after being outdoors. Ticks can transmit pathogens, including Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. </p>
