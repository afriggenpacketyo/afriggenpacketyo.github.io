          <p>Shohei Ohtani faced significant batting struggles during the Dodgers' National League Division Series, managing only one hit in 18 at-bats with nine strikeouts. Manager Dave Roberts attributed some of this to tough left-handed pitching but emphasized Ohtani needs to improve his "at-bat quality." Roberts stated the team cannot win the World Series with such a performance, urging Ohtani to recalibrate his approach. The Dodgers are counting on their superstar to adjust for the upcoming NL Championship Series.</p>

          <p>Golf legend Tiger Woods has undergone his seventh back surgery to address a collapsed disc in his spine, casting doubt on his future return to the sport. The 49-year-old announced the lumbar disc replacement was successful, but a timeline for his recovery remains unknown. This procedure follows previous back surgeries and a ruptured Achilles earlier this year, further complicating his efforts to compete. Woods has made limited golfing appearances recently, primarily in the TGL indoor competition.</p>

          <p>Marineland in Canada is threatening to euthanize 30 beluga whales after being denied a permit to sell them to a Chinese theme park, citing financial struggles. The park, which has a history of animal mistreatment allegations and has seen 20 whales die since 2019, claims it cannot afford their continued care. Animal welfare advocates and officials are seeking alternative solutions, including a Nova Scotia sanctuary, but no immediate facility can accommodate all whales.

          <p>Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado, Venezuela's opposition leader, stated in an NPR interview that the country is in "profound, total chaos" under President Nicolás Maduro's "illegitimate" regime. Speaking from hiding, Machado accused Maduro of rigging the 2024 election and transforming Venezuela into a "safe haven" for US enemies. She called for Maduro's removal, asserting that regime change was already mandated by the Venezuelan people. Machado, who dedicated her Nobel Prize to Trump, sees him as an ally against Maduro's "criminal structure."</p>

          <p>Ocean City Mayor Richard Meehan has urged residents to brace for a powerful Nor'easter, with impacts expected to be similar to Superstorm Sandy in 2012. The storm, forecast from Saturday night through Monday, will bring heavy rain, strong winds up to 50 mph, and moderate coastal flooding. Areas like downtown and bayside neighborhoods are particularly vulnerable, with the Route 50 bridge potentially becoming impassable. Emergency services are on high alert, and a temporary shelter is opening, as officials advise securing loose items and parking on higher ground.</p>

          <p>China's push for AI leadership, exemplified by its new underwater data center in Hainan, faces significant challenges from US-Gulf partnerships. The US is strengthening chip supplies to the UAE, where billions are being invested in advanced AI data centers like Stargate UAE, leveraging US technology. While China focuses on cost-effective land-based solutions, the US government is taking financial stakes in semiconductor companies, accelerating data center production. This convergence of investment and supply chain demands positions the US to expand its lead, potentially thwarting China's near-term AI data center dominance.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deploy the National Guard in Illinois for patrol duties, partially upholding a lower court's decision. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals stated the Guard could remain under federal control but blocked their deployment in Chicago, deeming it "likely to lead to civil unrest." Illinois officials had sued, arguing the deployment was a "grave intrusion on Illinois' sovereignty." This ruling reinforces judicial checks on presidential authority regarding domestic military deployment.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest is reportedly considering Sean Dyche as a replacement for head coach Ange Postecoglou, whose future is uncertain following a seven-match winless start to his reign. Last Sunday's 2-0 Premier League loss at Newcastle was seen as a pivotal game, intensifying doubts about Postecoglou's position. While Postecoglou remains in charge, well-placed sources indicate Dyche is a leading candidate should the club decide to part ways with the former Tottenham boss, who took over in September.</p>
