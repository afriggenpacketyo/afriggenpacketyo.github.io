          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 20:21:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is finding it difficult to decrease the amount of foreign aid allocated to cover hotel expenses for asylum seekers within the country. Despite efforts to expedite asylum decisions and reduce reliance on hotels, the Home Office anticipates spending Â£2.2 billion of overseas development assistance (ODA) this financial year, nearly the same as the Â£2.3 billion spent in 2024/25. Critics argue this diverts funds from crucial humanitarian and development programs abroad, with the scale of spending leading to significant cuts in UK support for international priorities. The Home Office maintains it is working to reduce costs and end the use of asylum hotels by 2026, but some question the incentive since the money doesn't come from their budget. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla is grappling with significant challenges, exacerbated by CEO Elon Musk's escalating feud with President Donald Trump. What began as a policy disagreement over Trump's spending bill has devolved into a public spat, causing Tesla's stock to plummet and erasing billions in market value. This conflict threatens Tesla's relationship with the government, potentially impacting regulations, investigations, and support for the company. Furthermore, Tesla faces increasing competition from lower-cost EV makers in China and a consumer backlash against Musk's political activities, leading to vandalism, protests, and tariff concerns.

          <p>Former Steeler Ryan Clark expressed his disapproval of the Pittsburgh Steelers signing quarterback Aaron Rodgers, stating that it would keep the team in a state of mediocrity.

He anticipates the Steelers will contend for a wild-card spot but will ultimately fall short of their championship aspirations. The Steelers acquired Rodgers on a one-year deal after his departure from the New York Jets, where his tenure was marred by injuries and disappointing performance. </p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that the Russian truck drivers involved in transporting platforms for Ukraine's drone attack on Russian warplanes were unaware of their cargo's true nature.

He emphasized that Ukraine used only its own weapons in the operation, avoiding the deployment of equipment from allied nations. The attack reportedly damaged over 40 Russian bombers, significantly impacting Russia's strategic bomber fleet.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's public row with President Donald Trump has raised concerns about the potential impact on his businesses, particularly Tesla and SpaceX. Tesla shares experienced a significant drop following Musk's social media criticism of Trump. While some analysts believe the feud could damage Musk's reputation and business prospects, others suggest it could rehabilitate him in the eyes of those who opposed his previous closeness to the president. The conflict adds to existing challenges for Tesla, including increased competition and protests against Musk's political views.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's immigration policies are facing increased scrutiny, with new travel bans and restrictions on foreign nationals entering the U.S. The administration has imposed travel bans on multiple countries, citing concerns about vetting and visa overstays. Critics argue that these policies are rooted in xenophobia and are harming the U.S.'s reputation as a welcoming destination. These policies have led to a decline in tourist spending and strained relationships with foreign leaders.</p>
