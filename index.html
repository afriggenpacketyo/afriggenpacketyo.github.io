          <p>President Vladimir Putin has ordered a 72-hour cease-fire in Ukraine, beginning May 8, to coincide with Russia's celebration of Victory Day, marking the Soviet Union's triumph in World War II. This marks the second temporary pause in fighting within two weeks amidst growing impatience from President Trump regarding Russia's reluctance to end the war. Kremlin spokesman Dmitri S. Peskov emphasized Russia's commitment to a peaceful resolution, urging Ukraine to reciprocate the cease-fire. The ordered cessation of hostilities is intended to demonstrate Russia's willingness to de-escalate and pursue diplomatic solutions, though skepticism remains regarding the long-term impact on the conflict. </p>

          <p>Representative Gerry Connolly, a leading Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, announced his plans to step down from his role and retire from Congress due to the return of his cancer. Connolly, who was first elected in 2009 and recently defeated Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for the committee chair, had previously disclosed his diagnosis of esophageal cancer six months prior. He expressed pride in his accomplishments over his 30-year career and affirmed his commitment to continue representing his constituents during his remaining term.

          <p>Starbucks' significant investment in China is encountering increasing challenges, prompting questions about its long-term viability in the market. Stiff competition from local brands, coupled with Chinese consumers tightening their belts, has led to a decline in Starbucks' revenue and same-store sales. President Trump's escalating trade war is exacerbating the situation, fueling anti-American sentiment and driving customers away from Starbucks stores. Analysts suggest that Starbucks needs to re-evaluate its strategy, possibly by focusing on a premium consumer segment or seeking a Chinese business partner, as its current approach of mass-market appeal is proving unsuccessful.

          <p>ESG (environmental, social, and governance) funds are experiencing continued outflows as investors react to President Trump's policies, particularly his "anti-climate agenda" and initiatives targeting diversity and inclusion. Investors withdrew $6.1 billion from ESG funds in the first quarter of 2025, marking the tenth consecutive quarter of outflows. The report suggests that the backlash against ESG investing is intensifying due to the Trump administration's stance on environmental and social issues. As of the end of Q1, U.S. investors held $330 billion in ESG funds, representing approximately 10% of the global total. </p>
