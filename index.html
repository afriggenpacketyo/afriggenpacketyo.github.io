        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid ongoing US-China tensions, a significant contrast has emerged in their energy policies. China is aggressively pursuing renewable energy goals and increasing investments, driven by the need to power technology like AI and secure a global tech lead. Conversely, the Trump administration is moving to cancel tax credits for wind and solar, labeling them "unreliable" and a threat to the American electric grid. This divergence positions China to potentially surge ahead in the global race for sustainable energy dominance.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has threatened to obstruct a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium unless the team reverts to its former "Redskins" name. In social media posts, he claimed there is significant public demand for the change, also calling for the Cleveland Guardians to become the Indians again. It remains unclear how he could intervene in the project, which involves federally controlled land that Congress granted to Washington, D.C., for redevelopment.</p>

          <p>Canada is experiencing a significant measles outbreak, with over 3,800 cases in 2025, surpassing the United States despite its smaller population. The surge, most prominent in Alberta and Ontario, has placed Canada among the top 10 countries with measles outbreaks globally. Health officials link the spread to low vaccination rates, particularly in some Mennonite communities, and a rise in post-pandemic anti-vaccine misinformation. Experts warn that the actual number of cases is likely underreported and stress the urgent need for increased immunizations to contain the highly contagious virus.</p>

          <p>Scott Turner, the current Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and a former player for the Washington Redskins, has publicly supported Donald Trump's push for the Commanders to revert to their old name.

His endorsement adds the perspective of a former player and a member of the administration to the ongoing debate over the NFL team's identity.</p>

Other tailwinds include massive infrastructure needs for data centers and the electric grid, relaxed lending standards for banks, and a potential boom in IPOs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has warned that people retiring in 2050 will be financially worse off than today's pensioners unless retirement savings are significantly boosted. To address this, the Department for Work and Pensions is reviving the Pensions Commission to find solutions, as nearly half of working-age adults are not saving into a private pension. The analysis highlights stark disparities, with low earners, the self-employed, women, and certain ethnic groups being the least likely to be saving adequately for their retirement. The commission aims to build a national consensus on a future strategy to prevent a widespread decline in retirement living standards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the use of detention facilities. This shift coincides with a perception that the program is targeting more than just dangerous criminals. Meanwhile, the poll reveals a persistent demand for the administration to focus more on lowering prices, with high disapproval of its handling of inflation. The findings suggest Mr. Trump's approval is increasingly defined by his base, while the broader public expresses growing doubts about his key policies.</p>

          <p>Aurora police are investigating a shooting that left a man with life-threatening injuries early Sunday morning. The victim was found in a roadway just blocks from a large house party that neighbors said involved hundreds of cars and high school-aged attendees. Residents reported hearing multiple gunshots and described a chaotic scene as people fled the area. Investigators believe the injured man may have been at the party, which took place at a house that appeared to be vacant and for sale. No arrests have been made.</p>

          <h2>US Businesses in China Face Uncertainty Amid Ongoing Tariff Negotiations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 18:00:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Sean Stein, president of the US-China Business Council, American companies operating in China are navigating a precarious environment as trade negotiations continue. While an extension of the current 90-day tariff pause seems likely, the business community is concerned that discussions have focused almost exclusively on tariffs, ignoring deeper structural issues. Stein notes that while China's recent move to restrict fentanyl precursors could lead to reciprocal tariff reductions from the U.S., progress has been slow. This leaves businesses walking a tightrope, trying to maintain operations amid persistent geopolitical and economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tech entrepreneur Adam Miller's nonprofit, Better Angels, is aiming to prove that affordable housing can be built profitably without taxpayer subsidies. The organization is bidding on several projects in the Los Angeles area, proposing to finance them with a mix of private equity and conventional loans. By simplifying the capital structure and avoiding the lengthy process of securing tax credits, Better Angels claims it can build faster and at a fraction of the cost of typical affordable projects. The goal is to create a new, market-driven model that attracts capitalist investment to solve the affordable housing crisis.</p>

          <p>The long-delayed 9/11 criminal trials at Guantanamo Bay face further setbacks after plea deals for the defendants, including Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, were canceled. The deals would have avoided a death penalty trial in exchange for guilty pleas and life sentences, offering a potential path to closure. Legal experts suggest the manner in which the deals were overruled will itself provoke more litigation, extending the cycle of pretrial hearings that has lasted for years. This development leaves the prospect of a final verdict uncertain, frustrating some 9/11 family members who see plea deals as the only viable way to achieve any form of resolution.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died on Long Island, New York, after being violently pulled into a running MRI machine by a heavy metal chain he was wearing around his neck. The man, who was not a patient, had reportedly entered the MRI room without permission to assist his wife after her scan. The powerful magnetic field of the machine drew him in, causing a fatal "medical episode." MRI facilities have strict protocols requiring the removal of all metal objects due to the immense magnetic force, which can turn them into dangerous projectiles.</p>

          <p>England defender Lucy Bronze has spoken out about the increasing abuse faced by players in women's football, stating that as the sport's profile grows, so does the negativity. Her comments follow those of teammate Jess Carter, who revealed she received racist messages during the Euro 2025 tournament. Bronze noted that while men's football sees more abuse in stadiums, women's football appears to be a specific target for online harassment. The Lionesses team is aware of the issue and is committed to using its platform to push for change and greater accountability from social media companies.</p>

          <p>A new ombudsman with legal powers will be created to handle consumer complaints against water companies in the UK, addressing issues like leaks, incorrect billing, and pollution. The announcement is part of a broader overhaul of the water industry following public outrage over rising bills and record sewage discharges into waterways. The Environment Secretary has described the sector as "broken" and vowed to halve sewage spills by 2030. The new watchdog will serve as a single point of contact for consumers, bringing the water industry's complaint process in line with other utilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent visit to China aimed to stabilize relations, subsequent actions by his government may be counterproductive. The author contends that by potentially forcing the sale of the Chinese-leased Darwin Port, Australia is sending mixed signals and undermining its own diplomatic efforts. The piece suggests that such moves sabotage attempts to convince China that Australia is a reliable partner for trade and investment. It highlights a disconnect between the positive rhetoric of the visit and the more confrontational policy actions being considered back home.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has sharply criticized the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, stating the raids have spread widespread fear throughout the city's large immigrant population. In an interview, she described how many residents, including legal residents and citizens, are now afraid to leave their homes, impacting local businesses and community life. Bass condemned the use of what she called "masked men in unmarked cars" by ICE, arguing it created confusion and fear of kidnappings. While acknowledging federal help during recent wildfires, she asserted that the administration's immigration policy has been purely punitive.</p>

Created by artist Robert Vargas, the vibrant artwork depicts Valenzuela in his famous wind-up and tipping his cap, celebrating his role as a cultural unifier for the Latino community. Valenzuela's career in the 1980s sparked "Fernandomania," connecting the Dodgers with a new generation of Latino fans.
