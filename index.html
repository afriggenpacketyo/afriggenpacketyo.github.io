          <p>A powerful line of storms is moving across the Midwest, causing widespread power outages and property damage with wind gusts exceeding 90 mph. Concurrently, a severe heat dome is impacting over 165 million Americans from the South to the Northeast, with heat indices potentially reaching 116 degrees. This dangerous combination of extreme weather highlights ongoing atmospheric instability, as the storms are being fueled by the intense heat. The conditions have also led to poor air quality along the I-95 corridor, exacerbated by Canadian wildfire smoke.</p>

          <p>The man responsible for the mass shooting in a Midtown Manhattan office building left a note claiming he suffered from CTE and blaming the NFL for his condition. The suspect, Shane Tamura, killed four people before taking his own life in the same building that houses the NFL's headquarters. According to police sources, the note asked for his brain to be studied, though he had no known history of a formal CTE diagnosis or any connection to professional football. The investigation revealed he had a history of mental health holds in Nevada.</p>

          <p>Union Pacific has made an $85 billion offer to acquire Norfolk Southern, a deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the United States. The companies argue the merger would streamline deliveries, but the proposal faces intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators due to concerns about industry consolidation. If approved, the move could pressure the remaining major U.S. railroads, BNSF and CSX, to pursue their own merger to remain competitive. (not investment advice)</p>

Key reasons include repeated delays in implementing the steepest tariffs, companies stockpiling goods in advance, and importers holding back shipments amid uncertainty. Many businesses are also absorbing the initial costs rather than passing them on to shoppers, though some targeted price hikes are beginning to appear. (not investment advice)</p>
