          <h2>Argentina Implements Stricter Immigration Policies Under Milei's Leadership</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 01:11:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Argentina's President Javier Milei has enacted a decree to tighten immigration controls, requiring immigrants to reside in Argentina for two uninterrupted years or make a significant financial investment to gain citizenship. The new measures also mandate proof of income and clean criminal records for permanent residency applicants. The decree facilitates the deportation of migrants who enter the country illegally or falsify documents and charges foreigners for public health care and education, with officials claiming public hospitals spent $100 million on treating foreigners last year. This shift has drawn comparisons to policies of the Trump administration and sparked debate over Argentina's tradition of openness to immigrants.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's economy is experiencing a boom due to a surge in pharmaceutical exports, particularly driven by Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications, Wegovy and Ozempic. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Denmark's economic growth to moderate from 3.7% in 2024 to 2.9% this year and 1.8% in 2026, but potential U.S. tariffs on the pharma industry are not expected to significantly impact the country. This is because most Danish drug products are neither produced in the country nor cross its borders, relying on a merchanting and processing system where intellectual property is key and manufacturing is contracted out.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling the release of its rice reserves to address soaring rice prices, which have reached near-record highs. This action is being considered due to a rice shortage partly caused by a poor harvest in the summer of 2023 and an increase in rice consumption at restaurants due to more foreign tourists. The government is studying the possibility of releasing 100,000 tons of reserve rice per month for three months through July, in addition to the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. To encourage participation in auctions, the government is also considering relaxing the requirement for distributors to buy back the same amount of rice within a year.</p>

          <p>Ford is recalling approximately 274,000 Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs in the U.S. due to a potential installation defect that may cause a loss of brake function while driving. The front brake lines in the recalled vehicles may come into contact with the engine air cleaner outlet pipe, potentially leading to a brake fluid leak and reduced braking performance. Impacted drivers may experience increased pedal travel or a red brake warning indicator. Ford dealers will inspect and replace the brake line or air cleaner outlet pipe as needed, free of charge, with owner notifications scheduled to begin in late May.</p>

          <p>London police are intensifying their search for the parents of three newborns abandoned in east London between 2017 and 2024, focusing on approximately 400 nearby houses. The babies, Harry, Roman, and Elsa, were each found in similar circumstances, leading police to believe they share the same parents. Detectives are requesting DNA samples from residents and contacting individuals in the national DNA database who may share familial DNA with the children's mother. Police speculate the mother may be unable to come forward due to mental or physical health problems, or some form of restraint, and are working with experts to identify her and prevent future abandonments.</p>

          <p>W.J. Hennigan writes in the New York Times about the recent near-war situation between India and Pakistan, where a tenuous cease-fire is holding after exchanges of airstrikes and drone attacks on military infrastructure brought the two nuclear-armed nations to the edge of war. The conflict was triggered by alleged terrorist attacks in Indian-administered Kashmir, leading to retaliatory strikes by India and subsequent drone attacks by Pakistan. Intervention by the Trump administration, including warnings to Prime Minister Modi, was crucial in de-escalating the situation. The article underscores the urgent need for diplomacy to prevent future escalations and potential nuclear conflict between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The Independent Schools Council (ISC) reports that the average cost of private school education in the UK has risen by 22.6% in the last year following the introduction of VAT on fees. This increase is higher than government predictions, and the ISC anticipates a decrease in private school applications as a result. The average termly fee for a day school in January was Â£7,382, including 20% VAT. Parents are already leaving the sector due to the increased costs, with some families finding private education unaffordable due to the tax changes.</p>

The proposed budget would also streamline permitting for fossil fuels and rescind Clean Air Act pollution funding.

          <p>US lawmakers are contemplating a restructuring of the State Department to better align economic and foreign policy goals, as major economies increasingly bypass the United States in forming new alliances. During a House subcommittee hearing, witnesses and lawmakers agreed on the need for closer economic engagement with trading partners to counter China's growing influence. The discussion emphasized the necessity for enhanced coordination among various US government agencies to address concerns that economic security and policy are integral to foreign policy. The hearing was held against the backdrop of unpredictable tariff actions by the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Former Attorney General Pam Bondi sold at least $1 million worth of shares in Trump Media, the company owning Truth Social, on the same day President Trump announced sweeping tariff measures. Bondi's stake in the company was valued between $1 million and $5.5 million at the time of the sale, which occurred on April 2. Trump Media and Technology Group reported a $400.9 million loss in 2024, while annual revenue declined 12% to $3.6 million. The timing of Bondi's sale has raised questions, especially given her previous role as a consultant for the company.</p>

Two medieval history professors, David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent, authenticated the document, making it one of only seven such originals in existence. The discovery highlights the importance of the Magna Carta as a cornerstone of freedoms and constitutional history. The document's journey from Appleby, Cumbria, to Harvard involved a series of owners, including the Lowthers and Thomas Clarkson.</p>

          <p>The New York Times analyzes Eurovision winners since 2000 to reveal winning strategies. Successful entries often sing about personal liberation in English, allude to folk music, and feature elaborate staging with fire. However, dramatic key changes and novelty acts are best avoided. Conchita Wurst's "Rise Like a Phoenix" exemplifies personal empowerment, while Ruslana's "Wild Dances" blends English lyrics with folk elements. The key is to be spectacular and slightly weird, but avoid being overly silly or relying on outdated gimmicks.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read murder trial, a forensic scientist testified that blood evidence collected in red Solo cups was never tested in connection to the death of John O'Keefe. Maureen Hartnett, from the Massachusetts State Police Crime Lab, stated that she found broken glass, scratches, and a dent on Read's SUV, along with blood and debris from O'Keefe's clothes, but the items in the cups were not analyzed. As a result, the nature of the red substance collected by Canton Police from the lawn where O'Keefe was found remains unknown.

The law, set to take full effect in December, seeks to prevent the tech giants from excluding app competitors from their proprietary app stores. It also prohibits the companies from using data obtained from their app stores or operating systems to gain an advantage in their own products and services.
