          <p>Resorts World Sentosa is moving forward with its S$6.8 billion expansion despite receiving a shortened two-year casino license renewal from Singapore's Gambling Regulatory Authority due to 'unsatisfactory' tourism performance. CEO Lee Shi Ruh stated the company's focus is shifting from shopping to unique experiences, such as the new Minion Land and the upcoming Super Nintendo World, to transform the resort into a premium lifestyle destination. This strategic pivot aims to address the regulator's concerns and secure a full three-year license renewal in 2026 by enhancing its appeal as a compelling tourist destination.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has threatened immediate legal action against Apple, accusing the company of antitrust violations related to the App Store rankings of his Grok AI chatbot. Musk alleges that Apple's practices make it impossible for any AI company other than its partner, OpenAI, to achieve the top ranking, which he claims is an 'unequivocal antitrust violation.' The threat escalates an ongoing feud between Musk and OpenAI, a company he co-founded, and adds to Apple's existing legal challenges, including a landmark antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice over its iPhone ecosystem.</p>

          <h2>Western Australian Coral Reefs Suffer Worst Bleaching Event on Record</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 22:52:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists report that coral reefs along the coast of Western Australia have experienced their most severe bleaching event ever recorded, caused by a prolonged and intense marine heatwave. The damage spans over 1,500 kilometers and affects previously resilient areas like Ningaloo and the Rowley Shoals, which had offered hope against the impacts of climate change. According to the Australian Institute of Marine Science, many reefs suffered heat stress for 15 to 30 weeks, far exceeding the eight-week threshold that typically causes coral mortality. This event is part of a two-year global bleaching crisis driven by record-high ocean temperatures.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to extend their trade truce for an additional 90 days, postponing a significant tariff increase that was set to take effect. Under the extension, the U.S. will maintain its 30% tariffs on Chinese imports, while China will keep its 10% tariff on American goods, providing more time for negotiations on trade imbalances and market access. The White House cited the nearly $300 billion trade deficit with China in 2024 as a key issue, while Beijing has called for the U.S. to lift what it terms 'unreasonable' restrictions.

The lawsuit alleges that Ohtani and Balelo used their celebrity leverage to have the plaintiffs improperly removed from a $240 million luxury housing project they had developed and for which Ohtani was the celebrity endorser. The plaintiffs claim they were fired from the project by their business partner, Kingsbarn Realty Capital, solely to placate Balelo's escalating demands.

A local council member described the city's main commercial street as a 'ghost town,' with residents afraid to go out and businesses locking their doors during operating hours to protect customers. This climate of fear is reportedly causing a sharp decline in local business and sales tax revenue, which in turn reduces funding for essential community services.

          <p>In Mexico City's Xochimilco borough, scientists are using environmental DNA (eDNA) to search for the critically endangered axolotl salamander. With wild sightings now nearly impossible, researchers from Mexico's National Autonomous University are filtering water from the canals to find genetic traces of the elusive creature. So far, axolotl DNA has been found primarily within protected refuge areas where water quality is higher, but one positive result outside these zones offers a slight hope for resilience. The research aims to update the population census and underscores the urgent need for habitat restoration to save the species.</p>

          <h2>Newly Discovered 2014 Greenland Flood Raises Questions About Ice Sheet Behavior</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-11 19:30:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Scientists have uncovered evidence of a massive, previously undetected flood in Greenland from 2014, where over 24 billion gallons of meltwater burst through a 300-foot-thick ice sheet. Published in Nature Geoscience, the study reveals the first known instance of meltwater breaking through the ice from below, challenging existing models of how water moves within the ice sheet. This surprising discovery indicates there is much more to learn about Greenland's complex hydrological system. It also heightens concerns about the stability of the ice sheet, which is already melting at an alarming rate due to climate change.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's military has announced that a joint air and ground operation in the northwestern state of Zamfara resulted in the deaths of more than 100 armed gang members. The operation was launched after intelligence indicated that a large group of over 400 gang members, often referred to as 'bandits,' was preparing to attack a village. These armed groups have been terrorizing communities in the region for years, engaging in kidnapping for ransom and other violent crimes. Despite repeated military efforts, the violence has persisted, exacerbating a severe malnutrition crisis by displacing farmers.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Federalization of DC Police Seen as Authoritarian Precedent</h2>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic frames President Trump's decision to federalize the D.C. police and deploy the National Guard as a significant and troubling action. The article argues that the move, justified by the White House with out-of-date crime statistics, sets a dangerous precedent for using armed forces in American cities under spurious emergency declarations. It points out the irony of conservatives, who previously accused Democrats of creating a 'police state,' now supporting this move. The piece contends the action is a political stunt that treats the District of Columbia as a presidential fiefdom rather than addressing public safety.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer commented on the Trump administration's deal requiring Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. Cramer argued the move is not novel, comparing the 15% cut to another form of a tariff that ultimately benefits the U.S. Treasury and is not unprecedented, citing past government interventions. He suggested that while the policy has 'pay-to-play' elements, allowing the chipmakers to access the Chinese market is a positive development for the companies and taxpayers.

          <p>Colorado is battling two major wildfires, with over 1,000 firefighters deployed to combat the blazes under dry and windy conditions. The Lee fire has become the fifth largest in the state's history, burning over 130,000 acres with minimal containment due to extreme drought and volatile fuel loads. A second blaze, the Elk fire, has scorched more than 14,000 acres, though crews have made better progress on containment. The fires have forced evacuations in several mountain communities and prompted air quality warnings, reflecting an explosive fire season across North America exacerbated by the climate crisis.</p>

          <p>President Trump's justification for federalizing the D.C. police force is based on claims of rampant crime that are contradicted by official statistics, similar to his previous narratives about Los Angeles. The article points out that while D.C. saw a homicide spike in 2023, violent crime in 2024 has fallen to a 30-year low, a fact ignored by the administration. Experts note that Trump's portrayal of Washington as a 'lawless hellscape' is a misleading tactic. This approach of using false narratives to justify federal intervention mirrors his actions in Los Angeles during protests against his immigration policies.</p>

          <p>England soccer player Jess Carter has spoken out about the intense fear of racist abuse she and her Black teammates face, particularly concerning penalty shootouts. She revealed feeling a 'sigh of relief' when white teammates also missed penalties in the Euro 2025 quarter-final, fearing that the racist backlash against Lauren James would have been 'astronomical' if she were the only one to miss. Carter, who was a target of online racism during the tournament, described how the abuse made her feel small and even 'scared to play' in the final. Her testimony highlights the severe psychological impact of racism on athletes.</p>
