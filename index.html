          <p>A man has been found guilty of murdering 57-year-old Anita Rose in Brantham, Suffolk, last summer. Ms. Rose was discovered with severe injuries on a footpath while walking her dog and died in the hospital four days later. The perpetrator, Roy Barclay, had been on the run for two years before the attack and denied the charges. A jury at Ipswich Crown Court delivered a unanimous guilty verdict, and the judge has indicated that Barclay will receive a life sentence.</p>

          <p>Monsoon rains have caused deadly flash flooding in the mountain resort village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, leading to three fatalities. A man and two young children were swept away by the fast-moving waters after the Rio Ruidoso crested at a record-breaking 20 feet. The severe flooding, exacerbated by burn scars from previous wildfires, prompted dozens of swift-water rescues. New Mexico's governor has signed an emergency declaration to request federal assistance for the recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>An Australian jury has convicted Erin Patterson on three counts of murder and one of attempted murder for intentionally serving a meal with toxic death cap mushrooms. The victims were family members who consumed the poisonous fungi in 2023. This article explains that death cap mushrooms contain alpha-Amanitin, a heat-stable toxin that causes severe liver failure and death. Experts noted these mushrooms only grow near specific trees, making their accidental inclusion in a meal with store-bought ingredients highly improbable.</p>

          <p>A group of Senate Democrats is introducing a bill to establish a new inspector general office dedicated to overseeing the Executive Office of the President. The proposed legislation aims to provide independent oversight of the White House, similar to the watchdog roles that exist in other federal agencies. Proponents argue that this measure is a necessary check on executive power to root out potential fraud and abuse, regardless of who is in office. The bill faces significant challenges in the Republican-controlled Congress, where similar past efforts have failed to advance.</p>

An estimated 30,000 people were infected with HIV and hepatitis from contaminated NHS blood products in the 1970s and 80s.

          <h2>Individuals Increasingly Face Climate Risks as Government Disaster Preparedness Falters</h2>

          <p>This article explores the growing need for individuals to take personal responsibility for climate disaster preparedness amid federal funding and staffing cuts to key agencies like FEMA and the National Weather Service. With the increasing frequency of events like wildfires, hurricanes, and floods, the piece advises homeowners to assess their specific local risks and "harden" their homes against them. It highlights that while individual actions are important, community-wide and landscape-scale solutions are critical for true resilience. The erosion of federal support systems places a greater burden on individuals to manage climate-related threats.</p>

          <p>A large wildfire that reached the edge of Marseille, France, has left more than 100 people, including firefighters and police officers, with minor injuries. The blaze, which authorities say was sparked by a car fire, forced the evacuation of at least 400 residents and temporarily shut down the Marseille Provence airport. Fanned by strong winds and dry conditions, the fire spread rapidly through the hilly landscape north of the city. Firefighters continue to battle the fire, which is now decreasing but not yet fully under control.</p>

          <p>Indirect negotiations in Qatar between Israel and Hamas for a new ceasefire and hostage release deal have reportedly stalled after three days. A Palestinian official indicated that key disagreements remain over the distribution of humanitarian aid and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from parts of Gaza. This development comes despite recent high-profile meetings between the Israeli Prime Minister and the U.S. President, which had raised hopes for a breakthrough. The impasse underscores the deep complexities involved in reaching an agreement to halt the 21-month-long war.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has launched its 41st annual Han Kuang military exercise, the largest and longest in its history, designed to simulate a realistic, protracted conflict with mainland China. The 10-day-long war games have been expanded and are being conducted without scripts to better prepare for battlefield unpredictability. This year's drills began by simulating Beijing's "grey-zone" tactics and will focus on a multi-stage conflict scenario. The changes reflect Taiwan's response to escalating military pressure from China's People's Liberation Army.</p>

          <p>The Red Bull Formula 1 team has dismissed its team principal, Christian Horner, after 20 years in the role. The sacking comes more than a year after Horner was accused of inappropriate behavior by a female colleague, a scandal that has clouded the team despite an internal investigation clearing him. While Red Bull did not state a reason for the dismissal, the move follows a period of internal tension and a decline in the team's on-track performance this season.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has lifted a lower court's order, allowing the Trump administration to move forward with its plans for large-scale layoffs of federal workers. The decision enables "reductions in force" at numerous government agencies, which could affect hundreds of thousands of employees and potentially disrupt government services. The executive order directing the cuts had been frozen by a district judge who argued the president lacked congressional authorization for such a broad restructuring. The ruling is a significant victory for the administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce.</p>

          <p>Records show that Texas state health inspectors reviewed and signed off on Camp Mystic's emergency plans just two days before the catastrophic flood that killed at least 27 people at the camp.

This revelation raises questions about the adequacy of the plans and the inspection process itself in the face of such a severe weather event, adding a layer of potential systemic failure to the tragedy.</p>

During the year, the firm actively rebalanced its portfolio, making SG$52 billion in new investments while divesting SG$42 billion, the largest divestment amount in over two decades.

          <p>Six months after its launch, New York City's congestion pricing program has led to significant reductions in traffic and pollution, but it continues to face opposition from the Trump administration. The $9 charge for cars entering Manhattan's core has cut traffic delays by a quarter, improved air quality, and raised nearly $500 million for public transit upgrades. Despite these tangible benefits and growing public support, the U.S. Department of Transportation has continued its legal efforts to dismantle the program.
