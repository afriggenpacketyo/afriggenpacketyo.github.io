          <p>Authorities identified 30-year-old Patrick Joseph White as the gunman responsible for a deadly shooting near Atlanta's CDC headquarters and Emory University campus. The violent incident, which unfolded Friday evening, resulted in the tragic deaths of the suspect and DeKalb County Police Officer David Rose, a father of three. While the attack prompted a campus-wide lockdown and left bullet marks on several federal buildings, no CDC employees or Emory students were physically harmed in the chaos. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is now leading a comprehensive inquiry to determine the motive behind the rampage, having recovered a long gun and three other firearms at the scene.</p>

          <p>A shooting in Manhattan's Times Square early Saturday morning left three people injured, including two teenagers and a 65-year-old man. The incident reportedly began as a fight inside a Raising Cane's restaurant before spilling onto the street at 44th Street and Seventh Avenue. A 19-year-old male was shot in the foot, an 18-year-old female sustained a graze wound to the neck, and the older man was shot in the leg; all were hospitalized in stable condition. The New York City Police Department has a 17-year-old suspect in custody and has recovered a firearm from the scene as the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested more than 150 people at a demonstration in Parliament Square held in support of Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under UK terrorism laws. Protesters, organized by Defend Our Juries, displayed signs with the message "I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action," intentionally violating the ban that makes supporting the group a criminal offense. The government outlawed Palestine Action in July after activists caused millions in damages to military aircraft. The protest occurred amid a heavy police presence, with authorities vowing to arrest anyone expressing support for the banned organization.</p>

          <p>William H. Webster, the only person to have led both the FBI and the CIA, has died at the age of 101. Appointed to head the FBI by President Carter in 1978, he was credited with restoring the agency's reputation after a period of scandal and expanding its capabilities to address terrorism. In 1987, President Reagan tapped him to lead the CIA, where he worked to rebuild trust with Congress following the Iran-Contra affair. Known for his integrity and non-partisan approach, Webster's long career in public service also included time as a federal judge and prosecutor before his appointments in Washington.</p>

Scammers purchase personal information from data brokers to create highly convincing, personalized offers for 401(k) rollovers or annuity upgrades. These fraudulent communications often mimic legitimate financial institutions, using real data points like age and net worth to build trust before soliciting private financial details or direct fund transfers. The article advises vigilance against unsolicited offers and pressure tactics, recommending data removal services and direct verification with financial advisors to protect against these schemes.</p>

          <p>William Bengen, the financial advisor who created the widely cited "4% rule" for retirement withdrawals, now suggests a higher rate of 4.7% is safe for a 30-year retirement. In a new book, he argues that most retirees are too conservative and could spend more by using a more sophisticated and diversified investment strategy that includes small-company stocks and a rising equity glide path. Bengen's updated research accounts for a wider range of assets and historical market conditions, noting that high inflation remains the biggest threat to retirement portfolios. He emphasizes that this is a baseline for the worst-case scenario, and many could withdraw even more (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A major new exhibition explores the life and work of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch artist who was one of the most celebrated flower painters of her era, even surpassing Rembrandt and Vermeer in fame during her lifetime. The daughter of a famous anatomist and embalmer, Ruysch channeled her unique upbringing surrounded by preserved natural specimens into creating intricate and vibrant still-life paintings. The article details her successful career, which spanned nearly 70 years, and the context of the Dutch Golden Age, where her art converted perishable, exotic flowers from a global empire into permanent, treasured objects. Her work is examined as a blend of aesthetic beauty, scientific detail, and moral messaging.</p>

          <p>A panel discussion featuring journalists from The Atlantic, ABC News, and The New York Times explored the implications of President Trump's upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Panelists noted that the summit marks a significant departure from the previous administration's policy of "Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine," suggesting Kyiv is being sidelined in negotiations about its own future. This shift places Ukraine in a precarious position, with its sovereignty potentially being negotiated by the U.S. and Russia without its direct participation at the main table. The discussion highlights concerns that Trump may pressure Ukraine into accepting a deal that favors Russian interests to end the war.</p>

          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has reported an additional 11 deaths from malnutrition, raising the total to 212, including 98 children. This comes as Israel announces a controversial new plan to take full security control of Gaza, beginning with a military siege of Gaza City after a two-month evacuation deadline ending on October 7, 2025. The plan involves forcibly displacing an estimated one million Palestinians to the al-Mawasi tent encampment in the south, a move widely condemned by humanitarian agencies. Aid distribution continues to be severely hampered, with the UN reporting that over 1,300 Palestinians have been killed while seeking food since late May.</p>

The WLFI tokens are not classified as securities by the SEC, which means they are not subject to the same regulatory scrutiny as traditional investments.

The one-on-one summit is aimed at negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, a conflict Trump once claimed he could resolve within 24 hours.

Trump also suggested that any peace deal would likely involve territorial concessions, stating there would be "some swapping of territories to the betterment of both."

His attorney, Kelley Henry, called the event "torture," noting that staff struggled for ten minutes to insert an IV and that Black lifted his head in distress multiple times.

The move follows a similar action by Seoul earlier in the week and appears to be a positive response to diplomatic overtures from South Korea's new president, Lee Jae Myung. The cross-border broadcasts, which had been a source of friction for years, were recently resumed in response to a campaign of trash-filled balloons sent from the North. The dismantling of the speakers suggests a mutual effort to de-escalate and improve inter-Korean relations after a period of heightened animosity.</p>

          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are finding new life by replacing vacant anchor stores like Sears with unconventional tenants such as churches, entertainment venues, and hotels. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold a former Sears space to Crossroads Church, which now draws thousands of people to the mall each week, boosting traffic for remaining retailers. Industry experts note that this trend of subdividing large retail spaces for a mix of tenants, including popular destinations like Barnes & Noble and Dave & Buster's, is driving a rebound in mall visits. This strategy creates a new kind of community hub, appealing to younger generations who value in-person experiences.</p>

When a specialist finally ordered an MRI, doctors discovered the true cause was not the concussion but a rare, underlying condition called an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in his brain. The AVM, which was likely the source of his chronic headaches all along, posed a significant risk of rupture and brain bleeding. Logan successfully underwent surgery to remove the AVM and is now recovering, with his family advocating for earlier diagnostic imaging for persistent post-concussion symptoms.</p>

          <p>A San Francisco startup, Marathon Fusion, has proposed a modern form of alchemy: manufacturing tons of gold by repurposing neutrons generated during the nuclear fusion process. The speculative idea, not yet peer-reviewed, suggests that transmuting mercury into gold could create a valuable revenue stream to subsidize the high cost of developing fusion energy. While scientists have created gold in labs before, the process has always been prohibitively expensive. This new proposal links the alchemist's dream to the quest for clean energy, though it remains entirely theoretical, as commercial-scale fusion reactors do not yet exist, which is the most significant barrier to the vision.</p>

A recent state audit criticized the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) for understaffing and failing to take proper action in response to heat illness incidents. Many farmworkers, a large number of whom are undocumented, are hesitant to report violations for fear of retaliation. As climate change brings more intense heat waves, lawmakers and unions are pushing for stronger protections and accountability to address what they call a persistent and deadly failure of the system.</p>

          <p>Sandra Grimes, a veteran CIA officer instrumental in unmasking notorious Soviet spy Aldrich Ames, has died at the age of 79. In 1991, Grimes, who was considering scaling back her career, agreed to help investigate why the agency's Soviet informants were being compromised and executed. Her meticulous analysis of financial records and activity logs revealed a pattern linking Ames, then the CIA's counterintelligence chief for Soviet operations, to large cash deposits after meetings with a Soviet official. Her work was crucial in the 1994 arrest of Ames, who was responsible for what the Senate Intelligence Committee called some of the most severe damage in CIA history.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Carronade Capital Management is urging satellite communications company Viasat to unlock shareholder value by separating its Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) business from its legacy Communications segment. In a letter, Carronade argues that the market misunderstands Viasat, undervaluing it due to the perceived threat from competitors like Starlink to its declining broadband division. The firm contends that the high-growth, high-margin DAT business is a "hidden gem" that would be valued much higher as a standalone entity. A separation via spin-off or IPO could lead to a significant increase in the company's total valuation (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Donald Trump's second-term economic policies, characterized by high tariffs, subsidy cuts, and anti-immigration stances, amount to a form of "degrowth." While not intentional, these policies are raising prices, suppressing consumption, and weakening the American economy, leading to conditions resembling stagflation. The author contends that the trade war, cuts to programs like Medicaid and green energy, and attacks on scientific research are creating shortages and reducing productivity. This approach, described as financial nihilism, will ultimately make Americans worse off by shrinking the economy, even if the president would never use the term associated with European leftist parties.</p>

          <p>Michael Brown, the 45-year-old suspect in a deadly shooting at a bar in Anaconda, Montana, has been apprehended after a weeklong manhunt. Authorities say Brown killed four people in The Owl Bar on August 1 before fleeing into the surrounding mountains. Governor Greg Gianforte announced the capture, praising the extensive effort of some 130 law enforcement officers. Brown, an Army veteran who served in Iraq, reportedly struggled with mental illness, according to his family and local residents. The victims were identified as Daniel Baillie, Nancy Kelley, David Leach, and Tony Palm, all described as cherished members of the small community.</p>

          <p>In a major diplomatic achievement for the Trump administration, the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a historic peace agreement at the White House, ending decades of conflict. The U.S.-brokered deal establishes normal relations and reopens key transportation routes, including a major transit corridor linking Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhchivan, which will be named the "Trump Route." Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev both credited President Trump for the breakthrough.

          <p>OpenAI's launch of its new flagship model, GPT-5, has drawn a mixed reaction from experts and the public in China, a key market in the global artificial intelligence race. While OpenAI CEO Sam Altman touted the model as the company's "smartest, fastest, most useful" yet, with improved performance and a built-in "thinking" function, some Chinese analysts were underwhelmed. One prominent AI blogger described GPT-5 as lacking revolutionary breakthroughs or memorable characteristics. The reception comes as Chinese tech firms are aggressively developing their own large language models, creating a highly competitive environment where incremental updates are closely scrutinized for their innovative value.</p>

          <p>The story of a family from Central America highlights the controversial conditions at a makeshift migrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." After being arrested for not having a driver's license during a fishing trip, a man was separated from his wife and baby and taken to the facility, which is run by the state of Florida. His family and advocates describe inhumane conditions, including extreme heat, insufficient water, and a lack of communication with the outside world. While the Trump administration defends the facility as being "above federal standard," human rights groups have filed lawsuits, calling it a health and human rights disaster.</p>

          <p>A wave of protests is taking place across Britain in opposition to the government's use of over 200 hotels to house asylum seekers. The demonstrations, often organized by local residents and promoted by right-leaning groups, are fueled by concerns over community safety and a perceived lack of transparency from the government. One focal point has been The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, where a resident was charged with sexual assault. While some protesters have ties to far-right organizations, many are ordinary citizens, like mothers and professionals, indicating a shift in public mood. The situation highlights deep-seated tensions over immigration policy and its local impact.</p>

A new company has been established to oversee the railway, which will form a 2,000-kilometer (1,240-mile) artery by linking the existing Lhasa-Shigatse line with a new route from Hotan. This railway is a key component of a larger plan to create a 5,000-kilometer plateau rail network centered on Lhasa by 2035. The project's business scope extends beyond transportation to include real estate development, tourism, and international contracting, signaling its broad economic and strategic importance for the country.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles County Fire Department captain, Thomas Merryman, is facing multiple felony charges for allegedly faking a work injury to fraudulently collect over $25,000 in disability insurance payments. Prosecutors allege the 45-year-old submitted forged paperwork, including documents under another captain's name and a physician's, to Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company. The fraudulent claim was for an injury that supposedly occurred when he was not at work. L.A. County District Attorney Nathan Hochman stated that such abuse of the system by public servants will not be tolerated, as it raises insurance premiums for everyone and harms those with legitimate claims.</p>
