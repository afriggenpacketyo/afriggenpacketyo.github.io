          <p>A federal judge dismissed with prejudice the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams.  The Department of Justice dropped the charges, citing concerns that the case interfered with Adams' mayoral campaign and ability to cooperate with the Trump administration on immigration. Adams and his attorneys have maintained his innocence throughout the legal proceedings. The dismissal prevents Adams from being retried on the same charges.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering announcing a new "External Revenue Service" to collect tariffs from foreign sources. This move could involve new tariffs on low-value goods from China and aims to alter trade relationships with Beijing. The plan's details remain unclear, but it involves a potential $25 fee on low-value packages from China.  The practicalities of replacing income tax with tariff revenue are complex and would require congressional action.</p>

          <p>Tesla's first-quarter sales experienced a significant drop, down 13% year-over-year.  While Tesla attributed the decline to a transition to a new car version, analysts also point to Elon Musk's controversial role in the Trump administration.

          <p>Despite significant offseason spending, the Los Angeles Dodgers' opening-day payroll is slightly lower than the New York Mets'. This is largely due to the Dodgers' extensive use of deferred salaries for players like Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts. While this strategy lowers their current payroll and luxury tax obligations, it has raised concerns about competitive balance in MLB.
