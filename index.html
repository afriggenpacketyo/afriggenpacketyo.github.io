          <p>Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet service experienced a significant network outage on Thursday, affecting over 60,000 users according to Downdetector. The disruption lasted approximately 2.5 hours before service was mostly restored. The outage occurred shortly after Starlink announced its direct-to-cell phone service in partnership with T-Mobile was expanding rapidly. It remains unclear if the new T-Mobile service was connected to the outage, which follows other recent technical issues with Musk's social media platform, X.</p>

          <h2>An Analysis of Why the Biden Administration Did Not Release the Epstein Files</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 18:40:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the political and legal reasons why the Biden administration did not release the complete Jeffrey Epstein investigation files. It suggests that even if the files contained information about Donald Trump, releasing them would have been highly unusual and legally complex, requiring court approval for secret grand jury testimony. The piece notes that the files may not contain clear evidence of wrongdoing by prominent figures, and that privacy concerns and the protection of ongoing investigations typically prevent the FBI from releasing such materials outside of formal charges.</p>

          <p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with Ghislaine Maxwell in Tallahassee, Florida, to question her about the Jeffrey Epstein case. Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Epstein's sex trafficking ring, reportedly answered all questions during the day-long session. This meeting occurs amid mounting pressure on the Trump administration to release more information from the Epstein investigation, following the DOJ's conclusion that no "client list" exists and that Epstein died by suicide.</p>

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn the formal nomination of his former lawyer, Alina Habba, to be the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. This procedural move allows her to bypass a legal restriction and serve in an acting capacity, following a dispute where federal judges had appointed her deputy to the role instead. The Justice Department, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, has strongly supported Habba and criticized the judges' intervention. This complex situation highlights a power struggle between the executive branch and the judiciary over key prosecutorial appointments.</p>

          <p>In the six months since President Trump's inauguration, the U.S. Department of Education has undergone significant changes, reflecting the administration's new policy direction. Despite the president's vow to close the department, his administration has actively used its power to influence federal education policy. A key example cited is the recent move to withhold billions of dollars in funding for K-12 schools. This article examines how these actions are altering the federal government's traditional role in education and what the potential impact could be for American classrooms and students.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, is launching a new political party aimed at challenging the "rich and powerful" and advocating for wealth redistribution. Now an independent Member of Parliament, Corbyn, along with MP Zarah Sultana, described the new venture as a "community-led, grassroot-led" alternative to the current political landscape. The move signals a formal break with the current Labour Party, from which Corbyn was suspended, and aims to capitalize on energy from the left wing of British politics. A Labour source responded by noting the electorate had twice rejected a Corbyn-led party.</p>

          <p>During a rare presidential visit to the Federal Reserve, President Donald Trump and Chairman Jerome Powell engaged in a public disagreement over the cost of the central bank's building renovations. Trump claimed costs had topped $3.1 billion, a figure Powell disputed on the spot. The tense exchange occurred amid Trump's ongoing pressure campaign for the Fed to lower interest rates. However, during the visit, Trump also seemed to back away from previous threats to fire Powell, stating such a move was likely not "necessary" and that he believes the chairman will "do the right thing."

He noted that while economists often advise against cutting rates in a hot economy, he feels "desperate times call for desperate measures." The comments add another layer of political pressure on the central bank's monetary policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New data reveals that investors own 19% of all homes in California, highlighting the state's severe housing affordability crisis. While this rate is just below the national average, it underscores the challenges for individual homebuyers in one of the nation's most expensive markets. The report from BatchData shows that in some rural and mountain counties, investor ownership exceeds 50%. Critics argue that large-scale investment puts upward pressure on prices, while the report suggests investors provide necessary market liquidity at a time when high mortgage rates have sidelined many traditional buyers.

The exchange, which occurred during a segment about Columbia University's settlement with the Trump administration, drew criticism on social media. A therapist analyzing the clip noted that such name-calling is a "complete communication interrupter" that can be used to dismiss another's viewpoint and assert perceived control in a conversation.</p>
