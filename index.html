          <p>Netflix's shares fell by up to 7% after the company reported a third-quarter earnings miss, primarily due to an ongoing tax dispute with Brazilian authorities. The streamer's operating margin of 28% was below its 31.5% guidance, though revenue aligned with expectations, increasing by 17% driven by membership growth and ad revenue. Despite the Q3 setback, Netflix projects a 17% revenue rise for Q4 and adjusted its full-year operating margin forecast to 29% from 30% due to the Brazilian tax matter. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 15-hour Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage caused widespread disruptions, affecting travel, financial transactions, and popular platforms like Netflix and Venmo. Experts highlight this incident as a stark reminder of the "concentration risk" inherent in relying on a few dominant cloud providers, with AWS controlling 38% of the market. The outage, originating in AWS's US-EAST-1 hub and tied to its domain name system, underscores the vulnerability of a system where a single point of failure can have global repercussions. While not expected to cause a mass exodus, the event may prompt companies to diversify their cloud services for greater resilience.</p>

          <p>La Liga has canceled the controversial plan to move December's Villarreal-Barcelona match to Miami, citing "uncertainty generated in Spain in recent weeks." The decision comes despite UEFA's reluctant approval, following hostility from fan groups and players regarding the internationalization of Spanish football. La Liga expressed regret that the project, intended to be a historic opportunity for global expansion, will not proceed.

          <p>Beyond Meat's stock experienced a significant surge, climbing over 146% in its best day ever, following its addition to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF. This rally was further fueled by an announcement of an expanded distribution deal with Walmart across the U.S. The dramatic increase appears to be largely driven by a short squeeze, forcing investors who bet against the stock to cover their positions. This turnaround for the once-struggling penny stock, which had previously tumbled significantly, could signal a frothy market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Retirees Explore Reverse Mortgage Options to Access Home Equity Without Monthly Payments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 15:40:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retirees are increasingly considering reverse mortgages to convert home equity into cash without incurring new monthly loan payments, especially amidst rising living costs and fixed incomes. The most common type, the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), is federally insured by the FHA, offering consumer protections and flexible payout options with borrowing limits. Proprietary reverse mortgages cater to higher-value homes, exceeding HECM limits but with fewer FHA protections. Single-purpose reverse mortgages, offered by state/local governments, are the most affordable but restrict funds to specific uses like home repairs or taxes. Understanding these options is crucial for informed financial planning in retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research published in Pediatrics indicates that reversing previous dietary advice to introduce peanuts early to infants has prevented at least 40,000 peanut allergy cases in the past decade. A landmark 2015 study found that early peanut consumption significantly reduced allergy likelihood, leading to revised U.S. health guidelines. Dr. David Hill, the study's lead, noted a 43% reduction in peanut allergy prevalence and a 36% reduction in any food allergy prevalence in young children. This shift, influenced by observations in Israeli children, marks a significant breakthrough in public health, addressing a condition that is often lifelong.</p>

          <p>A highly anticipated meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest has been put on hold, offering relief to Ukraine's EU allies. European leaders, already rattled by the prospect of Hungary hosting such talks, are now focused on upcoming summits to secure financial support for Kyiv and pressure Moscow. Many EU states, including Lithuania, expressed strong opposition to Putin's presence on European soil due to his ICC indictment for war crimes. Hungary's "pro-peace" stance and past actions have led some to view it as a "Trojan horse" for Russian interests, further complicating European unity on the matter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis report that Trump administration tariffs are contributing to inflation, particularly for imported goods like furniture and car parts. Their analysis indicates that companies passed 35% of tariff costs to consumers from May to July, with Goldman Sachs projecting this could rise to 55%. These tariffs added 0.5 percentage points to the headline PCE rate between June and August. Despite the White House defending its trade policy for manufacturing and job growth, S&P Global analysts estimate tariffs will cost U.S. businesses $1.2 trillion this year, with consumers bearing the majority of these increased expenses.

          <p>The upcoming September Consumer Price Index (CPI) report is drawing significant attention from financial markets, yet it faces skepticism regarding its data integrity due to the ongoing government shutdown. Experts worry about potential incompleteness in the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) data collection, exacerbated by staffing cuts and the agency's traditional methods. The BLS, under scrutiny this year for data revisions, is releasing this crucial report primarily because it indexes Social Security cost-of-living adjustments. This uncertainty complicates Federal Reserve policymakers' ability to formulate policy, especially with anticipated rate cuts and a lack of other economic data during the shutdown.

          <p>Monday's Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage, which disrupted major services globally, has intensified concerns about over-reliance on a few dominant U.S. tech firms for critical infrastructure. Experts like Prof. James Davenport and Brent Ellis point to "nested dependency" and "concentration risk," where a single outage can ripple worldwide. While using hyperscalers like Amazon and Microsoft offers economies of scale and cybersecurity benefits, migrating or diversifying providers is challenging due to embedded infrastructure and high costs. The U.K. markets regulator is investigating competition in the cloud sector, advocating for a more open and resilient market to prevent such widespread disruptions.</p>

Only 40% of over 18,000 surveyed workers reported having such positions, with many experiencing unpredictable schedules and financial struggles. The research highlights a significant gap in job quality beyond traditional employment statistics, showing that men are more likely than women, and older, more educated individuals are more likely than younger, less educated ones, to hold quality jobs.

While investigators are actively pursuing suspects, experts believe recovering the jewels, which could be broken up and sold on the black market, is unlikely.

Uribe, who served from 2002 to 2010, was the first former Colombian president to be convicted of criminal charges, stemming from allegations of bribing paramilitaries to lie about his links to the groups.
