          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bipartisan bill aimed at imposing sanctions on Chinese officials who fail to curb the trafficking of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals. The legislation also targets Chinese manufacturers who do not implement credible measures to prevent the flow of synthetic opioids into the United States. While the bill received support from both parties, some Democrats emphasized that sanctions alone are insufficient and that effective diplomacy and international law enforcement partnerships are crucial to resolving the crisis.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled against the U.S. government's request to break up Google, allowing the company to retain its Chrome browser and Android operating system. However, the ruling imposes significant restrictions, prohibiting Google from entering into exclusive default search engine contracts and requiring it to share some of its valuable search data with rivals to foster competition. This decision concludes a landmark antitrust case, aiming to curb Google's monopolistic power in the search market without resorting to the drastic measure of divestiture.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly opposed President Trump's stated intention to send federal agents and National Guard troops to Chicago, labeling the president's remarks as "unhinged." Pritzker stated he would not request such assistance and warned that the administration is likely planning to stage federal forces without local coordination to conduct raids in Latino communities. This confrontation highlights the escalating tensions between the White House and state governments over the use of federal power in major cities.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles jury has cleared rapper Cardi B of liability in a $24 million assault and battery lawsuit brought by a former security guard. The guard, Emani Ellis, alleged that the artist spat on her and cut her with a fingernail during a 2018 confrontation at a medical building, causing lasting harm. Cardi B, who was pregnant at the time, testified that Ellis had been invasive by filming her, and the jury ultimately sided with the rapper, dismissing the case and awarding no damages.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a scathing ruling declaring that the Trump administration broke the law by deploying National Guard and Marine units for domestic law enforcement in Los Angeles. The judge found the action to be a serious violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the use of the military for civilian policing. The opinion soundly rejected the administration's legal justification, which claimed broad presidential authority to protect federal functions, and blocked further such deployments in California.</p>

          <p>Residents in popular tourist destinations like Mexico City, Barcelona, and Lisbon are increasingly protesting against "overtourism," citing soaring housing costs and the erosion of local culture. The influx of digital nomads and travelers has driven up prices, leading to demonstrations where locals demand government intervention, such as restrictions on short-term rentals and higher tourist taxes. This growing backlash reflects a global trend of communities pushing back against the negative impacts of an unchecked tourism industry on their daily lives.</p>
