            <p>Hertz Global CEO Gil West conveyed his positive reaction to Bill Ackman's Pershing Square acquiring a significant stake in the rental car company. Ackman's firm has built a 19.8% position in Hertz, becoming its second-largest shareholder, after receiving an exemption from the SEC to delay the filing of the position. West highlighted the endorsement as a testament to the company's progress and the relentless efforts of its employees. This investment comes after Hertz emerged from bankruptcy and is seen as a vote of confidence in its future strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has temporarily halted the Trump administration's planned mass layoffs at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), preventing a reduction in force (RIF) that would have slashed the bureau's workforce by roughly 90%. Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued the order after plaintiffs accused the government of violating an earlier injunction, expressing deep concern over the scope of the planned action. A hearing is set for April 28 to hear testimony from officials slated to carry out the RIF procedures, ensuring no employees are dispersed until the legality is determined.</p>

This initiative comes as the U.S. and China have imposed retaliatory tariffs, escalating trade tensions and raising concerns about inflation and economic slowdown. The task force would focus on sectors like medicines, semiconductors, and critical minerals that are particularly vulnerable to supply pressure.</p>

Attorneys for Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas believe their clients are at risk of being deported to El Salvador under the AEA. The ACLU argues that the notices received by their clients do not provide due process to challenge their designation under the AEA, despite a Supreme Court ruling requiring it. This action follows the administration's previous use of the AEA to deport alleged migrant gang members to the CECOT mega-prison in El Salvador.</p>

            <p>President Trump has threatened to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status amid an escalating fight over federal funding, citing concerns about antisemitism on campus and Harvard's refusal to comply with administration demands. Trump argues that tax-exempt status is contingent on acting in the public interest, suggesting Harvard should be taxed as a political entity. Harvard maintains there is no legal basis for rescinding its tax-exempt status, warning it would severely hamper its educational mission and diminish financial aid for students. The administration has already frozen over $2.2 billion in federal funding for the school.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is implementing a new rule to reclassify some career civil servants as "at-will" employees, aiming to streamline the process of firing underperforming or subversive employees. The White House says the rule, formerly referred to as "Schedule F," empowers federal agencies to swiftly remove employees in policy-influencing roles without lengthy procedural hurdles. The Office of Personnel Management estimates about 50,000 positions will be changed to the new status. This move builds on an executive order Mr. Trump signed his first day in office in January, creating a new employment classification for many civil servants to effectively strip them of job protections.</p>

            <p>Britain's Supreme Court has ruled that the Equality Act of 2010 defines "sex" as binary, meaning a person is either a man or a woman based on biological sex. The ruling, which applies only to interpreting anti-discrimination law, affects women-only services such as domestic-violence shelters and single-sex hospital wards. The court stressed that transgender people have their own legal protections, including protection against discrimination based on gender reassignment. The ruling has been accepted across the political spectrum in Britain, marking a shift from previous support for self-identification of gender.</p>
