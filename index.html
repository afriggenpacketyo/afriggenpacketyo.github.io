            <p>Sony has announced a price increase for the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, attributing the decision to a "challenging economic environment" characterized by high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates. The price hike does not affect the PS5 with a Blu-ray disc drive or the PS5 Pro model. Analysts anticipate a potential price increase in the United States as well, depending on the future of tariffs. This isn't the first time Sony has raised prices for the console, with previous increases occurring in 2022 and 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Nesrine Malik in The Guardian discusses the challenges of imagining a world where the US is no longer the dominant global power, highlighting the psychological and practical difficulties of divesting from a system the US created. The article suggests that the US's breakdown could lead to a new global order where other countries have a greater stake. While acknowledging the potential for anarchy and instability, Malik argues that this shift could ultimately lead to genuine independence and a re-evaluation of the US's definition of peace and prosperity.</p>
