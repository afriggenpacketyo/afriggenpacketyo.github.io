          <p>Dr. Kevin O'Connor, who previously served as President Joe Biden's White House physician, declined to answer questions during a closed-door interview with the House Oversight Committee. He cited both physician-patient privilege and his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. The Republican-led committee had subpoenaed Dr. O'Connor as part of an investigation into the former president's mental fitness and the use of an autopen. The committee chairman called the move unprecedented and suggested it points to a cover-up, while vowing to continue the probe with other witnesses.</p>

          <p>India's women's cricket team achieved a landmark T20 series win against England, claiming victory with a game still to play. In the fourth match at Old Trafford, India comfortably chased down England's modest total of 126-7, winning by six wickets. India's openers provided a strong start, and despite a mid-innings slowdown, Captain Harmanpreet Kaur and Jemimah Rodrigues guided the team to victory. This marks the first time India's women's team has won a T20 series in England, highlighting the tourists' disciplined bowling and fielding throughout the matches.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Catholic Diocese of San Bernardino, California, has issued a rare decree dispensing parishioners from the obligation to attend Mass if they have a genuine fear of immigration enforcement actions. Bishop Alberto Rojas stated that such fear constitutes a grave inconvenience that can impede spiritual well-being. This move follows reports of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detentions on church properties, a practice that has become more common since a 2017 policy change. The decision is significant as non-attendance at Mass is typically considered a serious sin for observant Catholics.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has announced sanctions against Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, due to her outspoken criticism of Israel's military actions in Gaza. Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited her engagement with the International Criminal Court's efforts to prosecute Israeli or American nationals and accused her of antisemitism. The sanctions will likely block her from traveling to the U.S. and freeze any assets she holds there. The move represents an escalation in the administration's campaign against international bodies investigating its allies.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, have revealed that a kickoff meeting for a new flood warning system was scheduled for mid-July, just after the area was devastated by catastrophic floods. The Upper Guadalupe River Authority had approved a contract in April for a system designed to provide a centralized dashboard for real-time streamflow and rainfall data to support emergency response. This system would have been a decision-support tool for emergency managers, not a public alert system. The revelation comes as the region grapples with over 100 fatalities from the recent disaster.</p>

In a public letter, President Trump cited two primary reasons for the action: an unfair trade relationship and the ongoing prosecution of Brazil's former president, Jair Bolsonaro. The letter explicitly links the tariff to internal political affairs, calling Bolsonaro's trial an "international disgrace." The announcement caused Brazil's currency to fall over 2% against the U.S. dollar, marking a major escalation in trade policy being used for political leverage.</p>

          <p>An attack by Yemen's Houthi rebels on a cargo ship in the Red Sea has resulted in the deaths of three mariners and the kidnapping of several others, according to a European Union naval force and the U.S. Embassy in Yemen. The vessel, the Greek-owned Eternity C, was assaulted by small boats and drones, marking a deadly escalation in the region. This incident, along with another recent attack, signals a potential renewal of the Houthi campaign against maritime trade. The U.S. Embassy condemned the attack and called for the immediate release of the kidnapped crew members.</p>

          <p>In a story highlighting the complexities of U.S. immigration policy, an Iranian immigrant and devout Donald Trump supporter has been detained by ICE in California. Arpineh Masihi, who has lived in the U.S. since she was three, was taken into custody due to a past felony conviction from 2008, which made her a target for deportation. Despite her situation, she and her family maintain their support for Trump's immigration policies, believing they are meant for dangerous criminals. Her case illustrates the wide net cast by recent enforcement actions, affecting even those who align with the administration's political agenda.</p>

          <p>The UK government's Universal Credit Bill has been approved by the House of Commons after being significantly watered-down to avert a rebellion from Labour backbenchers. The legislation implements cuts to the health-related element of universal credit for some new claimants but scraps stricter eligibility rules for the personal independence payment (Pip) for existing recipients. Despite the concessions, 47 Labour MPs still voted against the bill, which critics called an "omnishambles." The changes are expected to become law, but the government's cost-saving goals have been almost entirely eliminated by the amendments.</p>

          <p>South Korea's former president, Yoon Suk Yeol, has been re-arrested in connection with his attempt to declare martial law last year. A court issued the arrest warrant over fears he could destroy evidence related to the case. Yoon, who was impeached in April, faces trial on charges of leading an insurrection, which could carry a sentence of life in prison or the death penalty. He was first arrested in January but was released two months later on a technicality, and his re-arrest marks another significant development in the political turmoil that has gripped the nation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has confirmed 1,288 cases of measles so far this year, marking the highest total since 1992 and surpassing the significant outbreak of 2019.

Health experts attribute the resurgence of the nearly eliminated virus to declining vaccination rates in certain communities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention maintains that the risk to the general population is low but emphasizes that the MMR vaccine is the most effective protection available.</p>

Davidtz, who herself grew up in South Africa during apartheid, discusses how the project is a way to process the institutional racism she witnessed.

          <p>Former New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning has stated he is no longer interested in purchasing a minority stake in the NFL team, primarily because he has been priced out. With NFL franchise valuations soaring, Manning noted that even a 1% stake in a team valued at $10 billion becomes a very large number. He also mentioned that ownership could create conflicts of interest with his broadcasting role on ESPN's "ManningCast." The Giants, co-owned by the Mara and Tisch families, are exploring the sale of a minority stake amid renewed investor interest in the league.</p>

          <p>A new spending bill signed into law by President Trump includes an increase to the maximum child tax credit, raising it from $2,000 to $2,200 per eligible child, effective in 2026. The legislation extends the credit, which was set to revert to $1,000 after 2025, and indexes the refundable portion to inflation. However, the bill does not expand eligibility rules, meaning the increase will primarily benefit middle- and high-income families who already qualify for the full amount. The change is projected to add approximately $817 billion to the federal deficit over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has recommended relaxing a cap on riskier mortgage lending, a move that could help more first-time buyers get onto the property ladder. The proposal would allow individual banks to issue more than 15% of their new mortgages at loan-to-income ratios higher than 4.5, though an industry-wide cap would remain. Lenders like Nationwide have welcomed the change, stating it will assist those struggling with high rents and affordability tests. The recommendation follows a government call for regulators to find ways to stimulate economic growth amid changing interest rate environments. (not investment advice)</p>

Hired to repair relationships with advertisers, Yaccarino's role was often seen as limited, with Musk remaining the ultimate authority.

This move is seen by observers as a new escalation in the government's suppression of press freedom, which already ranks 159th out of 180 countries. Critics, including journalists' associations and European officials, warn that the bans are silencing dissent and creating severe economic pressure on the last remaining independent media outlets.</p>
