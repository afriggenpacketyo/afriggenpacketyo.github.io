          <p>The European Union has announced a six-month suspension of planned countermeasures against U.S. tariffs, aiming to create stability for businesses and citizens on both sides of the Atlantic. This delay follows an agreement between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald J. Trump. The pause allows for further negotiations to finalize a joint statement, despite previous agreements lacking legal binding and clarity on investment commitments. This strategic move seeks to de-escalate trade tensions and foster continued dialogue.</p>

          <p>Everton has reached an agreement to sign Chelsea midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall for approximately £28 million, comprising an initial £24 million plus £3-4 million in add-ons. Despite the player's initial reluctance to leave Stamford Bridge, Chelsea was open to the transfer to recoup most of the £30 million they paid for him in 2024. The 26-year-old will now proceed with finalizing personal terms and undergoing a medical examination. This move is part of Chelsea's strategy to trim their squad and negotiate multiple player sales this week.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has approved a new compensation package for CEO Elon Musk, granting him 96 million shares of restricted stock valued at approximately $29 billion. This decision comes after a Delaware judge ordered the revocation of his previous $56 billion pay package from 2018, which Musk is currently appealing. The company stated this new grant aims to incentivize Musk to remain as CEO, particularly as Tesla transitions into an AI-first company and the competition for AI talent intensifies. The board views Musk's leadership as crucial for the company's future.</p>

          <p>In a shocking development in the Limpopo pig farm murder trial, a South African farm worker, Adrian de Wet, claims he was forced to feed the bodies of two black women to pigs. De Wet, now a state witness, alleges farm owner Zachariah Johannes Olivier shot Maria Makgato and Lucia Ndlovu, who were reportedly searching for food. This case has ignited widespread outrage and exacerbated racial tensions in South Africa, particularly in rural areas where land ownership and labor practices remain sensitive issues. The trial has been postponed, with Olivier and another worker yet to enter pleas.</p>

          <p>Millions of car buyers in the UK could be eligible for compensation following a Supreme Court ruling on hidden commissions paid by lenders to dealers. While the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), is still developing a compensation scheme, consumers are advised against using claims companies, as they will charge fees and not speed up the process. Individuals who had discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) and were overcharged are likely candidates. The article outlines steps to check eligibility, such as reviewing contract terms or contacting lenders, with first payments expected in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and his economic advisors are fueling baseless conspiracies, claiming recent federal jobs data was "rigged" by federal workers seeking to sabotage his administration. This follows the abrupt firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner Erika McEntarfer after a weaker-than-expected jobs report. Critics argue these actions politicize crucial economic statistics, undermining public trust and potentially leading to a flawed understanding of the economy.

          <p>A 17-year-old boy has been detained for 12 months for the torture and killing of two kittens found mutilated in a wooded area in west London. The judge described the offenses as the "most awful" against animals she had witnessed, noting the actions were extensively planned and premeditated. Disturbingly, notes on the boy's phone revealed a desire to kill a human and research into getting away with murder, stating he killed cats to reduce his urges. His accomplice, a 17-year-old girl, awaits sentencing for her role in the animal abuse.</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney's recently revealed registration as a Republican voter has sparked debate and concern regarding its potential impact on her career. While President Trump expressed delight at the news, PR experts warn that celebrity involvement in politics, especially early in a career, often backfires and can lead to significant backlash. Unlike established stars who have navigated political endorsements, Sweeney's 'overpromoted' status as a 'clickbait' figure makes her particularly vulnerable to the polarized American discourse. The article suggests that her silence on the matter might be strategic, but the situation could still lead to 'carnage' for her public image.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 09:51:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A clinical associate professor of pharmacy explains that a significant majority of people who believe they have a penicillin allergy are actually not allergic. While 10% to 20% of Americans report this allergy, fewer than 1% truly do. Misdiagnoses often occur in childhood due to rashes accompanying infections or common antibiotic side effects. Incorrectly labeled allergies can lead to less effective, more expensive, and broader-spectrum antibiotic treatments, increasing the risk of antimicrobial resistance. Consulting a healthcare professional and considering penicillin skin testing or a direct test dose can safely clarify allergy status.</p>

          <p>Germany plans to implement an increase in the 'mother's pension'—a pension subsidy for older parents—a year earlier than scheduled, now set for January 1, 2027. This move, championed by the CSU party, adds an extra half percentage point to pensions for children born before 1992, benefiting millions of women. However, the annual cost of approximately €5 billion raises concerns amidst Germany's significant federal budget gap. Critics argue this 'watering can' measure does not effectively address the gender pension gap or poverty among older people, and burdens active workers. (not investment advice)</p>
