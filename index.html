            <h2>Study Examines Why Men Are Less Likely to Seek Medical Care</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 20:17:45 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A recent study reveals that men are less likely to visit doctors than women, often delaying treatment until symptoms become severe. The research indicates that societal expectations of masculinity, such as self-reliance and stoicism, contribute to this reluctance. Many men feel pressured to "tough it out" and worry that discussing health concerns might be perceived as weakness. Healthcare systems may also need to adapt to better suit men's needs, such as offering appointments that accommodate work schedules and focusing on action-oriented approaches to care.</p>

            <p>Severe storms caused deadly flooding in Oklahoma, resulting in the deaths of two people, including a child, in Moore.

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the deportation of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. The court's order followed an emergency appeal from the ACLU, which argued that the deportations were proceeding without due process. Justices Thomas and Alito dissented, arguing the court acted prematurely. The White House claims the detainees are foreign terrorists. The ACLU had sued to block the deportations, citing concerns about the conditions in El Salvador's prisons where some deportees have been sent.</p>

Trump suggested that both countries could then engage in profitable business with the United States.

He was penalized for cutting a chicane after the start and retaining the lead, with stewards reducing the penalty to five seconds due to it being the first lap. Oscar Piastri, who won the race, felt he was entitled to the corner, while McLaren team principal Andrea Stella said the incident should not create any controversy.

            <p>Yan Anlin, a mainland China's Taiwan studies expert, believes that a timetable for Taiwan reunification has disadvantages. He argues that cross-strait relations are still in the early stages of building momentum towards complete reunification. Yan suggests that peaceful reunification is likely to take another five to 10 years, but the possibility of a non-peaceful resolution cannot be ruled out if Taiwan independence forces push matters to the extreme.</p>
