          <p>Official data reveals that China's industrial profits saw a second consecutive month of growth in April, increasing by 3% compared to the previous year, an acceleration from March's 2.6% rise, which is attributed to the industrial sector's resilience and ability to withstand shocks, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, with high-tech and equipment manufacturing sectors contributing significantly to this expansion. Despite tariffs and deflationary pressures, the high-tech manufacturing industry experienced a 9% profit increase, boosted by biopharmaceutical products and aircraft manufacturing. However, some sectors, like automobiles and apparel, faced challenges due to price competition and shifting demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has voiced frustration with the government's failure to provide due process to deportees being held in Djibouti, mandating that the men be given a chance to express fears of persecution if sent to South Sudan. The judge criticized the logistical challenges cited by the government and suggested returning the men to the United States if remote proceedings proved too difficult. This follows an earlier order that the deportees receive notice in a language they understand and adequate time to challenge their removal, which the court found had been violated. The judge emphasized that criminal histories do not negate due process rights.</p>

          <p>A study by ACS' Environmental Science & Technology found elevated levels of PFAS, or "forever chemicals," in some US-brewed beers, exceeding EPA limits. The research correlated PFAS concentrations in beer with municipal drinking water sources, revealing that beers brewed in North Carolina, California, and Michigan had higher levels. The team tested 23 beers, finding PFAS in 95% of samples, with perfluorooctanesulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid being the most common chemicals. International beers tested from Holland and Mexico were less likely to have detectable PFAS.</p>

The yen's depreciation increased the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, while Germany benefited from a significant current account surplus. (not investment advice)</p>

This price revision follows other price adjustments announced earlier in the year, leading to investor caution about increased competition and a potential price war in the sector. Analysts from Citi expect the price reduction to have increased footfall at BYD's dealership stores but are not concerned about competitors' market share. Citi anticipates robust sales growth for new energy vehicle companies with prices below 200,000 Chinese yuan due to relatively mild competition. (not investment advice)</p>

The legislation would cut in half the tax write-off for intangible assets, such as player contracts and media rights, which team owners can currently deduct over 15 years. While the provision would only affect future owners, it could cool demand for teams and raise nearly $1 billion in revenue over 10 years, according to estimates.

          <p>Jim Cramer identifies several reasons for market optimism, including the EU's willingness to fast-track trade talks, potential Senate resistance to the House's spending cuts and tax increases, and signs that President Trump recognizes Vladimir Putin's untrustworthiness. With Nvidia's earnings expectations low and the S&P Oscillator at a low risk level, Cramer suggests that investors may not have bought enough. He recommends buying Capital One and TJX, citing their undervaluation, and anticipates a surge in M&A deals. (not investment advice)</p>

Jenkins was found guilty on fraud and bribery charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison, with federal prosecutors saying he took $75,000 in bribes. Trump claimed Jenkins was a victim of an overzealous Biden Department of Justice and criticized the judge for refusing to allow evidence in his defense, while acting United States Attorney Zachary T.

          <h2>Apprenticeship Program Changes to Focus on Under-21s</h2>

          <p>The government is shifting the focus of apprenticeship funding to under-21s in England, creating 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults, with funding for postgraduate apprenticeships being scrapped. Only students under 21 will qualify for funding for level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree, and an increase in a charge paid by employers recruiting from outside the UK will be used to create 45,000 training places. These changes aim to push more money towards younger individuals and address the decline in entry-level apprenticeships, though critics argue it will harm public services and limit opportunities for older individuals.</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered a Memorial Day speech at Arlington National Cemetery, honoring fallen soldiers and their families while also highlighting his own achievements and indirectly criticizing his predecessor. He praised the sacrifices of soldiers and their families, promising to restore the nation's greatness, and referenced his efforts to rebuild the military. The speech followed a social media message that did not mention veterans but wished a “HAPPY MEMORIAL DAY TO ALL, INCLUDING THE SCUM THAT SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS TRYING TO DESTROY OUR COUNTRY THROUGH WARPED RADICAL LEFT MINDS.”</p>
