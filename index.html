          <p>Republicans are proposing to eliminate economic hardship and unemployment deferments for federal student loan borrowers, which currently allow borrowers to pause payments during periods of joblessness or financial setbacks, often without accruing interest. This change is part of a larger bill that also seeks to eliminate certain student loan repayment plans and establish a minimum monthly payment. Experts are concerned that removing these deferments could lead to increased loan defaults among individuals facing job loss or unexpected expenses. The Trump administration has projected a potential rise in student loan defaults from over 5 million to approximately 10 million in the coming months, underscoring the potential impact of these proposed changes. Optimism remains muted due to the potential financial strain on borrowers. </p>

          <p>President Trump stated his goal is a complete end to Iran's nuclear enrichment activities, not just a ceasefire in the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel. He emphasized that Israel would likely continue its assault on Iran, which has significantly damaged Iran's military command and nuclear program. Trump also warned Tehran's residents to evacuate, citing safety concerns, and suggested he might send envoys to negotiate with Iran, though he expressed reluctance. The conflict has seen escalating attacks, with Israel targeting Iranian media and military leaders, while Iran has launched missiles into Israel, causing casualties on both sides. The ongoing conflict has created a tense and uncertain environment. </p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has not dismissed the possibility of assassinating Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, viewing him as an existential threat. Netanyahu has called for regime change in Iran and urged Iranians to stand up against their government. Israeli strikes have already killed several top Iranian generals and security advisors close to Khamenei, but experts note that Iran's theocratic system has mechanisms in place to ensure stability even if its leader is removed. Some analysts believe internal tensions within Iran are more likely to cause regime change than external pressures, but the current conflict could fuel further discontent. The situation remains volatile with uncertain outcomes. </p>

          <p>Keir Starmer is now supporting a national inquiry into grooming gangs, a reversal from his previous stance where he accused those calling for one of exploiting far-right sentiment. This decision follows a report highlighting the need for a national criminal operation and inquiry to coordinate local investigations into abuse. The report also pointed out poor data collection on the ethnicity of perpetrators and suggested officials had avoided the issue. Starmer stated that the inquiry must address all relevant factors, including ethnicity and the role of public officials, and that he has been concerned about people ignoring various aspects of child sexual abuse for a long time. The inquiry aims to create a "national reset" on the grooming gangs issue. </p>

          <p>In the retrial of Karen Read, jurors' questions suggest they are focusing on the lesser charge of operating under the influence (OUI) rather than the more serious charge of first-degree murder in the death of her boyfriend, John O'Keefe. The questions included the timeframe for the OUI charge and whether convicting on a subcharge convicts the overall charge, indicating a focus on the role of alcohol in the case. Experts suggest that these questions are a positive sign for the defense, as they imply the jury is considering a lesser included charge. Read's first trial ended in a hung jury, and the defense has warned that the existing verdict slip could confuse the jury. The focus on the OUI charge suggests the jury is grappling with the impact of alcohol consumption on the events leading to O'Keefe's death. </p>

          <p>A $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family has gained backing from 55 attorneys general nationwide, resolving claims related to the opioid crisis. The settlement aims to end the Sacklers' control of Purdue, prevent the family from selling opioids in the U.S., and provide funds for opioid crisis abatement. Over half of the funds will be distributed within the first few years, with individual states receiving varying amounts. The settlement leaves Purdue in bankruptcy with oversight by a monitor and prevents the company from lobbying or marketing opioids. The funds will be used to compensate victims, address the opioid crisis, and provide overdose rescue medicines. </p>

          <p>Sarah Lin, a high school student from the Bronx, is advocating for the passage of the Open Captioning Accessibility Act in New York, which would mandate that movie theaters offer showings with open captions. Lin's motivation stems from her mother's progressive hearing loss and the challenges faced by the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in accessing movies. Closed captioning is seen as a more reliable option compared to assistive devices, which have been reported to be faulty. Lin hopes that the act will not only pass in New York but also serve as a model for national legislation, encouraging other states to follow suit and improve accessibility for all. The act aims to ensure that individuals with hearing difficulties can fully enjoy the moviegoing experience. </p>

          <p>Despite claims that the Trump Organization's newly announced T1 smartphone will be "built in the United States," experts believe it will likely be manufactured in China. The phone, priced at $499 and running Android, is expected to be produced by a Chinese original device manufacturer (ODM) due to the lack of readily available smartphone manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. Analysts suggest that designing and assembling the phone entirely in the U.S. is not feasible. This comes amid Trump's previous calls for Apple to manufacture its iPhones in the U.S., highlighting a broader desire to increase domestic electronics manufacturing. Experts have noted that large-scale manufacturing in the U.S. would take several years and substantially increase product costs. </p>

A majority of respondents believe the U.S. will strike a new trade deal with China within about five months. The Federal Reserve is expected to maintain current rates at the June meeting, with potential rate cuts anticipated in September. Investors foresee two rate cuts this year, bringing the funds rate down to 3.9% by year-end, and only one cut next year. The survey also indicates that investors are uncertain about trade policy, and most believe that the current tax bill will increase the federal budget deficit. (not investment advice)</p>

The company has already invested in removing or replacing artificial colors in some products, such as Kraft Mac & Cheese, while others, like Heinz Tomato Ketchup, never contained dyes. The FDA currently allows 36 food color additives, including eight synthetic dyes, but is working to eliminate them by the end of 2026 through voluntary efforts from the food industry.

          <p>Lawyers for R. Kelly claim he was rushed to the hospital after medically overdosing while in prison. The 58-year-old reportedly collapsed at the federal correctional institute in Butner, North Carolina, and was transported to Duke University hospital. Kelly's lawyers allege he was placed in solitary confinement and given an overdose quantity of medication by prison staff, leading to his hospitalization for two days. This filing follows an emergency motion by Kelly's lawyers alleging a plot to have him killed by another inmate, which federal prosecutors have opposed. Kelly was convicted in 2021 on racketeering and sexual assault charges and sentenced to 30 years in prison. </p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold its benchmark rate steady at its upcoming meeting, continuing its cautious approach from the first half of 2025. The CME Group's FedWatch Tool indicates a 99.9% likelihood that the Fed will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. Uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs has influenced the Fed's decision to hold off on cutting rates. The meeting will include an economic forecast, and analysts will be watching for any dissent among voting members. While a rate cut is unlikely, the Fed's decision will have implications for borrowers and savers, with credit card rates, auto loans, and mortgages expected to remain high.

Israel's military claimed to have eliminated a top Iranian commander, further intensifying the conflict. Trump's remarks contrasted with China's call for de-escalation, highlighting differing international approaches to the crisis.

While muscles have traditionally symbolized male strength, women are increasingly embracing strength training, challenging conventional beauty standards. However, the pursuit of strength can also lead to optimization traps, mirroring past obsessions with thinness. The article discusses how cultural associations with strength and muscles can vary based on gender and race, and how the wellness industry often promotes unattainable ideals.
