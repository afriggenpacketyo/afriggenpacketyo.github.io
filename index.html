          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren SÃ¡nchez recently celebrated their wedding in Venice, Italy, drawing a high-profile guest list that included numerous celebrities and business leaders. The lavish, multi-day festivities were attended by figures such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, and Bill Gates, who arrived via water taxis for the various events. While the couple and their guests celebrated, the event also sparked the "No Space for Bezos" campaign, with local residents protesting the influx of extreme wealth and over-tourism. Activists argue such events exacerbate rising costs and overcrowding, but the celebrations proceeded as planned amidst the controversy.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has sued Fox News for at least $787 million, alleging the network defamed him. The lawsuit, filed in Delaware, centers on comments made by host Jesse Watters, who claimed Newsom lied about a phone call with former President Donald Trump. Newsom's legal team states the suit will be dropped if Fox News issues a retraction and an on-air apology. Fox News has dismissed the lawsuit as a "frivolous publicity stunt designed to chill free speech" and intends to defend the case vigorously.</p>

          <p>A BBC correspondent details a personal journey into phage therapy, a century-old medical concept now being revisited as a weapon against antibiotic-resistant superbugs. The process involves finding bacteriophages, viruses that specifically target and kill bacteria, in environments like sewage. In a demonstration at the University of Southampton, a phage collected from the journalist's toilet successfully destroyed a persistent urinary tract infection in a lab setting. Researchers are hopeful this method can be developed into a viable treatment for infections, although it is still in the early stages of regulatory approval and clinical application.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Revised government trade data for May shows a dramatic surge in private sector imports of tariffed rice into Japan. The volume imported in May alone was 3.5 times the total amount from the entire 2024 fiscal year, reaching 10,605 tons. This sharp increase, primarily from the United States, is attributed to soaring domestic rice prices, which have spurred significant demand for cheaper alternatives from abroad. The data indicates a notable shift in the Japanese rice market driven by economic pressures on consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

This development is part of a broader anti-corruption scandal that has affected the Chinese military leadership since the summer of 2023.

Schafer then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with surprise and appreciation. The project not only helped her bridge social gaps but also prompted her classmates to reflect on their own interactions, fostering a renewed sense of connection within the graduating class.</p>

The proposed cuts were intended to generate significant savings but were criticized for targeting vulnerable individuals without a comprehensive long-term reform strategy. The reversal raises questions about the government's fiscal strategy and its ability to manage both its budget and internal party politics.

          <p>Authorities in New Orleans have captured Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center six weeks ago. The May 16 jailbreak, which went unnoticed for hours, was described by Louisiana's governor as one of the worst in recent state history. Massey was located and arrested at a residence in the city and will be transferred to a secure state facility. The escape has led to criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management of the jail, while only one inmate, Derrick Groves, remains at large.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors on the upcoming week's market-moving events, highlighting the labor report and an earnings release from alcohol producer Constellation Brands. He anticipates a weak report from Constellation, suggesting the company is affected by the rise of GLP-1 weight loss drugs and shifting consumer preferences toward cannabis. Cramer also noted that the company has cited the Trump administration's immigration policies as a factor weighing on sales to its significant Hispanic consumer base. He suggested a weak manufacturing report could increase pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia claimed a commanding 159-run victory over the West Indies in the first Test in Barbados, driven by a five-wicket haul from bowler Josh Hazlewood. The West Indies' batting lineup collapsed dramatically in the final session of day three, losing all ten of their second-innings wickets as they pursued a target of 301. Despite a promising start, a devastating spell from Hazlewood reduced the hosts to 56-5, a position from which they could not recover. The decisive win gives Australia a strong start to the series, concluding the match with two full days to spare.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a measure to more than double the state's annual tax incentives for film and television production, raising the total to $750 million from the current $330 million. The move, advocated by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to reverse the trend of productions leaving California for other locations with more generous financial incentives. Industry unions and advocates applauded the decision as a critical step to support local workers and bring production back to the state. The increase is part of a broader effort to maintain Hollywood's status as the center of the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court issued a 6-3 ruling that significantly limits the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions against executive branch policies. The decision came in a case concerning President Trump's order to end birthright citizenship, granting the administration a partial victory by staying the broad injunctions. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the birthright citizenship order itself, this decision makes it much harder for single judges to block presidential actions across the entire country. The ruling allows challenges to continue on behalf of individual plaintiffs but prevents universal halts to policy implementation.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Guardian argues that the Supreme Court's recent decision to limit nationwide injunctions represents a significant expansion of presidential power. The ruling, which came in the case challenging President Trump's birthright citizenship order, effectively curtails the ability of lower courts to place a nationwide hold on executive actions. The author contends this creates a chaotic system where constitutional rights may only be protected in specific jurisdictions where lawsuits are filed. The opinion piece suggests this gives the executive branch unchecked authority to implement potentially illegal policies, posing a threat to the rule of law.</p>

          <p>A political analysis from The Atlantic suggests that the fiscally conservative and anti-establishment principles of the Tea Party movement may be experiencing a revival. This resurgence is seen in the opposition from some Republican lawmakers, like Senator Rand Paul, to recent GOP spending and tax cut proposals that are not accompanied by commensurate budget reductions. These officials are echoing the same demands for fiscal discipline that characterized the original Tea Party wave in 2010. However, this new wave faces the challenge of opposing a popular Republican president from within their own party.</p>

          <p>Fox News host Jesse Watters is facing criticism for making misogynistic comments about the personal life of Democratic Representative Jasmine Crockett. During a segment, Watters remarked on Crockett's marital status, suggesting her political positions are rooted in personal unhappiness and offering to set her up with a man. Critics and gender studies experts condemned the comments as a classic tactic to delegitimize a female politician by shifting focus from her policy arguments to personal attacks. The remarks were seen as an attempt to distract from substantive debate through sexist and irrelevant commentary.</p>

          <h2>California Leaders Approve State Budget to Close $12 Billion Deficit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 17:46:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers have approved a $321 billion state budget designed to close a projected $12 billion deficit. The spending plan involves a combination of using state savings, borrowing from special funds, and delaying some payments to avoid more severe cuts to essential programs. However, the budget does pare back several progressive priorities, including halting new enrollments for certain low-income adult immigrants in the state's healthcare program. The deal reflects the tough fiscal decisions facing the state amid potential federal cuts and economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
