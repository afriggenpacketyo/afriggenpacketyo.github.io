This contest has drawn criticism for potentially selling access to the government for personal profit, with most buyers losing money on the coin.

          <p>A trove of forgotten Nazi documents seized during World War II was discovered in the basement of Argentina's Supreme Court. The documents, intended to propagate Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina, were found accidentally during a relocation of court archives. The boxes contained Nazi propaganda, photographs, and notebooks from the National Socialist German Workers' Party Organization Abroad and the German Trade Union. The contents are being scanned, digitized, and reviewed to uncover information about the Holocaust and the regime's financial activities.</p>

Israel paused its military operations in Gaza for a few hours to facilitate the transfer, which a Hamas official described as a goodwill gesture.

Alexander is the first hostage to be freed since Israel restarted its military offensive in March.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article examines the impact of President Trump's trade policies, particularly the imposition and subsequent reduction of tariffs on Chinese products. The article suggests that the tariff chaos did not generate significant concessions from China beyond a commitment to continue negotiations. It questions whether the trade disruptions were worth the economic pain experienced by American businesses. The decision to lower tariffs provides temporary relief but does little to ease long-term uncertainty for U.S. firms.</p>

          <p>This New York Times guest essay discusses the potential health risks associated with the thousands of additives allowed in U.S. food, particularly ultraprocessed foods. It highlights that the U.S. allows food companies to self-certify the safety of many chemicals without FDA approval, leading to limited testing and a lack of understanding about long-term health effects and chemical interactions. The author argues that regulators are relying on outdated science and not routinely re-examining chemicals already on the market, raising concerns about the safety of the American food supply.</p>
