          <p>Japan's political landscape has been destabilized after the Komeito party announced its departure from the ruling coalition with the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), ending a partnership that has lasted since 1999. This move significantly jeopardizes Sanae Takaichi's bid to become prime minister, as the LDP no longer holds a majority in the Lower House of parliament. The split was reportedly triggered by the LDP's failure to adequately address concerns over political funding scandals. The departure leaves the LDP scrambling for support just days before a crucial parliamentary vote to select the country's next leader.</p>

          <p>India has officially announced the reopening of its embassy in Kabul, four years after it was closed following the Taliban's return to power in 2021. The decision was revealed by Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar during a meeting with his Afghan counterpart, Amir Khan Muttaqi, who was on a landmark visit to India. This development signifies a major step towards normalizing diplomatic relations between the two countries. Muttaqi's visit is the first by a senior Taliban leader to India since the group retook control of Afghanistan, signaling a potential new phase of engagement.</p>

          <p>The Pima County Sheriff’s Department in Arizona is testing an AI program called Draft One to help deputies write incident reports more efficiently. The system transcribes audio from body cameras to generate a first draft, which deputies must then review, edit, and verify for accuracy before submission. Officials state the technology can reduce the time spent on paperwork from 30 minutes to just five, freeing up deputies for other duties. While the program shows promise for improving productivity, experts raise concerns about potential AI inaccuracies and the need for rigorous human oversight to prevent serious consequences like false arrests.</p>

          <p>The NFL's announcement that Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny will headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show has ignited a backlash from conservative commentators and MAGA supporters. Critics have pointed to the artist's support for Kamala Harris, his use of Spanish in his music, and his challenging of gender norms as reasons for their disapproval. The controversy highlights ongoing cultural and political divisions, particularly concerning Puerto Rico's status and Latino identity in the U.S. Despite the negative reactions, the artist's music has seen a surge in streams, and the NFL's decision is seen by some as a strategic move to increase global viewership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group concerning Kendrick Lamar's hit song "Not Like Us." The court ruled that Lamar's lyrics, which accused Drake of serious misconduct, constituted "nonactionable opinion" within the heated context of a rap battle. The judge noted that a reasonable listener would not interpret the incendiary language of a diss track as verifiable fact. This ruling marks a significant moment in what has been called one of the most infamous rivalries in rap history, reinforcing creative expression protections in artistic disputes.</p>

          <p>JP Morgan Chase has informed employees at its new Manhattan headquarters that sharing their biometric data, such as fingerprints or eye scans, is now a requirement for building access. This policy, which was previously voluntary, is being implemented to enhance security at the multibillion-dollar skyscraper. The move comes amid heightened corporate security concerns in New York and has sparked debate over workplace surveillance and employee privacy. While exemptions are available for some staff, the mandate reflects a broader trend of companies using technology to monitor and manage their workforce.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has responded to comments from his ex-teammate Steven Gerrard, who recently described their renowned "golden generation" squad as being full of "egotistical losers." Speaking on his podcast, Rooney defended the team's effort, stating that while they ultimately failed to win a major trophy, it was not for a lack of trying or a poor attitude. He suggested that intense club rivalries and a different media environment at the time contributed to the challenges they faced. Rooney asserted that every player worked hard and was committed to succeeding for the national team.</p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, the leader of Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru, has declared that his party is ready to replace the long-governing Welsh Labour party at the next Senedd election. In his conference speech, he promised a "new government, with new energy and new ideas," positioning Plaid Cymru as the main alternative for voters seeking change. He also framed the election as a choice between his party and the rising threat of Reform UK, urging voters to back Plaid to stop Nigel Farage's party from gaining a foothold. This marks a strategic effort to broaden the party's appeal beyond its traditional base.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered evidence that landlords in London are widely flouting the city's 90-night annual limit for short-term rentals on platforms like Airbnb. The research found over 1,000 instances of duplicate listings for the same property, a tactic used to reset the 90-night counter and continue renting to tourists year-round. This practice is exacerbating London's severe housing shortage by keeping properties off the long-term rental market. Local officials have described the situation as making a "mockery" of the law, while Airbnb maintains it has systems in place to enforce the cap.</p>

          <p>Councils across London will receive a £36.5 million funding boost from the government to help address the city's severe homelessness crisis this winter. The capital, where one in 50 people are homeless and record numbers of children are in temporary accommodation, will get the largest share of a national funding package. The money is designated for initiatives aimed at preventing rough sleeping and supporting families at risk of losing their homes. While the investment has been welcomed by the Mayor of London and charities, they also stress the need for a long-term strategy to tackle the root causes of the crisis.</p>

          <p>Beijing has blacklisted Canadian semiconductor research firm TechInsights, designating it an "unreliable entity" and prohibiting Chinese organizations from providing it with data. The move comes after TechInsights published a detailed analysis of Huawei's latest AI chips, which reportedly found components sourced from outside mainland China, raising questions about supply chain dependencies. This action by China's Commerce Ministry, citing national security, is seen as a way to control information and could increase the opaqueness of the country's rapidly developing chip industry.

          <p>A federal grand jury in Virginia has indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James on charges of bank fraud and making false statements, an action that follows President Donald Trump's public calls for her prosecution.

James has called the charges "baseless" and a form of political retribution, accusing the president of weaponizing the justice system in response to her successful civil fraud lawsuit against him and his company. The case raises serious concerns about the politicization of the Department of Justice.</p>
