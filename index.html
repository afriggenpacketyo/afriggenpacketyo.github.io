          <p>Investigators in San Bernardino County now believe 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro is dead, leading to the arrest of his parents, Jake and Rebecca Haro, on murder charges. The initial kidnapping report from a Yucaipa store parking lot was determined to be false, with authorities citing inconsistencies in Rebecca Haro's story. A 2-year-old child was previously removed from the home during a search, and the father has a past conviction for child cruelty. The search for the infant's body continues amidst this tragic development.</p>

          <p>North Korea has accused South Korea of a 'serious provocation' following an incident where South Korean troops fired warning shots at North Korean soldiers near the inter-Korean border. The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff confirmed their troops fired shots after North Korean soldiers briefly crossed the military demarcation line while setting up barriers. The North Korean soldiers retreated without incident, and no casualties were reported, though Pyongyang claims the action coincided with US-South Korean military drills.</p>

          <p>Lyle Menendez was denied parole by the California board, a day after his brother Erik also had his bid for freedom rejected, meaning both will remain in prison for the 1989 murders of their parents. Despite being described as a 'model inmate,' the board cited Lyle's lack of self-control and past deceptions, while Erik's parole was denied due to prison policy violations. The brothers, whose sentences were recently reduced making them eligible, maintain they acted in self-defense after years of alleged abuse, a claim disputed by prosecutors.</p>

The ruling extends a preliminary injunction that blocks the administration from conditioning federal funds based on policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration efforts. The judge deemed the administration's executive orders an 'unconstitutional coercive threat,' supporting cities that argued billions of dollars were at risk due to their 'sanctuary' policies.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost 2-1 to the San Diego Padres, resulting in a first-place tie in the National League West after squandering recent momentum. Despite a strong start from Blake Snell and a home run from rookie Alex Freeland, the Dodgers' offense faltered against Yu Darvish and the Padres' bullpen. This defeat marks a setback for the team, which had previously dominated the Padres this season, leaving them once again on the back foot in the standings.</p>

          <p>The United States is monitoring a fleet of five Chinese icebreakers and research vessels operating in the Arctic Ocean, raising concerns about China's intensifying interest in the region. The vessels, including the Xue Long 2, crossed the Bering Strait earlier this month, with the US Coast Guard noting their proximity to the Alaskan coast. This development highlights geopolitical tensions as the US tracks China's growing presence in the Arctic, particularly near disputed areas of the extended continental shelf.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has announced a plan for mass deportations of asylum seekers arriving in the UK via small boats, citing national security threats and potential public disorder. Farage advocates for withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights and banning asylum claims from small boat arrivals, proposing detention on disused RAF bases and returns to countries like Afghanistan and Eritrea. While Labour and Conservatives criticize the plan as unrealistic or recycled, Reform UK emphasizes the need for radical action to deter illegal immigration.</p>

This shift is attributed to Hong Kong's more active capital market and ongoing US-China rivalry, which introduces delisting risks for Chinese stocks in American markets, making Hong Kong a more stable option.

Police identified the alleged shooter as 25-year-old Curtis James Jr., who is now in custody. Authorities stated the shooting stemmed from a workplace dispute between two men who knew each other, which began earlier in the week.

          <p>The FBI conducted searches at the home and political action committee office of former National Security Adviser John Bolton in Bethesda, Maryland, as part of a classified documents investigation. President Trump claimed he learned of the raid from TV, calling Bolton a 'lowlife' and 'unpatriotic.' Bolton, who previously served in the Trump administration, wrote a critical memoir that led to a Justice Department inquiry over alleged classified information disclosure, an investigation later closed by the Biden administration. Agents were seen removing boxes from his residence.</p>

          <p>Polling in the UK suggests a growing political divide between young men and women, with young men increasingly leaning rightward while young women tend towards more liberal views. A 2025 survey found more young women identify as left-wing compared to young men, with the Green Party performing particularly well among young women, and Reform UK gaining traction with young men. Researchers attribute this trend to factors like higher education for women and the influence of social media, which offers alternative political engagement outside traditional parties.</p>

          <p>The release of Ghislaine Maxwell's interview transcripts has provided some relief for Donald Trump, as her comments largely support his efforts to distance himself from Jeffrey Epstein, but failed to quell outrage among his supporters. The transcripts reveal Maxwell's denials of witnessing Trump in inappropriate settings or having a close relationship with Epstein, and her focus on Bill Clinton. This article analyzes how the transcripts, while not incriminating for Trump, highlight ongoing political tensions and the persistent 'deep state' conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein's connections and death.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's claim of over 700 arrests in Washington D.C. as part of its crime crackdown is being met with caution by criminal justice experts. They argue that arrest numbers alone are not a reliable indicator of public safety, as many arrests may not lead to charges or convictions, and can reflect enforcement priorities rather than actual crime reduction. Concerns are raised about potential rights violations and the risks associated with 'flooding the zone' with federal officers, highlighting the need for more comprehensive data to assess the initiative's true impact.</p>

Abrego Garcia's attorneys received a 72-hour notice of his potential removal, despite a 2019 ruling that he cannot be deported to El Salvador due to fear of gang persecution.</p>

          <p>A Colorado judge has rejected a plea agreement for Jon Hallford, a funeral home owner who admitted to abusing 191 corpses, after emotional testimony from victims' families. Hallford and his wife, Carie, operated a fraudulent scheme, taking money for cremations but leaving bodies to decay and providing families with concrete instead of ashes. The judge's rare decision, influenced by the families' desire for a more severe punishment, means Hallford could withdraw his guilty plea or face sentencing without a guaranteed outcome, resetting the state criminal case.</p>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive crackdown on homelessness in Washington D.C., involving federal agents clearing encampments, is drawing comparisons to San Francisco's controversial and evolving approach to its own visible homelessness crisis. This article highlights that while San Francisco's similar 'get-tough' policies have reduced tent numbers, the overall homeless population continues to rise, raising questions about the effectiveness and punitive nature of such strategies. Critics argue criminalizing homelessness fails to address underlying issues, prompting debate on whether D.C. will see similar mixed results.</p>
