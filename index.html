          <p>OpenAI is set to acquire io, the AI devices startup founded by former iPhone designer Jony Ive, for $6.4 billion in an all-equity deal. Ive will assume significant creative and design responsibilities across OpenAI and io, with his "creative collective" LoveFrom remaining independent. This acquisition follows OpenAI's recent valuation at $300 billion and its $3 billion purchase of Windsurf, an AI coding tool, as the company intensifies efforts to maintain its lead in the competitive generative AI landscape. This move underscores OpenAI's commitment to hardware operations amidst competition from Google, Anthropic, and Elon Musk's xAI.</p>

          <p>Ed Martin, a Trump loyalist and the head of the Justice Department‚Äôs ‚Äúweaponization‚Äù group, plans to expose and discredit individuals he deems guilty, even without sufficient evidence for prosecution. This approach marks a departure from the traditional prosecutorial norm of speaking only through evidence and court filings, raising concerns about the department's impartiality and ethical standards. Martin's actions include inquiries into Trump's political adversaries, such as Andrew Cuomo and Senator Chuck Schumer, and he intends to subject the president‚Äôs accusers to humiliations comparable to what Mr. Trump endured. The article suggests this effort is part of a broader pattern of blurring the lines between personal score-settling and governance under the Trump administration.</p>

Single parents are finding their budgets stretched thin, with childcare costs consuming a significant portion of their income, leaving little to nothing at the end of the month.

          <p>The Senate passed a bipartisan bill that would eliminate federal taxes on tips, a move supported by both President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. The bill allows workers to deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028, provided they are reported. However, some analysts argue that the policy could lead to income misclassification and the introduction of tipping in new occupations. The article notes that the tax break would primarily benefit moderate to middle-income workers, as lower-income tipped workers often do not pay federal income tax due to their earnings falling under the standard deduction.

          <p>The article questions the GOP's resistance to Chinese investment in the U.S., particularly in the battery manufacturing sector. While President Trump has advocated for attracting factories to the U.S., some Republicans have attacked companies like Gotion and CATL due to their Chinese origins. The author argues that these companies bring jobs and advanced technology to the U.S., benefiting the American economy. He calls for a rational approach to economic rebalancing with China, rather than one based on paranoia.</p>
