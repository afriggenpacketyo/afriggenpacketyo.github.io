          <p>Renowned investor Warren Buffett has announced a donation of $6 billion in Berkshire Hathaway stock to five charitable foundations, continuing his long-standing philanthropic pledge. This latest contribution brings his total donations since 2006 to approximately $60 billion. The largest portion of the nearly 12.4 million Class B shares will go to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. This act aligns with Buffett's 2006 commitment to give away the majority of his vast fortune, emphasizing his belief in addressing wealth inequality through private philanthropy.</p>

The caskets of Revolutionary Guard chief Gen.

          <p>A 20-year-old woman sustained minor injuries after likely being bitten by a juvenile shark while swimming at Jones Beach, New York. The incident occurred while she was in waist-deep water, resulting in non-life-threatening cuts to her leg and foot. Although the woman did not see the creature, experts analyzed the bite marks and concluded they were most likely from a young sand tiger shark. Following the event, swimming was temporarily suspended as officials conducted drone searches of the area to ensure public safety.</p>

          <p>The UK government has strongly criticized chants calling for "death to the IDF" during a performance by rap-punk duo Bob Vylan at the Glastonbury Festival, which was broadcast live by the BBC. The broadcaster acknowledged the comments were "deeply offensive" and has removed the set from its on-demand iPlayer service. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy sought an explanation from the BBC regarding its due diligence. Police are now reviewing footage from the performance to determine if any criminal offenses were committed during the politically charged set.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are advancing a massive 940-page spending bill, a cornerstone of President Donald Trump's second-term agenda, aiming for a vote before the July 4th deadline.

A key provision involves a tentative deal to raise the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for many households. The bill's passage remains uncertain due to its $5 trillion debt ceiling increase and opposition from some fiscally conservative Republicans.</p>

          <p>A severe mudslide triggered by heavy rains caused a 12-mile traffic backup on the West Virginia Turnpike, stranding thousands of motorists for more than eight hours overnight.

The judge ruled that a Pennsylvania state law designed to protect against lawsuits targeting free speech does not apply in federal court.

          <p>A man's arrest in Southern California for allegedly impersonating a federal immigration officer marks the latest in a series of similar incidents across the U.S. Experts warn that the increased use of plainclothes and masked agents by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) makes it easier for imposters to deceive the public. Cases in several states have involved individuals posing as ICE agents to commit crimes, including kidnapping and sexual assault. Critics argue this trend poses a significant public safety threat, as it becomes difficult for citizens to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate law enforcement actions.</p>

While their initial court battle was unsuccessful, it helped pave the way for the state to legalize marriage equality in 2012.

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at record highs, navigating a week marked by significant geopolitical risk and mixed economic signals. The market largely shrugged off fears of escalation after the U.S. entered the Israel-Iran conflict, with a subsequent plunge in oil prices easing concerns about inflation and economic growth. Investor optimism was also fueled by increasing expectations of multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts by year-end. However, a slightly hotter-than-expected core inflation reading from the PCE price index adds a note of caution to the outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recently concluded Supreme Court term delivered significant victories for conservative states and bolstered former President Trump's claims of executive power. The court's 6-3 conservative majority sided with Republican-led states on issues like restricting transgender medical treatments and denying Medicaid funds to Planned Parenthood. While not landmark national rulings, these decisions reflect a states-rights approach. The court also repeatedly sided with Trump by setting aside lower court orders that had blocked his initiatives, focusing on reining in judicial power rather than directly ruling on the legality of the president's actions.</p>

The suspects were arrested on suspicion of preparing or instigating acts of terrorism. Following the security breach, the UK government has announced its intention to proscribe Palestine Action, making it illegal to be a member or supporter of the group.</p>

          <p>A new study of an ancient city in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society ruled by females over 9,000 years ago. Researchers analyzed DNA from over 130 skeletons found at Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k, a well-preserved Neolithic settlement. The genetic analysis revealed that where biological connections existed among household members buried together, the lineage was traced through the female line, indicating husbands likely moved into their wives' households. This evidence, along with a preferential treatment for females in grave goods, points to a society where maternal ancestry was key.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured a dominant pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, saying he felt like his "old me" was back after a challenging season. Norris outpaced the field by over half a second, delivering a lap he described as near perfection. This performance comes after a season hampered by qualifying mistakes, which he attributes to a lack of feeling from his car. Recent upgrades to the McLaren seem to have resolved the issue, placing him in a strong position to challenge his championship-leading teammate, Oscar Piastri, who will start in third.</p>
