The agreement imposes a 15% tariff on South Korean goods, while U.S. exports to the country will face no new tariffs. As part of the deal, South Korea will reportedly make substantial investments in the U.S. and purchase American energy products. This follows recent trade agreements with Japan and the European Union, though the South Korean government has not yet publicly confirmed the terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food & Drug Administration has issued a consumer warning after a production mishap led to some Celsius energy drink cans being filled with vodka. The error occurred when a supplier mistakenly sent empty Celsius cans for the "Astro Vibe Blue Razz" edition to the High Noon vodka seltzer company. Consequently, High Noon is also recalling some of its Beach Variety packs that came from the same production line. Consumers are advised to check lot codes on the bottom of the cans and dispose of any affected products.</p>

The company provided a second-quarter revenue forecast that aligned with market predictions, but the slowdown in its core smartphone business has concerned investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Colorado dentist, James Craig, has been charged with the first-degree murder of his wife, Angela Craig, who died after a mysterious illness. Prosecutors allege he poisoned her by lacing her routine protein shakes with substances like potassium cyanide and arsenic, which he reportedly researched and purchased online. The investigation began after a suspicious package containing cyanide was delivered to his dental office, and a colleague alerted authorities. While the defense may argue Craig was suicidal himself, the case highlights a complex web of alleged deceit, including a purported affair and financial troubles.</p>

          <p>Former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas and five others have been arrested and charged with running an illegal high-stakes poker operation from a mansion he owned in Encino, California.

The indictment details text messages where Arenas, nicknamed "Agent Zero," discussed arrangements for the games. Arenas pleaded not guilty to charges including conspiracy and making false statements to federal investigators.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, the Federal Reserve is reluctant to cut interest rates due to a mixed and uncertain macroeconomic environment. He notes that while some indicators like disappointing earnings from major retailers suggest a weakening consumer, others like strong reports from Visa and Starbucks show resilience. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has highlighted that a strong labor market and healthy GDP growth make a rate cut seem unreasonable at this time. Cramer believes the Fed is waiting for more definitive data before making a move, especially to avoid cutting too early and allowing inflation to resurge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Popular television shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt" are captivating audiences with their intensely stressful, high-anxiety narratives. These series use hyperrealistic filmmaking techniques, such as real-time sequences and single continuous shots, to immerse viewers in chaotic, high-pressure environments like a restaurant kitchen or an emergency room. Psychologists suggest that watching such scenarios can induce a "vicarious stress" response, which can be satisfying because it carries no real-world risk. This trend may also reflect a cultural desire for realism and a cathartic acknowledgment of the high-stakes pressures of modern work life.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Ends Global Tariff Exemption for Low-Value Imports</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 17:47:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to end the "de minimis" tariff exemption for all countries, a rule that previously allowed imports valued at $800 or less to enter the U.S. duty-free. This global expansion follows a similar order in May that specifically targeted goods from China and Hong Kong. The White House stated the move is necessary to prevent tariff evasion and to stop the flow of illicit opioids into the country. The change, which overrides a later deadline set by Congress, will subject these small packages to standard tariff rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of twelve Democratic members of the House of Representatives has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging they were unlawfully denied access to immigrant detention facilities. The lawmakers claim that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has repeatedly blocked them from conducting oversight visits, despite a federal law guaranteeing them access. The lawsuit demands that the administration comply with the law, citing the need for oversight amid reports of overcrowding and poor conditions in the facilities. The Department of Homeland Security responded that visit requests must be scheduled in advance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its conflict with Brazil by imposing 50% tariffs and sanctioning a Brazilian Supreme Court justice. These actions are seen as an attempt to pressure Brazil's government regarding the criminal case against former President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right ally of Trump, who is accused of planning a coup. The administration has accused Brazilian officials of a "witch hunt" against Bolsonaro. Brazil's government has so far responded with defiance, with President Lula da Silva stating he will not take orders from foreign leaders.</p>

While the most severe warnings were later downgraded, officials cautioned that dangerous currents and waves could persist for hours.

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has announced she will not be a candidate for governor of California in the upcoming election, ending months of speculation. In a statement, Harris said that her public service will not be in elected office "for now," leaving the race to succeed the term-limited Governor Gavin Newsom wide open. Her decision reshapes the contest for the state's top job and allows her to explore other roles, potentially including another presidential run in the future.

The series captures Brady's visit to the club in November 2023, where he tells colleagues he is "a little worried" about Rooney's approach. Brady also describes the team's players as "lazy and entitled." The comments were made during Rooney's brief and unsuccessful 83-day tenure as manager, a period in which the club's performance sharply declined, ultimately contributing to their relegation to League One.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that Americans' views on the national economy have improved slightly, though they remain net negative. The improvement is partly tied to more positive ratings of the stock market, particularly among higher-income individuals. However, this optimism is tempered by widespread concern about future price increases, with two-thirds of Americans expecting the cost of goods to rise. This outlook is impacting spending plans, as half of the respondents, especially those at lower income levels, intend to cut back on discretionary purchases. (not investment advice)</p>

The administration's initial threats to withdraw support were met with resistance, forcing it to escalate its commitment and drain American power.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 50% tariff on certain finished and semi-finished copper products, including pipes and wiring, effective this Friday. The move surprised markets because it excluded raw copper materials like cathodes and concentrates, falling short of the sweeping restrictions that had been anticipated. While the White House cited national security concerns, the targeted nature of the levy primarily aids U.S. manufacturers rather than the mining industry. The exclusion of raw materials provides a boost to major copper-producing nations like Chile and Peru. (not investment advice)</p>
