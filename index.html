          <h2>Greg Abel Designated as Warren Buffett's Successor at Berkshire Hathaway</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 07:20:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warren Buffett announced his intention to step down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, endorsing Greg Abel as his successor, a move that surprised shareholders. Buffett expressed confidence in Abel, who currently oversees Berkshire's non-insurance companies and rebuilt MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Abel's appointment signals a shift towards a more hands-on management style, though he will likely grant managers autonomy, and Buffett will remain as chairman to assist with acquisitions during volatile markets. The article highlights Abel's background, including his experience in the energy sector and his reputation for being more guarded than Buffett, but also well-regarded by Berkshire's managers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study in the American Journal of Psychiatry indicates a rise in talk therapy use among American adults with mental health needs, accompanied by a decline in psychiatric medication-only treatment. Between 2018 and 2021, the percentage of adults receiving only medication decreased, while the percentage receiving only talk therapy increased, particularly among those with depression, anxiety, and trauma-related disorders. The study suggests psychotherapy is becoming more accessible, possibly due to increased awareness and the expansion of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the study also notes that increased access to talk therapy primarily benefits affluent individuals with higher education and private insurance.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the benefit clawback rate from 100% to 50% for certain beneficiaries facing overpayment notices, effective April 25. This change applies to Title II benefits, including retirement, survivors, and disability insurance, while the withholding rate for Supplemental Security Income benefits remains at 10%.

The dollar's reserve status keeps demand for America's currency and debt artificially high, and the article explains why Trump's policies are undermining the dollar's preeminence.
