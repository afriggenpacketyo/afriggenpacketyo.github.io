          <p>Chris Mason of the BBC analyzes UK immigration trends, noting a consistent rise in net migration since 1994, a trend that continued even after Brexit despite political promises to reduce numbers. The article highlights the failure of successive governments to curb immigration, with net migration reaching historically high levels. The latest data is expected to show a decrease in 2024, but the overall trend remains upward, making it a significant political and social issue. The article provides context on the challenges faced by political leaders in managing immigration amid changing demographics.</p>

          <p>A measure in President Trump's reconciliation bill aimed at restricting federal payments to large abortion providers is facing opposition from moderate House Republicans, potentially jeopardizing the bill's passage. Representative Mike Lawler raised concerns about the definition of "large groups" providing abortion services, questioning the need for the measure given the existing Hyde Amendment. With a slim majority, House Republicans can't afford much dissent, and the bill also includes spending cuts related to Medicaid work requirements and healthcare for illegal immigrants, as well as repealing Biden's green energy subsidies.</p>
