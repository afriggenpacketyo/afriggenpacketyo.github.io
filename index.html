          <p>Northampton Saints achieved a commanding 36-19 bonus-point victory against Newcastle Red Bulls at Kingston Park, propelling them to the top of the Prem table. This impressive win, marked by five tries, positions them ahead of reigning champions Bath, who are scheduled to play Leicester Tigers on Saturday. Saints' victory was particularly notable as they spent half an hour of the match with a player sin-binned, yet still maintained control. Newcastle, despite brief moments of parity, remains without a league win since last November, unable to capitalize on opportunities and facing lasting frustration over their inability to convert advantages.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In his new memoir "Future Boy," 64-year-old actor Michael J. Fox candidly recounted feeling "like a whore" during a specific day on the set of his 1985 film "Teen Wolf." He described being asked by a prop guy to pose with a chocolate bar for a confectioner, an experience he sharply contrasted with the supportive atmosphere on the set of "Back to the Future." Despite his personal discomfort, "Teen Wolf" became a significant box office success, grossing $80 million on a modest $4 million budget. The article also touches upon Fox's ongoing journey with Parkinson's disease, diagnosed in 1991, and his recent return to acting in the Apple TV+ comedy "Shrinking," where his character does not have to contend with his illness.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 17:11:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hamas has transferred the remains of another deceased Israeli hostage to the Red Cross in the southern Gaza Strip, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed. This action follows Hamas's earlier statement that it had handed over all recoverable remains and that locating additional bodies would require extensive efforts and specialized equipment. The broader Gaza peace plan had stipulated the return of all remaining hostages, both living and deceased, by October 13. However, with this latest transfer, the remains of at least 18 Israeli hostages are still unaccounted for, highlighting the ongoing challenges in fulfilling the agreement's terms. Senior U.S. advisers are now sharing Israeli intelligence with Hamas to assist in finding the remains, and Turkey has offered expert search teams.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Seeks Supreme Court Approval for Illinois National Guard Deployment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 17:04:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has formally asked the Supreme Court to allow the deployment of federalized National Guard members in Illinois, challenging a lower court order that blocked the move. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the district court's decision "countermands the exercise of the President's Commander-in-Chief authority" and impedes efforts to protect federal immigration officers and government property amidst ongoing protests. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has vehemently opposed the federalization, calling it "un-American" to deploy troops against the state's will. A U.S. appeals court previously upheld the block, stating the facts did not justify the President's actions under Title 10, setting the stage for a significant legal showdown over presidential power.</p>

          <p>President Trump asserted that Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro has offered "everything," including significant stakes in the country's oil, gold, and other natural resources, to de-escalate tensions with the United States. Trump, using an expletive, suggested Maduro's willingness stemmed from not wanting to confront the U.S. These comments were made during a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, shortly after Trump confirmed authorizing covert CIA operations in Venezuela. The U.S. has intensified its pressure campaign, deploying warships and conducting deadly strikes on suspected drug vessels in the Caribbean, citing drug trafficking and migration as primary concerns.</p>

          <p>Ford is recalling nearly 750,000 vehicles across several models due to three distinct safety concerns identified by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Over 290,000 vehicles, including certain 2020-2022 F-250 SD, F-350 SD, and F-450 SD models, are affected by a rearview camera display issue that may impede visibility. An additional 115,539 Super Duty trucks from 2020-2021 face a potential loss of steering control due to a detached steering column upper shaft. Furthermore, 332,778 Mustang models from 2015-2017 have a seatbelt cable corrosion defect. Ford dealers will provide free inspections and repairs for these issues, which could increase the risk of crashes or injuries.</p>

          <p>President Trump is actively pursuing significant White House construction projects, including a $250 million ballroom and a proposed arch opposite the Lincoln Memorial, aiming to solidify his architectural legacy. The ballroom, privately financed and now fully funded, has sparked controversy, particularly over discussions of etching donor names in the structure. California Rep. Mark Takano, a Democrat, introduced bills to ban donor names on White House grounds and prohibit federal construction during shutdowns, arguing these projects distract from critical national issues.

          <p>The remnant of Typhoon Halong has caused devastating damage across Western Alaska's Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, bringing hurricane-force winds and record flooding to numerous Alaska Native villages. Thousands are displaced, one woman is confirmed dead, and two of her family members remain missing, prompting Governor Mike Dunleavy to request a federal disaster declaration. Remote coastal villages like Kipnuk and Kwigillingok bore the brunt of the storm, facing extensive evacuations and infrastructure destruction. The region, already highly vulnerable to climate change impacts like permafrost thaw and erosion, faces immense challenges in recovery and potential long-term relocation for many communities.</p>

          <p>Tensions escalated outside the Broadview ICE detention center in the Chicago area, leading to heated confrontations between Illinois state police and protesters, resulting in at least 11 detentions. Demonstrators advanced beyond designated "protest zones," prompting officers, equipped with helmets and batons, to push the crowd back and make arrests. This incident follows a recent court order requiring federal agents in Illinois to wear body cameras during immigration operations, issued after multiple reports of pepper balls, smoke grenades, and teargas used against protesters. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker criticized the federal agents' conduct, stating they "clearly lie about what goes on."</p>

          <p>A 49-year-old man and a 65-year-old woman from Sandwell have been arrested in connection with the sexual assault of a Sikh woman in Oldbury, West Midlands. This attack, previously described by police as racially motivated, sparked significant protests and vigils last month within the local Sikh community. The suspects were initially arrested for a separate sexual assault incident in Halesowen before being subsequently linked to the September 9th attack on Tame Road. The Sikh Federation UK welcomed the arrests, expressing hope that sufficient evidence will lead to charges for those responsible for these "disgusting attacks," which have deeply affected the victim's family.</p>

          <p>Athletic shoe company On is facing a class-action lawsuit from U.S. customers alleging that its popular "CloudTec" sneakers produce a "noisy and embarrassing squeak" with every step. Plaintiffs claim the expensive shoes, typically costing around $200, are rendered unwearable without "significant DIY modifications," posing particular issues for professionals like nurses who wear them all day. The lawsuit accuses On of "deceptive marketing" and failing to address the design flaw or offer refunds despite widespread complaints. Social media posts from other frustrated customers corroborate the issue, even as On recently reported better-than-expected earnings.</p>

          <p>Honeywell is initiating a multi-stage corporate split, commencing with the spin-off of its Solstice Advanced Materials unit later this month. Shareholders of record as of October 17 will receive one Solstice share for every four Honeywell shares, with independent trading beginning October 30. This strategic move, initially advocated by activist investor Elliott Management, aims to simplify Honeywell's conglomerate structure and unlock greater value. Solstice, a mid-sized specialty chemicals business generating nearly $4 billion in sales, focuses on refrigerants, building solutions, and electronic materials. While it boasts strong margins and returns, its sales have stagnated in recent years, presenting both opportunities and challenges as an independent entity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Seven fully preserved skeletons discovered in a water well within the ancient Roman city of Mursa, located in modern-day Croatia, have been identified as Roman soldiers from approximately 1,700 years ago. Researchers believe the men, aged between 18 and 50, were likely killed during a 260 C.E. battle or subsequent skirmish for the city and were "thrown in" shortly after death. Injuries on some remains, including blunt-force trauma and puncture wounds from weapons, support this theory. DNA analysis indicates the soldiers were not local to the area, with origins possibly from Northern/Eastern Europe or the Byzantine Empire, providing fascinating insights into ancient military movements and the demographics of the Roman Empire.</p>

With most of its staff furloughed, this delay could potentially lead to tax implications for borrowers if forgiveness extends beyond the 2025 tax-free provision.
