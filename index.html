          <p>President Donald Trump praised the Senate's advancement of the "One Big Beautiful Bill" after four conservative holdouts flipped their votes late Saturday night. Senators Rick Scott, Ron Johnson, Mike Lee, and Cynthia Lummis agreed to move the legislation forward after securing negotiations with Republican leadership on deficit reduction and changes to Medicaid. Johnson stated they were promised a vote on an amendment to lower federal Medicaid matching for new enrollees under the ACA. While the bill has overcome this procedural hurdle, final passage is not yet guaranteed, as several Republicans remain non-committal on the ultimate vote.</p>

          <p>First responders successfully rescued four people after their 61-foot sailboat caught fire approximately one mile off the coast of Cape Canaveral, Florida. The passengers were able to evacuate safely to a bystander's boat and were brought to shore by the Brevard County Sheriff's Office with no reported injuries. Video from the scene showed thick smoke, and witnesses reported hearing what sounded like explosions as the vessel was quickly engulfed in flames. The U.S. Coast Guard and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission are now investigating the cause of the incident.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials have reported the most massive Russian airstrike since the full-scale invasion began, involving 537 aerial weapons, including drones and missiles. The attack targeted multiple regions across Ukraine, resulting in at least two civilian deaths and several injuries. During the assault, a Ukrainian F-16 pilot was killed after his aircraft was damaged while successfully shooting down seven aerial targets. The incident comes as peace talks show little progress, and Russia's foreign intelligence chief confirmed a recent phone call with his U.S. counterpart to discuss issues of mutual interest.</p>

          <p>This article details the significant concerns of cancer researchers and patients over proposed budget cuts and layoffs by the Trump administration, which could slash funding for the National Cancer Institute by nearly 40%. Scientists like Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee of Johns Hopkins warn that these cuts are creating an existential crisis, causing skilled staff to leave and jeopardizing a technological revolution in cancer research. The report highlights the personal stakes through stories like that of Kevin Callahan, a pancreatic cancer survivor whose promising vaccine trial is at risk, and Natalie Phelps, whose life-sustaining immunotherapy trial was devastatingly delayed due to staff layoffs.</p>

          <p>An early morning fire and explosion in Philadelphia's Nicetown-Tioga neighborhood led to the collapse of three rowhome buildings, injuring at least two people. An 82-year-old woman and a 62-year-old woman were taken to hospitals, with one listed in critical condition. Residents reported being woken by a "big bang," and officials have evacuated adjacent properties as a precaution against further collapses. The Philadelphia Fire Department described it as an extensive, all-day operation, with local and federal agencies, including the ATF, on site to investigate the cause of the explosion.</p>

He described securing a majority in the upper chamber as a "must-attain" goal, acknowledging the difficulty amid voter concerns over inflation, stagnant wages, and economic uncertainty. Ishiba's government faces pressure as a recent poll shows half of voters want the ruling coalition to lose its majority. The prime minister also addressed rising rice prices, promising a new policy to support producers, and ongoing tariff negotiations with the United States.</p>

          <p>This article challenges the narrative of a "sex recession" among Gen Z, arguing that while they are having less partnered sex than previous generations, they are leading a new sexual revolution. It posits that Gen Z's approach is not about frequency but about redefining sex, gender, and relationships, driven by a deep understanding of their political dimensions. Having grown up post-#MeToo and with the erosion of reproductive rights, many young people are rejecting traditional, heteronormative definitions of sex and virginity. This progressive shift focuses on inclusivity, consent, and dismantling outdated gendered expectations, making them a politically and sexually progressive generation.</p>

          <p>This long-form article explores the pervasive and maddening phenomenon of "sludge"â€”the bureaucratic friction, endless hold times, and procedural hurdles that define modern customer service. Using a personal, months-long battle with Ford over a malfunctioning car, the author investigates why these systems often feel intentionally broken. The piece reveals that some companies find it profitable to create hassles, and it details how call center metrics can incentivize agents to be unhelpful. This systemic dysfunction, the article argues, leads to widespread consumer rage and a state of weary resignation, eroding trust in institutions and costing people time, money, and sanity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that a significant portion of the liberal argument for youth gender medicine is based on a "misinformation bubble" of unsubstantiated claims. It highlights that the assertion that transitioning prevents suicide is not supported by robust evidence, a point conceded by an ACLU lawyer before the Supreme Court. The piece contends that major medical organizations' consensus is politically influenced and that internal documents from groups like WPATH reveal doubts about the evidence base for treatments like puberty blockers. The author suggests that this reliance on weak evidence and suppression of debate has hindered a nuanced discussion about care for gender-dysphoric minors.</p>

The invitation comes amid ongoing trade tensions and diplomatic challenges, with Russian President Vladimir Putin also expected to attend the parade.

          <p>The UK's Labour government is now in a stronger position to pass its flagship welfare reform bill after making significant concessions to avoid a large backbench rebellion. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled and that concerns from over 120 Labour MPs led to crucial changes, including limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only. The government also reversed plans to freeze the health-related component of universal credit. Rebel MPs have indicated they will now support the bill, which aims to ensure the long-term sustainability of the welfare system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court issued a ruling that limits the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions against President Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship, but it did not rule on the order's constitutionality. The decision allows the administration to begin planning implementation, though a 30-day grace period means no immediate changes. This could lead to a fractured system where birthright citizenship is challenged in the 28 states that have not sued the administration. Legal challenges to the order's merits will continue in lower courts, and critics are already filing new class-action lawsuits to protect noncitizen pregnant women.</p>

          <p>England international striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin has announced his departure from Everton after nine years with the club. The 28-year-old, whose contract expires on Monday, confirmed the "incredibly difficult decision" in an Instagram post, stating it was the right moment for him and his family to seek a new challenge. Calvert-Lewin joined the club in 2016 and scored 71 goals in 273 appearances, with his best season in 2020-21 earning him a spot on England's Euros squad. His departure leaves Everton searching for a new striker ahead of their first season at their new stadium.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the Trump administration is using the same aggressive civil-rights enforcement playbook developed by progressives to target universities with conservative agendas. While the Obama and Biden administrations used Title IX to police sexual misconduct, the Trump administration is now using Title VI to investigate anti-Semitism and DEI initiatives, threatening to withhold federal funds. The author contends that this approach, regardless of political aim, leads to illiberal excesses, bureaucratic bloat, and infringements on academic freedom and free speech. The piece suggests this cycle of regulatory overreach could ultimately push both sides to support new congressional limits on the administrative state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the growing popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services, particularly among Gen Z and millennials, as a symptom of broader economic anxieties. Economic commentator Kyla Scanlon argues that while BNPL offers interest-free, short-term loans, it also encourages impulsive spending on non-essential items. The trend is seen not just as poor financial management but as a psychological response from a generation facing stagnant wages, high living costs, and the perceived impossibility of traditional financial milestones like homeownership. For many, small luxuries financed through BNPL provide a sense of agency in an economy that feels inaccessible.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has stated that Iran retains the capacity to restart uranium enrichment within "a matter of months." Despite recent U.S. and Israeli strikes on its nuclear facilities, Grossi noted that the damage was not total and Iran's industrial and technological capabilities remain. This assessment appears to contrast with President Trump's claim that the U.S. had "obliterated" Iran's nuclear program. Meanwhile, Iran's supreme leader declared the country would never surrender, and its armed forces chief expressed doubt that Israel would maintain the recent US-brokered ceasefire.</p>

This occurred despite a government watchdog previously advising him not to lobby the government on the company's behalf.

          <p>A Catholic school in the New Orleans area has fired a longtime music teacher, Mark Richards, after a parent discovered he was married to a man from his late husband's obituary. Richards, who taught at St. Francis Xavier school for 21 years, was dismissed for violating a morality clause in his contract that prohibits same-sex marriage. The firing has sparked an outcry from other parents, who have started a petition calling the decision "unjust" and praising Richards as a beloved teacher.

With no confirmed or acting director, legal experts say HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has direct control, a situation made concerning by his anti-vaccine history. Kennedy, however, testified that another official is running the agency, creating ambiguity that could lead to legal challenges against CDC decisions. This leadership vacuum comes as a new law requires Senate confirmation for the CDC director for the first time, leaving key public health recommendations in a state of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, author V (formerly Eve Ensler) reflects on navigating the despair of the current political climate, which she describes as authoritarian, cruel, and complicit in global suffering. She argues that survival depends on embracing dualityâ€”feeling rage but channeling it into action, and acknowledging reality without succumbing to hopelessness. Drawing inspiration from activists in the Congo and community organizers in the U.S., she posits that collective action, such as marches and local mutual aid, is essential for building community and resisting fascism. The essay concludes that protecting each other's humanity is a powerful form of resistance.</p>

          <p>The lone star tick, which can trigger a red meat allergy known as alpha-gal syndrome in people it bites, is rapidly expanding its territory across the U.S. due to the climate crisis. Experts warn that rising temperatures have allowed these aggressive ticks to move from the Southeast to northern and western regions, potentially exposing millions. Cases of alpha-gal syndrome have surged from a few dozen in 2009 to a possible 450,000 today. The condition causes severe allergic reactions hours after consuming red meat, and the ticks' spread is expected to lead to a continued increase in cases.</p>
