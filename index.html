          <p>Katie Boulter achieved her first WTA clay-court victory by defeating Katerina Siniakova at the Madrid Open, amidst a competitive environment to maintain her British number one ranking. Boulter has held the top British women's player spot since June 2023 but has experienced fluctuations in her world ranking due to a foot injury that limited her tournament appearances this season. Despite the pressure from Emma Raducanu and Sonay Kartal, Boulter remains confident and focused on her health, prioritizing long-term goals over immediate ranking concerns. Boulter secured GB's place in the Billie Jean King Cup Finals alongside Jodie Burrage in the deciding doubles.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested that revenue from tariffs could potentially replace the federal income tax, an idea he previously mentioned during his presidential campaign. Economists are skeptical of this proposal, citing that it is unrealistic, especially given the ongoing tariff negotiations and the current universal tariff rate of 10% for most countries. Tariffs on Chinese goods imported to the United States are as high as 145%. Experts believe that tariffs are not a stable or sufficient source of revenue to replace income tax.
