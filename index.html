          <p>Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has launched an unsolicited $34.5 billion bid to acquire Google's Chrome browser, a valuation notably higher than its own. This significant offer emerges as Google navigates an antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice, which previously suggested divesting Chrome to foster a more equitable search market. Perplexity, recognized for its AI-driven search engine and recent browser launch, seeks to capitalize on this regulatory pressure and expand its footprint in the competitive generative AI sector. The bid underscores the escalating strategic plays and financial valuations in the evolving tech industry, where AI integration is becoming paramount.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has intensified his pressure on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, threatening a "major lawsuit" concerning Powell's oversight of costly renovations at the Fed's Washington D.C. headquarters. Trump, who consistently demands immediate interest rate cuts, claims Powell's actions have caused "incalculable" economic damage by being "Too Late." The Fed and Powell have previously defended the rising renovation costs, pushing back on Trump's figures, asserting their independence. This public dispute underscores the persistent political interference in central bank affairs, with Trump seeking to influence monetary policy and question the Fed's operational decisions.</p>

          <p>Iconic photography company Kodak has issued a "substantial doubt" warning about its ability to continue as a going concern, facing significant financial pressure from nearly $500 million in short-term debt and over $200 million in pension liabilities. This development marks another challenging chapter for the 133-year-old business, which previously underwent bankruptcy in 2012 after failing to adapt to the digital photography revolution. Despite its struggles, Kodak is currently attempting to reinvent itself by focusing on commercial and packaging printing, alongside a new venture into pharmaceutical product manufacturing. The company's future hinges on its ability to secure financial resources to meet its obligations and successfully pivot its core business.</p>

This declaration, signed by 26 of 27 EU leaders, notably excluding Hungary's Viktor Orban, precedes a crucial summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine in Alaska. The statement reflects deep European nervousness about Moscow's actions and any potential formal recognition of Russian-controlled territories.

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump are scheduled to meet in Alaska on August 15 to discuss the war in Ukraine, an agreement reached shortly after Trump's ceasefire ultimatum. Experts largely anticipate the summit will primarily benefit Putin by granting him international legitimacy, despite the absence of Ukrainian representation. Analysts suggest Putin's openness to talks is driven by Russia's weakened economy, sluggish military advances, and the increasing pressure from secondary U.S. sanctions. While an airspace ceasefire is a rumored concession, critics argue such a move would disproportionately favor Moscow, enabling continued ground offensives.</p>

          <p>Quantum computing is rapidly transitioning from academic research to commercial viability, signaling a significant and imminent real estate revolution. A new JLL report forecasts substantial real estate implications, with investments potentially reaching $20 billion by 2030 and revenues soaring to $100 billion by 2035. Unlike traditional data centers, quantum computers require highly specialized facilities with electromagnetic shielding to prevent interference, leading to new development concentrated near established research hubs and universities. This burgeoning sector, attracting major investments from tech giants like Microsoft and IBM, is expected to complement rather than replace existing data infrastructure, driving new demand in commercial real estate.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent deployment of the National Guard and temporary assumption of control over D.C.'s police force revives a long and complex history of federal intervention in the capital's governance. Before the 1973 Home Rule Act, D.C. was governed by presidential appointees for a century, and even in the 1990s, a federally created board oversaw its finances during a financial crisis. While Trump justifies his action by claiming a crime emergency, D.C.'s violent crime rates are actually at a 30-year low. This executive action highlights the city's unique, limited self-governance and further fuels the longstanding push for D.C. statehood, as residents seek full autonomy and democratic representation.</p>

          <p>As persistent economic uncertainty influences household budgets, many seniors and retirees are increasingly exploring annuities as a means to safeguard their nest eggs and ensure a predictable income stream. The safety of an annuity fundamentally relies on the financial strength of the issuing insurance company, necessitating thorough research into their credit ratings, as these products are not backed by the FDIC. While state guarantee associations offer a limited safety net, different annuity types carry vastly different risk profiles. Ultimately, while annuities effectively mitigate longevity risk, long-term inflation poses the greatest threat to purchasing power, making careful product selection and professional financial advice paramount.

Advocates and civil rights groups warn that these policies weaponize the justice department to hamper legal defense for immigrants.

This provocative idea emerges shortly after Trump's decision to fire the former BLS commissioner, whom he blamed for a disappointing jobs report.

This transfer offers Grealish a crucial opportunity to rejuvenate his career and reclaim his place in the England squad ahead of upcoming international competitions. Moyes expressed optimism about Grealish's experience and ability to perform at a high level, anticipating he will be a key player for the Toffees.</p>

          <p>Tennis star Emma Raducanu has expressed unprecedented calm and confidence regarding her prospects at the upcoming US Open, marking a significant shift since her remarkable 2021 title win. Her improved mindset follows a positive summer on the North American hard courts, highlighted by a brilliant, albeit losing, performance against Aryna Sabalenka at the Cincinnati Open. Raducanu, who has openly battled injuries and inconsistent form since her Grand Slam triumph, feels her game level has been steadily increasing. Despite a first-round exit last year, her current positive trajectory and potential for a seeding suggest she will be a formidable opponent in New York.</p>

          <p>For savers seeking stable returns amidst ongoing stock market volatility, a $100,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) account presents a predictable, fixed-rate savings option. Current interest rates indicate that a $100,000 CD can earn over $1,000 in just three months, with potential earnings reaching tens of thousands over a five-year term, depending on the chosen duration. While these returns may be lower than those offered by the stock market, CDs provide principal security and guaranteed interest growth without exposure to market fluctuations. However, locking away a significant sum means forfeiting immediate access, and early withdrawal penalties can be costly, making consultation with a financial advisor highly advisable before committing.

          <p>China has reportedly advised its domestic companies to refrain from using Nvidia's H20 and Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) MI380 chips, particularly for government and national security applications. This warning follows recent U.S. export policies that required both chipmakers to obtain licenses for shipping less advanced AI products to China, alongside an agreement for the U.S. government to receive a 15% cut of related revenues. Former President Trump publicly labeled Nvidia's H20 as "obsolete," further highlighting the ongoing geopolitical tensions surrounding semiconductor technology.

The court's decision, prompted by alarming statistics of nearly 2,000 daily dog bites in the city, mandates the sterilization and relocation of these animals to shelters within six to eight weeks. Protesters vehemently argue that the policy is inhumane and fails to address the root problem effectively, advocating instead for strict enforcement of existing animal birth control rules.

          <p>Recent polls reveal a striking reality: a strong majority of Israeli Jews are largely untroubled by reports of widespread starvation in Gaza, with many dismissing the claims as Hamas propaganda or expressing indifference. This lack of empathy, rooted in deep-seated hostility and an intense focus on the fate of Israeli hostages and soldiers, highlights a profound dehumanization of Gazan civilians. While a minority of anti-war activism is emerging, it remains limited, and mainstream politicians largely avoid connecting public discontent with a broader alternative vision for peace. The prevailing sentiment indicates that the war's conclusion should primarily serve Israeli self-interest, rather than addressing Palestinian suffering.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in July rose 2.7% on an annual basis, coming in slightly cooler than economists had forecast, with core inflation (excluding volatile food and energy prices) increasing by 3.1%. While grocery and gasoline prices saw declines, overall food and restaurant costs continued their upward trend. Economists are closely monitoring the subtle but growing impact of Trump's tariffs, which appear to be contributing to price increases in certain imported goods categories. Despite inflation remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, analysts suggest that a September rate cut is still likely, particularly given the recent slowdown in jobs growth. The Fed's upcoming decisions will be heavily informed by subsequent economic data.</p>
