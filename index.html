        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund has significantly lowered its 2025 U.S. growth forecast from 2.7% to 1.8%, citing the negative impact of President Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs and subsequent countermeasures from trading partners. The IMF's chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, noted that weakening consumer confidence and consumption indicators also contributed to the downward revision, increasing recession odds to 40%. The IMF also cut its global growth forecast to 2.8% and raised its inflation expectations for advanced economies, including the U.S., due to persistent price dynamics and the supply shock from tariffs.

          <p>A U.S. District Court in Georgia has granted a temporary restraining order, compelling the Trump administration to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other groups, alleges that Immigration and Customs Enforcement unlawfully terminated student records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, potentially leading to deportation. The judge ordered the administration to notify the court of compliance and prohibited the use of plaintiffs' identities outside the lawsuit, with a hearing scheduled for Thursday.</p>

          <p>Stock futures are indicating a positive opening after a sharp decline on Monday, triggered by President Trump's renewed criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 1,000 points amid investor uncertainty about tariffs and Powell's future. Analysts suggest the potential for a US-India trade deal and support for Fed independence from key Republicans are driving the uptick. Despite this, Trump's trade war continues to disrupt global markets, with mixed trading in Asia and ongoing investor concerns.</p>

          <p>Climate change is threatening the $100 billion U.S. fishing industry as warming rivers reduce oxygen levels and harm fish populations. A recent study found that 87% of rivers across the U.S. and Europe are warming, with 70% losing oxygen. Brian Sheppard, a guide on the Beaver Kill River in New York, notes that rising water temperatures are killing trout, making it harder to sustain his livelihood. Efforts are underway to restore river flow and protect fishing tourism by removing old dams and reinforcing banks.</p>

The school board contends that the opt-outs became unworkable, and that exposure to diverse content does not equate to coercion.
