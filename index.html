            <p>Chris Krebs, the former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), resigned from his position at a private cybersecurity firm, Sentinel One, after being targeted by an executive order from President Donald Trump. Krebs, who had been appointed by Trump to lead CISA, stated that he did not want his personal fight for democracy and free speech to negatively impact the company. The executive order labeled Krebs a "significant bad-faith actor" for maintaining the security of the 2020 election, which contradicted Trump's false claims of election fraud. Krebs's resignation underscores the ongoing tensions between the former administration and individuals who upheld the integrity of the electoral process.</p>

            <p>Nintendo announced that retail pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 gaming system will begin on April 24, following a delay caused by uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs. The company initially planned to start pre-orders on April 9 but postponed the date to assess the potential impact of tariffs on electronics manufactured in Asia. While the console price remains unchanged at $449.99, Nintendo warned that accessories will experience price adjustments and future cost changes are possible for all products. The Switch 2 is slated to launch on June 5, 2025.</p>

            <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has warned that the US will cease efforts to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine within days unless there are clear signs of progress. Rubio cited other priorities for the US and expressed skepticism about the feasibility of reaching a truce, despite President Trump's earlier confidence in securing a quick resolution. This announcement comes as Russian strikes on Ukraine continue and as the US and Ukraine take initial steps towards a minerals deal aimed at supporting Ukraine's reconstruction.

The Trump administration claimed Abrego Garcia was a member of MS-13, a claim his wife denies, leading to a legal battle over his return.

The prosecutor argues that defense plans to present photos of injuries to O'Keefe's arm could violate a previous court order. Read is accused of fatally striking O'Keefe with her SUV after a night out, while the defense suggests other factors may have contributed to his death. The judge has already ruled on the admissibility of expert testimony regarding dog bites.</p>

            <p>Authorities have identified Phoenix Ikner, a 20-year-old Florida State University student, as the suspect in a campus shooting that resulted in two deaths and multiple injuries. Court records reveal a history of custody disputes between Ikner's birth parents, and the weapon used in the shooting belonged to his stepmother, a Leon County Sheriff's deputy. Former schoolmates described Ikner, who previously went by Christian Eriksen, as having been in special education classes and exhibiting concerning behavior.

            <p>A man allegedly attempted to burn down the official residence of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro shortly after Shapiro and his family concluded their Passover seder. The assailant reportedly told a 911 operator that he targeted Shapiro "for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people" and planned to physically harm the governor. This incident is considered an act of antisemitism, given Shapiro's Jewish faith and the targeting based on perceived actions related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

            <p>A recent report detailed Elon Musk's efforts to seek out women to bear his children, often using financial incentives and requiring NDAs, raising questions about his approach to fatherhood and family. Musk's focus on raising the birth rate, particularly among intelligent people, aligns with the techno-libertarian wing of the pro-natalist movement, which prioritizes reproduction over traditional family structures. His financial arrangements with the mothers of his children, sometimes involving legal disputes and varying levels of support, further challenge conventional notions of familial duty and responsibility. This has led to a debate about whether Musk is truly pro-family or simply pro-natalist.</p>

However, critics contend that focusing solely on education obscures the underlying economic grievances and class interests that drive political behavior. They argue that the Democratic Party's emphasis on higher education has alienated working-class voters and neglected their specific needs and concerns.</p>

            <p>Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran national residing in Maryland, was mistakenly deported to an El Salvador mega-prison, prompting legal action and diplomatic efforts for his return. Ábrego García, who had been granted protection from deportation in 2019, was sent to El Salvador along with alleged gang members, leading to accusations of an "administrative error" by the Trump administration. While officials allege ties to MS-13, Judge Xinis has called this unsubstantiated. Senator Chris Van Hollen visited Ábrego García in El Salvador, highlighting the ongoing efforts to resolve the situation.</p>

            <p>Current national average CD interest rates range from 1.69% APY to 2.01% APY depending on the term. However, online banks offer much higher rates, with short-term CDs (6 months to 1 year) often providing the best returns due to the inverted yield curve. Strategies for securing good rates include focusing on online banks and considering short-term CDs, and laddering CDs for long-term savings. Investing in CDs can help savings grow and beat inflation, while offering a safe investment option with FDIC or NCUA insurance. (not investment advice)</p>
