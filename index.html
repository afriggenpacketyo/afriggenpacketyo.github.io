          <p>President Trump indicated the U.S. might pull out of peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia if progress stalls due to significant animosity. Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," Trump highlighted the "tremendous hatred" between the nations but expressed initial optimism for a resolution. He cautioned, however, that the U.S. wouldn't mediate indefinitely, implying a point at which further engagement would be deemed unproductive. The article also mentions Secretary of State Marco Rubio tempering expectations for a peace agreement, emphasizing the critical nature of the upcoming week and a recent rare earth minerals agreement signed with Ukraine.</p>

          <p>In an interview with NBC News, President Trump stated he "doesn't know" if people in the U.S. are entitled to due process, adding he is not a lawyer. He also expressed uncertainty about whether he must uphold the U.S. Constitution. The article references the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man wrongly deported, and Trump's unsubstantiated claim that Garcia was a gang member. Trump also dismissed the possibility of seeking a third term, despite earlier suggestions that he might explore methods to do so, reaffirming the constitutional limit of two presidential terms.</p>

          <p>President Trump has dismissed the possibility of seeking a third term, an idea prohibited by the Constitution, and instead suggested Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential successors. He praised Vance as a "fantastic, brilliant guy" and Rubio as "great." While acknowledging that many people have urged him to seek another term, Trump stated that he is focused on having four great years and then turning the presidency over to a capable Republican.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of federal workers are in limbo after mass firings by the Trump administration and subsequent court-ordered rehirings. Probationary workers, in particular, have experienced a chaotic cycle of dismissals, reinstatements, and further terminations. The administration's actions, driven by Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency" (Doge), have been criticized as a "sham" and a destabilizing force within the civil service. While the administration claims to be tackling waste and inefficiency, the firings have disrupted government functions and led to a loss of expertise.</p>

Within 48 hours, her elderly aunt and uncle were arrested in Hong Kong and questioned about her links to the former British colony.
