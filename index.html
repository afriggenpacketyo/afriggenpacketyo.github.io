          <p>Patty Hartman, a 17-year public affairs specialist at the Justice Department, warns the agency is "driving straight into an abyss" after being fired. Hartman, who worked on press releases for the January 6th prosecutions, is one of several employees connected to the cases to be terminated recently under the new administration. She claims her dismissal was a form of political retribution and a sign that the traditional separation between the White House and the DOJ has eroded. Hartman is considering legal action, stating her firing occurred without due process and reflects a broader destabilization.</p>

          <p>Before-and-after aerial images starkly illustrate the devastation caused by recent flash floods in Central Texas, which have claimed over 120 lives. The photos from Kerr County show entire RV parks swept away and homes ripped from their foundations by the Guadalupe River, which rose 26 feet in under an hour. One RV park owner reported all 33 of her tenants' homes were washed away, with many residents still missing from the area. The images provide a powerful visual record of the tragedy's scale and the immense force of the floodwaters.</p>

The move follows a pilot program in Austin, Texas, where remotely supervised Model Y vehicles with human safety supervisors have been tested. This expansion effort comes as Tesla works to catch up in the autonomous vehicle space, relying on a camera-based system it claims is more economically viable.

          <h2>Analysis Questions if Recent UK Heatwaves Are Normal Summer Weather or a Sign of Climate Change</h2>

          <p>Amid a record-warm year in the UK, this article explores whether the increasing frequency and intensity of heatwaves are a direct result of climate change. Scientists note that global temperature rises disproportionately amplify heatwave temperatures in the UK, making them 3-4°C warmer than they would be otherwise. While some compare the heat to the historic 1976 summer, data shows current heatwaves are more geographically widespread and part of a clear warming trend, unlike the isolated 1976 event. Climate projections indicate hot spells will become even more common, particularly in southeastern England.</p>

          <p>A new study from UCLA researchers reveals that the duration of heat waves is increasing at a faster rate than the overall pace of global warming. The findings indicate that even small increments of global temperature rise will have a disproportionately large impact on the length and severity of extreme heat events. This acceleration poses significant risks to public health, agriculture, and infrastructure, particularly by drying out vegetation and increasing wildfire danger. The researchers warn that adaptation strategies must be accelerated, especially as the most extreme heat waves are changing the fastest.</p>

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, alongside French President Emmanuel Macron, announced the plan as a way to break the business model of people smugglers. The deal is part of a broader effort to strengthen cooperation on migration, though critics question its potential scale and deterrent effect.</p>

          <p>In response to growing student fear over recent immigration enforcement actions in the Los Angeles area, Cal State L.A. has authorized professors to offer online classes and excused absences. The university provost acknowledged that many students, particularly on a campus with a large immigrant and commuter population, are scared to use public transit or drive to campus. While there have been no raids at the university itself, the policy aims to support the well-being of students affected by the broader climate of fear. This move highlights the ripple effects of federal immigration policies on local communities and institutions.</p>

          <p>Walmart is recalling approximately 850,000 Ozark Trail stainless steel water bottles after receiving reports of serious injuries, including two cases of permanent vision loss. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the lid on the 64-ounce bottles can eject forcefully upon opening, creating significant impact and laceration hazards. The recalled product was sold exclusively at Walmart stores and online for about $15. Consumers are advised to stop using the bottles immediately and can return them to any Walmart store for a full refund.</p>

          <p>An ICE official testified in federal court that the agency has not determined where it would send Kilmar Abrego Garcia if he were released from pretrial detention. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported earlier this year and brought back to the U.S. to face charges, could be removed to a "third country." The official admitted he had no prior involvement in the case and was unaware of any successful third-country removals by officers in a similar role. The judge expressed frustration over the lack of clarity, seeking to ensure the man is not "spirited away again" without due process.</p>

          <p>Wab Kinew, the premier of the Canadian province of Manitoba, has accused a group of U.S. lawmakers of "trivializing" a deadly wildfire season. The congress members had sent a letter complaining that smoke from the fires was impacting Americans' ability to enjoy summer. Kinew made his remarks as Manitoba declared a new state of emergency, with over 100 active fires forcing thousands to evacuate their homes. He contrasted the lawmakers' complaints with the actions of American firefighters who are on the ground in Canada helping to battle the blazes, calling the political move an attempt to "make hay" out of a tragedy.</p>

          <p>Many of President Trump's supporters are feeling betrayed after the FBI announced it found no "client list" in its review of Jeffrey Epstein's files and would not be releasing more documents. For years, Trump and his allies fueled speculation that they would unmask a cabal of elites upon returning to power, a promise that resonated with the QAnon-adjacent wing of his base. The FBI's conclusion has caused a splintering in MAGA world, with some now directing their anger at administration officials and others creating new conspiracy theories to explain the reversal. The incident highlights the administration's difficult position after inviting such theories into the White House.</p>

          <p>Emergency room visits for tick bites in the U.S. have surged to their highest point in six years, with the Northeast experiencing a particularly sharp increase. According to CDC data, the rise is attributed to record-high tick populations and a longer tick season, which experts link to climate change. Ticks can transmit numerous illnesses, including Lyme disease, and health officials are urging the public to be vigilant. Experts stress the importance of prevention measures like using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing, and performing thorough tick checks after being outdoors.</p>

          <p>Officials in Kerr County, Texas, were scheduled to begin developing a centralized flood monitoring system in mid-July, just days after the region was devastated by deadly floods. The Upper Guadalupe River Authority had approved funding for a new dashboard to consolidate weather data and assist emergency managers, following years of unsuccessful attempts to build such a system. The tool was not designed as a public alert network but as a decision-support resource. The timing highlights the tragic irony that improved monitoring was imminent in a region long known as "flash flood alley."</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential erosion of Japan's long-held identity as a proponent of nuclear disarmament, a stance born from the tragedies of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Amid rapid nuclear buildups by China and North Korea, and the possibility of South Korea developing its own arsenal, the taboo on nuclear weapons in Japan is weakening. Experts warn of a "dangerous proliferation cascade" in the region, suggesting that historical antagonisms could push Japan to arm itself if South Korea does. The analysis points to a fragile global security environment where the risk of nuclear proliferation is becoming increasingly tangible.</p>
