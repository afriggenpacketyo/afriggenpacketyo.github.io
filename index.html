          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plans to restructure government agencies and lay off federal workers, siding with unions and local governments who argued the overhaul lacked congressional authorization. Judge Illston issued a 14-day pause, emphasizing that while the President can seek changes, they must be lawful and involve legislative cooperation, referencing previous presidential requests for such cooperation. The ruling impacts agencies working with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), pausing large-scale reductions in force while a hearing for a longer injunction is scheduled for May 22. The plaintiffs argued the reorganization has caused chaos and disrupted critical services, and the judge agreed they are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, citing exceeded authority and violations of administrative law.</p>

He acknowledged existing inadequacies in work discipline and coordination, urging improvements to meet the public's expectations for fairness and justice.

          <p>Shohei Ohtani propelled the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 14-11 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks with a tie-breaking three-run home run in the ninth inning.

The game was a back-and-forth affair, with multiple lead changes and home runs from both sides, including a grand slam by Arizona's Lourdes Gurriel Jr. Roki Sasaki, aiming for his second MLB win, had a shaky start, giving up five runs before being pulled in the fifth inning, but Ohtani's late heroics sealed the win for the Dodgers.</p>

          <p>Arab countries are focusing on strengthening economic ties with the US, hoping for significant business deals during President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, despite ongoing regional tensions. Saudi Arabia seeks foreign direct investment to meet its Vision 2030 targets, while the UAE plans to invest heavily in the US, particularly in AI and semiconductors. Discussions are expected to sideline the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with emphasis on defense, AI, and advanced weaponry deals. Analysts suggest Trump's "big announcement" could relate to Hamas hostages, a potential US-Iran nuclear deal, or the situation in Yemen, all serving US business interests.</p>

Although he showed no symptoms, the Imperial Household Agency stated that he will require careful follow-up care. The 91-year-old was admitted after an earlier checkup revealed signs of the heart condition, and he previously received treatment for heart failure in 2022. Akihito abdicated the Chrysanthemum Throne in April 2019, marking the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in approximately 200 years.</p>

          <p>A robotic Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched towards Venus in March 1972 but stranded in Earth orbit due to a rocket malfunction, is predicted to re-enter Earth's atmosphere. Experts estimate the re-entry will occur on Friday or Saturday, but the exact location remains unknown due to the spacecraft's high speed. While the spacecraft, weighing roughly 1,050 pounds and designed with a heat shield for Venusian atmosphere, may partially survive re-entry, the risk of injuries on the ground is considered low. If any pieces are recovered, they legally belong to Russia, as it is considered the registered owner.</p>

A lower court had previously ordered the statue's transfer to Buseoksa Temple, straining Japan-South Korea relations, but the ruling was overturned by a higher court and upheld by South Korea's Supreme Court.

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is set to unveil new plans aimed at reducing UK net migration, which stood at 728,000 last year, through an immigration white paper. The proposed measures include requiring employers to invest in UK skills before hiring overseas workers, visa restrictions for nationalities with high overstay rates, and potentially extending the period migrants must wait before applying for permanent residency. Tougher English language requirements for immigrants are also being considered, along with a review of how the "right to a family life" under the European Convention on Human Rights is applied in immigration cases.</p>

          <p>Newly released records from a corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams detail key moments in the investigation, which was ultimately dropped by the Trump administration. The documents reveal federal agents considered seizing the mayor's electronic devices at the New York City Marathon and that Adams was investigated for witness tampering. Prosecutors secured a five-count corruption indictment against Adams, but the Justice Department directed the case's dismissal, leading to resignations. Critics have suggested a quid pro quo between Adams and the Trump administration, trading the case's dismissal for help cracking down on illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>UK Ambassador to the US, Lord Mandelson, hailed the recent UK-US trade deal as a "platform for going further and opening up more trade opportunities" in his first interview since taking the role. The deal reduces or removes tariffs that were imposed by President Trump on some of his nation's imports from the UK, including cars, steel, and aluminum. The ambassador clarified that abolishing the UK's Digital Services Tax was not part of the trade deal but could be discussed in future negotiations. Mandelson also noted the positive relationship between Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump, emphasizing their shared commitment to defending their national interests.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered the Department of Homeland Security to increase the deportation force by 20,000 officers, potentially leading to a significant expansion of immigration enforcement. The administration intends to deputize state and local law enforcement officers, former federal officers, and other individuals for this effort. The plan also includes "Project Homecoming," offering migrants financial assistance to leave the country voluntarily or face consequences such as fines, wage garnishment, and property confiscation.

Graham's phone was used to film the felling, and his vehicle was tracked to the scene, while Carruthers' phone was traced to Northumberland the day the tree was felled. Both men blamed each other, leading to a complete breakdown of their relationship and their conviction for destroying a globally-beloved landmark.</p>

The end of the carve-out is significant, but some fear the administration is taking steps that will weaken its implementation.

The tariffs strike at the heart of China’s growth engine, but it has worsened frictions with China’s trading partners. While China has expanded its dominance in several key sectors, the focus on critical technologies and economic self-reliance comes at a cost to many Chinese households.</p>
