          <p>California Democratic gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter drew significant conservative backlash after a contentious interview with CBS journalist Julie Watts went viral. Porter became frustrated with follow-up questions about appealing to Trump voters, attempting to prematurely end the discussion. Critics, including political consultants and rival candidates, widely condemned her reaction, questioning her professionalism and leadership capabilities. This incident highlights the intense scrutiny faced by candidates in crowded races and the polarized political landscape, where media interactions can quickly shape public perception and campaign narratives.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old man, Jonathan Rinderknecht, has been arrested in Florida on suspicion of starting the Pacific Palisades fire in Los Angeles, which tragically killed 12 people and destroyed over 6,000 homes in January. Justice department officials revealed evidence from his digital devices, including a ChatGPT-generated image of a burning city. The fire, sparked near a hiking trail on New Year's Day, smoldered for days before spreading. Rinderknecht, a former Pacific Palisades resident, is charged with destruction of property by fire, with the arrest offering some measure of justice to the impacted community, including celebrity homeowners.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Priscilla has rapidly weakened to just above Category 1 strength, now positioned off Mexico's Pacific coast. The National Hurricane Center reported maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, anticipating further weakening over the next 48 hours as it moves northwest. A tropical storm watch is in effect for parts of Baja California Sur, from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro. The storm generates significant swells, impacting the coasts of southwestern and west-central Mexico, alongside southern Baja California, which are expected to create life-threatening surf, rip current conditions, and coastal flooding, prompting advisories for residents and visitors in these regions.</p>

          <p>Gerry and Kate McCann, parents of missing Madeleine McCann, emotionally testified in Leicester Crown Court against Julia Wandelt, 24, and Karen Spragg, 61, who are charged with stalking. Wandelt had falsely claimed to be their daughter, contacting their other child and turning up at their home with Spragg. The McCanns described the "distressing" impact of these claims, which pulled on their heartstrings while also damaging the ongoing search for Madeleine, who disappeared in 2007. They expressed feeling frightened and invaded in their own home by the defendants' actions.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed surprise at AMD's deal to offer OpenAI 10% equity in exchange for a multi-billion dollar chip purchase agreement. Huang described the deal as "imaginative, unique and surprising," especially given AMD's prior excitement about its next-generation products. This partnership, involving OpenAI committing to purchase 6 gigawatts of AMD chips, challenges Nvidia's dominant position in the AI chip market. Nvidia itself recently announced plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI, highlighting the intense competition and strategic investments shaping the future of artificial intelligence infrastructure.

          <p>Consumers are advised to shop early for holiday decorations, including artificial Christmas trees, due to warnings of limited inventory and higher prices. National Tree Company, a major importer, anticipates a 25% reduction in products and a 10% price increase, attributing these issues to trade war tariffs. The CEO, Chris Butler, has engaged with the Treasury Department and U.S. Trade Office to address the situation, aiming to "save Christmas" for American consumers. This scarcity, coupled with concerns about weaker consumer demand and significant drops in import volumes, suggests a challenging retail season for holiday goods.</p>

          <p>European football's governing body, UEFA, is aiming to generate over £4 billion annually from its next broadcast rights deals, exploring partnerships with streaming services like Amazon, Disney, or Netflix. The new six-year agreements, starting in 2027, are expected to significantly increase revenue from the current £2.9 billion per year. This strategic shift could see one first-pick game per round offered to a streaming platform, expanding accessibility and engaging new audiences. UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin emphasized building a unique, innovative, and accessible football experience to expand core revenue streams and maintain European football's top position.</p>

          <p>Sno Pac Foods has issued a nationwide recall for two types of organic frozen spinach due to potential Listeria monocytogenes contamination. The affected products, Del Mar 35-pound Bulk Organic Frozen Spinach and Sno Pac 10-ounce Organic Frozen Cut Spinach, were distributed in retail stores and through distributors. While no illnesses have been reported, Listeria can cause serious, even fatal, infections in vulnerable populations and may lead to miscarriages. Production has been suspended as the company investigates the source, and consumers are advised to dispose of or return the recalled items for a refund.</p>

          <p>David Norris, 49, convicted in the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993, has been deemed unsafe for release by a prison psychologist at his parole hearing. Norris, who publicly admitted his involvement for the first time, described punching Stephen but denied stabbing him, refusing to name other killers due to perceived family risk. The psychologist, who spent nine hours interviewing Norris, called him an "unreliable narrator" due to inconsistent confession details and a lack of racial awareness, recommending a transfer to a lower-security closed prison for further assessment rather than release or an open prison move.</p>

          <p>California's proposed Proposition 50, which would allow state lawmakers to redraw congressional districts mid-decade, is a central and contentious issue in the 2026 gubernatorial race. Backed by Governor Gavin Newsom, the plan aims to create more Democratic-leaning districts, countering perceived Republican gerrymandering in states like Texas. Candidates, including Democrats and Republicans, expressed sharply divided views, with some Democrats acknowledging unease about partisan manipulation despite supporting the goal. Opponents argue it's unconstitutional and a "power grab" that undermines voter representation and the independent redistricting commission, emphasizing the need for fair and transparent electoral processes.</p>

          <p>England's so-called 'Golden Generation' of footballers, featuring stars like Beckham, Lampard, and Gerrard, reflects on why they failed to achieve major tournament success despite immense talent. Former captain Steven Gerrard described them as "egotistical losers" hindered by club rivalries and a lack of team connection. The article explores various factors cited by players and pundits, including tactical shortcomings under managers like Sven-Goran Eriksson, who struggled to integrate top midfielders. Additionally, issues such as injury problems, psychological pressure from penalty shootouts, and team camp boredom contributed to their underperformance, with many acknowledging that other nations simply had stronger squads.</p>

          <p>The federal government shutdown has entered its second week with no clear resolution, as the House remains closed and the Senate repeatedly fails to pass a funding bill.

Despite public deadlock, some quiet discussions are emerging among senators, and President Trump has signaled openness to negotiations on health care, though his stance has shifted. The shutdown threatens missed paychecks for federal workers and highlights deep political divisions ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

While Macron's foreign policy powers are unaffected, his domestic influence is severely weakened, impacting joint Franco-German projects like the fighter jet program.

The watchdog, targeting EU-wide parent company Whaleco Technology Limited, fears such practices could severely threaten competition and lead to price increases across other sales channels.

Dutch authorities enlisted the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to examine the projectiles. The OPCW confirmed they were consistent with pre-1925 French and German manufactured chemical weapons, though the specific chemical fill could not be identified. The mystery behind their presence remains unsolved. The grenades will be safely destroyed in a specialized facility in Belgium, as the Netherlands lacks the necessary infrastructure for such disposal.</p>
