        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New York judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively. The suit stemmed from Lively's claims of sexual harassment on the set of "It Ends With Us" and accusations that Baldoni initiated a smear campaign against her. The judge ruled that Baldoni failed to adequately prove Lively's threats constituted wrongful extortion and that he did not demonstrate defamation, as Lively's statements were privileged under the lawsuit. The judge also found no evidence that The New York Times acted with malice in publishing the story, but Baldoni can amend and refile allegations related to contract interference by June 23. The author's tone is neutral and informative, focusing on the legal aspects of the case.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he would support the arrest of California Governor Gavin Newsom for allegedly obstructing federal immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. This comment followed Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta's lawsuit against Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the deployment of National Guard troops to address protests. The lawsuit challenges the legality of Trump's federalization of the California National Guard, which Newsom characterized as an illegal act of escalating tensions. Federal prosecutors also charged labor leader David Huerta with felony conspiracy to impede an officer during protests in L.A.

          <p>An inquest into the death of Rhianan Rudd, a 16-year-old girl groomed and charged with terrorism offenses, concluded that authorities missed opportunities to help her. The coroner cited a "systems failure" by counter-terror police and Derbyshire County Council for not referring Rudd earlier as a potential victim of modern slavery. Rudd, the youngest girl charged with terrorism offenses in the UK, took her own life at a children's home in May 2022 after charges were dropped due to her exploitation. The inquest highlighted failures in providing mental health support and safeguarding her, though no single organization was blamed for her death.
