          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings and revenue, with overall company revenue rising 56%, primarily driven by its data center business, which supports artificial intelligence infrastructure. Despite this, the stock saw a slight decline in extended trading as data center revenue fell just short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive quarter. The company projects strong sales growth for the current quarter, anticipating $54 billion, signaling ongoing robust demand for AI technologies. Nvidia's board also approved an additional $60 billion in share repurchases, reflecting confidence in its financial outlook and future growth, despite some challenges with H20 chip shipments to China.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Edmunds analysis reveals five significant financial missteps consumers often make when buying a car, particularly as high interest rates and rising vehicle prices push monthly payments to record levels. The article advises against purchasing beyond one's budget, securing loans directly through dealerships without prior approval, and trading in vehicles with negative equity, which can perpetuate debt. It also recommends engaging with internet sales teams for competitive pricing and exploring certified pre-owned options to avoid substantial new car depreciation. Adhering to these guidelines can prevent financial strain and promote smarter car-buying decisions in a challenging market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A devastating shooting at Annunciation Catholic School in Minneapolis during a Mass led to the deaths of an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, and left 17 others injured, including 14 children and three elderly parishioners. The perpetrator, 23-year-old Robin Westman, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after using legally purchased firearms to shoot through church windows. Authorities are investigating the incident as an act of domestic terrorism and a hate crime, reviewing a disturbing manifesto video Westman reportedly scheduled to post.

          <p>Country music star Carly Pearce shared her candid reflections on her short-lived marriage to Michael Ray, confessing she instantly regretted the union on her wedding night. She characterized the relationship as a "hot and heavy lust" rather than true love, attributing the rapid dissolution to a lack of genuine understanding and real conversations amidst their busy music careers. Pearce, who filed for divorce after eight months, found the privacy afforded by the COVID-19 pandemic instrumental in processing her embarrassment and heartbreak. She now expresses gratitude for the experience, which she says taught her about her own strength and self-worth, leading to a happier period in her life.</p>

          <h2>Remnants of Tropical Storm Juliette Forecast to Bring Rain and Thunderstorms to Southern California</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 16:46:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southern California is preparing for potential rainfall, thunderstorms, and hazardous surf conditions this week, stemming from the weakening Tropical Storm Juliette moving northward off the Mexican coast. Although Juliette is forecast to dissipate by Thursday, its residual moisture is expected to bring scattered showers across parts of southwestern California, particularly from San Diego to the Coachella Valley, with some areas receiving up to a quarter-inch of rain.

          <p>American universities are witnessing a substantial decrease in international student enrollment this fall, with an estimated 150,000 fewer new students nationwide, impacting institutions like the University at Buffalo. This downturn is primarily linked to the Trump administration's more stringent and delayed student visa interview process, which has prompted many accepted students to defer or seek education in other countries like the U.K. Experts warn that this could result in a $7 billion economic loss and over 60,000 job losses, potentially hindering U.S. innovation and campus diversity. Despite President Trump's recent comments supporting international students, the current policies are causing significant uncertainty and shifting global academic flows.</p>

          <p>A recent discussion on Reddit reflects widespread concern that artificial intelligence (AI) could lead to irreversible job displacement, a stark contrast to the recovery seen after the 2008 financial crisis. Many workers, especially in white-collar and creative sectors, report being laid off due to AI integration, questioning if these jobs will ever return. While some sources suggest offshoring still plays a more significant role in job losses, the article emphasizes that AI's impact is unique because it isn't generating new employment opportunities at a comparable rate. This situation sparks skepticism about government preparedness and the feasibility of solutions like universal basic income, indicating a perceived lack of long-term economic strategy.

          <p>As a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September appears highly probable, this article outlines crucial steps for savers to optimize their certificate of deposit (CD) earnings. Key recommendations include actively searching online for the highest available rates, as digital banks typically offer superior returns compared to traditional branches due to reduced operating costs. Furthermore, it is essential to precisely calculate the amount one can commit to a CD to avoid early withdrawal penalties and to consider longer-term CDs for extended interest-earning potential.

The analysis shows a $40,000 CD could yield approximately $423 for a three-month term or over $9,000 for a five-year term, depending on the chosen rate.

          <p>This article delves into the complex debate within liberal circles regarding the defense of the Federal Reserve's independence, particularly in light of President Trump's efforts to oust Governor Lisa Cook. Many liberals perceive Trump's actions as a direct attack on democratic institutions, aiming to politicize federal agencies. Conversely, some progressives argue that the Fed's independence is itself anti-democratic, as its influential monetary policy decisions lack direct public oversight. The article posits that an operationally independent Fed, insulated by long terms for its governors, can more effectively pursue long-term economic stability, free from short-term political pressures. Trump's attempt to remove Cook on a pretext is ultimately characterized as an anti-democratic subversion of established laws and norms.</p>

The 22-year-old right-hander has rapidly distinguished himself in the minor leagues, leading in both strikeouts and earned-run average, earning this call-up during the Mets' crucial playoff push. Tong's exceptional performance, including 11.2 scoreless innings in Triple-A, convinced the front office to accelerate his promotion. This strategic move provides the Mets' starting rotation with an additional day of rest during an intense 16-game stretch, demonstrating the team's belief in the young pitcher's ability to contribute immediately.</p>

          <p>A recent Lending Tree study indicates that a substantial 5.7 million full-time workers in the U.S. earned $100,000 or more in 2023 without holding a bachelor's degree, debunking the myth that a four-year degree is a prerequisite for high-paying careers. The report identifies numerous occupations, such as software developers, sales engineers, and specialized trades like elevator installers, where over 40% of non-degree holders achieve six-figure incomes. This finding is particularly relevant as the cost and value of higher education are increasingly scrutinized. The article notes a growing corporate trend of de-emphasizing college degrees, opening new opportunities and pathways to financial stability for a broader segment of the workforce.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the disturbing Hollywood murder-for-hire plot involving millionaire Dino Guglielmelli, who sought to have his ex-wife, Monica Olsen, killed amidst their contentious divorce. Driven by anger over alimony and child custody, Dino repeatedly pressured his associate, Rick Fuhrmann, to eliminate Monica, even suggesting horrific methods. Unbeknownst to Dino, Fuhrmann was cooperating with authorities and secretly recorded Dino explicitly detailing his desire for Monica's death and willingness to pay $80,000. These recordings led to Dino's arrest and a guilty plea for attempted murder, resulting in a nine-year prison sentence, from which he was paroled. The case highlights the extreme lengths to which personal conflicts can escalate.</p>

Despite an appeal from Governor Ron DeSantis's administration, an executive director confirmed the facility's impending shutdown. The camp had drawn widespread criticism for its harsh conditions, allegations of detainee abuse, and denial of legal access, prompting multiple lawsuits. The judge's ruling marked a significant victory for environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, who argued the facility caused irreversible damage to the ecologically sensitive wetlands, and for civil rights advocates concerned about human rights violations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly accused Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of mortgage fraud, alleging she falsely claimed multiple primary residences on loan applications to secure better rates. Legal experts, however, contend that proving "owner-occupancy mortgage fraud" is challenging, as it requires demonstrating a specific intent to deceive rather than an unintentional error. Mortgages for primary residences typically offer lower interest rates and more favorable tax benefits, incentivizing such misrepresentations. Cook's attorney has announced plans to sue Trump, arguing the president lacks the legal authority for her removal. This article underscores the difficulty in substantiating these types of fraud allegations in a court of law, differentiating legal standards from public accusations. (not investment advice)</p>

The author asserts that Trump's stated "crime fighting" rationale is a deceptive pretext, primarily serving to intimidate political adversaries and galvanize his supporters, despite low crime rates in the capital. The piece draws parallels to the FBI's raid on John Bolton's residence, viewing both as unsettling demonstrations of governmental force.
