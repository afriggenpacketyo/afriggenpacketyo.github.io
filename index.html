          <p>Beginning in early 2026, the United Kingdom's driving theory test for cars and motorcycles will include questions on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the use of defibrillators. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) initiated this change, hoping to equip the 2.4 million people who take the test annually with critical life-saving knowledge. Since drivers are often the first to arrive at accident scenes, this measure aims to improve emergency response and prevent avoidable deaths. The official learning materials have already been updated to reflect this new focus on basic first aid skills, which can significantly increase survival rates from cardiac arrest.</p>

          <p>Brooklyn Peltz Beckham and Nicola Peltz Beckham recently renewed their wedding vows, but Brooklyn's parents, David and Victoria Beckham, were notably absent from the ceremony. Nicola paid tribute to her mother by wearing an updated version of her original 1985 wedding gown. The absence of the Beckhams, who appeared to be vacationing in France, has fueled ongoing speculation about tensions within the family. This follows previous rumors of a feud, including discussions around Nicola's choice of wedding dress for their original 2022 ceremony. Representatives for the Beckhams have not commented on their absence from the recent event.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has formally acknowledged that France employed "repressive violence" in Cameroon during the 1950s as the nation fought for its independence. In a public letter, Macron admitted France's responsibility for the deaths of several Cameroonian independence leaders and the loss of tens of thousands of lives. This admission follows a 2022 historical report commissioned by France, which detailed mass forced displacements and the use of brutal militias by French colonial authorities. The acknowledgment is part of a broader, though sometimes criticized, effort by Macron's government to confront France's complex and violent colonial history in Africa.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police have arrested four teenagers suspected of ransacking actor Brad Pitt's home and targeting other high-profile individuals, including actors and professional athletes. The suspects, alleged street gang members aged 16 to 18, were apprehended after an investigation that began following the late June burglary at Pitt's Los Feliz residence. Authorities noted that criminals are increasingly using sophisticated methods like hidden cameras and Wi-Fi jammers to monitor potential victims. The police chief warned that public figures and anyone posting travel information on social media can inadvertently make themselves targets for such crimes.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that any negotiations about the war in Ukraine conducted without the country's participation "will not work." His comments come ahead of a scheduled summit between U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. Zelenskyy mentioned receiving signals via a U.S. envoy that Russia may be ready for a ceasefire, but he remains firm that Ukraine will not withdraw its forces from the occupied Donbas region. He emphasized the importance of European involvement in any peace process, arguing that a bilateral meeting between Trump and Putin would primarily benefit the Russian leader.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the European Union have publicly appealed to President Trump to defend Europe's security interests during his upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The leaders emphasized that a just peace must respect international law and Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Their appeal highlights European anxieties over being sidelined in critical geopolitical negotiations, especially given the fear that a Russian victory in Ukraine could embolden further aggression on the continent.</p>

          <p>Health experts are warning of an increased risk from Vibrio vulnificus, a so-called "flesh-eating" bacteria, as rising ocean temperatures allow it to thrive in new regions. The bacteria, which enters the body through open wounds and can be fatal in one in five cases, is typically found in warm coastal waters like the Gulf of Mexico. However, cases are now being reported further north in the Carolinas, Connecticut, and New York. Microbiologists attribute this spread to climate change, which warms waters and creates more favorable conditions for the bacteria, especially during hurricane season when storm surges increase exposure risks.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has struck an unusual deal allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell certain AI chips to China in exchange for the U.S. government receiving a 15% share of the revenue. This unprecedented agreement has sparked concerns from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers over its legality and potential national security risks. Critics argue that treating semiconductor exports as both a security threat and a revenue source sends a conflicting message. Questions also remain about the mechanics of the deal, as the U.S. Constitution bars taxes on exports, though experts suggest workarounds may be possible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a market rally that saw the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reach record highs, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to remain in the market despite geopolitical and domestic political concerns. He argued that investors who try to time the market by selling during periods of uncertainty often miss out on significant gains, like those seen on Tuesday. Cramer suggested that many of the issues causing pessimism are often resolved after stocks have already recovered. He believes that strong corporate profits and the ability of major companies to adapt to challenges are more important indicators for long-term investing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In its annual Human Rights Practices report, the U.S. State Department has accused the United Kingdom of having "significant human rights issues," specifically citing restrictions on free speech. The report, which states that human rights in the UK "worsened" in 2024, points to concerns over limits on political speech deemed hateful or offensive, as well as public space protection orders and safe access zones around abortion clinics. This assessment echoes previous criticisms from U.S. Vice President JD Vance. A UK government spokesperson responded by defending the country's record, stating it proudly upholds freedoms while ensuring citizen safety.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County prosecutors have filed two new corruption charges against City Councilman Curren Price, adding to an existing case involving allegations of embezzlement, perjury, and conflict of interest. The new charges allege that Price improperly voted on city grants and funding for agencies that were paying his wife's consulting firm hundreds of thousands of dollars. Price was initially charged in 2023 for allegedly voting on projects that created a financial benefit for his wife and failing to disclose her income. His attorney has dismissed the new charges as an attempt to bolster a weak case.</p>

The demonstration, organized by labor groups like the SEIU, called for an end to the raids and the release of detained immigrants. The park has become a symbolic site after federal agents conducted a major operation there in July. Protesters also urged a boycott of major companies they claim are not doing enough to protect their immigrant employees.

The review will examine content at museums including the National Museum of American History and the National Museum of African American History and Culture. The Smithsonian responded that its work is grounded in scholarly excellence and the accurate presentation of history, raising concerns about political interference in curatorial independence.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are set to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. The location is historically significant, as the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867. The summit was announced after Trump's deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire passed, and it follows several unsuccessful rounds of peace talks. The White House has framed the meeting as a "listening exercise," while Ukraine's President Zelenskyy, who is not attending, has insisted that no decisions can be made about Ukraine without its involvement.</p>

          <p>A federal trial has begun in California to address a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard for civilian law enforcement, specifically in Los Angeles. The state of California argues that this use of troops is illegal and sets a dangerous precedent for policing American streets. The case tests the limits of presidential authority and the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally bars the military from domestic law enforcement. The trial's outcome could have significant implications for the administration's broader strategy of using federal forces to respond to domestic issues in U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>A paper by Chinese military scientists reveals they are closely studying the electronic warfare tactics used in the Ukraine conflict to draw lessons for their own capabilities. The research focused on a major electronic warfare event where Russia jammed all satellite navigation systems in the war zone, including GPS, Galileo, and China's own Beidou system. Western powers responded with a counter-jamming mission. This analysis provides Chinese observers with a valuable opportunity to understand modern electronic combat between major military powers and assess the vulnerabilities and resilience of critical satellite-based technologies.</p>

          <p>An analytical article from The Atlantic explores how President Trump's political tactics consistently force his opponents into choosing between difficult and potentially damaging options. For example, Democrats who championed fair redistricting are now considering their own gerrymandering to counter Republican efforts, compromising their principles to fight for political survival. This dynamic extends to government officials, prosecutors, and judges, who have had to weigh established norms against the perceived need for extraordinary measures to resist Trump's actions. The article argues this ability to create lose-lose scenarios for his adversaries is a key part of his political power and threat.</p>
