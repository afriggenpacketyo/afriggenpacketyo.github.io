          <p>Nearly 100 former employees and prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Washington, D.C., have signed a memo opposing President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin to lead the office. The memo calls for the rejection of Martin's nomination, citing his lack of prosecutorial experience, involvement in the "Stop the Steal" movement, and defense work on January 6 Capitol riot cases. Senate Democrats have also voiced concerns, with Senator Adam Schiff placing a hold on Martin's nomination.</p>
