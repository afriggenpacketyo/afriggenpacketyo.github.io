        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France's government has been toppled after Prime Minister François Bayrou lost a parliamentary confidence vote he had called himself, marking a significant political crisis for President Emmanuel Macron. Bayrou's gamble to secure support for deep public spending cuts backfired, as opposition lawmakers united against his unpopular budget plans. This forces Macron to find a fourth prime minister in just twelve months, deepening the legislative deadlock that has plagued his administration since his centrist alliance lost its majority in the 2024 snap election, and casting doubt on France's ability to tackle its pressing economic challenges.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has continued his verbal attacks on Chicago, stating his administration would "love to go in and straighten it out." His comments follow a controversial social media post that referenced a "Department of WAR" and an image with the caption "I love the smell of deportations in the morning." Despite downplaying the post as not being a literal threat of war, his rhetoric has been condemned by Illinois leaders, who have refused to request federal assistance for what Trump claims is a crime problem, escalating tensions between federal and state authorities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a routine victory against Andorra, this article reflects on the predictable and often dull nature of England's World Cup qualifying campaigns. Despite an impressive record of only four losses in 30 years during qualifiers, these matches rarely generate significant excitement for fans or players. The analysis suggests that the prevalence of defensive tactics from smaller nations and a more possession-based style of play contribute to the lack of jeopardy, making the qualifiers feel like a formality before the real challenges of major tournaments.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 14:09:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld the $83.3 million judgment against Donald Trump for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The court rejected Trump's arguments that the damages were excessive and that he was protected by presidential immunity, stating he failed to provide grounds for reconsidering the immunity claim. This ruling pertains to defamatory statements Trump made while denying Carroll's accusation that he sexually assaulted her in the 1990s, with the court affirming the jury's award as fair and reasonable given the circumstances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to resume widespread immigration enforcement stops in the Los Angeles area, temporarily lifting a lower court's order. The previous injunction had barred federal agents from detaining individuals based solely on factors like race, language, or occupation without reasonable suspicion. The Justice Department argued the restrictions hindered law enforcement, while dissenting justices warned the decision allows the government to "seize anyone who looks Latino," setting the stage for further legal battles over the administration's mass deportation campaign.</p>

This assessment follows a weak August jobs report, which showed the creation of only 22,000 jobs, far below expectations. Hatzius anticipates that the Federal Reserve will need to implement several interest rate cuts this year to reignite economic momentum, predicting three cuts before the end of the year and further reductions in 2026 to navigate through the current period of weakness.

Key recommendations include improving one's credit score, as higher scores qualify for lower rates, and increasing the down payment to at least 20% to reduce lender risk and avoid private mortgage insurance. Additionally, prospective buyers are encouraged to consider alternatives to a 30-year fixed loan, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which can offer a significantly lower initial interest rate.

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett defended the 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. She argued that the ruling did not outlaw abortion but returned the contentious issue to the democratic process for states to decide. Barrett also spoke about the increasing threats faced by the judiciary, revealing that she owns a bulletproof vest and has received death threats, stating that such risks should not be the price of public service but require a "stiff spine."</p>

This data reflects a cooling labor market where hiring has slowed dramatically, causing workers to stay in their current positions and ending the high mobility trend seen during the "Great Resignation."

Tierney explained that the study actually provides more evidence that the current rate of warming is unprecedentedly rapid and dangerous, and she has challenged Rogan to invite her on his show to discuss it properly.</p>
