        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Governor of the Bank of England has indicated a readiness to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK's job market shows signs of a significant slowdown. While stating that the path for rates is "downward," the approach will remain "gradual and careful" as inflation is still above target. This potential policy shift comes as recent data shows a drop in job vacancies to its lowest level since 2021 and a contraction in the UK economy, prompting concerns about a possible recession.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's economy successfully avoided a technical recession by posting 1.4% growth in the second quarter of 2025, reversing a 0.5% contraction from the previous quarter. This growth, which surpassed analysts' expectations, was primarily driven by strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry warned of significant uncertainty and downside risks for the second half of the year, citing a lack of clarity over U.S. tariff policies and their potential impact on the global economy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, exceeding forecasts and indicating a boost from a temporary tariff truce with the United States. This growth was supported by robust shipments to non-U.S. markets, particularly a 16.8% surge in exports to Southeast Asian nations, suggesting some trade diversion. The data also showed a notable 60% increase in rare earth shipments and strong performance in steel and automotive exports, though analysts remain cautious about the sustainability of this momentum given ongoing global trade uncertainties.

          <p>A major price war has erupted among China's top e-commerce and delivery platforms, including Alibaba, Meituan, and JD.com, as they compete for market share. Companies are rolling out aggressive promotions, such as 0-yuan milk tea and deep discounts on popular items like crayfish, to lure in consumers. This intense competition led to massive order volumes, with Alibaba's platforms handling 80 million orders in a single day and JD.com reporting a new high of 150 million instant retail orders on a Saturday, highlighting the scale of the battle for consumer loyalty.</p>

This legislative push, supported by the pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration, has boosted investor confidence in the long-term stability and growth of the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>London is facing concerns about its global appeal as it contends with an exodus of millionaires due to new tax policies, businesses moving listings abroad, and workers leaving over high living costs. Some analysts argue the city's business 'buzz' has faded due to over-regulation and political instability, diminishing its status as a financial hub. However, others remain optimistic, pointing to London's strong fundamentals like the rule of law, cultural diversity, and a growing services export sector, suggesting the city is evolving rather than declining.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump attended the FIFA Club World Cup final in New Jersey, where Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain, on the one-year anniversary of a failed assassination attempt against him. In a statement, Trump said he believes God saved him that day for the purpose of restoring the nation. The sporting event also provided a venue for diplomatic discussions, as a U.S. envoy expressed hopefulness regarding Gaza ceasefire negotiations and confirmed plans to meet with Qatari officials who were also in attendance at the match.</p>

          <p>An undercover investigation by BBC Panorama has exposed dubious sales tactics at two prominent UK estate agencies, Connells and Purplebricks. The report found evidence of a Connells agent sidelining a cash buyer in favor of one using in-house mortgage services, a practice known as conditional selling, to generate more profit for the company. At Purplebricks, a whistleblower revealed that staff were incentivized to secure price reductions on properties that were allegedly overvalued to win instructions, raising questions about fairness and transparency in the industry.</p>

          <p>A woman has been found to have unlawfully brought a baby into the UK from Nigeria after fabricating a pregnancy and birth story. After her arrest at Gatwick Airport, DNA tests proved she and her husband were not the baby's biological parents, despite her providing forged hospital documents. A Family Court investigation uncovered evidence of a deal to purchase the baby and linked the case to the worrying trend of 'baby factories' in West Africa. The court has since ordered that the child, who was caused significant harm, be placed for adoption.</p>
