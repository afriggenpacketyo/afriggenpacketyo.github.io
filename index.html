          <p>Jerry Adler, a distinguished actor and veteran of Broadway's behind-the-scenes, has died at 96. Hailing from a family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, Adler spent decades as a stage manager, producer, and director for 53 Broadway productions, including the original "My Fair Lady." He transitioned to acting in his 60s, gaining widespread recognition for roles such as Hesh Rabkin in "The Sopranos" and Howard Lyman in "The Good Wife." Adler embraced his late-career success, publishing a memoir and stating, "I think retirement is a road to nowhere," until his peaceful passing.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has postponed its tenth Super Heavy-Starship test flight from the Texas Gulf Coast, citing an issue with ground systems during the fueling process. This highly anticipated flight aimed to test significant upgrades and push the vehicle's capabilities following a series of recent failures. The mission plan involved a controlled splashdown for the Super Heavy booster in the Gulf and a suborbital flight for the Starship upper stage, deploying Starlink simulator satellites and attempting an in-space engine restart before a splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This delay adds to concerns about the feasibility of NASA's 2027 target for Artemis lunar landings, which depend on multiple successful Starship flights for in-orbit refueling.</p>

          <p>A Change.org petition advocating for leniency for Harjinder Singh, an illegal immigrant truck driver charged in a fatal Florida crash that killed three people, has accumulated nearly 2.5 million signatures. The petition, addressed to Governor Ron DeSantis and the Florida Board of Executive Clemency, asserts that the August 12 incident was a tragic accident, not a deliberate act, and calls for a proportionate sentence, parole eligibility, or consideration of alternatives to incarceration. Singh, who entered the U.S. illegally in 2018 and obtained a California commercial driver's license, was denied bond by a Florida judge who cited his unauthorized status and flight risk. The incident has also led to the U.S. halting work visas for foreign commercial truck drivers.</p>

          <p>China's Generation Z is fueling a booming fashion craze centered on ball-jointed dolls, which is creating a notable impact on the country's economy. Young collectors, exemplified by 21-year-old Clementine Cai, are investing significant sums, often upwards of 3,000 yuan for outfits alone, far exceeding their personal clothing expenditures. Data from leading e-commerce platforms, Taobao and Tmall, indicates that sales of doll clothing soared by over 117% year-on-year in 2024, reaching a record 10 million yuan in May. This phenomenon underscores a distinct consumer trend among Chinese youth and its growing influence on market dynamics.</p>

Amidst these tensions, U.S. Vice President JD Vance indicated that Russia has shown "significant concessions" to President Trump, suggesting a potential for diplomatic resolution to the conflict. Despite these remarks, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov clarified that a meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin is not imminent. Meanwhile, Ukraine received substantial international backing, with Canada committing CA$2 billion in new military aid and Norway pledging approximately $695 million for air defense systems, while Pope Leo XIV prayed for peace.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has revealed new allegations that three indicted Smartmatic executives funneled funds from a 2018 Los Angeles County voting machine contract into slush funds, previously utilized for bribing election officials in Venezuela and the Philippines. While prosecutors have not yet confirmed if LA County money was directly used for bribes, they seek to establish a pattern of illicit activity. Concurrently, Fox News, currently facing a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, is leveraging these indictments in its defense, also alleging that LA County Registrar Dean Logan received undeclared gifts from the company. Smartmatic, however, asserts that the allegations are "filled with misrepresentations" and that it operates ethically, with the county also affirming the contract's fixed pricing structure.</p>

In his closely watched Jackson Hole speech, Powell acknowledged concerns about tariffs and inflation but emphasized the dramatic deceleration in hiring, indicating that job market worries now outweigh other factors in the Fed's calculus for rate cuts. This shift has generated significant market optimism, with Japan's Nikkei 225 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng futures pointing towards a stronger start. Investors are now keenly awaiting artificial intelligence giant Nvidia's earnings report, which is anticipated to further shape market direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump responded to Maryland Governor Wes Moore's invitation to Baltimore by demanding the city "clean up this crime mess" before he would visit, and threatened to reconsider federal funding for the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge. Moore had invited Trump after the president's "insults from the Oval Office" regarding Baltimore's crime rate and his deployment of National Guard to Washington D.C. Trump, on Truth Social, doubled down on his claims of an "out of control, crime ridden" Baltimore, despite Moore's reports of significant crime reductions in Maryland.

          <p>Following a directive from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, some National Guard members deployed in Washington D.C., estimated at fewer than 50, began carrying service weapons on Sunday night. This decision represents an escalation in President Trump's federal intervention into the city's policing, where approximately 2,000 Guard members are currently stationed, including hundreds from Republican-led states. While previously unarmed and primarily assigned to protect landmarks and manage crowds, the new order permits the use of force as a last resort against imminent threats of death or serious bodily harm. Local officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, maintain that the initiative is unwarranted, pointing to declining violent crime rates in the city, which contradict the president's assertions of an "epidemic of crime."</p>

          <p>Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency in response to the state's infant mortality rate climbing to its highest point in over a decade, registering 9.7 deaths per 1,000 live births, almost double the national average of 5.6. The data also reveals significant racial disparities, with Black infants more than twice as likely as White infants to die before their first birthday, a gap that has recently widened. The emergency declaration aims to expedite efforts to address care gaps by expanding prenatal services, establishing a regional obstetric care system, and bolstering home visiting and community health worker programs. Experts emphasize that structural inequities, including poverty and healthcare access, are fundamental causes, urging a broader approach beyond individual or clinical interventions.</p>

          <p>Chinese property giant Evergrande is scheduled for delisting from the Hong Kong stock market on Monday, signaling a grim final chapter for the once-$50 billion company that became the world's most indebted developer. Its spectacular collapse, largely precipitated by Beijing's 2020 regulations on developer borrowing, has profoundly impacted China's economy, contributing to massive layoffs, suppressed consumer spending, and a decline in household property values. Founder Hui Ka Yan was fined $6.5 million and banned from China's capital market for life due to overstated revenue. Experts contend the property slump remains the primary drag on the Chinese economy, with other major developers also facing liquidation, and no immediate "light at the end of the tunnel" despite government stimulus efforts.

Experts highlight that Russian propaganda is carefully tailored to specific regional audiences, often framing Russia as a victim of Western aggression and a champion of the Global South.

He argues these "smart weapons" are not only more effective but also morally superior to "dumb weapons" by reducing human casualties and enhancing precision. Despite strong international opposition, including the UN's condemnation of "killer robots," Luckey believes such technologies ultimately foster peace through credible deterrence, ensuring national security.</p>

          <h2>First Human Screwworm Case in US Confirmed in Maryland Traveler from Guatemala</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The first confirmed human case of the flesh-eating New World screwworm parasite in the United States has been identified in a person in Maryland who recently traveled from Guatemala. This development is significant as the parasite, which can be fatal to warm-blooded animals and rarely humans if untreated, has been escalating its northward spread from Central America. The affected individual received treatment, and preventative measures were implemented, though the CDC faced criticism for its initial lack of transparency regarding the case. This confirmed human infestation raises considerable concerns for the U.S. beef and cattle futures market, already experiencing record-high prices due to tight supplies, and poses a political challenge for USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins, who had previously vowed to prevent screwworm from entering the country.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic and fiery collision on Interstate 15 in Temecula resulted in four fatalities when a BMW M4, reportedly driven recklessly, crossed the concrete median into southbound lanes. The BMW then crashed head-on with a white Nissan Sentra, becoming engulfed in flames. Three passengers in the BMW—a 23-year-old woman, a 14-year-old boy, and a 15-year-old girl—were killed, while the 25-year-old male driver from Moreno Valley sustained major injuries but survived. The 35-year-old driver of the Sentra also died, and his 22-year-old passenger was hospitalized in critical condition. Authorities confirmed alcohol was not a factor, and the California Highway Patrol is investigating, with charges against the BMW driver pending.</p>

The 28-year-old, a first-time All-Star, has demonstrated consistent power, significantly increasing his home run production over the past few seasons.

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has developed southeast of Bermuda and is currently tracking north-northeast in the open Atlantic Ocean. As of Sunday evening, the storm maintained maximum sustained winds of 45 mph and was situated approximately 295 miles east of Bermuda. Forecasters anticipate Fernand will experience some strengthening through Monday before likely beginning to weaken on Tuesday, with its path expected to keep it over open waters well east and northeast of Bermuda, posing no immediate threat of landfall. This storm follows Hurricane Erin, which intensified to a ferocious Category 5 earlier in the season, aligning with NOAA's forecast for an above-normal hurricane season.</p>

Manager Ruben Amorim acknowledges these "teething problems," attributing them to the new players' adjustment to a different style of play and developing chemistry.

          <p>Jim Cramer presents his Monday market playbook, analyzing the significant rally spurred by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's signal of impending rate cuts. Powell's emphasis on a dramatic deceleration in hiring, outweighing concerns about tariffs and inflation, redefined market expectations and caught many "negatively biased hedge funds" off guard. Cramer delves into the varied prospects of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks, each facing distinct issues, and identifies strong bullish trends in sectors like housing, mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and initial public offerings (IPOs). He also pinpoints potential "pain points" in healthcare and enterprise software, recommending a focus on industrials, high-yielding oils, and housing-related retailers. The article concludes with a note of caution for September, historically a weak month, due to expected joblessness. (not investment advice)</p>
