        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New Jersey man has turned himself in for allegedly setting fire to ten NYPD vehicles and a police trailer in Brooklyn. Federal prosecutors state the arson, which caused over $800,000 in damages, was intended to compromise police resources ahead of anti-Israel protests. The suspect, Jakhi Lodgson-McCray, faces federal charges and is considered a flight risk due to a history of protest-related arrests and a previous failure to appear in court. His surrender was coordinated by his lawyer after he had been publicly identified as a suspect.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tom Homan, serving as Donald Trump's border czar, has announced plans to intensify immigration enforcement by deploying more ICE agents to sanctuary cities. This policy shift follows an incident where a CBP officer was shot in New York City, allegedly by an undocumented person. Homan stated that if local jails do not cooperate, agents will make arrests within the community, potentially detaining other undocumented individuals present. The administration is framing this as a necessary response to policies in cities like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, which they claim protect criminals.</p>

          <h2>Article Argues Trump's Second Term is Governed by Pettiness and Retribution</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 18:12:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article from The Atlantic argues that Donald Trump's presidency is driven by personal grievances and pettiness rather than coherent policy. It cites examples such as barring former DNI James Clapper from a CIA event for a rescue dog and pushing to fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell over interest rates. The author contends that even major foreign policy decisions, like recent actions on Ukraine, are reactive and based on whether Trump feels personally slighted by other world leaders. The piece concludes that this governance style, focused on culture wars and retribution, may eventually alienate even his most dedicated supporters.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security will begin using military bases in Indiana and New Jersey to detain immigrants, following approval from the Pentagon. The plan also includes expanding detention capacity at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to manage the increasing number of detainees under the Trump administration's policies. The bases in Indiana and New Jersey will each provide space for up to 1,000 people, supporting removal operations from Chicago and Newark. Democratic lawmakers have condemned the move as an inappropriate use of military resources for domestic political purposes.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released a vast collection of previously classified government files related to the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The 230,000 pages include FBI surveillance records and CIA documents concerning the investigation into the 1968 killing. In a statement, King's children acknowledged the release but urged the public to view the files in the context of the government's historical campaign to discredit their father. While some, like Alveda King, praised the move for its transparency, critics suggested it was a distraction from other political issues.</p>

In a letter, she outlined bipartisan recommendations, including upgrading Doppler radar, replacing old weather satellites, and investing in supercomputing to improve forecast accuracy. The call for investment comes as the Trump administration plans a 27% budget cut for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). A White House spokesperson responded that the administration is already focused on modernizing these agencies away from "climate change activism."</p>

The piece positions Bove as a controversial and significant nominee who could represent a new direction or continuation of this judicial reshaping.

          <p>The Texas Legislature has begun a special session to redraw the state's congressional districts, a move pushed by President Trump's political team to bolster the Republican majority in the U.S. House. The effort comes just a few years after the 2021 redistricting and is seen by critics as a partisan maneuver to gain up to five GOP seats ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The Justice Department has also weighed in, alleging that four current Democratic-held districts are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders.

          <p>A new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that President Trump's latest tax bill will increase the national debt by $3.4 trillion over the next decade.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates the bill will actually add $4.1 trillion to the deficit with interest, leaving an estimated 10 million Americans without health insurance by 2034.

          <p>A new report from San Jose State University's Human Rights Institute reveals a staggering level of economic inequality in Silicon Valley. According to the 2025 "Silicon Valley Pain Index," just nine households now control 15% of the region's wealth, totaling $683.2 billion, while the top 0.1% of residents hold 71%. The study shows the wealth divide in the tech hub has widened at double the national rate over the last decade. This concentration of wealth coincides with a rising cost of living, with San Jose ranked as one of the world's most unaffordable cities.</p>

          <p>Pedro Hernandez, the former store clerk convicted of murdering 6-year-old Etan Patz in 1979, has been sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Etan's disappearance from his Manhattan neighborhood became one of America's most influential missing-child cases, leading to new police practices and the creation of National Missing Children's Day. Hernandez confessed in 2012 to luring Etan into a basement and choking him, but his lawyers argued the confession was false due to mental illness. At the sentencing, Etan's father Stan Patz condemned Hernandez, stating, "I will never forgive you."</p>

The conflict, which killed over 1,200 people and displaced more than 128,000, also drew in Syrian government forces and prompted Israeli airstrikes against Syrian military targets. The violence highlights the immense challenges facing President Ahmad al-Sharaa's new government as it struggles to unite the nation, disarm militias, and navigate the interests of regional powers like Israel.

He claimed the medication, combined with fatigue from international travel, contributed to his father's widely criticized performance, where he appeared disoriented. This is the first time a member of the Biden family has mentioned Ambien in connection with the debate, which preceded Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 race.

However, the article advises that HELOC rates are variable and can change, whereas home equity loan rates are fixed, providing stability.
