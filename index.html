          <p>Ozeki Onosato has secured his promotion to yokozuna, the highest rank in sumo wrestling, after winning consecutive championships at the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament. The 24-year-old wrestler achieved a 13-0 record, defeating fellow ozeki Kotozakura. Onosato's promotion is a formality since the Japan Sumo Association's Yokozuna Deliberation Council has never denied promotion to an ozeki winning consecutive tournaments. He will be the first Japanese-born yokozuna since his stablemaster, the former Kisenosato, retired in 2019, and will join Mongolian Hoshoryu at the sport's highest rank.</p>

Netanyahu stated these leaders are on the "wrong side of humanity" for criticizing Israel's actions, while the UK has reiterated its support for Israel's right to self-defense within international law, emphasizing the need for aid to reach suffering civilians in Gaza.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, Steven Pinker, a Harvard professor, defends the university against what he calls "Harvard Derangement Syndrome," arguing that the extreme invective aimed at the institution is unhinged. He acknowledges Harvard's serious ailments, including the erosion of academic freedom and a lack of viewpoint diversity, but cautions against punitive measures that could cripple the university. Pinker calls for a balanced approach that recognizes Harvard's contributions to knowledge and innovation while addressing its genuine shortcomings, urging critics to diagnose and remedy specific issues rather than resorting to destructive, all-out assaults.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board critiques Republican efforts to dismantle Obamacare through measures like Medicaid work requirements and reduced insurance subsidies. The article argues that these actions would deprive millions of Americans of health insurance, primarily benefiting the wealthy with tax cuts. The board contends that such policies lack evidence of effectiveness and would primarily punish people through bureaucratic hurdles. The editorial emphasizes that access to affordable healthcare is a right and calls for policies that expand, rather than restrict, health insurance coverage.</p>

          <p>The UK's energy regulator, Ofgem, has confirmed a fall in the energy price cap, leading to a typical household saving of Â£11 per month starting in July. Ofgem encourages consumers to shop around for cheaper fixed-rate deals, potentially saving up to Â£200 annually, but notes that those currently on fixed deals will not benefit from the immediate price drop. Despite the decrease, energy prices remain high, and many households are still struggling with debt to suppliers. The announcement follows recent debates over winter fuel payments and standing charges, highlighting ongoing concerns about energy affordability.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army will implement a new Army Fitness Test (AFT) on June 1, 2025, replacing the current Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) with updated scoring standards focused on readiness and combat effectiveness. The AFT includes five events: the three-repetition maximum deadlift, hand-release push-ups, sprint-drag-carry, plank, and a two-mile run. Scoring requirements are more demanding, especially for soldiers in combat roles, with sex-neutral combat standards to ensure fairness and operational readiness. Experts note the test is challenging but achievable for those with a basic fitness foundation, emphasizing the importance of progressive training to avoid injury.</p>

          <p>The UN Security Council is set to vote on renewing the arms embargo on South Sudan, amid warnings from Amnesty International that the conflict could escalate without it. The embargo, in place since 2018, aims to curb arms transfers to conflict parties. However, reports of violations, such as the deployment of armed Ugandan soldiers, raise questions about its effectiveness. Despite UN peacekeeping efforts, some locals question the impact of UNMISS, citing continued instability and the need for a clearer mandate.</p>
