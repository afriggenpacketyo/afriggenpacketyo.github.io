          <p>Bill Belichick's much-anticipated college football coaching debut for the North Carolina Tar Heels concluded with a decisive 48-14 home loss against the TCU Horned Frogs. The game, held at Kenan Stadium with celebrity attendees, saw an initial UNC touchdown before TCU took control, scoring 41 unanswered points. Horned Frogs quarterback Josh Hoover excelled, leading his team to a commanding victory. This significant defeat signals a challenging beginning for Belichick's collegiate tenure, indicating the Tar Heels have substantial work ahead for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced mixed trading as investors closely monitored the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) meeting in Tianjin, with lingering tariff uncertainties impacting overall sentiment. This follows a U.S. federal appeals court ruling that deemed most of President Trump's global tariffs unlawful, creating market apprehension. India's markets are under scrutiny after Trump claimed India offered to reduce its tariffs to zero, though he expressed doubt about the timing. Meanwhile, Australia's financial regulator imposed a $3.88 million fine on Societe Generale's local unit for failing to prevent suspicious trading orders in electricity and wheat futures markets during a volatile period.

          <p>Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler, New York's longest-serving House member, will not seek re-election in 2026, citing a "necessity for generational change" within the party. His decision was influenced by former President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 election. Nadler, 78, first elected in 1992, previously chaired the House Judiciary Committee and served as a manager for former President Trump's first impeachment. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries praised Nadler as a relentless fighter for justice and civil rights, acknowledging his significant contributions to the Democratic Caucus.</p>

          <p>Chinese and Russian leaders, Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, met in Beijing for what was described as an "absolutely unprecedented" trip by the Kremlin. A joint declaration from the 10-member Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, which Putin attended, emphasized opposition to "bloc-based and confrontational thinking" in international issues. The SCO members also reaffirmed their commitment to an "open, transparent, inclusive, non-discriminatory and rules-based multilateral trading system," seemingly in response to U.S. trade policies. Many SCO members face sanctions and tariffs from the United States.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic landslide in Sudan's western Darfur region has reportedly destroyed the village of Tarasin, leaving over 1,000 people dead, according to a rebel group controlling the area. The disaster, which occurred after days of heavy rain, left only one known survivor and completely leveled the village. The Sudan Liberation Movement/Army has appealed to the United Nations and international aid agencies for assistance in recovering victims' bodies. This tragedy exacerbates Sudan's ongoing humanitarian crisis, now in its third year of civil war, with famine declared in parts of Darfur.</p>

          <p>The winning numbers for Powerball's estimated $1.2 billion jackpot, which ranks as the fifth-largest in the game's history, have been drawn. Uncertainty remains regarding whether any single ticket successfully matched all the numbers. This substantial jackpot grew after no winner emerged from Saturday night's $1 billion drawing, which still awarded nine tickets $1 million and three tickets $2 million with the "power play" option. A single winner would face a choice between a lump sum of $498.4 million before taxes or an annuity with increasing annual payments. The next drawing is set for Wednesday at 10:59 p.m. ET.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers in Beijing have developed a compact, detergent-free washing machine designed for astronauts, addressing the challenge of limited water in space. The cube-shaped device, weighing 12kg, uses only 400ml of water per cycle, delivered as an ultra-fine mist, to clean up to 800 grams of clothing. Instead of traditional detergent, it employs ultraviolet light to produce ozone, which effectively sterilizes clothes for multiple wears. This innovative solution from the China Astronaut Research and Training Centre aims to improve hygiene and resource efficiency for long-duration space missions.</p>

          <p>Significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, enacted under President Trump's tax law, are now taking effect, marking what some estimate as the largest reduction in the program's history. This federal initiative, which provides food assistance to over 40 million people, is projected to reduce benefits for 2.4 million Americans, with families potentially losing $72 to $231 monthly. While independent grocers anticipate hardship, larger discount retailers like Walmart may paradoxically benefit as low-income consumers seek to stretch their remaining dollars. Experts also warn of a potential decline in nutritional value as people trade down on food choices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children unless they have a formal deportation order. The ruling came just hours after lawyers alerted the court to a hurried government effort to deport hundreds of children, with planes already prepared for departure. The Justice Department confirmed 76 children were slated for deportation, all of whom are now being deplaned and returned to Health and Human Services custody. Lawyers argue these deportations bypass legal protections for minors, who could face abuse or persecution upon return.</p>

          <p>British musician Tom Odell experienced a career resurgence, highlighted by his song "Black Friday" becoming a global hit with 700 million streams. He credits a 2016 Hollywood gig, which he considered a "dud," with inspiring Finneas O'Connell and Billie Eilish, who were in the audience, to pursue their own music. This unexpected connection led to Eilish inviting Odell to open her European tour. After years of feeling creatively constrained, Odell went independent in 2021, embracing a more confessional style. His new album, "A Wonderful Life," reflects his personal and global anxieties, finding peace in the moment.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.0-magnitude earthquake in eastern Afghanistan has killed over 800 people and injured at least 2,500, primarily in Kunar province, according to the Taliban government. The shallow quake, striking late Sunday, destroyed numerous villages and was followed by several aftershocks. Rescue operations are underway, with medical teams dispatched to the affected areas, but the death toll is expected to rise. This disaster exacerbates Afghanistan's humanitarian crisis, occurring amidst a lack of international financial assistance following the Taliban's takeover. Aid officials warn that U.S. aid cuts will hamper relief efforts in the impoverished nation.</p>

Trump linked the investment directly to his trade policy, urging swift action to prevent economic devastation. The tariffs are set to remain until an appeal to the Supreme Court.

Experts warn that any slight drop will likely be temporary due to the emergence of deadly synthetic opioids called nitazenes, which are 100 times stronger than heroin. The crisis is deeply rooted in Scotland's post-industrial social and economic changes, including joblessness, poverty, and trauma, leading to what some describe as a "penchant for oblivion."
