          <p>Jian-Ping Wang, a China-born scientist, has developed a rare-earth-free magnet, potentially offering Western nations an alternative to China's dominance in rare earth element production. Wang's iron nitride magnet, created at the University of Minnesota, is being commercialized by his company, Niron Magnetics, as tensions rise between the U.S. and China over critical mineral exports. This innovation could provide a lifeline for Western technology and automotive giants seeking to reduce their reliance on Chinese rare earth supplies.</p>
