            <p>U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors reacted to President Trump's 90-day tariff reprieve on most countries, reversing a recent sell-off in bonds. The 10-year Treasury yield dropped over 10 basis points to 4.288%, while the 2-year Treasury yield also decreased. Trump's decision to pause tariffs, excluding China, came after bond market pressure, with analysts noting that unpredictability in trade policy remains. Investors are also awaiting the release of the Consumer Price Index for March for further insights into the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The utility company made changes to its internal policy on grounding idle transmission towers shortly after the fire, but has refused to disclose the specifics of the changes. The California Public Utilities Commission has also denied public records requests for information related to Edison's actions. Lawsuits have been filed against Edison, alleging improper grounding of the idle lines may have contributed to the fire.</p>

            <p>Los Angeles importers are facing uncertainty and rising prices as a result of President Trump's tariffs on goods from key trading partners. Business owners are struggling to absorb the added costs or pass them on to customers, potentially leading to lower profits or business closures. Retailers specializing in nonessential products are particularly concerned, as consumers may be less willing to accept price hikes for discretionary goods. The ever-changing nature of Trump’s tariff policies has made it difficult for businesses to determine the best strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's frequent declarations of national emergencies are raising concerns about the expansion of presidential power. Trump has declared emergencies over issues ranging from immigration to trade, allowing him to circumvent Congress and implement policies quickly. Critics argue that this trend allows presidents to abuse their authority with little consequence and undermines the legislative process. The use of emergency powers has accelerated since 9/11, with presidents claiming inherent constitutional powers beyond those granted by statute.</p>

Researchers tested the model with capsaicin and cells with genetic variants linked to abnormal pain perception, showing promise for studying nervous system diseases.</p>
