          <p>Families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas are criticizing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reported plan to prioritize military action for their release. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum described the strategy as a "fraud" that leads toward "devastation," contrasting with the government's pursuit of a "decisive military victory." This response follows the release of harrowing videos showing hostages in poor health, prompting Hamas to offer Red Cross access in exchange for humanitarian corridors throughout Gaza. The situation underscores the deep division over how to secure the remaining hostages' freedom.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is set to resume sales of its H20 chips to China after the U.S. government provided assurances, but the company's market dominance is expected to decline. Analysts predict Nvidia's AI chip market share in China will fall as domestic competitors like Huawei gain prominence, fueled by U.S. export controls that created an opportunity for local firms. While the move is a partial win for Nvidia, it also faces new national security scrutiny from Beijing, which is signaling its intent to intervene in the local AI market. The complex dynamic highlights ongoing U.S.-China tech tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Approximately 3,200 Boeing workers, who build military fighter jets, have initiated a strike at facilities in the St. Louis area after rejecting a second labor contract proposal. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers stated the walkout is about "respect and dignity," demanding a contract that better reflects their critical role in national defense. Boeing expressed disappointment, highlighting its offer included significant wage growth and resolved scheduling issues, and has activated a contingency plan to continue operations. The strike adds to the challenges facing the aerospace giant amid ongoing scrutiny over safety and recent financial losses.</p>

          <p>In a critical analysis, commentator Timothy Garton Ash argues that the Democratic party's current political difficulties were foreseeable and could have been avoided. The article posits that the decision to support Joe Biden for a second term, despite clear public concerns about his age and visible frailty, was a significant misstep by the party establishment and media insiders. Garton Ash contends that an open primary in 2023 might have produced a stronger candidate capable of defeating Donald Trump. He calls for the party to learn from this experience, listen to voters, and empower a new generation of leaders.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's pre-season tour under new manager Ruben Amorim shows promising signs of a cultural shift, but it remains uncertain if this will translate into consistent success. Amorim has introduced a more relaxed yet responsible environment, focusing on tactical walk-throughs and treating players like adults, a contrast to the previous regime. While on-pitch tactics, like a fluid three-man defense, and the energy of new players appear positive, weaknesses in midfield persist. The article concludes that while there are green shoots of recovery, the true test will come when the competitive Premier League season begins against Arsenal.</p>

          <p>A tragic incident off the coast of Yemen has resulted in the deaths of at least 68 migrants, most believed to be from Ethiopia, after their boat capsized in bad weather. The vessel, which was carrying approximately 157 people, sank in what the International Organization for Migration (IOM) describes as a notoriously perilous smuggling route. While a dozen people were rescued, many remain missing, adding to the thousands who have died on this journey in the last decade. The IOM has called for enhanced legal migration pathways to prevent such tragedies and protect vulnerable individuals from exploitation by smugglers.</p>

          <p>Dozens of Democratic lawmakers have fled Texas to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass new congressional maps heavily favored by Donald Trump. In response, Republican Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove the absent legislators from office if they do not return, citing a non-binding legal opinion. The Democrats, many of whom traveled to Illinois, argue they are fighting a "racist, gerrymandered map" and protecting the democratic process. This dramatic standoff escalates a partisan battle over redistricting ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, halting legislative work on other key issues like flood relief.</p>

Due to Ong's poor health from a rare cancer, prosecutors have agreed to recommend a fine instead of a jail sentence, citing the need for "judicial mercy."

          <p>This article suggests Manchester City's most significant summer signing may be Pep Lijnders, Jürgen Klopp's former right-hand man at Liverpool, who has joined as Pep Guardiola's assistant. The move is interpreted as a signal that Guardiola is preparing for a major tactical evolution, moving away from his signature 'positional play' towards a more direct, high-octane style. This shift is seen as a response to the changing dynamics of the Premier League, which increasingly favors aggressive pressing and transition-based attacks. Recent player signings who excel at carrying the ball also support the theory of this impending stylistic change.</p>

          <p>A new report from the UK-China Transparency think tank suggests that Chinese students at UK universities are being pressured by their government to monitor classmates and suppress discussions on sensitive topics. The survey of academics also highlighted instances of lecturers being warned to avoid certain subjects and researchers being denied visas or having their families in China harassed. These actions are seen as a threat to academic freedom and free speech on campuses. The Chinese embassy has dismissed the report as "groundless," while the UK government has stated that such intimidation will not be tolerated.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reversed his stance on actress Sydney Sweeney's controversial American Eagle ad, now declaring it "fantastic" after being informed she is a registered Republican. The ad campaign, which plays on the words "genes" and "jeans," had drawn mixed reactions, with some critics claiming it had racial undertones. Public records indicate the "Euphoria" star is registered with the Republican Party in Florida. Trump's comment adds a political dimension to the cultural debate surrounding the actress and her marketing, which has been both criticized as tone-deaf and praised for challenging "woke" advertising.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotech firms Innovent and BeOne are projected to achieve their first full-year profits in 2025, marking a significant milestone for the country's biotech industry. Innovent, a pioneer of Hong Kong's pre-revenue listing chapter, is expected to see a major revenue boost from its newly launched weight-loss drug, mazdutide. This shift to profitability indicates a maturation of the sector, suggesting that leading Chinese biotechs are becoming financially self-sustaining and no longer solely reliant on investor funding. The success demonstrates their growing ability to create value for patients and government payers. (not investment advice)</p>
