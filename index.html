          <p>Police are investigating a break-in at the Twin Cities home of slain Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman, days after she and her husband were fatally shot. The home had been boarded up after the initial investigation, but plywood covering a rear window was pried off, and the window broken. While family members don't believe anything was missing, crime scene investigators searched the home again. Neighbors expressed outrage and sorrow, feeling as if the Hortmans were being attacked again, as investigations continue and neighbors tend to the Hortmans' gardens and memorial. </p>

          <p>Senate Republicans largely support President Trump's handling of the Israel-Iran conflict, trusting his judgment on potential U.S. involvement. Trump indicated he would decide at the last moment whether to engage further, a stance that has divided his MAGA base, with some advocating for non-intervention. Democrats urge de-escalation and congressional approval for any military action, while Republicans emphasize preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Senator Mark Warner expressed concern over the lack of information from the Trump administration regarding its Iran plan, suggesting even Republican colleagues are uninformed.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering strikes on Iran's Fordo nuclear facility, potentially involving multiple attacks, according to a source familiar with the intelligence. The administration is gauging the MAGA base's reaction to potential strikes, while also assessing security at U.S. Army bases due to possible Iranian retaliation. This consideration comes as Israel discovered that they did not eliminate all Iranian air defenses as initially believed, adding to concerns about the ongoing conflict.

          <p>A new study published in JAMA reveals a link between addiction to social media, mobile phones, and video games and a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in teenagers. The study, which followed over 4,000 kids from ages 9-10 to age 14, found that a significant portion of the participants showed signs of addiction to these screens. Teens with high and increasing addiction to mobile phones and social media were associated with a higher risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, while total screen time was not linked to a higher suicide risk. Experts emphasize the importance of understanding how teens use their screen time and identifying signs of addiction.</p>

Experts suggest Congress must act to address the program's financial challenges, either by raising revenue or cutting benefits. The report also notes that Medicare's health insurance program for people over 65 is facing a financial crunch in 2033, at which point it wouldn't be able to pay 100% of benefits.

Forecasters warn of extreme temperature impacts in Nebraska, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Iowa, where humid conditions could make temperatures exceeding 90F feel as much as 20F hotter. The heatwave, fueled by moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, is expected to last into next week, with temperatures potentially reaching 100F in Denver and near 100F in Chicago, Washington DC, and New York City.

          <p>President Trump addressed the ongoing situation with Iran, stating he was not revealing what action he might take after being presented with a range of options by his national security team. He reiterated his demand for Iran's "unconditional surrender," clarifying it meant he was "done" and would consider military action if necessary. Trump also pushed back on prominent MAGA voices who have urged non-intervention, asserting his supporters were still aligned with him. The President emphasized his long-standing position that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon.</p>

The qualification about property size, type, and home energy score is being scrapped, allowing 2.7 million more homes, including almost a million with children, to benefit. While debt charities and energy groups have welcomed the move, some say the scheme still leaves out some of those most at risk, including those on non-means tested benefits. The bill for expanding the Warm Home Discount will be paid by energy companies and could be passed on through the Standing Charge.</p>

The trial included testimony from expert witnesses and friends, with the defense suggesting Read was framed by law enforcement officers.
