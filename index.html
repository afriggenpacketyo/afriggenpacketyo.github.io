          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell has been convicted of conspiracy to commit murder in the 2019 death of her estranged husband, Charles Vallow, in Arizona. Vallow Daybell is already serving life sentences in Idaho for the murders of her two children and conspiring to murder her then-boyfriend Chad Daybell's wife, Tammy. Prosecutors argued that Vallow Daybell and her brother, Alex Cox, planned to kill Vallow to collect life insurance money and marry Daybell, an author of religious novels. Vallow Daybell, representing herself, claimed Vallow's death was a tragedy, but the jury found her guilty after deliberating for three hours.</p>

          <p>A report indicates that President Trump's tariffs, combined with local regulations, could devastate Southern California's $300-billion trade and logistics industry. The region relies heavily on trade with China, which is subject to significant tariff hikes. The report warns that escalating trade tensions could have severe economic consequences, impacting jobs and increasing costs for consumers. Experts suggest that financial incentives, similar to those established by the CHIPS Act, could be a more effective approach to boosting domestic manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported a 20% drop in auto revenue for the first quarter, missing Wall Street estimates as CEO Elon Musk focused on his role in the Trump administration.

The report comes amid concerns that Trump's tariffs will increase costs for critical components. Tesla refrained from promising growth this year, and the stock price was volatile in after-hours trading. (not investment advice)</p>

This move stops short of an outright ban, relying instead on a "national standard and timeline" for the industry to make the switch. The FDA claims that the food industry is eager to remove artificial dyes, while the industry itself cites the dyes' importance for consistency and visual appeal. The decision fulfills one of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s goals.</p>
