          <p>Tesla shares are on track to finish May with a significant increase, despite some challenges in car sales in China and Europe. This positive trend coincides with Elon Musk's planned reduction in his involvement with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under President Trump. Musk indicated he would decrease his time spent on government work but would remain an advisor to the president. This shift is expected to allow him to focus more on Tesla and his other business ventures, potentially boosting investor confidence. The article also mentions that while Tesla is having a good month, its shares are still down for the year. Optimism around Musk's renewed focus seems to be driving the stock's recent performance.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is concluding his tenure at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) with an estimated $175 billion in savings, falling short of the initially projected $2 trillion. According to Richard Stern, an economics policy expert, DOGE overestimated its legal flexibility to implement significant cuts. The initiative faced challenges including negative press, lawsuits, and the need for congressional approval for major spending reductions. Stern suggests DOGE's greatest impact lies in identifying potential spending cuts and making information public to facilitate future congressional action. The White House is expected to send a $9.4 billion cuts package to Congress.</p>

          <p>Libya faces ongoing political turmoil, highlighted by recent violence in Tripoli between armed groups and pro-government forces. The clashes erupted following Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah's decree to dismantle armed militias, resulting in civilian casualties and further instability. The country remains divided between rival governments in the east and west, with Dbeibah attempting to consolidate power in Tripoli. Popular protests have demanded national elections and a return to constitutional drafting, but observers remain cautiously optimistic about the potential for renewed political progress.

          <p>Authorities are investigating whether a man who allegedly threatened to shoot and kill President Trump may have been framed. Ramon Morales Reyes was arrested after a threatening letter was purportedly sent from him to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. However, law enforcement sources indicate that a handwriting test did not match the letter's writing, leading to suspicions that someone else may have sent it. The Milwaukee Police Department is investigating the incident as a case of identity theft and victim intimidation. The Department of Homeland Security initially touted the arrest, emphasizing Reyes's illegal status and criminal history.</p>

          <p>A U.S. court battle over President Trump's tariffs has brought no immediate relief for the European Union, as an initial ruling against the tariffs was quickly suspended by an appeals court. The EU is currently engaged in negotiations with the U.S. to resolve trade disputes, with discussions focused on a "zero-for-zero" tariff deal. Experts offer differing views on whether the court ruling strengthens the EU's position, with some suggesting it reduces the potential for blackmail, while others argue it adds more uncertainty to the trade process. The EU has so far avoided higher tariff rates but remains prepared to implement countermeasures if negotiations fail.</p>

The players' approach to the tour was reportedly relaxed, with some engaging in nightlife activities. Incidents such as Amad Diallo making an offensive gesture towards a fan and Alejandro Garnacho's apparent disengagement have further fueled criticism. The club's decision to hold a bus parade in Kuala Lumpur, despite forgoing a parade after the Europa League final, has also been questioned.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has officially concluded his role in Donald Trump's administration, with Trump confirming the departure and praising Musk's service to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk stated that it was "not the end of DOGE, but the beginning" and that the DOGE team would "only grow stronger". Despite promising to save taxpayers as much as $2 trillion, DOGE currently estimates its efforts have saved $175 billion. Musk expressed frustration about resistance to his ideas, and clashed with other senior members of the Trump administration.</p>

The worth of an annuity depends on individual financial goals, offering peace of mind with predictable income and protection against longevity risk.

          <p>This opinion piece explores the reasons why millennials dread having children, focusing on the evolving definition of harm and the high standards they hold their own parents to. The author suggests that millennials' experiences with therapy, self-harm, and the internet have contributed to a heightened awareness of childhood trauma. This cultural shift has led to unrealistic expectations for parents, making millennials hesitant to take on the responsibility of parenthood. The author contemplates whether the standards they set for their own parents are achievable, or if they are afraid to fail at meeting them.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has dropped its criminal case against Boeing despite the company's agreement to plead guilty to its role in two fatal 737 Max crashes. This decision has sparked outrage from families of the victims, who feel that Boeing is not being held accountable. The Justice Department stated that the decision to drop the case and reach a non-prosecution agreement was the right decision given what could be proved in the case. The NPA includes Boeing agreeing to pay an additional $444.5 million in victim compensation, but it frees Boeing from having to plead guilty and from federal oversight.</p>
