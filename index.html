          <h2>Trump Denies Report Claiming He Was Persuaded Not to Fire Federal Reserve Chair</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 17:02:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has refuted a Wall Street Journal report that claimed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent convinced him not to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The report suggested Bessent warned of negative market reactions and argued a firing was unnecessary as the Fed is expected to cut interest rates. In a Truth Social post, Trump called the story untruthful, asserting that he understands the market well and does not need such matters explained to him. This comes amid Trump's continued public criticism of Powell's leadership and monetary policies.</p>

          <p>Parts of Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, experienced flash flooding following intense rainfall, with images showing streets submerged in water. A local resident described the force of the water as strong enough to lift manhole covers from the ground. The Met Office had issued an amber warning for heavy rain, its second-highest alert level, for several eastern counties overnight. The severe weather caused difficult driving conditions and road closures, prompting police to advise caution to all travelers in the affected areas.</p>

          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler won his first Open Championship with a dominant performance at Royal Portrush, finishing four shots clear of the field. This victory marks his second major of the year and his fourth overall, placing him in an elite group of golfers to win the Masters, US PGA, and The Open before turning 30. His consistent play throughout the tournament drew comparisons to a peak Tiger Woods, as he now only needs a U.S. Open title to complete the career Grand Slam.</p>

          <p>The acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, has stated he will continue to allow his officers to wear masks during arrest operations. He defended the controversial practice as a necessary tool to protect agents and their families from doxxing and threats, citing a sharp increase in assaults on officers. Critics, including legal advocates and state attorneys general, argue that the masks undermine accountability, create a climate of fear, and could lead to dangerous impersonations.</p>
