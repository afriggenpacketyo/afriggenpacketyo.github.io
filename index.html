        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The “Make America Healthy Again” (MAHA) movement's promotion of increased meat consumption contradicts recommendations from government nutrition experts and scientific research.  Studies consistently link high meat consumption to increased risks of chronic diseases.  While the MAHA movement emphasizes “natural” foods, this approach overlooks the benefits of plant-based diets and the importance of addressing America's overall dietary patterns.</p>
