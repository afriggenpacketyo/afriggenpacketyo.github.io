          <p>SkillStorm CEO Justin Vianello discussed the federal government's struggles with hiring skilled workers in cybersecurity and tech, leading to potential national security risks. Vianello proposed allowing an on-ramp time of two to four months to custom-build teams with the right skills and certifications, accelerating IT transformation. He highlighted SkillStorm's Performance Acceleration Center for Excellence, which trains and deploys individuals, recovering the investment through hourly billing. Vianello emphasized the need to invest in domestic programs to address the shortage of cybersecurity experts and AI innovators, viewing it as a national security imperative.</p>

          <p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett is facing increasing criticism from right-wing figures due to her votes on the Supreme Court, particularly those perceived as not aligning with President Trump's agenda. Examples include her vote against Trump's effort to rescind a lower court order on foreign aid and her joining Chief Justice Roberts to reject Trump's request to delay sentencing in the New York hush money case. While Trump has publicly defended Barrett, sources indicate he has privately expressed frustration with his Supreme Court picks. Despite the criticism, Barrett has consistently voted conservatively on key issues like overturning Roe v Wade and expanding gun rights.</p>

The system freezes water at night when electricity is cheaper, then uses the ice to cool buildings during the day, reducing cooling costs by up to 40%. Air conditioning accounts for a significant portion of global energy use, and this system helps alleviate stress on the power grid during peak hours. While currently implemented in about 4,000 sites globally, researchers are also exploring new materials that require less energy to store cooling power.</p>

The economists predict that the higher debt and deficits resulting from the bill would put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates.

          <p>Chinese company Zhongman Petroleum has drilled 193 wells in Egypt's West Minya to irrigate a 500-hectare farm supplying the world's largest beet sugar factory. The project, part of China's effort to export agricultural technology, uses air-foam drilling to tackle unstable aquifers and prevent well collapse, a technique now adopted by many Egyptian drilling companies. This partnership reflects a strategic alignment, with Chinese companies seeking overseas opportunities and Middle Eastern countries looking to Chinese expertise for development challenges. Saudi Arabia has also signed agreements with Chinese companies for projects in the environmental, water, agricultural, fisheries, and livestock sectors.</p>
