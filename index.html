          <p>Miami Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel has publicly addressed quarterback Tua Tagovailoa's recent comments criticizing teammates for a lack of effort and tardiness. While initially supporting player-led accountability, McDaniel clarified that a post-game press conference is not the appropriate venue for such grievances. The coach stated he believes Tagovailoa had no ill intent but emphasized that these conversations should remain internal, especially following a loss. This incident highlights growing frustration within the team amid a difficult 1-5 season start.</p>

The events are seen by some current and former officials as an attempt to consolidate power under Health and Human Services and undermine the agency's scientific independence.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump is celebrating a major diplomatic achievement after brokering a peace deal to end the two-year war in Gaza, which included the release of all living Israeli hostages. Arriving in the Middle East for summits in Israel and Egypt, Trump framed the agreement as a historic success that many thought impossible. However, analysis suggests significant challenges remain for the deal's next phases, including the disarmament of Hamas and the reconstruction of Gaza, which will require sustained international pressure to succeed.</p>

          <p>A significant step towards ending the two-year war in Gaza was taken as Hamas released all living Israeli hostages in exchange for Israel freeing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. The exchange, part of a US-brokered plan, prompted emotional celebrations and family reunions across both Israel and the Palestinian territories. While US President Donald Trump hailed the moment as a "historic dawn," difficult negotiations lie ahead regarding the future governance of Gaza, Israeli troop withdrawal, and the disarmament of Hamas.</p>
