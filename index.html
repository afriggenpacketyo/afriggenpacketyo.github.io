          <p>The Trump administration is considering charging three more New Jersey Democrats, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, following a clash at a federal immigration detention center. According to a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, body camera footage allegedly shows members of Congress assaulting ICE officers. Baraka, who was arrested for trespassing, insists he did nothing wrong and that the city will continue its legal fight against the Geo Group, the company running the detention center. The mayor emphasized that the federal government is not sharing information about who is being kept in the detention facility.</p>

          <p>Ukraine and its allies are advocating for a "full, unconditional ceasefire" with Russia for at least 30 days starting on Monday, according to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha. This push comes as leaders from France, Germany, Poland, and the United Kingdom visited Kyiv to encourage Moscow to agree to a truce and begin peace talks. Despite a unilateral three-day ceasefire declared by Russia, Ukraine alleges repeated violations by Russian forces. The leaders reiterated their support for President Trump's calls for a peace deal and urged Russia to cease obstructing efforts to secure an enduring peace.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, following his arrest at a protest outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility, has affirmed that the city will persist in its legal battle against the Geo Group, the company managing the facility.

The city's lawsuit alleges that the Geo Group is operating the facility without proper permits and obstructing city inspectors, while federal officials and Geo Group representatives deny these claims.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng engaged in over 10 hours of discussions aimed at de-escalating trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. While there was no immediate indication of progress, the talks offer a glimmer of hope for stabilizing global markets affected by the U.S.-China trade standoff. President Trump has hinted at potentially lowering tariffs on China, while Chinese officials have called for the U.S. to first drop its "unilateral" tariffs.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports that after Vice President JD Vance initially dismissed the India-Pakistan conflict as not Americaâ€™s concern, the Trump administration grew alarmed by the escalating tensions and the potential for nuclear conflict. Evidence of serious dogfights between the Pakistani and Indian Air Forces, and Pakistanâ€™s deployment of drones into Indian territory, prompted U.S. intervention. A missile strike on the Noor Khan air base in Rawalpindi, near Pakistanâ€™s nuclear command authority, heightened concerns. The U.S., along with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, engaged in diplomatic efforts, with U.S. officials directly contacting Prime Ministers Modi and General Munir to de-escalate the situation, leading to a ceasefire agreement.</p>

Sims, who was stationed at Fort Ord in 1977, had a prior conviction for assault to commit murder and robbery.

Economists and investors are closely monitoring the negotiations, fearing that a prolonged economic conflict between the two nations could lead to slower global growth and higher prices.

          <p>The New York Times reports that India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire after days of escalating conflict, but reports of continued violence emerged shortly after the announcement. President Trump claimed the U.S. mediated the agreement, a claim India disputed. Both sides accused each other of targeting military bases, and there are conflicting reports regarding the effectiveness of the ceasefire. The conflict originated after a terrorist attack in Kashmir, with India blaming Pakistan for involvement, which Pakistan denies.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Halts Use of Social Cost of Carbon in Regulatory Process</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to cease considering the economic damage caused by climate change, known as the "social cost of carbon," when developing policies and regulations. This decision effectively eliminates a tool used to justify climate policies by weighing the costs of regulation against the economic impacts of carbon pollution. Critics argue that this move denies the reality of climate change and allows "feelings, not facts" to guide federal policy. The American Petroleum Institute has supported limiting the application of the social cost of carbon, while environmental groups may challenge the administration's decision in court.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated, with both countries exchanging fire after India's missile attack on Pakistan, stemming from the disputed Kashmir region. Despite a ceasefire agreement, experts say dangers remain, citing strong nationalist sentiments, religious fervor, and the possession of nuclear weapons by both countries. The conflict largely dates back to 1947, with the origin of the recent hostilities largely dating back to 1947, when they gained their independence from British rule, according to Surupa Gupta, a professor of political science and international affairs at the University of Mary Washington in Virginia. Water rights and water access and the role of external actors like the U.S. in mediating tensions are also key factors.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that the Kyiv ceasefire talks represent a "significant moment" in the effort to secure a ceasefire in the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, although he acknowledged it is not "the end of the process." During a virtual meeting of the "coalition of the willing," approximately 30 global leaders reiterated their call for Russia to agree to a 30-day unconditional ceasefire, threatening "massive" sanctions if the demand is not met. President Trump reaffirmed his support for the ceasefire, which Vladimir Putin rejected in March. Starmer noted the unity in the demand and the planned response if the demand is not met.</p>

          <p>Negotiations are intensifying regarding President Donald Trump's tax agenda, with key issues and potential impacts on millions of Americans under scrutiny. The House Ways and Means Committee released a preliminary partial text of its portion of the bill, but the final version could undergo significant changes before a vote. Republican lawmakers aim to pass Trump's package without Democratic support through a process known as "reconciliation," which requires navigating budget constraints and competing priorities. The narrow Republican majority in the House and the need for a fiscally responsible package add complexity to the process.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates has pledged to donate most of his wealth by 2045 to address urgent global needs, expressing concern over cuts to USAID led by Elon Musk. Gates predicts these cuts will increase childhood deaths in poor countries, and described Elon Musk as a liar in response to Musk's defence on X. The Gates Foundation plans to double its giving to $200 billion by 2045, focusing on reducing child mortality, fighting diseases, and alleviating poverty. Gates' wealth stems from co-founding Microsoft, and he has since diversified his investments through Cascade Investment.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's efforts to pass crypto legislation are facing obstacles due to concerns about his personal cryptocurrency ventures creating conflicts of interest. Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act, meant to establish federal rules for stablecoins, due to concerns that President Trump's personal cryptocurrency ventures have created an unprecedented conflict of interest. Senator Jeff Merkley criticized the situation as a "profoundly corrupt scheme" that endangers national security and erodes public trust. Trump's meme coin, $TRUMP, and his family's crypto venture, World Liberty Financial, have raised ethical questions and led to defections from the stablecoin legislation.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell faces the challenge of avoiding President Trump's "Too Late" label amid economic uncertainty stemming from tariffs and volatile policy. Economists are divided on whether Powell should cut rates, with some arguing that the Fed's historical tendency to act slowly could lead to a recession. Trump has been pressuring the Fed to cut rates, but Powell has expressed confidence in the economy and dismissed the idea of pre-emptive cuts. The volatile policy mix, with tariffs threatening both growth and inflation, puts Powell in a difficult position.</p>

The timing of the talks coincides with Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow, highlighting China's alternative global leadership role.</p>

The protests led to the temporary suspension of student journalists who reported on the events, though the suspensions were later lifted.
