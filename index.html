          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced his decision to remove all 17 members of the CDC's vaccine advisory committee, the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), to restore public trust in vaccine science. Kennedy emphasized the need for unbiased science and transparency in the committee's recommendations, stating that the committee will no longer function as a rubber stamp for industry profit agendas. The move comes after the Biden administration appointed all 17 sitting ACIP members, with 13 of those appointments occurring in 2024, which Kennedy believes necessitates a clean sweep to reestablish public confidence in vaccine science. Kennedy aims to prioritize public health and evidence-based medicine in the ACIP's future operations. The goal is to ensure the public trusts the recommendations made by health agencies regarding vaccines. </p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing widespread protests after immigration raids by ICE officers in areas with large Latino populations, prompting President Trump to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops. The protests, initially peaceful, escalated into violence, including vehicles being set on fire and looting. Governor Newsom condemned Trump's actions as illegal and filed a lawsuit, arguing that the deployment violates state sovereignty, citing the 10th amendment of the US Constitution. The National Guard's role is to protect federal agents and property, not to conduct immigration raids, and the deployment has sparked political controversy, with local officials expressing concern over the heavy-handed response. The unrest has temporarily shut down major freeways and led to numerous arrests, highlighting the deep divisions over immigration policy in the city. </p>

          <p>President Trump stated he would support the arrest of California Governor Gavin Newsom for allegedly obstructing federal immigration enforcement actions in Los Angeles. This followed Newsom's announcement that he would sue Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for deploying National Guard troops without his consent. About 700 U.S. Marines were mobilized to support the California National Guard in protecting federal personnel and property during the protests. Newsom criticized Trump's action as an unwarranted escalation and an abuse of presidential authority, while Trump defended his decision by saying he was ensuring law and order. The conflict underscores the escalating tensions between the federal government and California over immigration enforcement. </p>

          <p>The dream of homeownership is fading for many Americans as the percentage of housing sales to first-time homebuyers has significantly decreased, reflecting challenges such as high home prices, low inventory, and rising mortgage rates. The typical first-time purchaser is older than in the past, with an average age of 38, indicating that people are entering the market later in life due to financial constraints. Americans who are unable to buy their first homes miss out on the opportunity to build wealth through homeownership. Factors such as high rent costs, credit card debt, and student loan payments make it difficult for people to save for a down payment, further hindering their ability to enter the housing market. </p>

          <p>An aid boat named Madleen, bound for Gaza carrying environmental activist Greta Thunberg and other activists, was intercepted by Israeli forces and arrived at the port of Ashdod. Israel's Defense Minister had vowed to prevent the ship from reaching Gaza, citing concerns about arms being imported to Hamas. The activists were undergoing medical checks and were expected to be deported to their home countries, while the aid on the ship would be sent to Gaza. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, which organized the effort, condemned the interception, accusing Israel of kidnapping the activists and confiscating the aid, which included baby formula, food, and medical supplies. </p>

          <p>President Trump invoked Title 10 of the federal code to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles amid protests over immigration raids, citing the need to protect federal immigration officials and law enforcement. California Governor Gavin Newsom has condemned the move and filed a lawsuit, arguing that it violates state sovereignty. Legal experts are debating whether the president has the authority to deploy the National Guard in a supportive role under Title 10, and the situation differs from invoking the Insurrection Act, which would grant the National Guard more substantive law enforcement authority. The deployment raises concerns about escalating violence and the relationship between the military, civil society, and state and federal governments. </p>

Many argue that photos of the riots will damage any hopes Newsom may have of running for president, accusing him of prioritizing open borders donors over stopping the violence.

          <p>Another Chinese researcher has been arrested upon entering the United States, amid an escalating federal probe into the alleged smuggling of biological materials. Han Chengxuan, a PhD candidate at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in Wuhan, was accused of shipping four undeclared packages containing biological materials from China to a University of Michigan lab. She allegedly made false statements to customs officers and admitted to the FBI that she sent the packages, which contained “biological material related to round worms.” This arrest follows charges filed against two other Chinese nationals affiliated with the University of Michigan for allegedly attempting to smuggle a crop pathogen. </p>

          <p>The Indian Coast Guard rescued crew members from a burning Singapore-flagged cargo ship, Wan Hai 503, approximately 144 kilometers off the coast of Kerala in southern India. The crew reported an explosion followed by a fire onboard, prompting them to abandon ship and take to life rafts. Four vessels were deployed to rescue the crew, but four crew members are still unaccounted for, and a search operation is underway. One of the rescued sailors is reported to have sustained serious injuries, while the cause of the explosion remains unclear. </p>
