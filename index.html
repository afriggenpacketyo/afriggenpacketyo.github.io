          <p>The Trump administration has established a new fast-track visa program, dubbed the "Gold Card," through an executive order.

Corporations can also sponsor individuals for $2 million. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that this program, which will make 80,000 cards available, is designed to replace existing exceptional ability visas by defining exceptional value through a significant financial contribution to the country.

          <p>A 45-year-old hiker from Argentina, Matias Augusto Travizano, died after falling approximately 2,000 feet down Wintun Glacier on Mount Shasta. After successfully reaching the summit, Travizano became disoriented during his descent on the Clear Creek Trail, considered the mountain's easiest route. He and another hiker found themselves on a dangerous ice sheet and attempted a controlled slide, but Travizano lost control, struck a boulder, and fell the remaining distance. Authorities warn that even the easier trails on the 14,179-foot volcano are treacherous and prone to sudden weather changes.</p>

          <p>The Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, has expressed serious concern that the UK Parliament is vulnerable to foreign espionage. His warning follows the Crown Prosecution Service's decision to drop charges against two men, Christopher Berry and Christopher Cash, who were accused of spying for China under the Official Secrets Act. Sir Lindsay stated he was "a very unhappy speaker" over the decision, arguing it "leaves the door open" for foreign actors to target the House. He is reportedly considering a private legal action against the pair and has voiced his concerns to the home secretary.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has strongly criticized Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Brendan Carr, likening his threats against ABC to the tactics of a "mafioso." Cruz's comments came after Carr suggested the FCC could revoke ABC's broadcast licenses over a monologue by host Jimmy Kimmel regarding the assassination of Charlie Kirk, leading to Kimmel's suspension. While stating he was "thrilled" Kimmel was disciplined, Cruz warned that a government agency threatening a media company's license over its content is "dangerous as hell" and sets a perilous precedent for free speech that could ultimately harm conservatives.</p>

          <p>A prominent Japanese defense researcher has warned that weakening ties between the United States and India, coupled with waning U.S. interest in regional alliances, are creating a strategic opening for China in Asia. Speaking at the Beijing Xiangshan Forum, the researcher identified the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), which includes the U.S., India, Japan, and Australia, as a key diplomatic tool for balancing against China. The article highlights Japanese concern that President Trump's disinterest in the Quad and a deteriorating U.S.-India partnership could undermine regional stability and security frameworks.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that he authorized a third lethal military strike on a vessel in the Caribbean Sea suspected of trafficking narcotics. According to the president, the strike killed three individuals described as "narcoterrorists" who were affiliated with a designated terrorist organization. This action follows a new policy classifying drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, which legally permits the use of military force typically reserved for imminent threats against Americans.

          <p>A comprehensive investigation has uncovered significant issues with counterfeit products and fraudulent sellers on Walmart's third-party online marketplace. As Walmart aggressively expanded its e-commerce platform to compete with Amazon, it reportedly relaxed its seller vetting processes, creating an environment where bad actors could thrive. The report found numerous instances of sellers using stolen identities of legitimate businesses, including a pizza parlor and a disability services provider, to sell fake goods like health supplements and luxury beauty products. This lax oversight has led to consumers receiving potentially dangerous counterfeit items, eroding trust in the platform.</p>

          <p>Recent threats from the Trump administration to revoke broadcast licenses of networks like ABC have raised questions about the powers of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC, an independent agency, grants licenses to local television and radio stations to use public airwaves, requiring them to operate in the "public interest." While it does not directly regulate national networks or cable channels, it can influence them through their affiliated local stations. Experts note that revoking a license is a complex process and is typically related to issues like obscenity or children's programming, not political content, making the current threats largely unprecedented.</p>

However, confirmation from Beijing was less definitive, with Chinese state media quoting Xi as saying China "welcomes negotiations over TikTok."

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation imposing a new $100,000 annual fee on H-1B visa applications, a move that could severely impact the U.S. tech industry. The H-1B program is heavily utilized by tech companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers, particularly from India and China. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the policy is designed to incentivize companies to "Train Americans" and hire recent U.S. graduates instead of foreign talent. The move has drawn criticism for creating a disincentive to attract global talent, and immigration experts are questioning the executive branch's legal authority to impose such a fee.

          <p>Federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies are implementing extensive security measures for the memorial service of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, scheduled for Sunday at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. With over 100,000 people anticipated to attend, including President Trump, the event has been designated a SEAR-1 level event by DHS, on par with the Super Bowl. A security bulletin noted "several threats of unknown credibility" are being tracked, though there is no information about a specific plot.

          <p>British supermodel David Gandy has joined over 2,000 other models in calling for government regulation to protect against the rising use of artificial intelligence in the fashion industry. Gandy expressed concern that generative AI, which can create realistic human-like images, poses an existential threat to the livelihoods of models, photographers, makeup artists, and others. He pointed to recent campaigns by brands like Guess that used AI-generated models who do not exist. Gandy fears that without regulation, this trend could irreparably damage the creative industry and also negatively impact the mental health of young people.</p>

          <p>Russia is reviving a Soviet-era song contest called Intervision, positioning it as an alternative to Eurovision, from which it was banned following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The event, a brainchild of Vladimir Putin, features 23 participating countries, primarily Russian allies from Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America, including China, Brazil, and South Africa. The contest is heavily backed by the Kremlin, with senior government officials on its supervisory board. The initiative is seen as a political project to demonstrate that Russia still has international friends and to promote a softer image focused on traditional cultural values.</p>

This influx of capital is aimed at strengthening the "Golden Triangle" of Oxford, Cambridge, and London as a global tech hub.

          <p>UCLA has released new, formalized rules for campus protests that align with some Trump administration demands while also expanding certain free speech zones. The guidelines, implemented ahead of the fall term, ban unauthorized overnight encampments and demonstrations in Royce Quad, the site of a major 2024 pro-Palestinian protest. However, the university will still permit pre-approved overnight events and has not adopted federal demands to screen foreign students for "anti-Western" views. The new policies come as UCLA faces the withdrawal of federal research funding and intense pressure to crack down on campus demonstrations.</p>
