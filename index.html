          <p>Local authorities in Dalton, Georgia, dismissed traffic charges against Ximena Arias Cristobal, a 19-year-old Mexican-born college student, leading to her ICE detention. Police reviewed footage and admitted the officer stopped the wrong vehicle. Despite the dismissal, Cristobal, who lacks legal authorization to be in the U.S., remains in ICE custody and faces deportation along with her father, who was also detained following a traffic stop. Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene stated Cristobal has no legal basis to remain in the United States, while the Department of Homeland Security urged Cristobal and her father to self-deport. The family maintains they are not criminals and only came to the U.S. to fulfill their dreams.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As economic uncertainty and inflation persist, investors are increasingly turning to gold as a safe-haven asset, driving its price close to $3,300 per ounce. Experts recommend considering gold's price in context, understanding the different investment types like physical gold and ETFs, and being aware of tax implications. Investors should also assess liquidity when choosing between physical gold and ETFs, as physical gold is considered a collectible by the IRS and may be taxed at a higher rate. Strategies include a 'buy and hold' approach for physical gold and using ETFs for short-term exposure to gold prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Three far-right extremists in the UK, Brogan Stewart, Christopher Ringrose, and Marco Pitzettu, were convicted of terrorism offenses after amassing weapons and planning attacks on targets including a mosque. The trio, part of an online group idolizing the Nazi regime, had amassed over 200 weapons, including machetes and crossbows, and discussed targets like mosques and synagogues. Stewart detailed plans to torture a Muslim leader using an "information extraction kit," including items like a blowtorch and bleach.

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is renaming its streaming platform from Max back to HBO Max, reversing a change made just two years prior. The decision reflects a shift in strategy to focus on high-quality programming over a large volume of content, aiming to emphasize the prestige and quality associated with the HBO brand. CEO David Zaslav stated that bringing back HBO will accelerate growth, while executives like JB Perrette highlighted the platform's distinct and great programming for adults and families. The move comes as legacy media companies grapple with achieving profitability in the streaming business and prioritize advertising tiers and service bundles.</p>

          <p>The United States announced plans to lift sanctions on Syria, a decision celebrated by Syrians who hope for economic recovery and stability. The move, influenced by discussions with Saudi Arabia and Turkey, aims to aid the new Syrian leadership in rebuilding the war-torn country. Lifting sanctions is expected to facilitate aid deliveries and encourage investments from wealthy neighbors, with potential for significant investments in the oil and gas sector by Turkey. Experts believe the Syrian economy faces immense challenges, needing substantial investment to revive industries and resettle displaced populations, but the sanctions relief is a critical first step.</p>

          <p>Researchers are exploring methods to extract valuable rare earth metals from wastewater, including the toxic brew in Montana's Berkeley Pit, to boost U.S. production for technologies like electric vehicles and defense. The Berkeley Pit contains 50 billion gallons of acidic water rich in elements like neodymium and praseodymium, essential for magnets in electric vehicles and military applications. Extracting metals from wastewater is considered more economical and environmentally friendly than traditional mining. The process involves using specialized technologies to separate and refine these metals, potentially transforming liabilities into valuable resources and reducing reliance on foreign suppliers like China.</p>

The Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) found that the bottom 60% of U.S. households cannot achieve a "minimal quality of life," with an average annual income of $38,000 falling short of the $67,000 needed to cover essential expenses.

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, moved closer to potential freedom after being resentenced to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law. The brothers, who claimed sexual assault by their father as a defense, apologized for their actions during the hearing. Judge Michael Jesic cited their rehabilitation efforts in prison, while their fate now rests with state parole officials and California Governor Gavin Newsom.

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for prioritizing the resettlement of white South African refugees, known as Afrikaners, while simultaneously reducing protections for refugees from other countries. The State Department welcomed 59 Afrikaners, citing racial discrimination as the reason for fast-tracking their applications.

Questions have also been raised about the funding for the Afrikaners' travel, as the International Organization for Migration denied involvement, and the State Department has not clarified whether the refugees paid their own way.</p>

Andor was the TV prequel to the film Rogue One, which was itself a prequel to the first movie in the original Star Wars trilogy; like its predecessor, Andor took its Star Wars storytelling seriously.

          <p>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was elected as mayor in his home city by a landslide, official results showed Tuesday, despite his detention by the International Criminal Court. The Davao election board proclaimed Duterte won the race for Davao mayor, with the official tally showing that he garnered over 660,000 votes, or eight times as many as his closest rival. Elated supporters chanted "Duterte, Duterte" when the result was announced. His youngest son, Sebastian, the incumbent mayor of Davao, was declared Davao vice mayor.</p>
