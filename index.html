          <p>The U.S. Treasury is reportedly considering a new one-dollar coin for the nation's 250th anniversary, potentially featuring an image of President Donald Trump. A draft design includes Trump's face and a depiction of him after a 2014 incident, with the phrase "Fight, Fight, Fight." While a 2020 law allows commemorative coins, legal provisions typically prohibit living persons, especially sitting presidents, from appearing on currency, though Congress could make an exception. The Treasury expects to share more details soon on this controversial proposal.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to significant parts of President Trump's Gaza ceasefire proposal, including the release of all hostages. While the group seeks further negotiations on other elements, such as decommissioning weapons, Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu had already accepted the deal. Trump, who had issued an ultimatum, now urges Israel to halt bombing in Gaza to facilitate safe hostage release, signaling a potential breakthrough in the protracted conflict. The proposal also involves Hamas handing over Gaza administration to a technocratic Palestinian body.</p>

          <p>Following Sean "Diddy" Combs' sentencing to over four years for prostitution-related offenses, his lawyers announced plans to appeal, arguing the judge acted as a "13th juror." They contend the judge unfairly considered conduct for which Combs was acquitted, specifically sex trafficking and RICO counts, despite the jury's not-guilty verdict on those charges. The defense maintains that Combs is a "changed man" and has taken responsibility for domestic violence, but disputes the lengthy sentence given the acquittals and the potential for rehabilitation. The appeal will focus on the judge's alleged inconsistency with the jury's findings.</p>

          <p>Republicans allege California is using a "provider tax" loophole in Medicaid to draw federal funds, which are then pooled to cover healthcare costs for undocumented immigrants, a claim Democrats deny. The White House memo suggests Democrats want to repeal Trump reforms aimed at closing this alleged backdoor. While California officials insist this is false, the lack of specific state records on how provider tax funds are spent makes definitive determination difficult.

          <p>Scientists are making significant progress in biocomputing, aiming to create computers powered by living human cells. Researchers in Switzerland are developing "wetware" by culturing stem cells into brain organoids, which are then connected to electrodes to process simple commands. This technology holds potential for energy-efficient AI learning and disease modeling, though challenges like sustaining organoid life and understanding their complex responses remain. While not intended to replace silicon, biocomputing could complement existing AI and advance neurological drug development.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has cleared the way for the Trump administration to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 300,000 Venezuelan migrants, reversing a lower court's decision. This ruling allows the administration to proceed with rolling back protections that permitted Venezuelans to live and work in the U.S. without fear of immediate deportation. Critics, including dissenting justices, condemned the decision as a misuse of emergency powers, arguing it will disrupt hundreds of thousands of lives and send individuals back to unsafe conditions. The Department of Homeland Security, however, hailed it as a "win for the American people and commonsense," asserting TPS was always meant to be temporary.</p>

Constitutional scholars have widely criticized Trump's attempt to outlaw this form of expression, emphasizing the president's lack of authority to override established constitutional protections.

This surge is attributed to carmaker discounts, a wider model choice, and the government's £3,750 grant scheme designed to encourage the switch from petrol and diesel.

However, the long-term impact on tourism remains uncertain, with a potential fall in visitor numbers still possible if the situation escalates.</p>

          <p>Bowling Green State University's new football mascot, Pudge, a 3-year-old Persian cat, has become an unexpected sensation, drawing thousands of fans to home games. Owned by the team's long snapper, George Carlson, Pudge initially joined the locker room to boost morale after a wave of injuries. Carlson credits Pudge with helping him cope with the loss of his mother, highlighting the cat's therapeutic presence. Home game attendance has surged by almost 60%, making Bowling Green the top NCAA Division I team for attendance increase, largely attributed to Pudge's unique appeal.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani is set to start Game 1 of the National League Division Series for the Dodgers against the Philadelphia Phillies, notably without the pitching restrictions he faced earlier in the season. This marks a significant step in his return from a second Tommy John surgery, allowing him to pitch like a "regular pitcher" for potentially six or seven innings. Ohtani's dominant five no-hit innings against the Phillies in September, where he utilized his full arsenal, signaled his readiness. This postseason debut is a highly anticipated moment for the two-way star and the team.</p>

          <p>Apple and Google removed apps, including "ICEBlock," designed to alert users to nearby immigration agents, after pressure from Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Trump administration. Critics argue this action exemplifies the administration's sway over Silicon Valley and constitutes "jawboning," or government censorship through intimidation. Legal experts, like Kate Ruane, contend that tech companies capitulating to such demands erodes First Amendment protections and sets a dangerous precedent. The incident highlights Apple CEO Tim Cook's efforts to ingratiate himself with Trump amidst aggressive tariff policies, with the administration having previously exempted iPhones from tariffs.</p>

          <p>A CBS News/YouGov poll reveals a strong consensus among Americans, across all political affiliations, that political violence is unacceptable. Despite this, a majority anticipate an increase in such violence in the coming years, reflecting widespread apprehension.

Furthermore, fewer than half of Americans feel comfortable expressing political views publicly, fearing negative outcomes like insults, threats, or employment problems, underscoring a decline in civility and open dialogue.</p>

Roske, who traveled from California with weapons and a detailed plan, called 911 on herself before the attack, expressing suicidal thoughts and her intent to kill Kavanaugh. Prosecutors had sought a 30-year sentence, calling her actions "terrorism" aimed at altering the constitutional order, particularly after the abortion rights leak.

          <p>California lawmakers and LA County officials are demanding an audit of the historic $4-billion sex abuse settlement and a State Bar investigation into Downtown LA Law Group (DTLA). This follows reports that some plaintiffs were allegedly paid by vendors to sue the county, with some claiming they were instructed to fabricate allegations. The allegations, which DTLA denies, raise serious concerns about "capping" (illegally soliciting clients) and the integrity of the justice system, particularly for genuine survivors. The settlement, enabled by a 2020 law change, has also strained county finances.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly authorized drone attacks on two Gaza-bound humanitarian aid vessels off Tunisia last month, according to American intelligence officials. Drones allegedly dropped incendiary devices, causing fires on the Portuguese-flagged "Family" and British-flagged "Alma," though no one was killed or injured. This action, if confirmed, would violate international humanitarian law prohibiting incendiary weapons against civilian objects. The Global Sumud Flotilla, which organized the initiative to break Israel's Gaza blockade, condemned the attacks as reckless and called for independent investigations, while the U.S. State Department called the flotilla a "provocation."</p>

Amazon spokesperson Griffin Buch confirmed the closures, stating the company regularly evaluates its store portfolio and will assist affected employees in finding new roles.

This compromise, a rare agreement between labor and tech, grants significant collective bargaining rights by exempting drivers from antitrust laws that typically prohibit such actions. In return, Uber and Lyft will benefit from reduced insurance requirements, potentially saving them millions. The law outlines a process for drivers to form unions and negotiate on issues like pay and working conditions, though some advocates worry about its ultimate strength.</p>
