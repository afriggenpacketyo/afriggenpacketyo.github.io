          <p>An op-ed argues that President Trump's new tariff regime, triggered by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, is unlikely to succeed due to the federal government's lack of resources and preparation.

          <p>Alberto Lovo Rojas, an asylum seeker from Nicaragua with a legal work permit, was arrested by ICE despite complying with regular check-in requirements. Rojas, who fled Nicaragua due to political persecution, had been living in Spokane, Washington, with his family and working as a mechanic. His arrest highlights the Trump administration's intensified deportation efforts, which prioritize the removal of all immigrants without legal status, regardless of their compliance with authorities or lack of criminal history. Supporters are rallying to provide legal assistance and support for his family.</p>

          <p>Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering a UnitedHealthcare CEO, faces the death penalty, deepening the cultural significance of the case beyond a typical slaying. Attorney General Pam Bondi cited Trump's agenda to stop violent crime as justification. Veteran defense attorneys say this means Mangione's legal team must present context, potentially de-emphasizing guilt and focusing on fighting the death penalty. The defense may point to Mangione's lack of criminal history and present mitigating factors to sway the jury. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that over half of millennials are working multiple jobs to supplement their income, driven by factors like inflation and stagnant wages. The trend, known as "polyworking," allows individuals to add to savings, pursue personal interests, and gain skills for career advancement. While some critics express concern about the long-term effects on work-life balance, others view it as a form of entrepreneurism and a way to hedge against unemployment. This shift reflects a new reality in the workplace, where traditional employment models are evolving to meet the economic challenges faced by younger generations.</p>

          <p>China's upgrades to Cambodia's Ream Naval Base are part of a strategic plan to diversify regional maritime access and de-risk supply chains, according to analysts. The upgrades include a joint logistics and training center and a pier capable of handling large warships. While China claims the facility is for regional cooperation and counterterrorism, the US has expressed concerns about potential exclusive PLA access to the site.

          <p>A journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg from The Atlantic, was mistakenly added to a White House Signal group chat discussing plans for US strikes in Yemen due to a series of compounding errors. National security adviser Mike Waltz had inadvertently saved Goldberg's number under the contact information for a Trump spokesperson. The White House authorized the use of Signal due to the lack of a real-time cross-agency text platform.
