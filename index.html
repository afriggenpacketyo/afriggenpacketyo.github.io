          <p>Joey Chestnut has once again won the Nathan's Famous Fourth of July hot dog eating contest, reclaiming his title after being banned the previous year over a sponsorship dispute. The article portrays Chestnut as an elite athlete, detailing his rigorous training regimen which includes neck exercises, yoga, and breathing techniques to enhance his performance. It reflects on the bizarre yet compelling nature of the event, framing it as a spectacle of American excess and competitive will. The piece positions the contest as a raw expression of cultural themes like abundance and freedom, albeit taken to a grotesque extreme.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Paris has officially opened designated zones in the Seine River for public swimming, a legacy project from the 2024 Olympics. The ban, instated in 1923 due to severe pollution, was lifted after a massive €1.4 billion cleanup effort improved water quality. Three supervised swimming areas, complete with amenities like changing rooms and lifeguards, are now available for free public use. This initiative, championed by city officials, aims to enhance the quality of life for Parisians and adapt the city to climate change, transforming a long-held dream into reality.</p>

In response, the Church in Wales has acknowledged the inappropriate use of alcohol and is implementing new policies, while calling for further reviews of the diocese.</p>

          <p>The 90-day pause on a sweeping set of tariffs proposed by the Trump administration is nearing its end, creating uncertainty for global markets and businesses. The administration had claimed it could secure 90 trade deals in this period, but few have materialized. While some partial agreements have been reached with countries like the UK and China, the prospect of steep new tariffs on many other nations looms.

          <p>Scientists in China have made a significant breakthrough in regenerative medicine by successfully restoring damaged ear tissue in mice. They achieved this by identifying and reactivating a "genetic switch" that produces retinoic acid, a key compound for tissue development that is normally dormant in adult mice. The research, published in the journal Science, resulted in the complete regeneration of lost tissues, including cartilage. While human application is still a distant goal, the discovery offers hope that similar regenerative pathways might exist for other organs, opening new avenues for future medical treatments.</p>

This reflects the DPP's broader political stance of emphasizing a distinct Taiwanese identity separate from the mainland.

The piece suggests this is an ironic turn of history, as the U.S. propped up many of these repressive regimes as anti-communist allies.

          <p>The iconic Britpop band Oasis performed their first concert together in 16 years, kicking off a highly anticipated reunion tour in Cardiff, Wales. Brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher, whose acrimonious split in 2009 ended the band, took the stage before a sold-out stadium of ecstatic fans. The show featured a setlist packed with their classic 1990s hits like "Wonderwall" and "Live Forever," sparking massive sing-alongs. While the famously feuding siblings kept some distance on stage, the performance was powerful and well-received, marking a momentous occasion for a generation of music fans.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was awarded the Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, the Caribbean nation's highest civilian honor, making him the first foreign leader to receive it. The award was presented during Modi's two-day visit aimed at strengthening diplomatic and economic ties. The relationship between the two countries is rooted in the 19th-century migration of indentured Indian laborers. During the visit, leaders announced new strategic partnerships and Modi expanded eligibility for Overseas Citizen of India cards to more people of Indian descent.</p>

          <h2>Trump Falsely Claims China Does Not Use Wind Farms, Prompting Online Fact-Checks</h2>

          <p>During a renewed attack on renewable energy, President Donald Trump made the false claim that China does not have wind farms, stating, "I have never seen a wind farm in China." The comment was quickly fact-checked on social media, with users pointing out that China is the world's leading producer of wind energy by a large margin. The statement came as Trump's administration is moving to eliminate tax credits for wind and solar power, a move that critics, including trade unions and analysts, warn could devastate the American renewable energy industry and sacrifice thousands of jobs.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers to Maintain Trade Deadline Strategy Despite Max Muncy's Knee Injury</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers do not plan to alter their trade deadline strategy despite an injury to third baseman Max Muncy. Muncy suffered a bone bruise in his knee during a collision and is expected to miss about six weeks, a more optimistic prognosis than initially feared. The team's management expressed relief that the injury was not season-ending and believes he will have sufficient time to return before the playoffs. For now, the Dodgers will rely on internal options like Tommy Edman to cover third base, rather than urgently seeking an external replacement on the trade market.</p>

          <p>New York City officials temporarily closed a section of beach in the Rockaways, Queens, on the Fourth of July after multiple sharks were spotted swimming very close to the shore. Drones operated by the city's emergency management agency confirmed the sightings, leading to a brief closure to ensure public safety. This incident occurred just days after New York's governor announced enhanced shark surveillance measures for Long Island beaches ahead of the holiday weekend. Authorities are using drone technology and lifeguard patrols to monitor the waters and keep beachgoers safe from potential encounters.</p>

          <p>As the United States targets China's dominance in the shipbuilding industry, competitors South Korea and Japan are stepping up efforts to support their own sectors. South Korea's new presidential administration has labeled its industry as being in "major crisis" and has outlined a new growth policy to reclaim its position as a global leader. The strategy focuses on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through improved technology and training. This move signals a potential shift in the global shipbuilding landscape, driven by both economic competition and geopolitical strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has denied an emergency request to stop the deportation of eight immigrants to South Sudan, allowing the Trump administration to proceed with their removal. Lawyers for the men had argued they would face perilous conditions in the war-torn country, where the U.S. government advises against travel. The men, who are from various countries and have all been convicted of serious crimes, were flown to Djibouti while their case was litigated. The ruling marks a development in a legal battle over the administration's aggressive deportation policies and their humanitarian implications.</p>

          <p>A protest in Mexico City against mass tourism and gentrification turned violent, with some demonstrators smashing storefronts and harassing foreigners in popular neighborhoods like Condesa and Roma. The march, which began peacefully, was organized by locals who feel pushed out by soaring rents driven by an influx of "digital nomads," primarily from the United States. Protesters carried signs reading "gringos, stop stealing our home" and demanded stricter housing and tourism regulations. The event highlights the growing tensions in the capital city over the social and economic impacts of its increasing popularity.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed his signature tax and spending legislation into law during a Fourth of July event at the White House. Dubbed the "big, beautiful bill" by the president, the law introduces significant tax cuts, increases defense spending, and provides more aggressive funding for immigration enforcement. The administration claims these measures will stimulate economic growth. However, the bill has been met with strong opposition from Democrats, who argue that it disproportionately benefits the wealthy while harming low-income earners, calling its passage a "dark day."
