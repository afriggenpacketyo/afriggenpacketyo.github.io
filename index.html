If won, the jackpot would have an estimated cash value of $770.3 million before taxes. This upcoming windfall could become the third-largest in U.S. lottery history, trailing only the $2.04 billion and $1.765 billion Powerball jackpots from 2022 and 2023, respectively. The odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 292.2 million, and tickets are sold in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. (not investment advice)</p>

Meanwhile, South Korea's Kospi also traded higher, but Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reversed course and fell, and mainland China's CSI 300 retreated amid volatile trading.

          <p>Shares of Nidec Corp experienced a significant drop after the company announced an investigation into allegations of improper accounting within its group. The probe was initiated after an internal review of its Chinese subsidiary, Nidec Techno Motor, revealed evidence suggesting malpractice linked to its management. This announcement follows a previous delay in submitting its financial report due to potentially erroneous declarations regarding the origin of certain motors, which could have resulted in unpaid import tariffs. Nidec, a major manufacturer of motors used in various devices, has seen its shares decline this year, contrasting with the Nikkei 225 index's rise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>France is facing increased scrutiny over its fiscal outlook, with economists drawing unfavorable comparisons to Italy due to political infighting and unresolved budget issues. France's debt and deficit figures are raising concerns, particularly as Prime Minister Francois Bayrou calls for a confidence vote on a contentious 2026 budget. The political instability and potential government collapse are creating unease in financial markets, with France's 30-year bond yield rising to levels not seen since 2008. This comes as France's neighbors are watching closely as Bayrou seeks a budget compromise with rival parties. (not investment advice)</p>

Supporters claim it protects women and fetuses, while opponents view it as an attempt to intimidate providers and encourage vigilantism. The bill is expected to face legal challenges if it becomes law, setting up a potential battle over abortion access across state lines.</p>
