          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has reported the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels, a method that avoids open-skull surgery. This minimally invasive technique successfully allowed a 67-year-old paralyzed patient to regain some limb movement, positioning it as a potential alternative to more invasive procedures like those developed by Elon Musk's Neuralink. The procedure involves inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vascular network via a neck vein, which reportedly reduces surgical risks and significantly shortens patient recovery time. This development marks a notable advancement in neurotechnology, highlighting a different approach to connecting human brains with computers.</p>

          <p>A Shandong Airlines flight traveling from Qingdao to Shanghai was forced to execute an emergency landing in Nanjing due to an aircraft malfunction. Passengers aboard flight SC4667 reported hearing loud bangs and smelling a burning odor, with one witness suggesting an object may have been ingested by the plane's left engine. Despite the frightening experience, which included several minutes of shaking, the crew handled the situation effectively, and the captain announced the diversion to Nanjing. The landing was conducted smoothly, and no injuries were reported. The airline confirmed the incident, stating all passengers were safely accommodated and another aircraft was dispatched to complete the journey.</p>

          <p>U.S. federal prosecutors have charged 11 people in connection with a massive, Russia-based scheme that attempted to defraud the Medicare program of $10.6 billion. The transnational criminal organization allegedly stole the personal information of over a million Medicare recipients to submit fraudulent claims for expensive medical equipment that was never provided. The group purchased dozens of legitimate medical equipment companies to facilitate the fraud, ultimately receiving approximately $41 million from Medicare and an estimated $900 million from supplemental insurers between 2022 and 2024. The scheme, allegedly led from Russia, laundered its proceeds through international shell companies and cryptocurrency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese and U.S. officials have agreed to continue negotiations over tariffs, though significant disagreements persist, particularly concerning the American automotive industry. The talks in Washington occurred as a 90-day pause on U.S. reciprocal tariffs, which would add a 14% duty on Japanese goods, is set to expire in early July. President Trump has indicated the pause could be extended but also expressed a desire to simply impose the tariffs. Japan is especially concerned about a separate, pre-existing 25 percentage point tariff hike on imported passenger vehicles, which has already severely impacted its auto industry. The outcome of the talks remains uncertain, with both sides reaffirming their positions. (not investment advice)</p>

Starting pitcher Dustin May struggled, lasting only four innings, but the bullpen delivered five scoreless frames to secure the win. The victory came down to a tense ninth inning, where closer Tanner Scott induced a game-ending double play with the bases loaded, showcasing the team's ability to win even when not at their peak.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Supreme Court ruling has affirmed the right of parents to opt their children out of public school lessons that conflict with their religious beliefs, specifically concerning the reading of LGBTQ+ themed storybooks. The 6-3 decision stemmed from a lawsuit in Montgomery County, Maryland, where parents objected to a curriculum that included nine specific picture books aimed at representing LGBTQ+ families. These books, such as "Uncle Bobbyâ€™s Wedding" and "Born Ready," became central to the legal arguments. The court's majority opinion, written by Justice Alito, stated schools must provide advance notification, while the dissent, from Justice Sotomayor, argued the ruling fails to accept the existence of LGBTQ+ people in society.</p>

          <p>This article presents a critical analysis of long-standing U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, arguing that its primary objective has been to ensure Israel's military and technological dominance in the region. Citing an alleged conversation with a U.S. senator, the author claims the American strategy was not merely regime change in countries like Iraq but to reduce any regional power's military capabilities to a 'pre-industrial' level to prevent them from matching Israel. This neoconservative-driven agenda, the article contends, became official U.S. policy following the September 11 attacks. The piece frames recent and past conflicts as part of this broader, decades-long quest and examines the resulting instability and cycle of violence.</p>

Weiss faces separate criminal charges for allegedly hacking into the accounts of over 2,000 college athletes to find intimate photos.

          <p>Canadian businesses are facing significant challenges and uncertainty due to the shifting tariff landscape imposed by the Trump administration. The tit-for-tat trade war has hit Canada's economy, which is heavily reliant on exports to the U.S., causing a slowdown in the first quarter of 2025. Business owners express frustration over the inability to plan for the future, describing the constant policy changes as 'killer' for small businesses. While intense negotiations for a new trade deal are underway, President Trump recently terminated discussions over Canada's digital services tax, further heightening economic anxiety.

While the court did not rule on the order's constitutionality, its decision allows the administration to begin planning, though a 30-day grace period means no immediate change. Federal courts must now narrow existing injunctions to apply only to the specific plaintiffs, potentially allowing the policy to take effect in 28 states that have not sued.

          <p>A new study from Tulane University reveals that parts of New Orleans' concrete flood wall system, reinforced after Hurricane Katrina, are sinking at an alarming rate, in some areas up to nearly two inches per year. This rate of subsidence is faster than sea-level rise, potentially degrading the city's flood protection. Using satellite radar data, researchers identified sinking hotspots around industrial sites, the airport, and newer residential developments, likely due to soil compression and groundwater withdrawal. The findings serve as a wake-up call for the need for ongoing monitoring and maintenance to protect the low-lying city, with some wetlands at risk of becoming open water within a decade if trends continue.</p>

          <p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has sharply criticized a new aid distribution system in Gaza, labeling it "inherently unsafe" and stating that the search for food must never be a "death sentence." The system, operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) and backed by Israel and the U.S., bypasses the UN. According to the UN, over 400 Palestinians have been killed while trying to get food from GHF sites, an assertion the GHF denies. Guterres emphasized that UN-led humanitarian efforts are being strangled and that Israel is obligated to facilitate safe aid delivery throughout the territory, calling for the political courage to enact a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The first meeting of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) since its members were replaced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has drawn sharp criticism. The article describes a spectacle where new members, including noted COVID contrarians and individuals with ties to anti-vaccine organizations, questioned established vaccine science and safety data. The new chair, Martin Kulldorff, and other appointees floated unproven hypotheses about vaccine harms, while CDC staff attempted to respond with evidence-based information. Critics described the proceedings as a shift from scientific assessment to decision-making based on 'feelings and preferences,' signaling a radical change in U.S. vaccination policy.</p>

          <p>In a major 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has limited the power of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which have been used to block policies from both Republican and Democratic administrations. The ruling came in a case concerning President Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship. While not ruling on the constitutionality of the order itself, the court stated that such universal orders likely exceed the authority granted to federal courts. The decision narrows the scope of injunctions blocking the birthright citizenship policy, but allows legal challenges to continue. Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote the majority opinion, while Justice Sonia Sotomayor's dissent warned the ruling abdicates the court's role in protecting the rule of law.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned that a Republican budget bill in the U.S. Senate could cause as many as 3.4 million Californians to lose their Medi-Cal health insurance. Newsom described the proposed cuts as 'devastating' and 'cruel,' stating they could force rural hospital closures and drive up insurance premiums. The bill includes a provision requiring many Medicaid recipients to prove they work, volunteer, or attend school for at least 80 hours a month, a measure the nonpartisan CBO estimates would leave 4.8 million Americans uninsured. Newsom argued these work verification requirements would create a bureaucratic labyrinth, disproportionately affecting those who are eligible but struggle with documentation.</p>

          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security has found that working-age individuals who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet exhibit lower rates of depressive symptoms. The research assessed a diet rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, cooked vegetables, and green tea among nearly 12,500 employees. While 30.9% of the cohort showed depressive symptoms, those adhering to the Japanese diet were less likely to do so, even after accounting for other potential factors. The institute suggests that nutrients like folic acid in vegetables and omega-3 fatty acids in fish may contribute to improved mental well-being by aiding neurotransmitter release and reducing inflammation.</p>

The decision curtails a legal tool that has been used to stymie executive actions from both parties.

This marks the latest in a series of legal defeats for the administration's campaign to punish law firms for representing clients or causes the president opposes.

          <p>The UK's Labour government has executed a major U-turn on its planned welfare reforms, raising significant questions about its long-term economic strategy and credibility. The plan, which aimed to save billions by tightening eligibility for disability payments, was reversed to avoid a large-scale rebellion from within the party. This decision leaves a multi-billion pound hole in the Chancellor's budget, which may need to be filled with tax rises or other spending cuts. Critics argue the initial plan was a hasty cost-cutting exercise rather than a genuine reform to address the rising number of people out of work due to ill health. (not investment advice)</p>
