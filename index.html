          <p>Authorities in Washington state have found human remains they believe belong to Travis Decker, a fugitive accused of murdering his three young daughters in May. The remains were discovered in a remote wooded area near Leavenworth, not far from where the girls' bodies were found. Decker, a former soldier with survival skills, had been the subject of a massive manhunt since the killings. DNA analysis is pending to confirm the identity, but preliminary findings point to Decker, potentially bringing a conclusion to the tragic case.</p>

          <p>The United States has used its veto power for the sixth time to block a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza. The U.S. envoy argued the draft did not sufficiently condemn Hamas or recognize Israel's right to self-defense. All other 14 council members voted in favor of the resolution, which highlighted the "catastrophic" humanitarian situation. The decision underscores the growing international isolation of the U.S. and Israel on this issue as the conflict continues.</p>

          <p>An Eritrean man has become the second migrant to be removed from the UK to France under a new "one in, one out" pilot scheme, following a failed last-minute legal challenge. The policy, agreed upon by both nations, aims to deter small boat crossings by returning one migrant to France in exchange for accepting another with a strong asylum case in the UK. The man's lawyers had argued he was a potential trafficking victim, but a judge ruled there was significant public interest in his removal.</p>

          <p>Following the suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel by ABC, former President Donald Trump suggested that television networks critical of him should potentially have their broadcast licenses revoked. Trump's comments came after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), led by a Trump appointee, threatened regulatory action against ABC over Kimmel's remarks linking the killer of a conservative influencer to Trump supporters. The situation has intensified concerns about the administration's use of regulatory power to curtail free speech and pressure media outlets.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protestors, including members of the Writers Guild of America, gathered outside Walt Disney's headquarters in Burbank, California, to protest the suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!". Demonstrators condemned the decision by Disney-owned ABC as an act of "corporate cowardice" and a capitulation to pressure from the Trump administration. The protests in California and New York reflect growing public backlash against what many perceive as a government-led attack on free speech, with calls for Kimmel's immediate reinstatement.</p>

          <p>While official details remain undisclosed, China's CJ-1000 missile is being discussed as a potential game-changer in aerial warfare. Described during a military parade as a hypersonic "plane-killing" weapon, it would represent a significant technological advancement if its capabilities are confirmed. Such a missile would be the first of its kind, capable of targeting aircraft at hypersonic speeds, thereby altering the strategic balance of air combat. However, without official test results, its actual performance and operational status are still a matter of analysis.</p>

          <p>In a rare show of unity, several major late-night talk show hosts responded to the suspension of ABC's Jimmy Kimmel with coordinated satirical segments targeting the Trump administration. Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart, Jimmy Fallon, and Seth Meyers all used their Thursday shows to defend free speech and mock what they portrayed as an authoritarian crackdown on comedy. The hosts employed parody, sarcastically praising the president as a "dear leader" and feigning compliance, to condemn the pressure that led to Kimmel's removal from the air.</p>

          <p>The death of Demartravion "Trey" Reed, a 21-year-old Black student found hanging from a tree on the Delta State University campus, has been officially ruled a suicide following an autopsy. The Mississippi State Medical Examiner's findings were consistent with the initial police investigation, which stated there was no evidence of foul play. The incident had raised significant community concern and evoked painful historical memories of racial violence in the state, prompting the university president to acknowledge the emotional impact and the FBI to monitor the case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that Western media often misinterprets China's diplomatic efforts, such as the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, by focusing on superficial pageantry rather than substance. The author contends that the real story is China's pragmatic engagement and its ability to create a space where neighboring countries feel secure and heard without being forced to choose sides in global power struggles. The attendance of leaders like India's Narendra Modi signals a commitment to cooperation, highlighting a realignment of partnerships across Asia.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced the decertification of the Life Alliance Organ Recovery Agency, part of the University of Miami Health System, citing a history of patient safety failures and violations. The move is part of a broader Trump administration effort to reform the nation's organ transplant system and restore public trust, which has been damaged by reports of procedural errors. Kennedy stated the action serves as a warning to other organizations and is accompanied by reforms to the national transplant network.</p>

          <h2>Review Finds Sanctions for UK Doctors in Sexual Misconduct Cases Are Often Too Lenient</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the UK's Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) suggests that sanctions in nearly a quarter of sexual misconduct cases are too lenient, failing victims and public trust. The analysis of 46 cases, which included offenses of sexual harassment and sexual assault, found that some doctors received temporary suspensions when the General Medical Council had recommended they be struck off the medical register. The report criticized inconsistent sanctions and a lack of support for victims, prompting calls for significant reform.</p>

          <p>According to a BBC political analysis, the UK government and Prime Minister Keir Starmer's team are feeling both delighted and relieved after successfully hosting former U.S. President Donald Trump for a state visit. Despite differing political styles and stances on issues like Palestinian statehood, the visit was managed without major public confrontations. The analysis suggests that while Trump's tendency to comment on internal UK politics persists, his hosts have become more adept at navigating his unpredictable nature, allowing for valuable diplomatic engagement.</p>
