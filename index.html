          <p>China's state media reported that a J-16 fighter jet successfully detected and expelled two foreign fifth-generation stealth aircraft, believed to be US F-22s. Military analysts attribute this success not to the jet's standalone capabilities but to the People's Liberation Army's integrated combat system, which combines data from satellites, early warning aircraft, and anti-stealth radars. The incident is being presented as a demonstration of China's advanced, networked defense capabilities in countering sophisticated stealth technology amid ongoing regional tensions.</p>

          <p>The vast peatlands of Canada's Hudson Bay, which store five times more carbon per acre than the Amazon rainforest, are facing a significant threat from mining. These unique ecosystems, crucial for regulating the global climate, sit atop mineral deposits like nickel and chromium that are essential for clean energy technologies such as electric vehicle batteries. This situation creates a profound environmental conflict, as extracting the minerals required for the green transition could destroy one of the planet's most effective natural carbon sinks.</p>

          <p>The first debate for New York City mayor featured intense confrontations between Democrat Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. The candidates clashed over crime, affordability, and their political ideologies, with Cuomo attempting to frame Mamdani as an inexperienced socialist. The influence of President Trump was a recurring theme, as was the contentious issue of Israel's status as a Jewish state, highlighting the deep divisions among the contenders in the race to lead the city.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is scheduled to meet President Trump in Washington to advocate for advanced Tomahawk missiles. The visit is set against the backdrop of a recent phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which they agreed to meet in Hungary to discuss ending the war. Zelensky noted that Moscow seems more eager for dialogue whenever the possibility of Ukraine receiving long-range weapons is raised, highlighting the high-stakes diplomacy at play.</p>

          <p>The UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has ruled that the BBC committed a "serious breach" of broadcasting standards with its documentary "Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone." The investigation found the program was "materially misleading" because it failed to disclose that the narrator was the son of a Hamas official. Ofcom stated this omission deprived the audience of critical context and has ordered the BBC to broadcast a prime-time statement about the finding, which the corporation has accepted.</p>

          <p>Following weeks of youth-led protests over severe power and water shortages that forced his predecessor to flee, Colonel Michael Randrianirina has been sworn in as the new president of Madagascar. The military has dissolved most government institutions and announced that a military-led committee will rule for up to two years before new elections are held. The African Union and the United Nations have condemned the undemocratic takeover in the island nation.</p>

          <p>Scientists on an expedition in Indonesia have confirmed the first official sighting of a Malaysian giant turtle in the region after a local fisherman inadvertently caught one in a trap. The turtle, which is the largest freshwater species in Southeast Asia, is critically endangered due to habitat destruction and being caught as bycatch in fisheries. After being carefully examined and photographed by the research team, the rare creature was safely released back into its natural habitat.</p>

          <p>Goaltender Carter Hart is returning to the NHL on a tryout contract with the Vegas Golden Knights after being acquitted of sexual assault charges stemming from a 2018 incident involving former World Junior teammates. The article argues that his swift return exemplifies a pattern in hockey culture where redemption is granted without a true reckoning with systemic issues like hazing and abuse. It highlights a persistent "code of silence" that protects the sport's ecosystem at the expense of accountability.</p>

Micron is expected to continue selling chips to Chinese customers in the less sensitive automotive and smartphone sectors, as well as to firms with data centers outside of China.</p>
