          <p>Amazon's Prime Air delivery service is under federal investigation by the FAA and NTSB following an incident in Tolleson, Arizona. Two of the company's MK30 delivery drones collided with a stationary construction crane while returning to a nearby warehouse. Both drones sustained significant damage, and one person on the ground was evaluated for possible smoke inhalation. This event marks another setback for Amazon's long-standing ambition to establish a large-scale drone delivery network, following previous crashes that also prompted regulatory scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A low-speed collision involving two Delta Connection aircraft occurred on a taxiway at New York's LaGuardia Airport. The incident happened when an arriving flight, taxiing to its gate, struck a stationary flight awaiting departure, causing damage to both planes. One flight attendant sustained a minor injury and was transported to a hospital, but no passengers were seriously harmed. The FAA and NTSB have launched investigations into the collision to determine the cause of the ground incident.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown directly affects hundreds of thousands of federal employees and various public services. While "excepted" workers in roles deemed essential for life and property protection must continue to work without pay, a large percentage of staff in agencies like the EPA and the Department of Education are furloughed. Under a 2019 law, all federal employees will eventually receive back pay once the shutdown ends. However, government contractors are not guaranteed compensation for lost work, creating significant financial uncertainty for many.</p>

          <p>Morocco is experiencing a wave of youth-led protests organized by an anonymous online collective known as GenZ 212. The demonstrations, which began in Rabat and have spread to other major cities, call for improved health and education services and criticize government spending on large-scale projects like World Cup stadiums while public services remain underfunded. The protests recently turned violent, leading to hundreds of arrests and several reported deaths. In response, the Moroccan government has adopted a more conciliatory tone, acknowledging the legitimacy of the demands and promising dialogue.</p>

          <p>The director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Todd Arrington, has resigned under pressure following a disagreement with the Trump administration. The dispute centered on a request to give an original Eisenhower sword from the library's collection to King Charles III as a state gift. Arrington resisted giving away a historical artifact belonging to the American people, offering to help find a replica instead, which ultimately came from West Point. Arrington stated he was told to "resign — or be fired," believing he was no longer trusted with confidential information.</p>

          <p>The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA) has identified the remains of U.S. Navy Fireman 1st Class Edward D. Bowden, who was killed during the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. Bowden, 29, was serving aboard the USS California when it was sunk, resulting in the deaths of over 100 crew members. His remains were among those deemed unidentifiable for decades but were successfully identified using modern dental, anthropological, and DNA analysis after being exhumed in 2018.

          <p>Researchers at UCLA have found that a new treatment strategy significantly delays disease progression for men with recurrent prostate cancer. The study, presented at the ASTRO annual meeting, combined standard radiation therapy with a PSMA-targeted radioactive drug. Patients who received the combination therapy remained disease-free for a median of nearly 18 months, compared to about seven months for those who received radiation alone. This approach could offer a significant benefit by delaying the need for hormone therapy, which often comes with challenging side effects for patients.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals AI Can Redesign Dangerous DNA to Evade Biosecurity Screening</h2>

          <p>A new study has demonstrated that artificial intelligence can be used to create designs for hazardous biological materials that bypass current biosecurity measures. Researchers used AI protein-design tools to generate thousands of variants of toxic proteins with altered DNA codes that were not flagged by screening systems used by DNA synthesis companies. While a software fix was quickly developed, it is not yet perfect, highlighting a significant vulnerability. The findings underscore growing concerns about the potential misuse of advanced AI in creating novel biothreats, prompting debates on responsible information sharing in science.</p>

          <h2>Research Shows a Sharp Increase in the Financial Cost of Wildfires Over the Past Decade</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that the economic damage caused by wildfires has accelerated dramatically, with a significant spike in costs occurring in the last ten years. Researchers analyzed global fire loss data and found that 43% of the 200 most costly fires on record have happened since 2015. The study attributes this surge to human-driven factors, particularly rising average temperatures and long-term drought, which create extreme fire weather conditions. This trend is placing greater strain on financial systems, increasing insurance costs, and highlighting the escalating economic impact of climate change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla announced it delivered 497,099 vehicles in the third quarter, a 7% increase compared to the same period last year. The rise in deliveries was partly driven by U.S. buyers rushing to purchase electric vehicles before a key federal tax credit expired at the end of the quarter. Despite the year-over-year increase in deliveries, vehicle production for the quarter saw a slight decline. The company's performance was hampered by a sales slump in Europe but offset by strong demand in the U.S. ahead of the policy change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The captain of an oil tanker suspected of being part of Russia's "shadow fleet" has been charged in France for refusing to comply with naval orders. The vessel, the Boracay, was boarded by the French navy as it was subject to EU sanctions for carrying Russian oil exports, a measure imposed after the invasion of Ukraine. Russia has allegedly built a fleet of hundreds of such tankers with obscured ownership to evade international sanctions. The captain, a Chinese national, was unable to provide a coherent explanation for the flag the ship was flying.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's vehicle sales saw a significant rebound last quarter, rising 7% year-over-year, largely due to customers rushing to utilize a $7,500 federal tax credit for new electric vehicles before it was eliminated. This marks the company's first year-over-year sales increase in three quarters, following a period of decline attributed to market saturation and brand damage from CEO Elon Musk's political activities. While the sales boost provides a positive sign, analysts caution it may be a temporary "sugar rush" driven by the expiring credit rather than a structural turnaround. (not investment advice)</p>

However, this decline in approval for Trump has not translated into significant gains for the Democratic party.
