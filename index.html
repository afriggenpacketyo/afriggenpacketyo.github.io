          <p>A Paris court has found former French President Nicolas Sarkozy guilty of criminal conspiracy in a high-profile campaign financing trial, sentencing him to five years in prison. The case revolved around accusations that he accepted illegal campaign contributions from the late Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. While convicted of conspiracy, Sarkozy was cleared of corruption charges. The prosecution's case was built on testimonies and evidence suggesting a quid pro quo to rehabilitate Gadhafi's international image. Sarkozy, who maintains his innocence, can appeal the verdict, which would suspend the sentence until the appeal process is concluded.</p>

          <p>The Israel-Premier Tech cycling team is facing significant pressure from its title sponsor, Premier Tech, to remove "Israel" from its name due to disruptions from pro-Palestinian protesters during the Vuelta a España. The Canadian sponsor stated the "current situation is no longer sustainable," and a key bike manufacturer has echoed these concerns, threatening to end its association without a name and flag change. The Israeli-registered team, owned by billionaire Sylvan Adams, has been a target of protests over Israel's military actions in Gaza. The situation highlights the growing intersection of geopolitical conflicts and professional sports, affecting athletes and team operations.</p>

          <p>Decades after France concluded 193 nuclear tests in French Polynesia, the local population continues to suffer from the long-term consequences, including high cancer rates and genetic deformities. A young parliamentarian, Hinamoeura Morgant-Cross, is bringing international attention to the issue, describing her people as "France's guinea pigs" who were poisoned for the sake of France's nuclear ambitions. Despite President Macron acknowledging France's "guilt" in 2021, the government has never formally apologized, and victims face significant hurdles in receiving compensation. The article highlights the intergenerational health crisis caused by radioactive fallout, which the French government initially dismissed as harmless.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has urged the United States to cancel "unreasonable tariffs" to create better conditions for bilateral trade, specifically highlighting the impact on soybean imports. The statement comes as American farmers enter harvest season without the usual bulk purchases from China, traditionally their largest market. A ministry spokesman emphasized that positive action from the U.S. is needed to restore normalcy to the agricultural trade relationship. This call for tariff removal followed a meeting between Chinese trade officials and a delegation of political and business leaders from the American Midwest, a region heavily reliant on soybean exports.</p>

          <p>The British government is exploring options to support suppliers of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) after a major cyber-attack forced the carmaker to halt production. The shutdown, expected to last until at least October, has raised fears that smaller suppliers solely dependent on JLR could face bankruptcy. One potential measure being considered is the government purchasing and stockpiling component parts to maintain cash flow for these firms, though suppliers have expressed skepticism. This situation is unprecedented, as it would be the first time the government has offered such financial aid to a company's supply chain as a direct result of a cyber-attack.</p>

          <p>H&M's shares surged after the fashion retailer reported third-quarter operating profit and sales that exceeded analyst expectations, signaling its turnaround plan is taking effect. Operating profit rose 40% year-over-year, driven by tight cost controls and a renewed focus on core product lines under CEO Daniel Erver. This marks the second consecutive quarter of strong performance as the company works to improve efficiency through store revamps and increased digitization to better compete with rivals like Zara-owner Inditex. However, the company cautioned that the full impact of U.S. tariffs on imports could lead to price increases later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent trend has emerged where assailants in high-profile shootings inscribe ideological messages on their ammunition. The suspect in the Dallas ICE facility attack allegedly used a bullet casing engraved with "anti-ICE," mirroring similar actions by the accused killers of Charlie Kirk and UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. This pattern of using engraved casings to convey motives, from anti-fascist slogans to criticisms of the health insurance industry, highlights a new method for attackers to publicize their political or personal grievances.

The author points to subsequent calls for institutionalization of transgender individuals and the advancement of anti-LGBTQ+ legislative riders as evidence of this escalation.

The book follows a writer, also named Patricia, as she navigates the debilitating and transformative effects of long COVID over four years. The novel captures the alienation and cognitive disruption of the illness, including memory loss and a shattered sense of identity, using poetic and fragmented prose. The reviewer notes that the book stands out by focusing on the prolonged, unresolved state of being sick, exploring the narrator's deep curiosity about how the illness has remade her mind and her relationship with language.</p>

The court on the island of Gran Canaria found that the man intentionally threw the four-month-old puppy off a cliff to inflict emotional suffering on the woman, an act defined as "vicarious violence." This is the first time Spain's pioneering legislation against gender-based violence has been extended to a case involving an animal. The ruling establishes a new legal precedent for how animal cruelty can be prosecuted when used as a tool to harm a human partner.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly shooting at a Dallas field office that killed one detainee and injured two others, the acting director of ICE has placed all agency facilities on higher alert. The gunman, who died from a self-inflicted wound, fired from a nearby rooftop, and authorities are investigating the incident as an act of targeted violence, noting that recovered ammunition contained anti-ICE messages. The attack has drawn condemnation from officials, who link it to a significant increase in assaults against ICE personnel amid heightened political rhetoric surrounding immigration enforcement. The Department of Homeland Security has characterized the event as a direct attack on law enforcement.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests AI Has Changed the Method, Not the Frequency, of Student Cheating</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An education researcher argues that while generative AI has introduced new tools for academic dishonesty, it may not have significantly increased the overall rate of cheating, which was already high. Citing survey data from before and after the release of ChatGPT, the article suggests that AI is replacing older methods like copying from websites or peers, rather than creating a new wave of cheaters. The piece delves into the complexities of why students cheat, including academic pressure and assignments perceived as busy-work. It also highlights the ambiguity around what constitutes permissible AI use, as teachers and schools are still developing clear policies for this new technology.</p>

          <p>Following an investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Ticketmaster has agreed to improve how it communicates ticket prices to consumers. The probe was launched after complaints that fans were misled during the sale of Oasis reunion tour tickets, where a tiered pricing system led to significant price variations for similar seats without clear explanation. Ticketmaster will now have to provide more upfront information about pricing structures and use accurate labeling. While the CMA found no evidence of algorithmic "dynamic pricing," the agreement aims to prevent consumers from being surprised by high costs and ensure transparency in the ticket-buying process.</p>

          <p>A long-debated plan to install permanent restrooms at Runyon Canyon Park, one of Los Angeles's most popular hiking spots, is moving forward despite renewed opposition from some local residents. For years, many in the surrounding Hollywood Hills community have argued against bathrooms, fearing they would attract homeless individuals, increase foot traffic, and commercialize the wilderness oasis. However, with an estimated 2 million visitors annually, city officials and park advocates maintain that the nearly $1-million project is necessary for public health and dignity. A local group is now calling for the project to be halted, citing fiscal irresponsibility and public safety concerns, but the city remains committed to completing it by next summer.</p>

          <p>A plan to convert the 32-acre Boething Treeland Nursery in Woodland Hills into a cemetery and funeral home is facing resistance from some local residents. The property was sold to Dignity Memorial, the nation's largest funeral provider, which is now seeking city approval for the project. Residents in the affluent surrounding communities of Woodland Hills, Hidden Hills, and Calabasas have raised concerns about traffic and the "fright factor" of living next to a cemetery, hiring a law firm to push for a more rigorous environmental and public review process. The developer argues that the land is already zoned for cemetery use and that the project will be less impactful than previous residential development proposals for the site.</p>

          <p>Millions of California residents will see a credit on their electricity bills this October as part of the state's biannual California Climate Credit program. The refund, which varies by utility provider but can be over $50 for many, is derived from the state's cap-and-invest program. This system requires large industrial polluters to purchase permits for their greenhouse gas emissions, and a portion of the revenue is returned directly to residential and small-business customers. The credit is applied automatically in April and October for electricity, and with recent legislation extending the program, these refunds are expected to increase in the coming years.</p>

Originally a librarian with a passion for astronomy, she transitioned careers to become the first woman to operate Palomar's major telescopes, a role she began in 1985. Overcoming historical gender barriers at institutions that once barred women, Mueller not only supported the research of countless astronomers but also made significant discoveries of her own. Using the observatory's powerful telescopes, she discovered 15 comets, numerous asteroids, and over 100 supernovae, leaving a remarkable legacy in observational astronomy.</p>
