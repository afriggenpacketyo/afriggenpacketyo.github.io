        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has temporarily halted the importation of live cattle from Mexico through southern border ports to address the detection of screwworm, a potentially fatal parasite, in farms as far north as Oaxaca and Veracruz. Secretary Brooke Rollins emphasized the importance of animal and food supply safety, stating the suspension is not politically motivated but focused on implementing increased surveillance and eradication efforts. Mexico's Agriculture Secretary Julio BerdeguÃ© expressed disagreement but remained confident in reaching an agreement soon. The screwworm, a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly, can severely damage tissues and cause fatal lesions in warm-blooded animals, including humans.</p>

          <p>Scientists at NeuroRestore in Switzerland are developing a 'digital bridge' to help paralyzed individuals regain movement and bodily functions. The technology involves wirelessly transmitting signals from the brain to the spinal cord, bypassing the injury. While walking is often seen as the top priority, patients express greater interest in regaining control over functions like bladder control, blood pressure regulation, and sexual function. Spinal cord stimulation also shows promise in improving mobility for individuals with Parkinson's disease, and researchers are working to simplify the therapy for broader accessibility.</p>

Patients and doctors are expressing concerns over the limited ability to tailor obesity drug prescriptions to individual needs, as Wegovy is the remaining option for Caremark's most popular list of medicines.

          <p>President Trump urged Ukraine to accept a Russian proposal for direct talks, diverging from a European plan that insisted on a cease-fire first, as reported by the New York Times. While European leaders set a Monday deadline for Russia to accept a cease-fire or face additional sanctions, Mr. Trump supported Russia's counteroffer of direct talks in Istanbul. President Zelensky responded cautiously, but added a new twist by saying he would personally attend negotiations in Turkey. These developments came amid ongoing diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine.</p>

Migrants will also need to wait ten years to apply for settlement, instead of five. Labour aims to create a controlled, selective, and fair system. The plan includes fast-track settlement for nurses, engineers, and AI experts. Critics worry the rules may split families if partners struggle to learn English, but research suggests migrants see language as important for integration and employment.</p>
