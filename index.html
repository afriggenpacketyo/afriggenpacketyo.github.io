          <p>Spanish banking giant Santander has announced a Â£2.65 billion deal to acquire TSB from its current owner, Sabadell. If the deal proceeds, Santander intends to integrate TSB into its UK group, which could lead to the disappearance of the TSB brand name from British high streets. The takeover would create the UK's third-largest bank by personal current account share. While described as an "exciting chapter" by TSB's CEO, Santander has acknowledged that the merger will likely result in job cuts and branch closures due to duplication. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite intense pressure, three Republican senatorsâ€”Susan Collins, Rand Paul, and Thom Tillisâ€”voted against President Trump's signature domestic policy bill, forcing a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. Collins cited concerns over drastic Medicaid cuts that would harm hundreds of thousands of her constituents in Maine and threaten rural hospitals. Tillis also opposed the Medicaid provisions, arguing they would jeopardize coverage for over 600,000 North Carolinians. Paul, a fiscal conservative, opposed the bill for not including sufficient measures to control the national debt, stating he was fighting for fiscal sanity.</p>

While the removal was a relief for investors, industry groups like the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) remain critical.

The indictment reveals that chemicals found in a deer tranquilizer, for which Barry Morphew held a prescription, were discovered in Suzanne's bone marrow. This is the second time he has been charged with her murder, as previous charges were dropped due to prosecutorial misconduct, though his attorney insists he is innocent.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have passed President Trump's major policy bill, a comprehensive package centered on extending the 2017 tax cuts and funding key administration priorities. The bill passed on a 51-50 vote, requiring Vice President JD Vance to break the tie after three Republicans voted against it. The legislation, which now heads to the House, also allocates billions for border security and mass deportations while imposing new restrictions on social programs like Medicaid. Critics warn the bill will add over $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade.</p>

          <p>The Republican "big beautiful" bill passed by the Senate includes a new temporary tax deduction, or "senior bonus," aimed at providing relief for taxpayers aged 65 and over. The Senate's version proposes a deduction of up to $6,000, while the House version calls for $4,000, available from 2025 through 2028. This benefit would be fully available to single filers with incomes up to $75,000 and joint filers up to $150,000. While touted as a way to reduce taxes on Social Security, it does not eliminate the taxation of benefits, a different proposal prohibited under the legislative process used.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank likely would have already lowered interest rates this year if not for the Trump administration's tariff policies. Speaking at a European Central Bank forum, Powell stated that the Fed went "on hold" after the tariff plans were announced, as they caused inflation forecasts to rise materially. His admission confirms that the administration's trade policy has been a key factor in the Fed's decision to maintain current interest rates despite public pressure from the White House to cut them. Powell reiterated that future rate decisions remain dependent on economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The spending package passed by the Senate includes a provision to permanently increase the child tax credit, a key difference from the temporary expansion proposed by the House. The Senate bill would raise the maximum credit from its current $2,000 to $2,200 starting in 2025 and index it to inflation thereafter. In contrast, the House version offers a higher credit of $2,500 but only through 2028. Policy experts note that despite the increase, the credit's structure means that the lowest-income families may still not be able to access the full benefit due to refundability limits.

Trump stated the facility will hold the "most menacing migrants" and that the dangerous wildlife would serve as a natural deterrent to escape.

          <p>With average U.S. homeowners holding significant tappable equity, a new report suggests several smart ways to utilize these funds, focusing on a hypothetical $100,000. One primary recommendation is to consolidate and pay off high-interest debt, such as credit card balances, by leveraging lower-rate home equity loans. Other strategic uses include funding home renovations that boost resale value, investing in a diversified portfolio, or financing a small business venture. The article cautions that these are secured loans backed by one's property and should be used responsibly. (not investment advice)</p>

Global health specialists have repeatedly reviewed the DTP vaccine's safety and found no evidence of the negative effects claimed, warning that cutting funds to Gavi based on flawed evidence could result in millions of preventable deaths.</p>

Despite polls showing widespread public opposition and warnings of severe consequences like millions losing health insurance, the party has rushed the legislation through Congress. The analysis suggests a combination of factors, including ideological commitment to tax cuts, insulation from public opinion via partisan media, and intense pressure from President Trump. The president has treated any dissent ruthlessly, creating an unstoppable momentum for his "big, beautiful bill."</p>
