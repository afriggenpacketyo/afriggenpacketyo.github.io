          <p>Huawei announced a new AI computing system powered by its Ascend chips, aiming to rival Nvidia's technology in China.  This development comes amid US efforts to restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors. Huawei plans to release three new Ascend chip versions by 2028, doubling computing capabilities yearly. The company claims its new Atlas 950 SuperCluster will surpass Nvidia's and xAI's systems in computing power, although this claim requires further verification.</p>

          <p>The UK government will appeal a High Court ruling that blocked the deportation of an Eritrean migrant to France under a new bilateral agreement.  The migrant claimed to be a victim of modern slavery just hours before his scheduled flight. The Home Secretary criticized last-minute asylum claims, suggesting they undermine efforts to deter dangerous Channel crossings.  The ruling raises questions about the scheme's effectiveness and potential for future legal challenges.</p>
