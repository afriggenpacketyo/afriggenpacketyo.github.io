          <p>An Air India passenger plane, a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, carrying 242 passengers and crew crashed shortly after takeoff in Ahmedabad, India, en route to London's Gatwick airport. According to police reports, there were no survivors and casualties were also likely on the ground as the plane crashed into buildings in a residential area. Boeing has issued a statement expressing their support and readiness to assist Air India, and the NTSB will send a team to assist the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau with its investigation. The crash prompted immediate responses from Indian and UK officials, including Prime Minister Modi and U.K. Prime Minister Starmer, who expressed their condolences and assured swift action and support. The crash appears to be the first of its kind for the Dreamliner.</p>

          <p>Three Democratic governors, Kathy Hochul of New York, J.B.

The governors disputed claims of failing to cooperate with federal authorities, with Walz emphasizing that Minnesota is not a sanctuary state and criticizing the federal government's approach to immigration. Hochul addressed the influx of migrants to New York City, highlighting the state's efforts to manage the humanitarian crisis while cooperating with ICE in criminal cases.

          <p>The article discusses current certificate of deposit (CD) interest rates and strategies for securing optimal returns in an economy facing persistent inflation. It notes that while national average CD yields for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year terms are around 2%, 1.70%, and 1.71% APY respectively, top CDs offer much higher rates, sometimes exceeding 4.40% APY. The article suggests considering online banks and short-term CDs to take advantage of the inverted yield curve, where shorter terms offer better rates, and recommends CD laddering as a practical approach for long-term savings. These strategies can help savers lock in competitive rates and achieve their financial goals more effectively (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The State Department has restricted travel for U.S. government workers in Israel and authorized family members of U.S. military personnel across the Middle East to evacuate amid concerns of a potential Israeli strike on Iran. This follows reports that U.S. officials were informed Israel is prepared to launch an operation into Iran, while Iran announced plans to significantly expand its uranium enrichment program in response to an IAEA vote finding Tehran non-compliant with nuclear obligations. Despite the tensions, a new round of Iran-U.S. talks is scheduled for Oman, but the risk of military conflict remains a concern. The IAEA resolution cited Iran's failure to cooperate fully regarding undeclared nuclear material and activities.</p>

Despite his personal struggles, Wilson's impact on music was undeniable, inspiring countless artists and shaping the sound of summer for generations. His 1966 album "Pet Sounds" is considered one of the greatest albums of all time, and his influence extended far beyond the Beach Boys' hits.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that individuals participating in protests alongside groups like Antifa are inadvertently enabling violence, even if they consider themselves peaceful. The author suggests that by remaining at protests where violence erupts, peaceful protesters divert police attention and provide cover for agitators. Drawing a contrast with protests like the March for Life and Tea Party rallies, the piece questions why violence is often accepted as inevitable at left-wing protests. The author urges protesters to leave at the first sign of violence to avoid contributing to chaos and destruction, and to condemn the actions of agitators.</p>

          <p>India is emerging as a key player in global manufacturing, driven by geopolitical factors, economic incentives, and strategic diversification, as highlighted in CNBC's "Inside India" newsletter. Companies like Shein, Apple, and Google are expanding their manufacturing operations in India, drawn by its large labor force and government incentives like the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. While challenges remain, including logistical bottlenecks and labor concerns, India offers a relatively stable option for companies seeking resilient supply chains. This shift reflects a broader realignment across sectors, with India becoming an alternative manufacturing hub amid U.S.-China trade tensions.</p>

Trump stated on Truth Social that Paul and his family were welcome, joking that it would give him more time to secure Paul's vote on the bill.

The IAEA Board of Governors has declared Iran in non-compliance with its nuclear safeguards obligations, and despite ongoing talks, Israel is considering military action. The key obstacle remains Iran's domestic uranium enrichment, which could be used for nuclear weapons, raising concerns about Iran's intentions.</p>

One expert suggests Beijing should adopt a more pragmatic approach and adapt to the conservative shift in American politics.

          <p>India's headline inflation eased to a lower-than-expected 2.82% in May, marking its lowest level since February 2019, according to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. The decline was primarily driven by a slide in food prices, with food inflation hitting 0.99% in May, sharply below April's 1.78%. The Reserve Bank of India has been relaxing monetary policy amid these easing inflationary pressures, most recently cutting its benchmark repo rate by 50 basis points. Economists anticipate further rate cuts due to subdued inflation and weakened economic activity (not investment advice).</p>
