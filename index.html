        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent economic analysis indicates that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are contributing significantly to inflation in the United States. Researchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis identified notable price increases in categories like furniture, electronics, and auto parts, finding that companies pass a substantial portion of these costs to consumers. According to the study, these tariffs accounted for a 0.5 percentage point increase in the Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation rate over a recent three-month period. S&P Global analysts further project that the tariffs will cost U.S. businesses an additional $1.2 trillion this year, with consumers bearing the majority of the financial burden.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 12:57:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The French Ministry of Culture has confirmed that the priceless crown jewels stolen from the Louvre museum were not covered by private insurance. According to French law, national museums like the Louvre are considered state property, and the state acts as its own insurer for items that are not on loan. This means neither the museum nor the government will receive an insurance payout to cover the value of the stolen artifacts. While a criminologist expressed confidence that the perpetrators will be caught, he believes the jewels themselves are unlikely to be recovered, as they could be dismantled and sold on the black market.</p>

          <p>Despite the ongoing federal government shutdown, several resources remain available for individuals seeking assistance with their student loans. The U.S. Department of Education's website, Studentaid.gov, continues to offer services such as applications for repayment plans and loan consolidation, as some call centers are operated by contractors. Additionally, student loan servicers, which are also government contractors, are expected to operate normally for billing, payments, and processing deferment requests. Borrowers can also seek help from nonprofit organizations and state student loan ombudsman offices for guidance during the shutdown.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Construction has commenced on a new $250 million ballroom at the White House, sparking ethical concerns over its funding, which relies on private and corporate donations. Legal experts, including a former White House ethics lawyer, have described the project as an "ethics nightmare," suggesting it could create a pay-to-play scenario where donors gain access to the administration. While President Trump has stated he will personally fund parts of the project, a recent dinner for potential donors included executives from major corporations like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. The White House maintains the project is a necessary renovation and that donations are being handled appropriately by a non-profit trust.</p>

          <p>A major outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS) that disrupted global websites and essential services like banking has renewed concerns about the world's dependence on a few U.S. tech giants. In the UK, AWS and Microsoft Azure control a significant portion of the cloud computing market, creating what experts call a "highly concentrated risk" where small issues can have widespread economic impact. While using these large providers offers benefits like cost savings and security, regulators and analysts argue that this market dominance stifles competition. The event has prompted calls for the UK government to mandate greater data resilience and diversify its cloud infrastructure to prevent such extensive disruptions in the future.</p>

          <p>A New York man who received a presidential pardon from Donald Trump for his involvement in the January 6th Capitol riot has been arrested for allegedly threatening to kill House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries. The individual, Christopher Moynihan, was previously convicted on multiple counts related to the riot and was among approximately 1,500 people pardoned by Trump on his first day back in office. In a statement, Representative Jeffries thanked law enforcement for their swift action and criticized the blanket pardons, suggesting they have released dangerous individuals back into communities. The incident highlights ongoing concerns about the consequences of the pardons for those involved in the Capitol attack.</p>

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat experienced a dramatic surge, rising over 80% on Tuesday after a 127% jump the previous day. The rally was triggered by its inclusion in the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, which appears to have initiated a short squeeze, forcing investors betting against the stock to cover their positions. This marks a significant turnaround for the company, which had been trading as a penny stock after falling from its post-IPO highs in 2019. The sudden revival of a speculative name like Beyond Meat is seen by some market observers as a potential sign of market frothiness and renewed interest from retail traders.

          <p>Indonesia has agreed to repatriate Lindsay Sandiford, a British grandmother who has been on death row for over a decade following a drug trafficking conviction in 2013. Sandiford, now in her late 60s and reportedly seriously ill, was arrested after cocaine was found in her suitcase upon arrival in Bali. She claimed a drug syndicate had threatened her son's life, forcing her to carry the narcotics. The repatriation agreement, signed by Indonesia's senior law minister and the British foreign minister, also includes another British national serving a life sentence for drug offenses.

          <p>A new documentary titled "Orwell: 2+2=5," directed by Raoul Peck, examines the contemporary relevance of George Orwell's dystopian novel "1984." The film uses archival footage and Orwell's own writings to argue that while generations have recognized the book's warnings about authoritarianism and propaganda, this awareness has led to complacency rather than action. Peck explores how concepts like "Newspeak" and the suppression of truth are mirrored in modern politics and media, suggesting that society has become numb to the very dangers Orwell predicted. The documentary frames the rise of authoritarian tactics as an infection, urging viewers to move beyond simply referencing Orwell and engage in more meaningful resistance.</p>

Buchdahl's memoir, "Heart of a Stranger," explores how these experiences shaped her identity and leadership approach.

Ranching associations argue that importing beef could introduce other diseases and undermine domestic producers. Instead of market intervention, they are urging the government to focus on biosecurity measures to combat the screwworm threat and support the rebuilding of U.S. cattle herds.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has officially announced the upcoming launch of ChatGPT Atlas, an artificial intelligence-powered web browser, causing shares of Google's parent company, Alphabet, to drop by 3%. The announcement places OpenAI in direct competition with established browsers like Google Chrome and emerging AI-centric browsers from rivals such as Perplexity AI. The new browser will be available globally on macOS, with versions for Windows, iOS, and Android planned for future release. This move signals a significant expansion for OpenAI, as it aims to integrate its powerful AI capabilities directly into the web browsing experience, potentially reshaping how users interact with online information.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Department of Defense to return nearly 600 books concerning race and gender to school libraries on five military bases. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by students and their families, who argued that the removal of these books violated their First Amendment rights. The books were removed earlier this year following executive orders from President Trump and guidance from the Secretary of Defense prohibiting materials that promote "gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology." In her decision, the judge stated that the removals were based on "improper partisan motivation" rather than pedagogical concerns and ordered the immediate restoration of the materials.</p>

          <p>China is reportedly discussing a potential trilateral currency swap agreement with Japan and South Korea to enhance the region's financial stability amid trade tensions with the United States. The talks, which took place on the sidelines of the recent IMF-World Bank meetings, aim to deepen economic cooperation and bolster a financial safety net. This move aligns with China's long-term strategy to increase the international use of the yuan as an alternative to the U.S. dollar. The discussions are significant as they involve two close U.S. allies that have also been impacted by tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

The presentation was made by Nixon's daughter, Tricia Nixon Cox, and others associated with the foundation. The honor comes after Trump played a central role in brokering a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas.

She argues that investors are underestimating the risks associated with the trillions of dollars that major tech companies are committing to AI-related capital expenditures. Wolfe pointed out a significant mismatch between this massive spending and the yet-to-be-realized profits, making current valuations difficult to justify. Drawing parallels to the dot-com era, she advised that a better strategy than investing in overvalued AI companies is to seek value in overlooked sectors, similar to how railroads were a solid investment in 2000.

          <p>Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical giant behind the popular drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, is set to undergo a significant boardroom overhaul with seven members, including the chairman and vice chair, not seeking re-election. The departures stem from a disagreement between the board and its majority shareholder, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, over the company's future governance and strategy. This shakeup follows a series of recent challenges for the Danish company, including a new CEO, mass layoffs, and a profit warning due to increased competition from U.S. rivals. The company's former CEO, Lars Rebien Sorensen, is being proposed as the new chairman to steer the company through these market changes.</p>

The expert, Alain Bauer, noted that the robbers left behind significant DNA evidence at the scene, which should aid in their identification and capture. However, he believes the historical jewels, including a tiara commissioned by Napoleon III, will probably be broken apart and their individual gems sold on the black market. The brazen robbery has been called a national embarrassment and has exposed significant security vulnerabilities at the world-famous museum.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for President Donald Trump are urging a federal judge to allow their $10 billion defamation lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal to proceed. The lawsuit centers on the newspaper's reporting of an allegedly bawdy letter from Trump that appeared in a birthday book for the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump's legal team argues the article was a "deliberate smear campaign" and that the letter is a forgery, while the Journal stands by its reporting and has filed a motion to dismiss the case. The newspaper contends that Trump's past public friendship with Epstein means his reputation could not have been harmed by the story.</p>
