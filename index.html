          <p>A recent analysis by the Highway Loss Data Institute reveals that the Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 is the most stolen vehicle in the United States. With a theft rate 39 times higher than the average, the high-performance car is targeted by thieves for its powerful engine and a specific security vulnerability in its on-board data port. The report also notes a broader trend of thieves targeting expensive, high-horsepower vehicles and pickup trucks, while electric vehicles are among the least stolen, partly because they are often parked in secure garages.</p>

          <p>China's trade data for July showed surprisingly strong growth, with exports climbing 7.2% and imports rising 4.1% compared to the previous year, beating economists' forecasts. This performance has provided significant support to the nation's economy amid ongoing trade tensions and a potential tariff truce with the U.S. nearing its deadline. Despite the positive trade figures, China's factory activity recently slowed, indicating that the momentum from businesses front-loading shipments may not be sustainable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a potential 100% tariff on semiconductor imports has caused varied reactions across Asian stock markets. The proposed tariff, which would not apply to companies with manufacturing operations in the U.S., led to a decline in some Japanese chip stocks like Tokyo Electron. However, shares for South Korea's Samsung and Taiwan's TSMC rose, as both companies have made significant investments in U.S.-based production facilities, potentially exempting them from the new levy.

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted a raid at a Home Depot in Los Angeles by using a Penske rental truck to pose as employers seeking day laborers, a tactic dubbed "Operation Trojan Horse."

Penske Truck Rental stated it was unaware of the truck's use in the operation and prohibits the transport of people in its cargo areas.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to crack down on the non-surgical cosmetic industry by introducing a new licensing scheme for practitioners. Under the proposals, clinics offering treatments like Botox and dermal fillers will need to meet strict safety and training standards to obtain a license. Furthermore, the most high-risk procedures, such as non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs), will be restricted to qualified health professionals only, aiming to protect the public from harm and exploitation.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook described last week's U.S. jobs report as "concerning," highlighting the significant downward revisions to hiring data for May and June. She stated that such large revisions are often "typical of turning points" in the economy and could signal a coming slowdown in economic activity. Cook also noted that an "uncertainty tax," caused by businesses spending time preparing for potential tariffs and other macroeconomic shifts, is creating a drag on productivity across industries.

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's justification for firing the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner shows a misrepresentation of the timeline of jobs report data. Trump claimed the agency released "phony" strong numbers just before the 2024 election and revised them down afterward, but the major downward revision he cited was actually issued in August 2024, months before the election. Furthermore, the final jobs report released just before the election showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, which the Trump campaign used at the time to criticize his opponent.</p>

However, key industries like IT services and pharmaceuticals, which are major exports to the U.S., are not targeted by the current duties on goods. (not investment advice)</p>
