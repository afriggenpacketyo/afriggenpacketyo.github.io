        <p>China is concerned that President Trump's tariffs on Mexico could be a precursor to broader efforts to force developing nations to choose between trade with the U.S. or China.  Companies have shifted production to countries like Mexico to circumvent US-China trade friction.  China fears that pressure from Washington could lead Mexico to restrict trade with China to avoid further tariffs, potentially impacting jobs and the economy.</p>
