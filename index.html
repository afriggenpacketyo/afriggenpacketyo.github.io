          <h2>US Trade Court Blocks Trump's Tariffs, Prompting Immediate Appeal</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court stated that the US Constitution reserves the power to regulate commerce with other nations for Congress. The Trump administration immediately lodged an appeal. The lawsuit was filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small businesses that import goods from countries targeted by the duties, marking the first major legal challenge to Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. The New York attorney general welcomed the decision, asserting that no president has the power to unilaterally raise taxes. Optimism surrounding this ruling is tempered by the understanding that the Trump administration is appealing the ruling.</p>

          <p>A Salvadorian immigrant family made three attempts to cross the Rainbow Bridge into Canada, seeking asylum from potential US deportations. Despite initial rejections due to document discrepancies, they eventually succeeded with legal assistance. The family's story highlights a rise in asylum seekers fleeing not only their homelands but also President Trump's immigration policies. While the number of people attempting to cross into the United States from Canada has decreased, the number of asylum seekers being denied entry into Canada from the US has increased, with stricter border policies and increased removals being implemented by the Canadian government. Despite this, the CBSA maintains that their policies and processes have not changed.</p>

          <p>The sentencing hearing for the mother and co-accused in the disappearance of six-year-old Joshlin Smith in South Africa was filled with emotion. Joshlin's mother, a drug addict, is believed to have sold her for money, and the court convicted her of kidnapping and trafficking. Victim impact statements from Joshlin's grandmother, a family friend, and her teacher detailed their pain and bewilderment. The case has drawn comparisons to the Madeleine McCann disappearance, with the big question being what happened to Joshlin, whose disappearance has shocked the country. A social worker's report painted a stark picture of the mother's drug addiction and neglect of her children.</p>

          <p>China's Type 055 destroyer, the Lhasa, can now strike beyond visual-range targets with precision by linking to an airborne early warning system, according to state broadcaster CCTV. This allows the destroyer to conduct long-range anti-ship and air-defense strikes without relying solely on its own radars. The networked capability mirrors Pakistan’s use of similar Chinese technology to shoot down Indian fighters near the disputed Kashmir region. Battlefield data fusion enables seamless information sharing across domains, marking a significant advance in operational coordination for the PLA.</p>

          <p>South Korea's central bank has cut its policy interest rate for the fourth time, reducing rates to 2.5% in response to political uncertainty and trade tensions with the United States. The country is grappling with the aftermath of a failed attempt by the former leader to impose martial law, as well as reciprocal tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. South Korean leaders are working to strike a deal with the U.S. government before the July 8 deadline. The central bank also slashed its full-year GDP forecast for 2025 to just 0.8%, significantly lower than the previous projection of 1.5% (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to "aggressively" revoke the visas of Chinese students studying in the US, particularly those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. Criteria for future visa applicants from China and Hong Kong will also be revised to "enhance scrutiny". Relations between Beijing and Washington have deteriorated recently due to an ongoing trade war. Estimates indicate there were around 280,000 Chinese students studying in the US last year, although this number has dropped in recent years. Some students have expressed regret about applying to US schools after hearing of the planned visa changes.</p>

          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority with his reciprocal tariffs, dealing a blow to a major tenet of the president's economic agenda. The U.S. Court of International Trade found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant the president the power to unilaterally implement the sweeping duties. The Trump administration swiftly appealed the ruling. The court stated that the tariffs exceeded any authority granted to the president by the emergency powers law, and the ruling triggered retaliatory measures, inflated prices on essential goods, and placed an unfair burden on American families and small businesses (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The government has announced that two major new reservoir projects in East Anglia and south Lincolnshire will be fast-tracked to shore up England's water supplies. The projects have been declared "nationally significant," allowing them to speed through the planning process, though they could still be over a decade away from completion. The government intends to pass legislation to automatically make the other seven proposed reservoirs "nationally significant" too. Some experts warn that managing how we use water needs to take greater precedence in a warming climate, and like any major project, the new reservoirs could prove unpopular with local communities.</p>

          <p>A federal court has ruled that President Donald Trump's tariffs are illegal, citing constitutional limits on Congress's ability to empower the president to impose tariffs. The US Court of International Trade argued that Trump surpassed these limits and that several federal trade laws place rigid constraints on Trump’s ability to continue his trade war. The decision is broad, arguing that the Constitution places fairly strict limits on Congress’s ability to empower the president to impose tariffs in the first place. The three-judge panel unanimously agreed that Trump’s tariffs, as they stand now, are illegal, and the decision can be appealed up to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Authorities are investigating an incident in Agoura Hills as a hate crime after a man allegedly damaged the door of a home displaying a Palestinian flag. The suspect, videotaped by a doorbell camera, reportedly made racist remarks and verbal threats. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR-LA) commended the LASD for investigating the incident as a hate crime, stating that no one should face harassment or threats for displaying a flag that represents their identity or call for justice. The incident comes months after a violent clash between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian students on UCLA’s campus.</p>

          <p>As negotiations to end the war in Ukraine stall, the Trump administration is turning to the Middle East to showcase progress toward landmark deals and fulfill the president’s vow to be a global peacemaker. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff announced a temporary truce in Gaza was within reach, potentially leading to a peaceful resolution. Trump has also taken a harsher approach to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and officials are increasingly optimistic about brokering a nuclear agreement with Iran. Meanwhile, Russia has proposed sending a delegation to present Ukraine with its terms for a ceasefire, but Ukrainian officials have balked at the delay.</p>

Trump expressed outrage that about one-fourth of Harvard’s student body is made up of international students, and he questioned where the students are coming from.
