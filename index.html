        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>SK Hynix, a key supplier to Nvidia, reported impressive first-quarter results driven by strong demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI chipsets, with revenue rising about 42% and operating profit surging 158% year-on-year. The company cautioned that macroeconomic uncertainties, including U.S. tariff policies, could introduce demand volatility in the second half of the year, as there are growing concerns that tariffs can be applied to semiconductor products. Despite these concerns, SK Hynix anticipates continued spending by Big Tech on AI and expects demand from consumer electronics to rise with new AI-enabled products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive actions aimed at reshaping education, including efforts to rein in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in colleges and universities. One order targets college accreditors, alleging they've abused their authority by imposing discriminatory DEI-based standards, while another promises new discipline guidance for K-12 schools based on objective behavior rather than DEI. The actions also aim to increase intellectual diversity on campuses and require colleges to disclose foreign funding, with potential revocation of federal grants for non-compliance. These orders are part of a broader effort to cement Trump's conservative agenda in education, rolling back Biden administration policies and bolstering workforce training.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Ukrainian President Zelenskyy for refusing to recognize Russian control of Crimea, claiming it harms peace negotiations, but also suggested that the U.S. would be willing to formally recognize Russia’s seizure of Crimea as part of any agreement. Trump stated he wants a deal done and has no favorites in the conflict. The U.S. administration's vision for a deal involves freezing territorial lines close to where they are today, implying both Ukraine and Russia would have to cede some territory. Meanwhile, Russia intensified attacks on Ukraine following a brief lull over Easter, despite Putin's claims of a temporary ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Trading Standards officers in England have seized over six million illegal vaping products in the past three years, revealing a sophisticated network involved in the illicit trade. These non-compliant vapes often exceed legal limits for tank size and nicotine strength, posing significant health risks to consumers, particularly children. Authorities are preparing for a ban on single-use disposable vapes, hoping it will curb the illegal trade, which is also linked to other serious crimes like modern-day slavery and drug supply. The government is allocating additional funds for Trading Standards to tackle underage and illicit sales, with increased enforcement powers.</p>

          <p>Japan's approach to foreigners who overstay their visas involves arrest, detention, and deportation, often treating them as common criminals. While many overstayers come to Japan seeking employment, the country has been slow to adopt more neutral language, such as "undocumented immigrants," to protect the human rights of foreign workers. Some organizations are advocating for the use of terms like "irregular stay" to reduce prejudice and discrimination, as there are growing concerns that not having regular residency status should not be equated with serious criminal offenses. Some religious organizations provide shelter and support to undocumented immigrants facing destitution and hardship.</p>

          <p>Water companies in the UK are admitting that self-monitoring of sewage pollution levels is damaging public trust and propose a new, third-party monitoring system. The industry body, Water UK, made this recommendation to the government's independent review into the water sector. This comes after incidents of misreporting by water companies and criticisms that the Environment Agency lacks the capacity to conduct sufficient monitoring. The industry also requested universal water meters to ensure fairer billing and encourage conservation.</p>

Climate change-related events like wildfires and extreme heat are worsening air quality, and the report also notes that Black people are disproportionately affected due to systemic racism and the placement of pollution sources in communities of color.</p>

          <p>Geoscientists have discovered a magma cap at Yellowstone National Park, which is likely playing a critical role in preventing a massive eruption. The "volatile rich" cap is located about 2.4 miles below the Earth's surface and acts as a lid, trapping pressure and heat below it. Data suggests that the magma reservoir is actively releasing gas but remains in a stable state. Researchers believe the system is efficiently venting gas through cracks and channels in the porous rock of the magma cap.</p>
