          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods is set to acquire Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, aiming to expand its reach to a more urban consumer base and tap into basketball and sneaker culture. Foot Locker has been struggling as a mall-based chain, but it has a massive footprint of stores — about 2,400 across 20 countries. The acquisition faces challenges including new tariffs on imports and competition from big brands selling directly to consumers. Dick's plans to maintain Foot Locker as a separate chain after the deal is finalized, pending shareholder and regulatory approval.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed deals to create a 10-mile campus in Abu Dhabi that will transform the United Arab Emirates into an A.I. powerhouse, supplied by American-made A.I. chips. The project is part of the "U.S.-U.A.E. A.I. Acceleration Partnership" and will be supported by 5 gigawatts of electrical power. While the Commerce Department states the U.A.E. is committed to safeguarding A.I. technologies, some officials have expressed concerns about protections to prevent the technology from benefiting China. Experts consider A.I. a transformative technology with implications for economic and military power, and the deal is viewed as a major milestone in achieving President Trump’s vision for U.S. A.I. dominance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding President Trump's order to end birthright citizenship, focusing on the power of lower court judges to block presidential orders nationwide. Justices grappled with the balance between presidential authority and judicial oversight, considering arguments that the order violates the 14th Amendment. The US solicitor general argued that lower courts overstepped their authority, saying this power should be curtailed. A decision siding with Trump could expand his ability to enact policies without congressional approval, while opposition warns of a chaotic, patchwork system of citizenship.</p>

          <p>Disneyland is launching its 70th anniversary celebration with a new "World of Color" show, "Happiness!," which centers around the characters from "Inside Out." The show aims to create a party vibe and focuses on all things happiness, but some critics find it lacking in sentimentality and depth, arguing that it glosses over the range of emotions found in Disney's films. Other anniversary offerings include projection shows on It's a Small World and Carthay Circle, as well as additions to existing attractions.

          <p>A mega-bill encompassing President Trump's legislative agenda faces jeopardy as several Republican hardliners signaled their opposition to advancing the package out of the House Budget Committee. Concerns about the bill adding to the national debt and a lack of transparency regarding its true cost are cited as reasons for potential no votes. Speaker Mike Johnson faces a tough road ahead as he works to unify his divided conference, with key components related to Medicaid and tax reform remaining sticking points.</p>

          <p>Florida became the second state after Utah to ban adding fluoride to drinking water, with Governor DeSantis signing a bill that goes against the concerns of public health experts and medical professionals. The law aligns with the positions of figures like Robert F Kennedy Jr and Florida’s surgeon general, who believe fluoride affects children’s intellectual abilities. DeSantis framed the law as protecting against forced medication, arguing that individuals should have the choice to use fluoride for their teeth.</p>

          <p>Republican-backed legislation is unlikely to include a tax break on Social Security benefits, despite President Trump's previous suggestion, due to restrictions on making changes to the program through the reconciliation process. Instead, the bill includes an additional $4,000 deduction for filers 65 and older. Eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits would negatively impact the program's long-term outlook, potentially depleting the trust fund sooner. The article clarifies the complexities of Social Security taxation and the political challenges of making changes.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is requesting 20,000 National Guard troops to assist in the removal of migrants without legal status. The request is under review by military lawyers, and state governors would be asked for volunteers.

This move follows President Trump's order to increase the deportation force by 20,000 officers, and using Guard forces would be the quickest way to achieve this goal.</p>

          <p>A Republican megabill aiming to enact President Trump’s agenda is advancing through Congress, proposing significant tax cuts, increased defense spending, and stricter immigration enforcement. The bill also includes cuts to health, nutrition, education, and clean energy programs to offset costs. However, divisions within the Republican party over Medicaid cuts and tax plan details, particularly the state and local tax deduction, pose significant challenges to its passage. Democrats criticize the bill for prioritizing tax cuts for the wealthy at the expense of social programs.</p>
