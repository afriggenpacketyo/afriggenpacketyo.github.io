          <h2>Right-Wing Social Media Campaign Reportedly Derails German Constitutional Court Nomination</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major controversy has erupted in Germany after the parliamentary vote to elect new judges to the Federal Constitutional Court was postponed. The delay is linked to resistance against law professor Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf, a respected candidate who became the target of a coordinated right-wing social media campaign. A political consultancy analyzed thousands of posts, concluding that certain platforms spread defamatory and false information to portray her as a "left-wing radical." This situation has raised significant concerns about the influence of manipulative online campaigns on Germany's democratic institutions and the integrity of its judicial appointment process.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced that "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" will end its run in May 2026, and the network will retire "The Late Show" franchise entirely. The network stated the move was a purely financial decision and praised Colbert's successful tenure, during which the show has been number one in late night for nine consecutive seasons. Colbert informed his audience during a taping, expressing his gratitude to CBS, his staff, and the viewers. The show, which Colbert took over from David Letterman in 2015, will be celebrated over its final 10 months on air.</p>

          <p>An Iranian national, Mahdi Khanbabazadeh, was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials in the parking lot of his child's preschool in Oregon. Khanbabazadeh, who was reportedly in the process of obtaining a green card after marrying a U.S. citizen, had overstayed his initial visa. According to ICE, officials allowed him to drive to the school but had to break a car window to complete the arrest when he resisted. The incident, witnessed by other parents, has been described as chaotic and has drawn criticism, highlighting aggressive tactics in immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that grants it significant access to vast offshore oil reserves in Guyana. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled in Chevron's favor, rejecting a claim from Exxon Mobil that it held a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region's Stabroek Block. The outcome resolves major uncertainty that had weighed on the transaction and affirms a standard industry practice regarding corporate-level mergers. Chevron's CEO indicated that some headcount reductions are expected as the two companies integrate their operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For retirees who are "house rich but cash poor," a reverse mortgage can serve as a tool to supplement Social Security benefits and improve monthly cash flow. This financial product allows homeowners aged 62 and older to convert their home equity into usable income without having to sell their home. The article details three primary ways this can be utilized: creating a steady monthly income stream, accessing funds for unexpected healthcare costs, or enabling the delay of Social Security claims to secure higher future benefits. Repayment is typically deferred until the homeowner moves, sells, or passes away. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's call for the release of Jeffrey Epstein-related grand jury testimony, legal experts have confirmed that courts possess the authority to unseal such records. Typically, grand jury transcripts are kept secret, but a judge can order their release upon a showing of compelling public interest that outweighs the need for continued secrecy. In this case, Attorney General Pam Bondi is preparing to file a motion to request the unsealing. Former prosecutors suggest that since the government itself is requesting the disclosure and Epstein is deceased, a judge is likely to grant the request, though victim information would likely be redacted.</p>

          <p>According to a University of Michigan survey, U.S. consumer sentiment has improved for the second consecutive month in July, despite ongoing concerns about President Trump's tariff policies. This recent uptick follows six straight months of declining optimism, although the current sentiment level remains significantly lower than it was before Trump took office. Year-ahead inflation expectations also decreased, a positive sign for consumers. The data suggests that robust consumer spending, a critical component of the U.S. economy, has so far remained resilient in the face of economic uncertainty caused by fluctuating trade policies and potential price increases.</p>

The report, which is part of the "Top States for Business" study, evaluates roads, bridges, water systems, power grid reliability, and broadband access. Maine was ranked as having the worst infrastructure, primarily due to its unreliable power grid. Other states in the bottom ten include Alaska, for its poor connectivity, and Hawaii, for its deteriorating roads.

          <p>Delta and United Airlines are increasingly separating themselves from the rest of the U.S. airline industry, capturing over 86% of the sector's profits last year. Analysts suggest their success stems from strong networks and a strategic focus on premium travel, including business class seats and lucrative loyalty programs, which provide a buffer against economic challenges. While the industry faces headwinds from weaker domestic demand for coach fares, both airlines have seen strong revenue from their premium cabins and co-branded credit card partnerships. This strategy allows them to maintain stronger financial performance compared to competitors focused on price-sensitive consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German farmers have significantly reduced the land used for cultivating strawberries and asparagus, leading to the lowest harvest volumes in years. According to the Federal Statistical Office, the 2025 open-field strawberry harvest was the lowest in 30 years, while the asparagus yield hit a 15-year low. Growers report that rising costs, particularly for labor, are making the crops economically unviable, as they cannot pass the full cost increase on to consumers. This trend is turning these seasonal favorites into luxury items and has sharply decreased Germany's self-sufficiency in strawberry production, from 68% in 2015 to 50% today.</p>

The passage describes his mix of joy and disappointment as he found the landscape altered and the steamboat culture in decline.

The IRS is expected to issue clarifying guidance in October, as tax professionals are currently uncertain about which occupations will be eligible.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has formally responded to questions from the White House Office of Management and Budget regarding the escalating costs of the Fed's headquarters renovation. In his reply, Powell directed OMB Director Russell Vought to a new public webpage detailing the project and refuted accusations that the building would feature luxurious amenities. The inquiry is seen as part of a broader pressure campaign by the Trump administration against Powell and the central bank. Powell's response was measured, explaining the reasons for cost overruns without engaging with the confrontational tone of the White House's letter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to petition the court to unseal grand jury testimony related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. This move follows pressure from supporters and political opponents to disclose more information after a recent Justice Department memo stated there was no evidence of a "client list" or blackmail. While the government typically keeps grand jury materials secret, a judge can approve their release, though the process could take weeks or months. The request is unusual, and it remains unclear what specific materials will be sought or what grounds the government will use to justify the disclosure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article in The Guardian argues that President Trump's long-standing strategy of leveraging conspiracy theories is now working against him in the Jeffrey Epstein case. For years, Trump benefited from far-right narratives, like QAnon, that painted him as a hero fighting a cabal of powerful pedophiles. However, his administration's recent attempts to conclude the Epstein inquiry by stating there was no "client list" has angered his base, who feel betrayed. The author suggests that Trump, having helped create a post-truth political environment, is now discovering that the powerful, conspiracist narratives he fostered cannot be easily controlled or redirected at will.</p>

          <p>The catastrophic flood at Camp Mystic in Texas, which claimed 27 lives, is being examined through a lens of systemic failures and missed warnings. A key factor was the county's unsuccessful 2018 grant application for a modern flood warning system, a project that stalled due to lack of funding after a similar tragedy in 1987. Further scrutiny is on the camp's director, who also died, for waiting over an hour to evacuate after receiving a severe warning. The investigation highlights a tragic history of inadequate infrastructure, regulatory oversights, and a reliance on an outdated alert system that ultimately failed to prevent the disaster.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced that no further action will be taken against the Irish language rap group Kneecap following their performance at the Glastonbury festival. A criminal investigation was launched last month into comments the trio made on stage.

The group, which had faced controversy for its pro-Palestinian stance and other political expressions, called the investigation an act of "political policing intimidation" and described their performance as a celebration of solidarity.</p>

          <p>A Mexican diplomat has stated it is "very unlikely" that Chinese-owned factories in Mexico will be excluded from the preferential trade benefits of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Speaking at an expo in China, the envoy suggested that the upcoming 2026 review of the trade deal will likely focus on tightening rules-of-origin requirements for all companies rather than targeting specific countries. This means companies may need to source a higher percentage of their product components locally to qualify for benefits. The statement comes amid ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, with Washington seeking to limit Chinese economic influence.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to wear an electronic ankle monitor, surrender his passport, and cease using social media. The measures were imposed as authorities searched his home and party headquarters in connection with an investigation into whether he plotted to overturn the 2022 election results. The restrictions are reportedly aimed at preventing Bolsonaro from fleeing the country. The move coincides with pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has threatened tariffs on Brazil to leverage a favorable outcome for Bolsonaro, whom he has called a victim of a "witch hunt."</p>

In her view, the expectation to work around the clock places an unfair burden on female entrepreneurs, who are often still expected to handle most family responsibilities. She advocates for a more balanced approach, believing that a life outside of work is essential for long-term success and mental health.</p>

          <p>In the competitive streaming market, children's programming like "CoComelon" and "Bluey" has become a crucial tool for retaining subscribers and ensuring profitability. Industry experts note that kids' content is effective because it is less expensive to produce and has high re-watch value, which drives engagement and reduces customer churn. Data from Nielsen shows that children's shows and movies consistently rank among the most-streamed titles. As a result, major platforms like Disney+, Netflix, and Paramount+ are investing heavily in their children's libraries and partnering with platforms like YouTube to maximize reach and discoverability among young audiences.</p>
