          <p>Grant Hardin, known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," was recaptured near the Calico Rock prison in Arkansas, nearly two weeks after his escape. Hardin, a former police chief, was serving a lengthy sentence for murder and sexual assault.

Authorities confirmed his identity through fingerprint analysis, ensuring public safety after the manhunt. The article emphasizes the end of an active threat to public safety with the capture of Hardin, who had a history of violent crimes.
