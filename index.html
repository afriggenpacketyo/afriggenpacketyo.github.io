          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest, alleging he violated previous precautionary measures related to his trial for a supposed coup plot. The decision, made by Justice Alexandre de Moraes, cites Bolsonaro's use of his sons' social media to communicate with supporters during a protest. This development occurs amidst heightened political tensions, exacerbated by the U.S. Trump administration's criticism of the trial and sanctions against the presiding justice, which some in Brazil view as foreign intervention.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is dealing with the aftermath of Storm Floris, described as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory, which caused widespread power outages and travel chaos. In Scotland, approximately 50,000 homes lost electricity, and Network Rail reported numerous incidents on train lines due to gusts reaching up to 90 mph. While an amber weather alert has ended, a yellow warning remains in place for some areas as cleanup efforts continue. The storm also led to flight cancellations and disruptions to major events, including the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost 3-2 to the St. Louis Cardinals despite a strong seven-inning performance from starting pitcher Tyler Glasnow. Both Glasnow and Cardinals' starter Sonny Gray dominated, each allowing only one run before turning the game over to their bullpens. The lead changed hands in the eighth inning before a tie, but a go-ahead single in the ninth inning secured the victory for St. Louis. The loss highlights ongoing concerns with the Dodgers' bullpen reliability and injuries to key utility players.</p>

          <p>The United States is introducing a 12-month pilot program that will require some business and leisure travelers to pay a refundable bond of up to $15,000 to enter the country. This policy targets visitors from nations with high rates of visa overstays or those deemed to have insufficient security screening. The State Department will determine the specific bond amount, ranging from $5,000 to $15,000, based on individual circumstances. The program is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to tighten immigration laws and aims to assess the feasibility of using bonds to ensure compliance with visa terms.

          <p>Thirty years after "Operation Storm," which effectively ended Croatia's war of independence, Croatia and Serbia hold starkly different interpretations of the event. For Croatia, it is celebrated as a heroic military victory that reclaimed occupied territory and led to a turning point in the Bosnian War. Conversely, Serbia views it as a tragic pogrom that resulted in the mass exodus and murder of Serbian civilians. The anniversary highlights the persistent and conflicting national narratives that continue to define post-war relations in the region, with both nations holding military parades to mark the occasion.</p>

          <p>A manhunt is ongoing for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran suspected of killing four people at a bar in the small town of Anaconda, Montana.

          <p>Ranchers in Sonora, Mexico, are facing severe economic strain following the U.S. suspension of live cattle imports, a measure taken to prevent the spread of the New World Screwworm. This flesh-eating parasite poses a significant threat to livestock and has been detected moving north through Mexico. The ban has crippled a $1.2 billion export industry already weakened by years of drought, forcing ranchers to sell cattle domestically at a steep loss and diversify into other ventures to survive. The situation highlights the vulnerability of cross-border agricultural economies to biological threats and regulatory actions.</p>

          <p>Global leaders are meeting in Geneva for another round of UN negotiations aimed at creating a legally binding treaty to address the escalating plastic crisis.

Scientists estimate nearly 200 trillion pieces of plastic are in the oceans, posing a threat to wildlife and human health through chemical contamination. A coalition of nearly 100 countries is pushing for ambitious production limits, while some oil-producing nations advocate for a focus on waste management.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Poland's liberal democratic government, led by Donald Tusk, is losing momentum less than two years after ousting the populist Law and Justice party. The author suggests that by adopting some of his predecessors' rhetoric and policies, Tusk has failed to offer an inspiring new vision, leading to a slump in popularity. The piece warns that this pattern of post-populist disappointment is a global phenomenon, seen in countries like Brazil and the U.S. It concludes that without a compelling, forward-thinking agenda, liberal democrats risk their victories being mere interludes in a longer populist era.</p>

The policy had previously closed the asylum system to those entering the country illegally. A federal appeals court ruled that while the government can pause access to asylum, it cannot ignore other laws that protect migrants from being sent to places where they could face torture or persecution. This decision effectively reopens pathways for migrants to request humanitarian refuge, though they will likely remain in detention while their claims are processed.</p>

          <h2>Guide to Spotting Tarantulas in Southern California During Mating Season</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>It is currently tarantula mating season in California, a time when the typically reclusive male spiders emerge from their burrows in search of a mate. This annual event, lasting from August to December, makes sightings more common in areas like Joshua Tree National Park, the Santa Monica Mountains, and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. Experts note that while their appearance may be intimidating, California's native tarantulas are shy and pose no serious threat to humans, only biting if severely provoked. Their primary defense is flicking irritant hairs, so observers are advised to keep a respectful distance.</p>

          <p>A Harris County Precinct 5 deputy in Texas, Jennifer Escalera, is under internal investigation after posting a controversial video to TikTok while in uniform. The now-deleted clip featured a caption implying that her professional conduct, specifically handing out tickets, was influenced by a lack of sexual activity the previous night. The video sparked public outrage, with many residents calling the behavior unprofessional and a betrayal of public trust. The constable's office has confirmed the investigation, highlighting the ongoing challenges law enforcement agencies face with officers' personal social media use.</p>

          <h2>Nationwide Shortage of Volunteer Firefighters May Force Towns to Adopt Costlier Paid Services</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 21:11:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing shortage of volunteer firefighters across the U.S. is straining a system that saves taxpayers an estimated $46.9 billion annually. The number of volunteers, who make up nearly 70% of the nation's fire crews, has dropped by over 20% since 1985, while emergency call volumes have tripled. This decline is forcing some communities to switch to professional, taxpayer-funded fire departments. Lawmakers are considering incentives like student loan forgiveness to boost recruitment, as the shortage threatens the safety and financial stability of many small towns that rely on this critical service.</p>

Barkley, who has previously golfed with both Trump and Barack Obama, noted that he respects the office of the presidency but was surprised to see his name mentioned for the council.</p>

          <p>In a cave near Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales, archaeologists and cavers have discovered the remains of an auroch, an extinct breed of large wild cattle from the Bronze Age. The survey, part of a larger heritage project, also uncovered evidence of the cave system being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. These findings provide new insights into how prehistoric communities lived and farmed in the region. The project highlights the crucial role of collaboration between archaeologists and experienced cavers, who can access these otherwise unreachable historical sites.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) estimates that in the event of a military blockade by Beijing, Taiwan's natural gas reserves would be depleted in just two weeks. The analysis, based on 26 war-gaming scenarios, also found that coal supplies would last seven weeks and oil reserves 20 weeks. However, the report concludes that a blockade would not be a low-risk option for China, as it would likely incur high casualties and could easily escalate into a wider conflict involving the United States. The study suggests a blockade would put other nations on high alert, undermining a potential subsequent invasion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>More than £100 million in prize money from the UK's government-backed Premium Bonds savings program has gone unclaimed, according to a BBC investigation. The 2.5 million unclaimed prizes include eleven awards of £100,000. Critics argue that the operator, National Savings and Investments (NS&I), needs to reform its tracing process, which can be difficult for those who were gifted bonds or only possess old paper records. NS&I states it has successfully paid over 99% of winners and provides online tools and a tracing service, but some customers report the system is bureaucratic and rigid.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump commented on a controversial American Eagle advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, calling it the "HOTTEST ad out there" and praising Sweeney as a "registered Republican." His endorsement on social media led to a more than 20% surge in the company's stock price. The ad had previously drawn criticism from some who interpreted its wordplay on "genes" and "jeans" as echoing eugenics rhetoric. Trump contrasted the campaign's success with what he termed "woke" advertising failures, wading into a cultural debate that has now impacted the company's market performance.

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) is issuing a warning after multiple wild pigs in Monterey County were found to have blue-dyed muscle and fat tissue. An investigation confirmed the discoloration was caused by exposure to a rodenticide containing a blue dye. The pigs likely consumed the poison bait directly or ate other animals that had ingested it. Officials are urging pesticide applicators to use bait stations inaccessible to non-target wildlife and are warning hunters to avoid consuming any game animal with discolored tissue, as contamination may not always be visible.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows that lowering the recommended screening age for colorectal cancer to 45 has led to a significant increase in early-stage diagnoses for people aged 45-49. Following updated guidelines, screening rates in this age group rose by 62% between 2019 and 2023. This corresponds with a sharp rise in the detection of localized cancers, which are more treatable. While researchers celebrate this as promising news for public health, they also note that screening rates remain suboptimal and inequitable, highlighting the need for continued outreach and access.</p>

In a draft letter, the lawmakers argue that the current tragic moment highlights the overdue need for Palestinian self-determination and rights. The letter, which will be sent in September, adds that a viable Palestinian state must recognize Israel and guarantee its security. This move comes as several key U.S. allies have pledged to recognize Palestine, while the Trump administration has stated it views such a step as "rewarding Hamas."</p>
