          <p>Bitcoin has rebounded, surpassing $90,000 as investors seek refuge from turbulent stock markets and a weakening dollar. The cryptocurrency's recent gains coincide with increased pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. Spot bitcoin ETFs have seen significant inflows, indicating renewed investor confidence in the asset. Analyst Ed Engel notes Bitcoin's resilience and decoupling from risk assets, though light trading volumes suggest caution regarding further price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta's advertising revenue could decline by $7 billion this year due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, which are expected to impact retailers like Temu and Shien. These retailers, major advertisers on Facebook and Instagram, may reduce their ad spending in response to the trade dispute. Analysts at MoffettNathanson suggest that China is Meta's second-largest revenue source after the United States, despite the company not operating platforms within China. A broader recession, combined with trade tensions, could further decrease Meta's advertising revenue.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has cautioned that President Trump's sweeping tariffs pose a significant threat to the global economy. The IMF lowered its global growth forecast for this year and reduced its U.S. growth forecast even more sharply. The increased policy uncertainty stemming from the trade tensions is a major concern. The IMF's chief economist, Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, noted that the global economic system is being reset, and the surge in policy uncertainty is driving the economic outlook.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to end the IRS' Direct File program, a free tax-filing tool that has saved users an average of $160 each. While users praise the program's ease of use, private tax preparation companies have criticized it as a waste of taxpayer money. Democratic lawmakers are urging the administration to keep Direct File open, but Republican lawmakers and commercial tax preparation companies argue that free filing programs already exist. The IRS is undergoing a cost-cutting overhaul, which may impact the program's future.</p>

          <p>After 500 days of Javier Milei's presidency, Argentina is experiencing mixed results. His radical pro-market agenda has lifted currency controls and stabilized the peso, but poverty remains high and austerity measures have taken a toll on pensioners. While some economists praise Milei's reforms, others criticize the government's approach to suppressing inflation. The country's economic future remains uncertain, with questions about whether Milei can deliver long-term prosperity without leaving too many Argentinians behind.</p>
