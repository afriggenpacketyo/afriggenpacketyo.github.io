          <p>Former heavyweight world champion Deontay Wilder made a successful, albeit understated, return to boxing by defeating Tyrrell Herndon with a seventh-round stoppage. This was Wilder's first victory since October 2022, following a series of difficult losses that had cast doubt on his career. The fight lacked the usual spectacle of his major events, suggesting a more focused, stripped-back approach for the 39-year-old fighter. While the win was dominant, Wilder acknowledged he is still working to become a more complete fighter and rebuild his career.</p>

          <p>A rift has emerged within Germany's coalition government regarding the country's stance on nuclear energy. Economy Minister Katherina Reiche of the conservative CDU attended a meeting of pro-nuclear EU states, drawing criticism from Environment Minister Carsten Schneider of the SPD. Schneider emphasized that Germany's decision to phase out nuclear power is final and socially accepted, with the focus now on renewable energy. This disagreement highlights a fundamental policy clash over how to achieve climate neutrality, competitiveness, and energy sovereignty for Germany and the EU.</p>

          <p>According to Peng Wensheng, chief economist at China International Capital Corporation, China holds a significant competitive edge in the developing field of stablecoins due to its mature third-party payment platforms like WeChat and Alipay. He argues that this existing infrastructure, which functions similarly to stablecoins by pegging to fiat currency, is already supported by a robust regulatory framework. Peng suggests these platforms' stability is ensured by strict safeguards, including customer funds being backed by central bank money, positioning China favorably in the global economic debate.

          <p>A recent study from the Japan Institute for Health Security has indicated a correlation between a Japanese-style diet and a lower incidence of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research examined the effects of a diet rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and green tea. The study found that individuals who adhered to this traditional eating pattern, as well as a modified version that included more fruit and dairy, exhibited fewer symptoms of depression.

          <p>The European Union has formally proposed imposing international trade restrictions on all eel species under the Washington Convention, a treaty regulating endangered species. This move, which faces strong opposition from Japan, a major consumer of eel, would require export permits and proof of legal capture for species like the Japanese eel. If the proposal is adopted at the upcoming conference, the new regulations would take effect in June 2027. The measure aims to address the declining populations of various eel species globally by tightening control over their trade.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Kings General Manager Ken Holland is among those who prefer the traditional, centralized format of the NHL draft over the new, semi-remote version used this year. The new format, which saw teams making picks from their home cities while players were in Los Angeles, was plagued by technical glitches and lacked the energy of past events. Holland, an 'old-school' executive, remarked that the former system better celebrated the draftees, especially later-round picks who could share the moment with their families in the arena. His sentiment was reportedly shared by other GMs.</p>

          <p>Negotiators from Japan and the United States have agreed to continue discussions over tariffs, though significant disagreements persist, particularly concerning U.S. duties on the Japanese automotive industry. The talks in Washington occurred as a 90-day pause on certain U.S. reciprocal tariffs is set to expire in early July. The Trump administration has indicated the pause could be extended, but has shown no sign of lowering the 25% additional tariff on imported passenger vehicles. Japan maintains that these auto tariffs are unacceptable, creating a major obstacle in the ongoing trade talks. (not investment advice)</p>

The approach contrasts with the open-skull surgery method used by companies like Elon Musk's Neuralink.

According to industry leaders, these pressures have resulted in billions of dollars in losses across the sector, with many listed companies now operating in the red.
