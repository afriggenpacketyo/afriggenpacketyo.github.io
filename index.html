          <p>Following the advancement of the Trump-backed "Big, Beautiful Bill" in Congress, some liberals are criticizing Democratic Party elders for remaining in office too long, even until death. The criticism arose after the death of Rep. Gerry Connolly, which contributed to the bill's narrow passage, with some analysts suggesting that earlier retirements could have changed the outcome.

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Vladimir Putin's actions in Ukraine, prompting a response from the Kremlin suggesting he's suffering from "emotional overload." Trump's frustration stems from his belief that he has a personal connection with Putin and can influence him, though this has not translated into a change in Russia's behavior. The article notes that Putin's actions are now a liability for Trump, who had claimed he could end the war quickly. The author argues that Trump's frustration is a sign that he's admitting Putin is bent on the total conquest of Ukraine. The optimism score for this article is 40.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is ending federal court-ordered reforms of the Minneapolis Police Department, marking the fifth anniversary of George Floyd's death. This decision signals a broader effort to withdraw federal injunctions aimed at abusive and discriminatory police departments. The author argues that this move will result in a loss of a crucial tool for police reform and an inevitable increase in police violations and violence, especially against people of color. The political process has proven ineffective in changing policing, making federal intervention a necessary tool. The optimism score for this article is 25.</p>

          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics indicates that recent college graduates are facing increased difficulty finding employment, contributing to a rise in the national unemployment rate. The report attributes this trend to a mismatch between an oversupply of graduates in fields where business demand has waned, particularly in the tech industry. Economic uncertainty, driven by the Trump administration's tariff policies, is also slowing hiring. This situation can lead to underemployment, with qualified workers taking jobs outside their desired field. (not investment advice) The optimism score for this article is 35.</p>
