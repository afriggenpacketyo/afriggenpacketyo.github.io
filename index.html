          <p>Samsung Electronics announced a significant downturn in its second-quarter financial results, with operating profit falling by more than half compared to the previous year. The company's chip division was hit particularly hard, experiencing a nearly 94% collapse in profits due to inventory adjustments and impacts from export restrictions related to China. While the mobile division saw growth driven by strong sales of its Galaxy S25 and A series smartphones, the overall performance missed analyst expectations. Samsung plans to focus on high-demand AI-driven products and advanced semiconductors to navigate the challenging market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

West Yorkshire Police confirmed they were arrested on suspicion of affray and have since been released on bail. The airline has banned the individuals from future flights, stating it maintains a zero-tolerance policy for such appalling behavior on its family-friendly services.</p>

          <p>A significant diplomatic rift has emerged between the United States and several of its key allies, including the UK, France, and Canada, over the future of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. These allied nations have announced plans to recognize a Palestinian state, a move the Trump administration has boycotted, labeling it an anti-Israel "publicity stunt." This divergence highlights a lack of a clear, long-term US vision for post-war governance in Gaza beyond the removal of Hamas. European and Arab nations are now attempting to fill this strategic vacuum, pushing for a two-state solution even without American participation.</p>

          <p>An exceptionally powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake struck off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, generating tsunami waves that prompted warnings and advisories for Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, Japan, and other Pacific nations. The quake, one of the strongest ever recorded, caused flooding in parts of Russia, but the resulting waves in other regions like Hawaii and California were smaller than initially feared, leading to minor flooding but no major damage. Authorities urged coastal residents to evacuate to higher ground as a precaution. By Wednesday afternoon, most warnings had been downgraded or lifted.</p>

          <p>The United States has reached a trade deal with South Korea, imposing a 15% tariff on goods, including cars and semiconductors, thereby avoiding a threatened 25% levy.

South Korean President Lee Jae Myung praised the deal for maintaining competitiveness and for protecting sensitive agricultural sectors like rice and beef from further market opening. However, steel and aluminum imports will face a higher 50% tariff, consistent with rates applied to other nations.</p>

          <p>Plans by Elon Musk's The Boring Company to construct a 10-mile underground transit loop in Nashville have ignited a partisan dispute between state and local officials. The project, supported by Republican Governor Bill Lee, would be privately funded and aims to connect the city's downtown to its airport. However, Democratic lawmakers in Nashville are raising concerns about a lack of transparency, public input, and environmental assessments, particularly as the state considers granting the company a no-cost lease on public land. The controversy reflects growing scrutiny over Musk's business dealings and their intersection with state-level politics.</p>

Residents had raised concerns that increased density from duplexes could impede future emergency evacuations, citing the chaotic scenes from the January fire.

The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which it claims would be less costly and disruptive by avoiding the need to reroute the M25 motorway. The company estimates its project would cost under £25 billion and could be operational by 2035. This marks the first time a rival bid has been formally considered for the long-debated expansion, introducing new competition into the major infrastructure project.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's trade policies reveals significant impacts on the U.S. economy, including a surge in government tariff revenue to its highest levels in decades. However, the tariffs have not reduced the U.S. trade deficit; in fact, it has widened, partly due to companies stockpiling goods to avoid the import taxes. The policies have also shifted trade patterns, with U.S. imports from China decreasing while Chinese exports to other regions have grown.

          <p>Following the recent 8.8 magnitude earthquake near Russia, scientists explain the complex recipe required to create a tsunami. The key ingredients include a powerful underwater earthquake, typically magnitude 6.5 or higher, that causes a vertical shift in the seafloor. The depth of the quake and its proximity to the surface are also critical factors. While forecasting remains challenging, modern deep-ocean sensors are improving prediction accuracy. Scientists note that tsunamis travel at jet-plane speeds in the deep ocean but slow down and grow in height as they approach shallower coastal waters, which is when they become most dangerous.</p>

          <p>Researchers have used advanced near-infrared photography to reveal the stunningly detailed tattoos on a 2,500-year-old female "ice mummy" from the Pazyryk culture of Siberia. The high-resolution images show intricate designs of leopards, a stag, and mythical creatures that were previously difficult to see, showcasing a level of sophistication that would challenge a modern tattoo artist. By working with a specialist in ancient tattooing techniques, the team concluded the designs were likely stenciled and applied with multi-pointed tools. The findings offer a rare, personal glimpse into the artistic and cultural practices of this ancient nomadic people.</p>

          <p>Entering his ninth NFL season, cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon has become the most experienced player and a key leader in the Los Angeles Rams' secondary. At 30 years old, he is seen by defensive coordinator Chris Shula as the "Yoda" of the position group, providing a calming and savvy presence for younger teammates. After a successful 2023 season, the Rams re-signed Witherspoon to a one-year deal, a move he sees as a vote of confidence in the existing defensive personnel. Witherspoon is embracing his mentorship role, aiming to combine the defense's aggressive front with the secondary's experience.</p>

          <p>A diplomatic dispute has erupted between France and Spain following the removal of a group of French Jewish teenagers from a Vueling flight in Valencia. French ministers condemned the "excessive and brutal" force used by Spanish police, who handcuffed the group's female counselor, and criticized a Spanish minister's since-deleted comment calling the teens "Israeli brats." While the airline cited disruptive behavior and mishandling of safety equipment, other passengers and the group's representatives dispute this account, raising allegations of antisemitism. The incident has prompted France's foreign minister to express "deep concern" to the airline's CEO.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has initiated a large-scale recruitment campaign, offering signing bonuses of up to $50,000 to attract new deportation officers, lawyers, and investigators. The campaign, which uses patriotic themes, is funded by a recent congressional appropriation of $76.5 billion to the agency over five years, aimed at supporting the Trump administration's goal of one million annual deportations. The push to hire 10,000 new staff has raised concerns among former officials about the potential for lowered hiring and training standards, drawing parallels to issues faced by the Border Patrol during its own rapid expansion.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that his country plans to formally recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations General Assembly in September. This policy shift aligns Canada with other G7 nations like France and the UK, who recently made similar declarations. The recognition is conditional on the Palestinian Authority implementing democratic reforms and holding elections without the participation of Hamas. Citing the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and expanding Israeli settlements, Carney stated that the traditional negotiated two-state solution approach is "no longer tenable."

          <p>Following a request from President Trump, Texas Republicans are moving forward with a plan to redraw the state's congressional districts five years ahead of the typical schedule. The proposed map could significantly increase the GOP's House majority, prompting threats of retaliation from Democrats in states they control, such as California and Illinois. This has led to concerns about a potential "gerrymandering war," where maps are redrawn every election cycle for partisan advantage. Experts warn that such a practice would severely damage voters' faith in democratic institutions and create unprecedented political instability.</p>

          <p>Despite the immense power of the 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's coast, the resulting tsunami caused far less damage than its size might suggest. Scientists explain that key factors, including the tsunami's location and directionality, played a crucial role in mitigating its impact on populated areas. The main energy of the tsunami was directed into the open Pacific, roughly between Alaska and Hawaii, allowing it to dissipate significantly before reaching the U.S. West Coast. While the area near the epicenter saw damage, this "best-case scenario" for distant regions highlights the complex variables that determine a tsunami's destructive power.</p>

These include a strong labor market, healthy GDP growth, and robust reports from companies like Visa and Starbucks. Cramer believes Fed Chair Jerome Powell is taking a cautious approach because cutting rates prematurely could risk a resurgence of inflation, a scenario no central bank chief wants to risk.
