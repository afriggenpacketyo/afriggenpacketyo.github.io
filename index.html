          <p>A new report from research firm Yole Group projects that mainland China will significantly expand its global share of semiconductor foundry capacity, reaching 30% by 2030. This growth would position China ahead of current market leader Taiwan, reflecting Beijing's substantial progress toward chip self-sufficiency despite ongoing US technology restrictions. The report highlights that domestic Chinese chipmakers are expected to play an increasingly dominant role, expanding from their current 15% share of foundry capacity. This development underscores a major shift in the global semiconductor landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia's Immigration Minister, Tony Burke, has confirmed that the entry visa for the American musician Ye, formerly Kanye West, was revoked due to his pro-Nazi song. The song, which includes lyrics praising Adolf Hitler, has faced widespread condemnation and has been banned on several platforms. Minister Burke stated that while visa cancellations are typically for public advocacy, Ye's case was an exception made after the song's release, emphasizing that Australia does not need to import bigotry. The decision is not a permanent ban, and any future visa applications from Ye would be reassessed.</p>

          <p>According to payroll firm ADP, private sector employment in the United States unexpectedly declined by 33,000 in June, marking the first decrease since March 2023 and significantly missing economists' forecasts of a 100,000 job gain. The report indicates a potential cooling in the labor market, with job losses concentrated in service sectors like professional services and health, while goods-producing roles saw some expansion. This data introduces uncertainty about economic strength ahead of the official government jobs report, which is still expected to show growth. (not investment advice)</p>

The specifics of this bare-bones deal would then be negotiated at a later date, according to sources familiar with the talks. Tensions have been high since the Trump administration announced reciprocal tariffs in April, which have been temporarily suspended to allow for negotiations.

          <p>A new analysis in a Vox article argues that the Republican-led "One Big Beautiful Bill" could severely undermine the United States' leadership in artificial intelligence. The legislation's deep cuts to the social safety net are seen as unprepared for potential AI-driven job displacement. Furthermore, the bill's repeal of clean energy credits for wind and solar could slow the development of energy-hungry data centers, making the U.S. less competitive.

          <p>Virtual YouTubers, known as VTubers, are digital avatars powered by artificial intelligence that are earning millions and attracting massive online followings. These AI-driven personalities, often puppeteered by humans using motion-capture technology, create content for platforms like YouTube, with some channels generating seven-figure revenues. Advances in generative AI are making it easier to create these characters and automate content production, fueling their growth. While the trend is booming, it also raises concerns about the proliferation of low-quality, AI-generated content, often referred to as "AI slop," flooding social media feeds.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic details a growing sense of fear and uncertainty among Chinese students at American universities due to shifting U.S. government policies. Students report self-censoring their speech and worrying about sudden visa revocations, heightened border scrutiny, and a political climate they perceive as increasingly hostile. This anxiety is fueled by new rules targeting students in sensitive fields and broader rhetoric from the Trump administration. The students describe being caught in a geopolitical guessing game, feeling a chill that mirrors the very system they had sought to study away from.</p>

Much will depend on new leaders like Giulia Gwinn and Sjoeke NÃ¼sken, as well as forward Lea SchÃ¼ller, who is stepping into a primary goal-scoring role.

          <p>Heathrow Airport is exploring legal action against National Grid following a fire at an electrical substation that caused a complete airport shutdown in March. An investigation by the National Energy System Operator found that National Grid was aware of a fault caused by moisture at the substation as early as 2018 but repeatedly deferred maintenance. Heathrow stated that the grid operator "could and should" have prevented the fire and expects it to take accountability for the failings. The incident, which cost airlines up to Â£100m, has prompted a separate investigation by the energy regulator Ofgem.</p>

To ease the burden on industries, the proposal includes a provision allowing member states to use carbon credits from non-EU countries for up to 3% of the reduction.

          <p>Media conglomerate Paramount has agreed to a $16 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump regarding a CBS News '60 Minutes' interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris.

The settlement payment will go to Trump's future presidential library, not to him personally, and does not include an apology.
