          <p>The Trump administration has formally updated its tariff policy, issuing an executive order that adjusts duties for numerous countries and imposes a significant 40% tariff on all goods found to be transshipped to evade original duties. While some Asian nations received lower rates, countries like Syria, Laos, and Myanmar face duties of 40% or more, with the new rates taking effect on August 7. The move has created uncertainty in global markets, with experts noting that while some deals have been struck, many trading partners still face steep import taxes. This action continues the administration's strategy of using tariffs to renegotiate trade relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

Cambodia and Thailand expressed positive sentiments after seeing their proposed duties significantly reduced, with officials stating it would boost their economies and competitiveness. In contrast, Taiwan faces a 20% "temporary tariff" while negotiations continue, and India confronts a 25% rate as it works toward a trade agreement. The varied responses highlight the widespread impact of the U.S. trade policy and the ongoing efforts by nations to secure favorable terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia has publicly refuted claims of security vulnerabilities in its H20 chips, which are specifically designed for the Chinese market, after being questioned by China's cyberspace regulator. The Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) had raised concerns about potential tracking and remote control functions, a move that surprised the industry as Washington had approved the export of these chips. In a statement, Nvidia asserted its commitment to cybersecurity and denied the existence of any "back doors" that would allow unauthorized remote access. This development underscores the ongoing challenges for tech companies navigating the tense U.S.-China rivalry in artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>Florida has set a new record for the most executions in a single year since the U.S. reinstated the death penalty, after putting a 60-year-old man to death on Thursday. The man, convicted of the 1994 murders of his wife and two young children, was the ninth person executed in the state this year. This total surpasses Florida's previous record of eight executions in 2014 and makes it the state with the most executions in the nation for the current year. Opponents of the execution had pointed to the man's military service and the narrow 7-5 jury recommendation for his death sentence.</p>

In a public statement, the family described the comment as jarring and called for answers, emphasizing that their sister was "preyed upon" and not an object to be stolen. This development comes as Epstein's associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, was recently interviewed by the Justice Department. The family's reaction adds another layer to the complex and ongoing fallout from the Epstein case and his connections to powerful individuals.</p>

          <p>A new anti-poaching initiative in South Africa, known as the Rhisotope Project, is embedding radioactive material into rhino horns to deter trafficking. Launched by the University of the Witwatersrand and conservation partners, the project injects a small, harmless amount of radioactive isotope into the horns. This substance is undetectable to the rhino but can be easily identified by radiation detectors at borders and airports, making the horns a significant liability for smugglers. The innovative method aims to disrupt the black market and protect the country's declining rhino population, which is heavily targeted by poachers.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the tragic death of Becky Zerlentes, a 34-year-old professor and amateur boxer who died in 2005 after being knocked unconscious during a sanctioned fight in Colorado, becoming the first female boxer to die from injuries sustained in a U.S. ring. The piece explores the profound impact of her death on her husband, Stephan Weiler, and the opponent, Heather Schmitz, who was initially investigated for homicide. Weiler, now speaking out, reflects on the inherent dangers of combat sports and the lack of long-term support for families affected by such tragedies, drawing parallels to other athletes who have suffered similar fates.</p>

          <p>A notable shift is occurring in the space industry, with a growing emphasis on Mars as the ultimate destination, treating the Moon more as a "stepping stone." While NASA's Artemis program continues to advance lunar exploration with planned manned missions and a permanent habitat, the rhetoric from figures like Elon Musk and President Trump increasingly champions the colonization of the red planet. Other nations, including China and those in the European Space Agency, are also setting long-term goals for Mars missions. This trend suggests that while the Moon will remain a hub of activity, the grander ambitions of space exploration are now firmly fixed on Mars. (not investment advice)</p>

These unlicensed houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) often contain rats, black mould, and serious safety hazards, with evidence suggesting their numbers far exceed legally registered properties in some boroughs. The report highlights the story of a fatal fire in one such HMO, where a man died, and the landlords were subsequently fined.

The opposition has condemned the move, with one lawmaker declaring that "democracy has died in El Salvador."

          <p>Jen Easterly, who served as the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) under the Biden administration, has had her appointment as a distinguished chair at West Point rescinded. The decision by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll followed social media posts from a pro-Trump activist who accused Easterly of undermining the Trump administration and promoting "censorship" due to her work countering election disinformation. In a post, Easterly called the rescission a "casualty of casually manufactured outrage." This is the second instance of a high-profile dismissal following public pressure from the same activist.</p>

          <h2>Columnist Argues US Healthcare Failures Are Not Australia's Fault</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece pushes back against the characterization of countries like Australia as "freeloaders" on the U.S. for paying less for prescription drugs. The author highlights the grim statistics of the American healthcare system, which spends nearly twice as much per person as other wealthy nations for worse health outcomes and lower life expectancy. The article suggests that instead of blaming other countries, the U.S. could adopt successful policies from abroad, such as Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). The author concludes that the U.S. administration's approach is more about bullying than systematic reform. (not investment advice)</p>

Harris clarified she is not giving up the fight but wants to engage with Americans outside of a transactional, political context.

After being released pending review, the District Attorney's office reopened the case and issued an arrest warrant. She now faces multiple felony charges, including bringing an illegal substance into a jail facility.

          <p>An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan has sentenced 108 members of former Prime Minister Imran Khan's political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), to prison terms. The convictions are related to their involvement in the violent nationwide protests that occurred in May 2023 following Khan's arrest. Among those sentenced is opposition leader Omar Ayub Khan, who received a 10-year term. The PTI has denounced the rulings as politically motivated and a "black day for democracy," vowing to challenge the verdict, which it sees as a targeted crackdown on Khan's allies and supporters.</p>

          <p>For the first time in seven years, annual university tuition fees for undergraduate degrees in England and Wales have risen, increasing by 3% to £9,535. Maintenance loans for student living costs have also been increased to help offset the rising cost of living. The fee hike comes after universities warned of significant financial pressures due to years of frozen fees and high inflation, with many expecting to run a deficit. The change means students are now facing higher direct costs for their education, while student loan repayment rules have also been altered, likely increasing the total amount paid back over time.

However, this article questions the strategy, arguing that the team could have traded impending free agents to build for the future.
