          <p>President Trump announced plans to expand deportation operations in cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, citing a need to detain and deport undocumented immigrants. In a social media post, Trump accused these cities of using undocumented immigrants to expand their voter base and grow the welfare state. He ordered ICE officers to pursue the "single largest Mass Deportation Program in History," focusing on the remigration of aliens and preventing the admission of anyone undermining domestic tranquility. The announcement signals a continued hardline stance on immigration policy from the Trump administration, even as critics argue that such measures could disrupt essential labor forces and separate families.</p>

          <p>North Korean troops fighting alongside Russia in Ukraine have rapidly adapted their tactics, particularly in drone warfare, posing potential implications for the Korean Peninsula. Initially using outdated World War II tactics, they quickly learned to manage the battlefield with drones and electronic warfare. Ukrainian soldiers noted their disciplined fighting style and willingness to retrieve fallen comrades, a stark contrast to Russian troops. As the war continues, the knowledge gained by these North Korean soldiers could present a threat to South Korea, especially in the realm of drone technology, according to security analysts. The Ukrainians have warned that the Russians have begun sharing the technological know-how with the North Koreans in exchange for the soldiers who are fighting in Ukraine. The Ukrainians have reported that the North Koreans have become proficient in shooting down drones with rifles and other weaponry. This is a significant development in the ongoing conflict. </p>

          <p>A former U.S. ambassador to the UN criticizes the UN Security Council's handling of the Gaza conflict, citing Russia and China's exploitation of the situation to deflect attention from the war in Ukraine. The author recounts instances where the U.S. vetoed resolutions lacking clear condemnation of Hamas and failing to recognize Israel's right to self-defense. The article accuses some council members of prioritizing political agendas over achieving a practical and implementable ceasefire, which is why the United States exercised its veto power. The author argues that the Security Council's divisions and politicization have rendered it irrelevant to resolving the conflict, emphasizing that Hamas must disarm for peace to be achieved.</p>

          <p>A new drug, Vykat XR, has been approved for treating Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by insatiable hunger, offering hope for patients and insights into the biology of extreme appetite. However, this breakthrough comes amid concerns about cuts to federal funding for health research, which could disrupt efforts to understand and treat obesity's many causes and pathways. While the new medication is a positive development, the high cost and potential side effects remain challenges.

This move reinforces existing U.S. export restrictions and aims to tighten loopholes, potentially raising the punishment for future breaches. The action reflects Taiwan's commitment to national security and its cooperation with the U.S. in restricting access to advanced technologies.</p>

          <p>Chinaâ€™s navy is expanding beyond the strategic island chains that have traditionally defined defensive boundaries for the United States and its allies in the Western Pacific. The deployment of two Chinese aircraft carrier groups in the open waters of the Pacific Ocean since late May underscores Beijingâ€™s ambition to become a blue-water navy by 2035. The island chain strategy, proposed in 1951, aimed to contain communist powers using American-aligned island bases. While the strategy became less prominent after the Cold War, it has re-emerged as a way to counter a rising China, but its effectiveness is now being questioned.</p>

          <p>The owners of a former Michelin-starred restaurant in Japan were arrested for ignoring an order to temporarily shut down after a food poisoning outbreak. Hirokazu Kitano, his son Hirotoshi, and wife Noriko, who operated Kiichi restaurant in Osaka Prefecture, allegedly violated the Food Sanitation Act. The restaurant had been ordered to suspend business after 33 customers experienced vomiting and diarrhea, with norovirus detected in some individuals.

          <p>Up to 100 truckloads of Scotland's waste will be moved each day to England once a landfill ban comes into effect at the end of the year. The Scottish government is banning "black bag" waste from being buried in landfill from December 31, but acknowledges that there are not enough incinerators to meet the extra demand. It is leaving a "capacity gap" which is estimated by Zero Waste Scotland to be 600,000 tonnes in the first year of the ban. While the reason for the ban is to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases coming from landfill sites, the short-term impact will be a rise in emissions from the fleet of heavy vehicles taking the waste to sites in England.</p>
