          <p>Gabrielle has intensified into a Category 1 hurricane, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic season. While no watches or warnings are currently in effect for land, its center is projected to pass east of Bermuda on Monday, with forecasters noting the potential for rapid strengthening. The National Hurricane Center warns that swells from the storm will likely generate life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward into Canada early this week.</p>

          <p>South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung has stated he would accept an interim deal where North Korea freezes its nuclear weapons program as a "feasible, realistic alternative" to the long-term goal of complete denuclearization. In an interview, Lee emphasized that this "emergency measure" would halt the North's production of 15-20 new nuclear weapons annually. He expressed hope that former U.S. President Trump, who he believes has mutual trust with Kim Jong Un, could resume negotiations that broke down in 2019, potentially enhancing regional and global security.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has officially approved a £2.2 billion plan to bring Gatwick Airport's existing northern runway into regular use, effectively creating a second runway. The government and airport officials champion the privately-financed project as a major opportunity for economic growth, projecting it will increase flight capacity and create jobs. However, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental campaigners and local groups concerned about increased noise, traffic congestion, and climate impacts from the significant expansion.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly set to announce a potential link between the use of Tylenol by pregnant women and an increased risk of autism in their children, a claim that contradicts current medical guidelines. The announcement, expected Monday, may also include exploring the drug leucovorin as a potential treatment for autism. This move follows President Trump's public statement about a forthcoming "very important announcement on autism," prompting concern within the medical community due to the lack of established scientific consensus supporting such a connection.</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Eagles staged a remarkable comeback to defeat the Los Angeles Rams 33-26, erasing a 19-point second-half deficit. The game's dramatic conclusion saw the Rams line up for a potential game-winning 44-yard field goal in the final seconds. However, Eagles defensive lineman Jordan Davis blocked the kick, recovered the ball, and returned it for a touchdown as time expired, sealing the improbable victory. The loss was a major setback for the previously undefeated Rams, while the Eagles maintained their perfect season record.</p>

          <p>A three-year-old female mountain lion, known as F390 and the mother of two 14-month-old cubs, was struck and killed by a vehicle on State Route 74 in Orange County. Researchers expressed concern for the adolescent cubs, who were still dependent on their mother for learning crucial survival and hunting skills. The UC Davis California Carnivores Program, which was tracking the mother via a GPS collar, has since successfully collared one of the cubs to monitor her progress. The incident highlights the significant threat that road traffic poses to wildlife in habitats fragmented by development.</p>

          <p>Peach farmers in California's Central Valley are reporting significant harvest declines, with some seeing up to a 30% reduction, which they attribute to warmer winter temperatures. According to agricultural experts, fruit trees like peaches, plums, and apricots require a specific number of "chill hours" below 45 degrees Fahrenheit to properly regulate their growth cycles. Unseasonably warm winters disrupt this process, leading to poor fruit production. This trend is causing financial strain for farmers and leading to higher prices for consumers, highlighting the tangible impacts of climate change on agriculture.</p>

          <p>Gary Cohn, who served as National Economic Council director in the first Trump administration, has stated that the U.S. job market is degrading, pointing to a slowdown in job creation from over 100,000 to less than 50,000 per month recently. Speaking on Sunday, the IBM vice chair noted that companies facing rising input costs are cutting back on labor expenses to protect their profit margins. He suggested that after a period of "labor hoarding" post-COVID, businesses are now aggressively managing human capital costs, a trend he believes is reflected in recent economic data and the Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates.

          <p>President Trump appeared to dismiss concerns over a new Pentagon directive that significantly restricts journalists' ability to report on U.S. military matters. When asked about the policy, which requires reporters to pledge not to gather any information not officially authorized for release, Trump stated, "Nothing stops reporters." The memo, issued by Trump-appointed Department of War head Pete Hegseth, has been heavily criticized by press freedom advocates. They argue it acts as an unconstitutional prior restraint on publication and transforms independent reporting into government-approved information.</p>

          <p>England secured a 2-0 series win over Ireland in their first-ever T20 series, clinching the final match by six wickets in Malahide. After being set a target of 155, England's chase was anchored by a crucial half-century from Jordan Cox, who scored 55 runs. England's bowlers, led by Adil Rashid's three wickets, had earlier restricted the Irish batting lineup effectively on a slower pitch. The victory caps a successful series for the English side under the captaincy of Jacob Bethell, sealing the win with 17 balls to spare.</p>

          <p>London's Mayor Sadiq Khan has initiated a one-day trial banning traffic from a half-mile stretch of Oxford Street, one of the world's busiest shopping districts. The event, called "This is Oxford Street," is a precursor to a larger plan to permanently pedestrianize the area between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch to increase footfall and improve the shopping experience. While many pedestrians welcomed the car-free environment, the proposal has raised concerns from some local councillors and residents about traffic being diverted to smaller side streets and potential accessibility issues for people with mobility challenges.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has sharply criticized Charles Kushner, the U.S. Ambassador to France, calling his public letter about rising antisemitism in the country an "unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat." In the letter, Kushner accused Macron's government of insufficient action and linked its foreign policy, including gestures toward Palestinian statehood, to endangering Jewish life in France. Macron firmly rejected the claims, stating that a diplomat's role is not to make such public condemnations and that disagreeing with the Israeli government does not make him antisemitic.</p>

Brussels Airport has asked airlines to cancel half of their Monday flights as there is no clear timeline for a secure resolution.

          <p>The Great Britain and Northern Ireland team concluded the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo with its worst performance in nearly two decades, failing to secure a single gold medal for the first time since 2003. The team finished with a total of five medals—two silver and three bronze—matching its lowest overall count since 2005. This result is a significant drop from the 10 medals won at both the previous World Championships and the 2024 Paris Olympics. The disappointing campaign was compounded by injuries to key athletes and a failure to win any relay medals.</p>

The footage shows the massive cats snarling, biting, and swatting at their cage doors with incredible fury just before being set free. Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are the largest tiger subspecies and are critically endangered, with only 500 to 600 estimated to be left in the wild.

Each American player will receive a $500,000 payment, a controversial move in an event where Europeans continue to play for free. Donald believes that if the expensive-to-watch U.S. team struggles, the fans' high expectations combined with the player payments could create a uniquely pressurized environment.
