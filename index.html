          <p>Donald Trump's attempt to overturn a civil jury verdict finding him liable for sexually assaulting writer E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s and defaming her has failed.

Carroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, expressed satisfaction with the decision, stating that Trump remains liable for sexual assault and defamation.

          <p>Stocks declined on Friday as oil prices surged following Israel's military strikes on Iran.

The market reaction was driven by concerns about a broader military conflict and potential impacts on oil supply. U.S. benchmark crude oil increased significantly, and airlines experienced sharp losses due to rising fuel costs and travel uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Louis Theroux's documentary, "The Settlers," explores the lives and beliefs of Israeli settlers in the West Bank, some of whom are now setting their sights on Gaza. The documentary features Daniella Weiss, a prominent figure in the settler movement, who dismisses international law and expresses a desire to retake the Gaza Strip. The film also highlights the demeaning restrictions on Palestinian life and the intensity of the Israeli military occupation, raising questions about the future of the region.</p>

That has prompted worries that we could be facing another period of sharply higher energy prices, leading to a bout of higher prices for everything from petrol and food to holidays. The main questions are how long Israel and Iran remain locked in this conflict, whether other countries in the region are drawn in, and whether the US steps in to de-escalate the situation.</p>
