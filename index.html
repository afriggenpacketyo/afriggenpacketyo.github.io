          <p>Wildfires sparked by lightning have forced evacuations at Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona. The Dragon Bravo Fire has led to a mandatory evacuation order for all residents on the North Rim, with about 500 visitors also having been evacuated. A separate, larger blaze, the White Sage Fire, is burning north of the park and is also uncontained, challenging firefighters with strong winds and dry conditions. These incidents highlight the growing risk of wildfires in the western U.S. due to persistent hot and dry weather.</p>

          <p>Google has announced a significant move in the AI talent competition by hiring Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior employees. The $2.4 billion deal involves licensing fees and compensation, though Google is not investing in Windsurf itself, which remains an independent entity. This acquisition underscores the intense rivalry among tech giants like Google, Meta, and Microsoft to secure top AI expertise, particularly in the burgeoning field of AI-assisted software development.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers following a backlash over sandals that resembled traditional Kolhapuri chappals. The controversy erupted after Prada showcased the design at Milan Men's Fashion Week without acknowledging its Indian origins, prompting criticism on social media. In response, Prada initiated talks with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents Kolhapuri artisans, to explore future collaborations. This move is seen as a step toward respectful engagement between global fashion brands and traditional craft communities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, halting immigration raids that rely on unconstitutional tactics in several Southern California counties. The ruling responds to a lawsuit by the ACLU, which argued that federal agents were violating the Fourth and Fifth Amendments by targeting individuals based on race or ethnicity. The judge found a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims, enjoining agents from making stops based solely on factors like appearance, speaking Spanish, or location. This decision provides a temporary stop to controversial enforcement actions amid heightened community fear.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company deceptively used their voices to create AI clones for its text-to-speech platform without their consent. While the judge dismissed a federal copyright claim on the voices themselves, claims of breach of contract, deceptive practices, and copyright infringement related to training data will proceed. The decision is considered a significant victory for artists seeking to protect their work from unauthorized use by AI companies.</p>

          <p>The preliminary investigation into the Air India Flight 171 crash has revealed a perplexing detail: both engine fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position just seconds after takeoff. Cockpit audio captured one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, with the other denying he did so, leading to a total power loss. Investigators are trying to determine if this was an intentional act or a result of confusion, as the switches have safety features to prevent accidental activation. This finding has intensified the mystery surrounding the crash that killed 260 people in Ahmedabad.</p>

          <p>A plan to dismantle a 123-year-old railway bridge in Prague has ignited a fierce debate between the national Railway Authority and preservation advocates. The authority argues that the corroding Vysehrad bridge cannot handle projected increases in rail traffic and must be replaced with a new, three-track structure. However, a coalition of experts, backed by UNESCO and a public petition, insists the iconic bridge can be repaired and preserved while a second, new bridge is built alongside it. The conflict represents a classic dilemma between modern infrastructure needs and the protection of cherished historical landmarks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has laid off 1,353 civil and foreign service employees as part of a sweeping reorganization plan by the Trump administration. The cuts, which are part of a larger workforce reduction of nearly 3,000 staff, have significantly impacted bureaus focused on human rights, refugee resettlement, and foreign assistance. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the layoffs will undermine U.S. diplomacy and national security. The administration contends the changes are necessary to eliminate redundant offices and streamline the department's focus on its core mission.</p>

Defectors and UN officials have highlighted the harsh treatment of workers and the displacement of local residents without compensation. The resort's opening illustrates the regime's efforts to boost its sanctioned economy while masking the severe human cost of its development projects.</p>

          <p>An intense and prolonged marine heatwave in the western Mediterranean Sea is raising alarm among scientists about its potential consequences for marine life. Sea surface temperatures have regularly exceeded 30°C, several degrees above normal for this time of year, creating conditions that many species struggle to survive in. This extreme heat, driven by climate change, can lead to mass mortality events for critical species like seagrasses, with cascading effects on fish stocks and the overall ecosystem. The event serves as a stark warning of the growing threat that warming oceans pose to marine biodiversity.</p>

The OBR cautioned that the country faces "daunting" fiscal risks, with debt levels potentially soaring, and that current spending promises are unaffordable without changes. This has led to widespread expectations that Chancellor Rachel Reeves will be forced to implement significant tax rises, potentially between £10bn and £20bn, to stabilize the public finances and maintain her fiscal rules.

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final presents a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova. While Swiatek has more major-final experience, Anisimova's aggressive, free-swinging style and underdog status could make her particularly dangerous on the grass court. Analysts note that Swiatek has adapted her game for grass by moving further behind the baseline to better utilize her powerful topspin forehand. The key to victory will likely be who better manages the pressure of the occasion in their first-ever tour-level meeting.</p>

While maintaining the U.S. alliance as a pillar of security, this recalibration involves pragmatic engagement with China, as demonstrated by his upcoming state visit to Beijing.

Lula stated that if negotiations fail, Brazil will use a reciprocity law to match any U.S. tariffs. The move represents a significant escalation, risking a trade war as Trump uses economic policy to interfere in another nation's judicial process. (not investment advice)</p>
