            <p>A federal judge ruled that the White House cannot bar Associated Press (AP) reporters from areas like the Oval Office and Air Force One. The ruling stated that restricting access based on the AP's continued use of 'Gulf of Mexico' instead of the president's preferred 'Gulf of America' violates the First Amendment. The judge clarified that the AP doesn't have special privileges but cannot be treated worse than other news outlets. The White House has been given time to appeal the ruling, which affirms the press's right to report freely without government retaliation.</p>

The study also highlights the stark realities of poverty's impact on brain development, revealing similar risks for full-term babies from deprived backgrounds as premature babies from affluent families.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

She also noted that relocating Apple's supply chain would take years, and most experts deem it impossible to fully manufacture iPhones in the U.S. The comments come as Apple shares face pressure due to the company's manufacturing exposure to China and the imposed tariffs.

            <p>The US Congress heard that export controls alone will not ensure America's leadership in artificial intelligence (AI). Analysts testified that Washington must increase funding to counter China's rapidly advancing AI sector. Beijing's ability to develop cutting-edge AI systems at lower costs could shift the balance of tech and economic power. While export restrictions on advanced AI chips have been imposed, these measures are considered insufficient to address the broader challenge.</p>

            <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has eliminated the Division of Learning and Organizational Development (DLOD), which trained staff and healthcare professionals. This action is part of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s plan to restructure the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). All DLOD employees were laid off, leading to the cancellation of planned activities, including training on opioid safety and medication error prevention. Some HHS personnel and programs may be reinstated, but it is unclear if that includes DLOD employees.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump signed executive orders to revive coal production by allowing older coal-fired power plants to remain open, citing increased power demand from data centers and AI. Environmentalists criticized the move, stating Trump is stuck in the past and wants utility customers to pay more for outdated energy. The orders direct agencies to end discriminatory policies against the coal industry and promote grid security by prioritizing secure energy production. These actions contrast with Joe Biden's climate rules aimed at reducing carbon pollution from coal plants.</p>

            <p>President Trump's aides face scrutiny for delivering mixed messages on tariffs, creating confusion about the administration's trade agenda. While Trump boasts about negotiating deals for tariff relief, his aides have insisted that tariffs are not bargaining chips. This inconsistency has damaged the credibility of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who are tasked with explaining the plan to Wall Street. The conflicting messaging undermines business confidence and increases market uncertainty.</p>

            <p>Some Affordable Care Act (ACA) enrollees may face unexpected tax bills due to past fraud by rogue brokers.

With fewer caseworkers, resolving issues will take longer, and potential changes to premium tax credits could increase monthly premium costs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An analysis suggests that the Trump administration's air war against the Houthi rebels in Yemen is unlikely to achieve its goals and could backfire. The article argues that air power alone rarely wins wars and that the Houthis have the advantage of a remote, mountainous hinterland. It also notes the lack of a ground offensive or diplomatic engagement with the Houthis' rivals, and suggests that the administration's actions may be inadvertently damaging its allies in Yemen.</p>
