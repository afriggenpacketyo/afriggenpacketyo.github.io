          <p>TCL's chairman, Li Dongsheng, stated that while the US is TCL's largest overseas market, establishing a US factory isn't currently economically viable due to unstable US policies.  He emphasized that long-term economic benefits, not short-term policy shifts, will drive Chinese companies' overseas expansion decisions.  Stable tax policies and competitive industrial policies would be necessary to change this calculation.</p>
