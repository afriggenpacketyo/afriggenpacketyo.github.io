          <p>President Trump announced that the Department of Justice intends to sue California over Governor Gavin Newsom's efforts to create a new, Democratic-leaning congressional map. This legal challenge comes shortly after Trump praised Texas Republican legislators for successfully codifying a new map designed to give the GOP an advantage in five more U.S. House races in the 2026 midterm elections. Trump asserted that the DOJ would file the lawsuit soon, while Newsom issued a defiant public response. The article highlights the escalating political tensions surrounding redistricting, a process usually undertaken every ten years after the U.S. Census, but now a contentious mid-decade issue in states like Texas and California.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former New York Giants safety Jack Brewer argues that ex-convicts, facing significant challenges in reintegrating into society, should fill commercial truck driver jobs instead of migrants. He supports Secretary of State Marco Rubio's order to bar illegal immigrants and certain visa holders from obtaining commercial driver's licenses, issued after a deadly crash involving an undocumented trucker. Brewer, who leads a foundation assisting formerly incarcerated men, highlighted the paradox of trained ex-cons being blocked from these jobs due to probation rules. He emphasized prioritizing U.S. citizens for such roles, particularly those with additional hurdles like criminal records, suggesting this approach addresses both labor needs and social reintegration.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, led by Republican Rep. James Comer, has issued a subpoena to Jeffrey Epstein's estate, seeking a range of documents and communications from 1990 to 2019. This includes videos from Epstein's properties, contact books, and a leather-bound book compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell for his 50th birthday, which reportedly contains a letter from President Trump. Trump has dismissed the alleged letter as "fake" and filed a defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for reporting on it. The committee's investigation aims to scrutinize the government's handling of the Epstein case and enforcement of sex trafficking laws.</p>

Norrie, who also dealt with an arm injury in 2024, admitted to pre-match nerves despite his experience at Flushing Meadows.

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper announced an $18 billion deal to acquire Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's, aiming to boost its struggling coffee division. Following the announcement, Keurig Dr Pepper's stock fell 11%, while JDE Peet's shares rose 15%. The acquisition, expected to close in early 2026, will be followed by Keurig Dr Pepper splitting its beverage and coffee units into two separate, U.S.-listed companies, effectively unwinding its 2018 merger. This strategic move seeks to enhance appeal to at-home coffee drinkers and compete in the cold coffee market, reflecting broader industry trends and competition. (not investment advice)</p>

The company typically uses limited theatrical releases as marketing tools or for awards consideration, leveraging "eventizing" to create buzz without traditional costly campaigns.

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at punishing individuals who burn the American flag, asserting it "incites riots" and could lead to a year in prison. The directive, titled "Prosecuting Burning of the American Flag," instructs the Justice Department to pursue cases that violate "content-neutral laws" while causing harm unrelated to expression, such as violent crimes. However, the order faces constitutional challenges, as the Supreme Court ruled in 1989 and 1990 that flag burning is protected speech under the First Amendment. Legal experts emphasize that the president cannot unilaterally alter constitutional rights, setting up a potential legal battle over the order's enforceability.</p>

          <h2>Understanding the Consequences of Defaulting on a Reverse Mortgage for Seniors</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reverse mortgages allow seniors to convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, but failing to meet obligations like property taxes or insurance can have severe consequences. Defaulting immediately makes the entire loan balance due, potentially leading to swift foreclosure proceedings, unlike traditional mortgages. Additionally, missed obligations can result in liens against the home and negatively impact credit scores, making future financing difficult. Despite these risks, reverse mortgages can be a valuable tool for "house-rich but cash-poor" retirees when managed responsibly, offering financial flexibility and access to equity without selling their homes.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starbucks stock experienced a 2% drop, likely influenced by a Bloomberg report detailing the company's plan to scale back production at its U.S. plants from seven days a week to five, starting in January. This move, potentially driven by cost-cutting and lower demand after six consecutive quarters of negative same-store sales, raised competitive concerns. While the company declined to comment, the reduction in capacity suggests a response to decreased customer demand. Despite the negative implications for immediate growth, the article notes that increased operational efficiency could be a long-term benefit, especially with coffee prices returning to May highs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cracker Barrel's recent logo redesign, intended as part of a brand refresh, sparked public outcry and a nearly $100 million drop in market value. Brand experts attribute the "flop" to the company abandoning its core "brand story," which previously evoked a "southern, whimsical atmosphere" and "homestyle country cooking." The removal of the iconic "Uncle Herschel" figure and the namesake barrel from the logo alienated loyal customers who associated the image with a "simpler time." This incident underscores the significant risks companies face when modernizing legacy brands, especially in a polarized cultural environment where even seemingly apolitical changes can draw intense criticism.</p>

This appointment comes amidst controversy, as Nakagawa's predecessor, Jane Raleigh, alleged her dismissal was retaliation for supporting a union organizing campaign. The article notes Nakagawa's lack of prior curatorial or administrative experience for such a high-profile role. This development also coincides with the Kennedy Center's request for increased federal funding, which Senate Republicans voted to delay unless the opera house is renamed, adding a political layer to the institution's internal turmoil.</p>
