          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has filed a $787 million defamation lawsuit against Fox News, alleging the network knowingly spread false information about him. The lawsuit centers on comments made by anchor Jesse Watters, who claimed Newsom lied about a phone call with President Donald Trump. The damages sought are nearly identical to the amount Fox paid to settle the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit. Newsom's legal team stated the suit would be dropped if Fox News retracts the claim and issues a formal on-air apology for its reporting.</p>

          <p>A major fire has broken out on a scrap metal-carrying vessel docked at Albert Dock in Hull, England, sending a large plume of smoke across the city. Humberside Fire and Rescue Service responded with multiple engines and an aerial platform to tackle the blaze, which started in the ship's cargo hold. All crew members were safely accounted for, but local authorities have closed nearby roads and shops as a precaution.

          <p>The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Universal Service Fund, a multi-billion-dollar program designed to expand telephone and internet access. In a 6-3 decision, the court ruled that Congress did not unlawfully delegate its legislative powers to the FCC when creating the fund. This program, which collects nearly $10 billion annually from telecom carriers, subsidizes services for low-income households, rural areas, schools, and healthcare providers. The ruling rejects a challenge that sought to revive the nondelegation doctrine, preserving a key mechanism for improving national telecommunications infrastructure.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has escalated his public attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "very stupid person" and fueling speculation about an early nomination for his successor. This renewed criticism comes as Wall Street traders increase their bets on multiple interest rate cuts this year, potentially influenced by the political pressure on the central bank. Potential candidates rumored to be on Trump's shortlist include Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and former World Bank President David Malpass.

          <p>The Supreme Court issued a 6-3 ruling that curtails the ability of federal judges to impose nationwide injunctions, which have been used to block policies from both Republican and Democratic administrations. The decision stemmed from legal challenges to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, but the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the order itself. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, writing for the majority, argued that such broad injunctions likely exceed the authority Congress granted to federal courts. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned that "no right is safe" under this new legal framework.</p>

A DW Fact Check found these claims to be false. The article notes that while Mamdani's criticism of Israeli government policies is controversial for some, it does not conclusively meet definitions of antisemitism, and he has been endorsed by Jewish politicians. Furthermore, there is no evidence he has ever advocated for a theocracy; his platform focuses on affordability and progressive policies like LGBTQIA+ rights, which often conflict with conservative religious laws.</p>

          <p>Anna Wintour, a dominant figure in the fashion industry for decades, is stepping back from her direct editorial duties at U.S. Vogue. While she will retain her top titles as Vogue's global editorial director and CondÃ© Nast's chief content officer, the U.S. edition of the magazine will recruit a new head of editorial content. This move aligns the U.S. publication's structure with other international editions of Vogue. The change will allow Wintour, 75, who has been editor-in-chief since 1988, to focus more on her overarching global and corporate responsibilities within the CondÃ© Nast media empire.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated his government has struck "the right balance" on welfare reforms after making concessions to his own Labour MPs. The initial, stricter plans to change the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) benefit faced a significant backbench rebellion, prompting the government to apply the new criteria only to new claimants. While the compromise has satisfied many of the rebels, some MPs on the left of the party still intend to vote against the bill. The episode has highlighted internal party tensions over both the policy itself and communication between party leadership and backbenchers.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has confirmed details of a trade framework with the United States aimed at easing tensions over technology and critical resources.

This development follows high-level talks in London and stabilizes a relationship that had become fraught with disputes over export curbs and tech restrictions. While the announcement is seen as an encouraging step, analysts advise caution, noting a lack of specific details on which restrictions will be lifted.</p>

          <p>Tesla recently held a supervised, invite-only launch for its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, yielding mixed results. Some participants, like Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, praised the event as a success, highlighting the vehicles' smooth maneuverability. However, other reports noted significant issues, including a vehicle driving on the wrong side of the road and another stopping abruptly in traffic. The launch underscores Tesla's unique camera-based approach to autonomous driving, which differs from competitors like Waymo that use lidar and radar, and revives the debate over the feasibility and safety of its technology.</p>

The deal is part of a broader framework to implement a previous trade consensus reached in Geneva, aimed at de-escalating trade tensions. China had previously restricted exports of these critical minerals, which are vital for automotive, aerospace, and military manufacturing, in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. In return for the renewed supply, the U.S. is expected to roll back some of its own countermeasures against Beijing.</p>

The military junta that seized power in 2021 is accused of using the narcotics trade to finance its war effort.

The author, a former political prisoner, recounts personal experiences of being detained in unmarked compounds and interrogated in secret safe houses disguised as mundane offices. This hidden infrastructure of the Islamic Republic, embedded within the civilian fabric, is designed to remain unseen but was briefly illuminated by recent Israeli airstrikes. The article argues that the ongoing conflict in Iran is a struggle between the public's desire to live openly and the regime's omnipresent, clandestine apparatus of power.</p>

The Hispanic Construction Council estimates a current shortage of 500,000 workers, and the crackdown on this informal labor market is expected to have ripple effects throughout the economy. The situation highlights the complex interplay between immigration policy, labor supply, and economic stability in the U.S.</p>

          <p>German federal prosecutors have indicted a Syrian teenager for his alleged role in a foiled terrorist plot targeting a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna last year. The teen is accused of supporting a foreign terrorist organization by translating a bomb-making manual from Arabic and connecting the primary Austrian suspect with an "Islamic State" member. The plot allegedly involved driving a car loaded with explosives into the crowd of concertgoers. The incident led to the cancellation of three of Swift's scheduled performances in Vienna due to the security concerns raised by the arrests.</p>

          <p>A new, 30-meter-long slide at a popular tourist spot in Kitakyushu, Japan, has been temporarily closed after four people sustained broken bones while using it. The incidents, which occurred shortly after the slide opened in late April, involved a tourist from Taiwan, a municipal employee, a toddler, and a man in his 70s. According to the local government, some injuries may be linked to users not adhering to the recommended age range of 6 to 12. Officials are planning to improve warning signage in multiple languages with the hope of reopening the attraction in July.</p>

          <h2>Florida's Plan for Migrant Detention Camp in Everglades Draws Widespread Outrage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 09:17:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A plan by Florida officials to build a harsh outdoor migrant detention camp, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," in the Everglades has sparked a chorus of outrage. Environmental groups, immigration activists, and the Miccosukee Tribe have condemned the project, which would house up to 5,000 detainees in tents in a remote, undeveloped area. Critics argue that subjecting people to extreme heat, humidity, and wildlife like alligators and pythons constitutes inhumane treatment. The facility is part of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement agenda, but opponents cite devastating environmental impacts and parallels to the forced removal of Native Americans.</p>
