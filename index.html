          <p>A deadly shootout at a nightclub in Ecuador's coastal province of Guayas has left eight people dead and three injured, marking the latest tragedy in a nationwide surge of violent crime. Authorities reported that heavily armed suspects arrived on motorcycles and in vehicles before opening fire on the patrons. The country has been grappling with a wave of violence attributed to disputes among organized crime groups linked to transnational drug cartels. This attack follows numerous other killings in recent months, with Ecuador recording over 4,000 homicides in the first five months of 2025 alone.</p>

          <p>A large gorse fire that spread rapidly across the iconic landmark of Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh is being tackled by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. The blaze produced a significant amount of smoke visible across the city, prompting police to urge the public to avoid the area. Eyewitnesses described seeing the flames spread quickly due to wind, forcing them to evacuate the popular hill. This incident follows a series of wildfire warnings in Scotland, which has experienced an unusually warm and dry summer, contributing to conditions ripe for such fires. No casualties have been reported from the incident.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended his government's plan to take control of Gaza City, calling it the "best way" to dismantle Hamas and end the war quickly. His remarks came as Israel faced severe criticism during an emergency UN Security Council meeting, where nations like the UK and France warned the plan could violate international law and further endanger hostages. The U.S. defended Israel, stating the war could end if Hamas released the hostages. Netanyahu also dismissed claims of starving Gazans as "fake" and part of a campaign of lies, while outlining a new plan to increase aid distribution.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after California enacted a landmark law to protect outdoor laborers from heat, farmworkers continue to suffer and die from preventable heat-related illnesses. Advocates and some lawmakers attribute the ongoing issue to ineffective enforcement by the state's occupational safety agency, Cal/OSHA, which a recent state audit criticized for inadequate procedures and staffing. Many farmworkers, a significant portion of whom are undocumented, are hesitant to report unsafe conditions for fear of retaliation. As summer heat intensifies, the article highlights the persistent dangers faced by this vulnerable workforce.</p>

Many participants also expressed anger at the UK government's conditional intention to recognize a Palestinian state, viewing it as a "reward for Hamas" rather than a step toward peace. The demonstration, which saw a few minor scuffles and three arrests, highlighted the ongoing emotional toll of the crisis on families and the Jewish community in Britain.</p>

          <p>A union representing CDC employees has called for federal officials to unequivocally condemn vaccine misinformation following a deadly shooting at the agency's Atlanta headquarters. The gunman, who killed a police officer before dying at the scene, was reportedly fixated on his distrust of COVID-19 vaccines. The union argues that such rhetoric has vilified scientists and created a hostile environment, putting staff at significant risk. This incident has heightened calls for improved security and a stronger public stance against baseless scientific claims.</p>

The series will feature reporting from international correspondents on how countries are adapting to a world with waning U.S. influence.

After more than 50 Democratic lawmakers fled Texas to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass the new maps, Abbott vowed to call continuous 30-day special sessions and have the legislators arrested upon their return. The proposed maps, reportedly initiated at Donald Trump's behest, aim to give Republicans five additional U.S. House seats.

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a directive on social media for the homeless population in Washington, D.C., to "move out, IMMEDIATELY," promising to provide alternative places to stay far from the capital. This warning is part of his administration's escalating rhetoric and planned actions against what it portrays as rampant crime in the city, despite Justice Department data showing a 30-year low in violent crime for 2024. The move follows a recent executive order facilitating the removal of homeless individuals and an increased presence of federal law enforcement in the District. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has called the administration's characterization of the city hyperbolic and false.</p>

While reaffirming Germany's fundamental solidarity with Israel, Merz stated that this support does not extend to military backing for actions that could result in significant civilian casualties. The policy shift has drawn criticism from within Merz's own conservative political bloc but has been largely supported by his coalition partners. The move marks a significant change in Germany's staunch support for Israel, reflecting growing international estrangement over the conflict.</p>

The agency granted accelerated approval in 2023 for the company's $3.2 million gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, despite internal concerns about limited clinical data. However, after three patients died from acute liver failure, the FDA has now asked the firm to suspend the treatment's distribution, causing its stock to plummet. This situation exemplifies the difficult dilemma the FDA faces in balancing the need for rapid access to treatments for rare diseases against potential safety risks.</p>

A Kern County firefighter sustained serious injuries when his truck rolled over a ridge while battling the blaze. Fueled by extreme heat and dry conditions, the fire expanded rapidly, though favorable weather overnight has since allowed crews to make good progress, reaching 62% containment. The incident is one of several active wildfires across California, where experts say climate change is contributing to longer and more destructive fire seasons.</p>

Prior to the surge, many short-sellers targeted Apple due to its perceived lack of a clear AI strategy and potential financial impacts from an antitrust ruling against Google. However, a perceived endorsement from President Trump and a commitment to further U.S. investment helped reverse the stock's trajectory.

The talks are expected to address complex issues, including potential territorial swaps, which Ukraine has constitutionally rejected. The choice of Alaska as the location is historically significant, as the U.S. purchased the territory from Russia in 1867.</p>

          <p>Actor Tom Hanks has paid a heartfelt tribute to astronaut Jim Lovell, whom he portrayed in the 1995 film "Apollo 13," following Lovell's death at age 97. In an Instagram post, Hanks described Lovell as a person who dared to dream and lead others to extraordinary places, noting his voyages were fueled by challenge, not a desire for fame or riches. Lovell famously commanded the near-disastrous Apollo 13 mission, which became known as a "successful failure" after the crew returned safely to Earth against all odds. Hanks concluded his tribute by wishing the celebrated astronaut "God speed" on his next voyage to the cosmos.</p>

          <p>The Japanese mindfulness practice of 'shinrin-yoku,' or forest bathing, is gaining popularity as a way to lower stress and improve focus. The practice involves immersing oneself in nature and connecting with the environment through all senses. Certified forest therapy guides lead walks that encourage quiet reflection and disconnection from technology, which can be an emotional and calming experience for participants. Experts note that the benefits can be achieved even with short, 15-minute sessions in a local park or backyard, and they recommend journaling about the experience to enhance its positive effects on mental well-being.</p>

Chan recommends starting with small, consistent actions, like sending one networking email a month or posting one professional update a week, to build comfort and momentum. She emphasizes that a brand exists both online and offline, and engaging in personal interests can surprisingly lead to professional opportunities.</p>

          <p>A new biography, "Electric Spark," examines the life of novelist Muriel Spark, focusing on how her conversion to Roman Catholicism profoundly shaped her famously witty and acerbic fiction. The book argues that Spark, best known for "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie," was one of modern Britain's most important religious writers, using narrative devices to explore the relationship between God and humanity. It delves into her formative experiences, including her work in psychological warfare during WWII, which influenced her obsession with truth and fiction. The biography presents Spark as a writer who played God with her characters, exploring themes of judgment, free will, and divine caprice.</p>

          <p>Allies of the late Alex Salmond have dismissed suggestions in Nicola Sturgeon's upcoming memoir that Salmond himself leaked details of the sexual misconduct investigation against him. In her book, Sturgeon denies she or her team were the source but suggests it would have been "classic Alex" to be behind it. Kenny MacAskill, leader of the Alba party, called Sturgeon a "hypocrite" for the claim, while a former party official labeled it a "fabrication." A journalist who originally broke the story also stated he finds the claim not credible, highlighting the deep and persistent rift between the two former leaders of the Scottish independence movement.</p>
