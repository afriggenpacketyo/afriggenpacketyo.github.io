          <p>A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., has maintained a lower court's decision that prevents President Trump from firing Federal Trade Commission Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter without cause. The three-judge panel determined that the administration had no significant likelihood of winning its appeal, citing clear Supreme Court precedent that protects members of independent agencies from such removals. This ruling allows Slaughter, who was appointed by the previous administration, to return to her position while the legal battle over presidential removal powers continues. The decision reinforces the operational independence of federal agencies from direct presidential control.</p>

          <p>Filmmaker Woody Allen described President Trump as polite and professional during a cameo appearance in his 1998 film, comments made on Bill Maher's "Club Random" podcast. Allen, who clarified that he disagrees with nearly all of Trump's policies, stated that as an actor, Trump was charismatic and effective, leading Trump to share the praise on his social media. The article criticizes both Allen and Maher for what it describes as normalizing a controversial political figure, contrasting their remarks with the administration's contentious actions. This interaction has drawn public scrutiny due to Allen's own controversial personal history.</p>

Pegula secured her spot by defeating Barbora Krejcikova in straight sets, 6-3 6-3, reaching the semi-final stage for the second consecutive year.

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has begun deliberations in the trial of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of plotting a coup to remain in power after his 2022 election defeat to Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Prosecutors allege Bolsonaro and seven others formed an "armed criminal association" to violently overthrow the democratic order, culminating in the storming of government buildings in January 2023.

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has publicly released over 33,000 pages of documents related to Jeffrey Epstein, which were provided by the Department of Justice following a subpoena. This release comes amid ongoing public and political pressure on the Trump administration regarding the handling of the Epstein investigation. Democratic committee members have noted that a large portion, estimated at 97%, of these records were already in the public domain, with only 3% being new material. The DOJ has stated it will continue to produce records while redacting victim identities and sensitive material related to child sexual abuse.</p>

          <p>President Trump has recently claimed to have ended six or seven major international conflicts, suggesting he deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for these efforts. A White House official listed disputes including those between Israel and Iran, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and India and Pakistan as examples. However, foreign policy experts interviewed for the article state that while the administration has helped broker ceasefires and normalize relations in some cases, many of these conflicts were not full-scale wars and remain largely unresolved. The analysis suggests the president's declaration of success is often premature, with underlying tensions still present in most of the cited regions.</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching an estimated $1.3 billion, an analysis reveals where winners would retain the most money after taxes. While all winnings are subject to a 37% federal tax, state income taxes create significant disparities in the final payout. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery prizes, allowing a winner to take home a larger share. In contrast, a winner in New York, which has the highest tax rate on winnings, would receive the smallest after-tax amount. The article also provides data on the most and least frequently drawn numbers, though it emphasizes that each drawing is a random event.</p>

The article contends that such laws, intended to protect minorities, are sometimes used by various groups to penalize political opponents, leading to a chilling effect on speech.

This action occurs amid heightened tensions, following the recent deployment of U.S. warships to the region as part of a broader counternarcotics mission.

He warns that such deployments, which are becoming more routine, risk misinterpretation of civilian crises and undermine the democratic principle that legitimacy does not come from military force.

          <p>Authorities have released a 699-page document containing evidence photos from the apartment of Bryan Kohberger, who was convicted of murdering four University of Idaho students. The images show personal effects, academic materials, and two birthday cards he received for his 28th birthday, which occurred just eight days after the November 2022 killings. One card appears to be from his parents, while another contains a humorous, annotated illustration of Theodore Roosevelt riding a dinosaur. These details provide a small glimpse into the life of Kohberger, who was a Ph.D. student in criminology at the time of the murders.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has authorized U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to use a powerful spyware tool called Graphite, developed by the Israeli-founded company Paragon Solutions. The contract, initially paused by the Biden administration for review, allows the agency to use software capable of hacking into any mobile phone and accessing encrypted applications like WhatsApp and Signal. Civil liberties groups have expressed alarm over the decision, citing the potential for abuse and the significant threat such technology poses to privacy and free speech. The move places one of the world's most advanced cyberweapons in the hands of a domestic law enforcement agency.</p>

          <p>Air Lease Corp., a major aircraft leasing firm founded by industry pioneer Steven Udvar-Házy, has agreed to be taken private in a $7.4 billion deal led by a consortium of investors including Japan's Sumitomo and SMBC Aviation Capital. The acquisition, valued at approximately $28.2 billion including debt, reflects ongoing consolidation within the aircraft leasing industry. This sector has benefited from high demand and record rental rates due to a shortage of new aircraft. The deal will provide the acquiring group with greater scale in a market where lessors now own more than half of the world's passenger jet fleet.</p>

          <p>In a sharply critical open letter, nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have accused Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of undermining public health. They condemn his policies, which include restricting vaccine access, cutting research funding, and firing thousands of healthcare workers, arguing these actions put Americans at risk. The letter also highlights the recent removal of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez as a particularly damaging move. Kennedy has defended his actions, stating the CDC had lost public trust and strayed from its core mission due to politicized science.</p>

Police state the suspect, Gonzalo Leon Jr., was "waiting in the shadows" behind a fence after the boy and his cousin knocked on his door for the third time. The suspect allegedly followed the children as they ran away before opening fire, fatally wounding Guzman. A search of the suspect's home uncovered numerous firearms and tactical gear. This tragic incident highlights a case of extreme and fatal overreaction to a common childhood prank.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his administration will ask the Supreme Court for an expedited ruling to overturn a recent appeals court decision that found most of his tariffs illegal. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the president lacked the authority to unilaterally impose the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, stating that such power rests with Congress. Trump argued that the tariffs are essential for the nation's financial stability and claimed the stock market's recent dip was a direct result of the adverse ruling. The administration fears that upholding the decision would require returning billions in collected revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Senators Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff have sent a formal request to the Defense Secretary for a detailed breakdown of the recent deployment of National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles. The deployment, ordered by President Trump to support federal immigration enforcement, was made over the objections of state and local officials. The senators are seeking information on the specific missions, costs, and any law enforcement activities undertaken by the troops, expressing concern that the use of the military in this capacity is inappropriate and potentially illegal. Their letter came shortly before a federal judge ruled that the deployments violated the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>
