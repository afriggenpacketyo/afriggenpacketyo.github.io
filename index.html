          <p>Elon Musk announced that Tesla's robotaxi service is tentatively scheduled to begin in Austin, Texas, on June 22, with a small initial rollout of 10 to 20 Model Y vehicles using an unsupervised version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology. The service will be geofenced, limiting initial operational areas, and remotely monitored by employees, with safety being the primary concern, potentially causing date shifts. Musk shared a video of driverless vehicle testing in Austin, while protests are planned by safety advocates and those opposing Musk's political views. The Dawn Project and other anti-Musk groups plan a demonstration to highlight safety concerns with Tesla's vehicles and driver assistance features. The new service is expected to be closely watched by both enthusiasts and critics alike.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced a curfew for downtown Los Angeles, effective from 8 p.m. Tuesday to 6 a.m. Wednesday, due to ongoing anti-ICE protests. The curfew covers a one-square-mile area bounded by the 5, 110, and 10 Freeways, with exemptions for residents, workers, credentialed media, and those experiencing homelessness. The protests, triggered by immigration raids, have led to nearly 200 arrests and looting of 23 businesses, prompting the mayor to take action to protect lives and property. President Trump has deployed the California National Guard and U.S. Marines to protect federal buildings, escalating tensions with Governor Newsom, who has condemned the move as illegal and immoral.</p>

          <p>A UN panel is urging the UK to renegotiate its deal with Mauritius regarding the Chagos Islands, stating that the current agreement fails to guarantee the rights of the Chagossian people. The deal, signed last month, returns sovereignty of the archipelago to Mauritius, but allows the UK to maintain a military base on Diego Garcia. The panel argues that preventing Chagossians from returning to Diego Garcia violates their right to return to their ancestral lands. The UK Foreign Office defends the deal, noting it has been welcomed by international organizations, including the UN secretary general.</p>

          <p>Residents of Graz, Austria, held a candlelight vigil to mourn the ten victims of a school shooting, the deadliest in the country's recent history. A 21-year-old former student committed suicide in a school bathroom after the attack, which took place at DreierschÃ¼tzengasse secondary school. Three days of mourning have been declared, with a nationwide moment of silence planned, and the school will remain closed indefinitely. The gunman, who legally owned the weapons, was not previously known to the police, and the motive for the shooting remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration authorities have expanded enforcement actions into California's agricultural regions, leading to increased fear among farmworkers, with reports of agents appearing at fields and packing houses. Advocates say that the raids are causing workers to be afraid to take their kids to school or go to the grocery store, and that the expansion into rural communities follows similar raids in urban areas of Los Angeles County. Two Democratic members of Congress condemned the raids, stating they are not about public safety but about stoking fear. Farmworker advocates noted that the raids occurred despite a judicial ruling regarding Border Patrol actions in Kern County.</p>

          <p>Residents in Japan with foreign roots are increasingly speaking out against racial profiling by police, with some taking legal action, though progress is slow due to public indifference. A survey revealed that over 71% of foreign nationals in Japan have been questioned by police in the past five years, a rate 5.6 times higher than for Japanese citizens. Despite similar crime rates between Japanese and foreigners, those with foreign appearances are disproportionately targeted for street questioning. Advocacy groups and legal actions aim to pressure the government to prevent discriminatory interrogations and promote a more inclusive society.</p>

          <p>Mark Zuckerberg, reportedly frustrated with Meta's AI progress, is investing $14 billion in Scale AI and hiring its CEO, Alexandr Wang, to lead a new AI research lab. Wang, known for his technical expertise and business acumen, is expected to help Meta improve its Llama AI models. Meta's decision to take a 49% stake in Scale AI, rather than acquire it outright, may be influenced by antitrust concerns. Scale AI, valued at $14 billion, is a data-labeling and annotation startup that helps major tech companies train AI models and has also made inroads into the defense industry.</p>
