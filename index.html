        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Artisans in India-administered Kashmir, specializing in traditional crafts like papier-mache and carpet weaving, are facing severe economic uncertainty. New US tariffs of up to 50% on Indian goods, a response to disputes over Russian oil, have caused a sharp decline in Christmas orders from the United States, their primary market. This tariff regime, combined with a drop in tourism, threatens the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of artisans, as the price of their luxury goods becomes prohibitive for American buyers. The situation raises concerns about widespread unemployment and the potential loss of generational skills in the region's vital handicraft industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A California ballot measure proposes temporarily bypassing the state's independent redistricting commission to create more favorable congressional districts for Democrats. The measure's official title explicitly references Texas's recent Republican-led redistricting as justification, a move experts call "extremely rare" and overtly partisan. This action is a direct response to efforts in GOP-led states, initiated at former President Trump's request, to gerrymander maps and secure control of the U.S. House. The ballot language frames the issue as a defensive maneuver, highlighting the escalating national conflict over political map-drawing and its impact on electoral outcomes.</p>

          <p>With teenagers increasingly using generative AI tools like ChatGPT for everything from homework to mental health support, experts are urging parents to engage in conversations about responsible usage. They recommend starting discussions early, exploring the technology together, and teaching critical thinking skills to fact-check AI-generated information. While AI can be a helpful learning aid, there are significant risks, as some chatbots have provided unsafe responses regarding mental health crises. The guidance emphasizes setting reasonable household rules and balancing screen time with real-world interactions to mitigate potential negative impacts on child development.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small colleges across the U.S., like Roanoke College in Virginia, are adding or reviving football programs in an effort to increase overall enrollment, particularly among men. Administrators hope the sport will foster a sense of belonging and school spirit, attracting students at a time when male college attendance is declining. While Roanoke saw an immediate influx of nearly 100 student-athletes, research suggests that such enrollment spikes are often temporary and do not produce long-term gains. The trend reflects a broader strategy by smaller institutions to remain competitive and financially viable amid a shrinking pool of potential students.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over thirty people, including teachers, firefighters, and military members, have been fired or are under investigation for social media posts critical of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk after his assassination. A coordinated campaign by conservative activists and some Republican officials is identifying and publicizing these posts, demanding professional repercussions for those deemed to be "celebrating" his death.

          <p>A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.4 struck early Saturday off the eastern coast of Russia's Kamchatka region. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the epicenter was located approximately 112 kilometers east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a depth of 39 kilometers. Initially, the Pacific Tsunami Warning System issued a potential tsunami threat, but this was later rescinded. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries from the seismic event, and Japanese authorities noted only the possibility of slight sea-level changes.</p>

          <p>Local elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, are being viewed as a significant political test for Chancellor Friedrich Merz's national coalition government. The vote for municipal councils and mayors is the first major electoral challenge since Merz's conservative CDU/CSU formed a government with the center-left SPD. The results will also be a crucial indicator for state Premier Hendrik Wüst, who is seen as a potential successor to Merz. Meanwhile, a recent survey indicates widespread financial strain in Germany, with over half of adults under 50 borrowing money for basic necessities.</p>

          <p>Officials in Downing Street and the Foreign Office were reportedly aware of supportive emails between Lord Mandelson and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before Prime Minister Keir Starmer initially defended him. The BBC understands that while Sir Keir himself was not aware of the email contents during Prime Minister's Questions, a media inquiry detailing the messages had been received by the government a day earlier. Lord Mandelson was subsequently sacked as UK ambassador to the US after the emails, which showed a close relationship, were published.

          <p>Scotland's women's rugby team faces a formidable challenge against England in the World Cup quarter-final, a team they have not defeated in over 25 years. The historical gap between the two teams is attributed to England's early investment, larger player pool, and more developed professional pathways. Despite the lopsided record, Scotland has shown significant improvement in recent years, rising to sixth in the world rankings. The match represents a critical moment for Scottish women's rugby, with hopes that a strong performance can secure better contracts and continued investment in the sport's future.</p>

Conversely, those backing Álvarez emphasize his significant size and power advantage, as Crawford is moving up two weight classes. They argue that while Crawford is a master boxer, Álvarez's ability to control distance and deliver powerful blows will ultimately be too much for the smaller fighter to handle.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Münster in Germany have developed a new mechanical method to recycle electric vehicle battery materials without using hazardous chemical solvents. The process uses mills to grind up production scraps and separate valuable cathode materials from their metal backing, preserving them for immediate reuse. This breakthrough targets batteries made with a dry process using a plastic binder, a newer manufacturing technique. The innovation could significantly lower production costs, reduce environmental harm from waste, and ultimately make electric vehicles and energy storage systems more affordable for consumers.</p>

The author suggests his long absence has been a calculated move to avoid negative publicity and potential legal issues.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the recently released 2003 Jeffrey Epstein birthday album is a relic of a past culture where the sexual exploitation of underage girls was normalized. The author, Rebecca Solnit, recounts how movies, music, and mainstream culture in the 1970s and 80s often depicted or excused relationships between adult men and teenage girls. She posits that the "sexual revolution" often removed protections for young women without granting them true agency. The article credits the feminist movement for fundamentally shifting societal norms by establishing principles of consent, exposing widespread abuse, and challenging the power dynamics that enabled such exploitation.</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 series has achieved record pre-order sales in China, indicating strong consumer demand despite a challenging economic climate. E-commerce platform JD.com reported that sales in the first minute surpassed the entire first-day volume of last year's iPhone 16. The high demand caused temporary issues with Apple's official website, and in major cities like Shanghai, all in-store pickup slots for the Pro Max model were booked within 20 minutes. As of Saturday, customers in Guangzhou face a wait until mid-October for delivery, highlighting the robust start for Apple's latest product launch.</p>

          <p>A senior official from the German state of Bavaria has stated that the region remains open to and welcoming of Chinese investment, despite broader tensions between the European Union and China. The comments were made during an event marking the 50th anniversary of a historic visit to Beijing by former Bavarian leader Franz Josef Strauss. While acknowledging the EU's push for greater economic resilience, the minister emphasized that protectionism is not the solution. This stance highlights a pragmatic, business-focused approach at the state level, which can sometimes differ from national or EU-wide geopolitical strategies.</p>

          <p>At the IAA Mobility conference in Munich, Chinese electric vehicle companies like Xpeng and GAC showcased their latest models with large, ambitious displays, signaling a major push into the European market. These firms are leveraging advanced in-car technology and competitive pricing to challenge established European brands, which are perceived by some as lagging in EV development. Despite potential EU tariffs, Chinese automakers are setting aggressive sales targets and expanding their presence. This influx of competition is forcing legacy European carmakers to accelerate their own EV strategies and innovations.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk on their campus, students at Utah Valley University are expressing a renewed commitment to political discourse. Some students, inspired by Kirk, are becoming more politically active, stating that attempts to silence his voice will only amplify his message through others. Even students who disagreed with Kirk's views told the BBC they feel a responsibility to ensure that open and healthy debate continues on college campuses. The tragic event has thrust the university into the national spotlight and appears to have galvanized students across the political spectrum.</p>

          <p>U.S. health authorities are growing concerned as Chagas disease, a parasitic illness traditionally found in South America, is being detected with increasing frequency across at least eight states. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is considering reclassifying the disease as endemic, meaning it is regularly present in the U.S. population. Transmitted by the feces of the "kissing bug," the disease can lead to serious, life-threatening heart and digestive problems if left untreated. This potential reclassification would trigger more robust monitoring, research, and public health responses to what is often called a "neglected disease."</p>

          <p>The UCLA Bruins' football season has fallen into a deeper crisis following a 35-10 home loss to New Mexico, marking their third straight defeat. The team, which has yet to hold a lead at any point this season, was heavily favored but was outplayed on both offense and defense. Plagued by penalties and an inability to execute, the Bruins have been outscored 108-43 over their first three games. The loss raises serious questions about the direction of the program under second-year coach DeShaun Foster, as the team heads into its Big Ten conference schedule with an 0-3 record.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Qatar aimed at assassinating senior Hamas leaders appears to have failed, creating significant diplomatic fallout for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While the strike killed several low-level members, Hamas claims its top leadership survived, undermining a potential "image of victory" for Israel. The attack has enraged Qatar, a key mediator in hostage negotiations, strained relations with the United States, and jeopardized efforts to secure a ceasefire and the release of remaining hostages. Despite the setback, Netanyahu's government shows no signs of halting its military campaign in Gaza.</p>

However, the Dodgers' offense struggled, scoring only a single run and failing to capitalize on scoring opportunities.
