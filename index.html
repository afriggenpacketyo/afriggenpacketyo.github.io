          <p>John Bolton, former national security advisor to President Trump, was indicted by a federal grand jury in Maryland on Thursday. The specific charges against Bolton, a Republican, were not immediately disclosed on the court docket. This development marks the third high-profile Trump critic to face criminal charges in recent weeks, following former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James, who have both denied any wrongdoing in their respective cases. FBI agents had previously raided Bolton's Maryland home and Washington D.C. office in August as part of a national security investigation seeking classified records, adding relevant context to this legal action.</p>

          <p>The UK Prime Minister has strongly criticized the decision to prevent Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending their Europa League match against Aston Villa on November 6th, deeming it the 'wrong decision.' This ban was implemented by the Safety Advisory Group due to significant safety concerns, with West Midlands Police classifying the game as high-risk, citing previous violent clashes and hate crime incidents involving Maccabi Tel Aviv fans in Amsterdam. Other political leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch, echoed the Prime Minister's disapproval, with Badenoch branding it a 'national disgrace' and demanding guarantees for Jewish fans' safety. However, local MP Ayoub Khan welcomed the decision, arguing that latent safety risks made drastic measures necessary, highlighting the complex security challenges surrounding the event.</p>

          <p>A teenage street musician, Diana Loginova, has been jailed for 13 days in St. Petersburg after leading a public performance of an anti-Putin rock song. Loginova, who performs under the name Naoko, faces an administrative charge for organizing an unauthorized public gathering and will subsequently face an additional administrative offense of 'discrediting' the Russian military. The song, 'Swan Lake Cooperative' by exiled rapper Noize MC, is openly critical of the Kremlin and was previously banned by a St. Petersburg court on grounds of promoting hostile attitudes. This incident highlights the severe suppression of dissent and artistic expression under the current Russian government, where even seemingly indirect musical performances can lead to imprisonment and further charges.</p>

          <p>Admiral Alvin Holsey, who commands US military forces in Latin America, is set to retire at the end of this year, just one year into his typically three-year tenure. This announcement by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth comes amidst escalating tensions with Venezuela and ongoing US military strikes targeting suspected drug smugglers in the Caribbean. While no official reason for Holsey's early retirement was disclosed, sources indicate underlying tensions between him and Hegseth, along with Holsey's reported concerns regarding the mission and attacks on alleged drug boats. This high-profile departure signals potential internal discord within the military leadership concerning the administration's foreign policy and operational strategies in the region.</p>

          <p>U.S. cybersecurity company F5 saw its stock sink 10% after disclosing a significant system breach by a 'highly sophisticated nation-state threat actor' who maintained long-term access to some of its systems. The hack, which Bloomberg attributed to state-backed Chinese hackers, specifically impacted F5's BIG-IP product development environment, compromising source code and information on undisclosed vulnerabilities. Despite F5 stating no evidence of new unauthorized activity or active exploitation, the breach prompted an emergency directive from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), urging all agencies using F5 software to apply the latest updates. This article highlights the alarming ease with which such vulnerabilities can be exploited, potentially leading to catastrophic compromises of critical information systems.</p>

          <p>Americans are receiving an average of 2.56 billion robocalls monthly, the highest level in six years, with robotexts tripling since 2021, according to a U.S. PIRG Education Fund report. These unsolicited communications, often from crime rings, aim to extract personal information or money, with victims losing an average of $3,690 to robocalls and $1,452 to robotexts in the first half of 2025. Despite the 2019 TRACED Act requiring robocall-fighting software, less than half of phone companies have fully complied, and AI is making scams more sophisticated. The problem highlights the ongoing challenge of consumer protection against evolving fraudulent tactics, as scammers appear to be several steps ahead of regulators and phone companies.</p>

          <p>Demand for protein has surged, with 61% of US consumers increasing intake last year, driven by social media influencers and brands. The protein industry is now valued at $114 billion, with a 122% rise in high-protein shakes since 2020, primarily driven by Gen Z. While protein is an essential nutrient for various bodily functions, dietitians warn that wellness culture often overestimates daily protein needs, with whole foods being the ideal source for most people. Consumer Reports found that over two-thirds of tested protein powders contained unsafe lead levels, underscoring the importance of limiting intake to occasional use for those who can meet protein targets from whole foods.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced initiatives to expand access to in vitro fertilization (IVF), urging US employers to create new fertility benefit options separate from medical coverage. President Trump also stated that a deal with biopharmaceutical company EMD Serono would "dramatically" lower the cost of a key fertility drug, Gonal-f, by an estimated 73% for American consumers. While framing the employer benefit as a recommendation without new incentives, the administration aims to make IVF more affordable and accessible, especially after the Alabama Supreme Court's controversial ruling on embryo personhood.

Grijalva's signature would provide the decisive 218th vote needed to trigger the release, leading to accusations that Johnson is 'protecting pedophiles.'

          <p>A new intelligence-style assessment by over 340 former US intelligence and national security officials warns that the United States is 'on a trajectory' toward authoritarian rule. The report, titled 'Accelerating Authoritarian Dynamics,' applied methods typically used for foreign democracies to domestic decline, concluding with 'moderate to high confidence' that the US is moving towards 'competitive authoritarianism.' Indicators cited include expanded executive power, politicization of civil service and federal law enforcement, and erosion of judicial independence under the Trump administration.

          <p>This article revisits Henry Dwight Sedgwick's 1904 Atlantic story, 'The American Coup d’Etat of 1961,' which offers a 'frightening American fable' about democratic decline. Sedgwick's narrative depicts a powerful tech innovator, an imperial president seeking a third term, a weakened Congress, and societal chaos leading to a manipulated election and a new, compromised order. The story, written during Theodore Roosevelt's presidency, critiqued the era's materialism, corruption, and imperial ambitions, reflecting fears that the country was losing its way. The author highlights how this historical fiction serves as a stark, unsettling commentary on enduring themes of power, governance, and the fragility of constitutional order in the United States.</p>

The project is reportedly privately funded by Trump's supporters and is part of his broader vision for capital developments, including White House renovations. However, developing such a memorial is a complex process, typically requiring congressional approval and navigating federal laws that restrict new construction on the National Mall, making its completion by July 4th next year unlikely.</p>

This significant increase, from a previous range of $2,000-$5,000, is deemed cost-prohibitive for many US employers, particularly startups and small and midsize businesses, hindering their ability to access global talent.

          <p>A Milwaukee Brewers fan, Shannon Kobylarczyk, lost her job and a Make-a-Wish Wisconsin board position, and was banned for life from the stadium, after a social media video showed her yelling 'Let's call ICE' at a Latino Dodgers fan. The incident occurred during a playoff game amidst rising tensions from the Trump administration’s immigration raids, which have swept the country. The Dodgers fan, Ricardo Fosado, a US citizen and war veteran, was later escorted out by security after Kobylarczyk reported him, though he expressed sympathy for her. ManpowerGroup, her employer, confirmed her termination, and Make-a-Wish Wisconsin announced her immediate resignation from its board, highlighting the severe consequences of public xenophobic remarks.</p>

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, however, publicly denied receiving any such proposal, creating a clear disagreement between congressional leaders as the shutdown continues for its 16th day. Democrats have been unwavering in their demands for health care fixes to prevent premium spikes for millions of Americans.

          <p>Germany's Bundestag parliament has opened its first reading of a contentious bill seeking to reintroduce some form of military service, initially on a purely voluntary basis, with contested plans for a mandatory component in the future. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius praised the democratic debate, emphasizing the need to expand the Bundeswehr's combat forces in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The legislation, intended for 2026, aims to more than double the number of active servicemen and women to 460,000 by 2035. The current proposal mandates a questionnaire for all 18-year-old men regarding military interest, while any decision on obligatory recruitment would require a separate Bundestag resolution.</p>

The bill, which includes a 500% tariff on imported goods from countries that buy Russian oil, gas, and uranium, had been delayed due to other international conflicts and White House requests for modifications.

This article explains that credit card rates are also heavily influenced by credit conditions and individual scores, and issuers are mitigating exposure by trimming lower APRs but not higher ones.
