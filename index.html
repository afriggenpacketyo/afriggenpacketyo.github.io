            <p>The Keystone Pipeline was temporarily shut down on Tuesday morning after an employee at a pump station reported hearing a "mechanical bang." The pipeline was shut down within two minutes, and emergency personnel were notified immediately. A release of crude oil was confined to an agricultural field near the pump station, with no impact reported to people or structures. The cause of the rupture and the amount of oil spilled are currently under investigation. This incident marks at least the fourth significant spill since 2017 for the Keystone Pipeline, which transports crude oil from Canada to refineries in the United States.</p>

            <p>While most of the world's wealthiest individuals have experienced significant losses due to the market sell-off following President Trump's tariff announcements, Warren Buffett's net worth has increased by $11.5 billion since the beginning of 2025. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway held a record $334 billion in cash at the end of 2024, which Buffett attributed to a lack of compelling investment opportunities. Some investors view Berkshire Hathaway as a safe haven during the current market turmoil, as the company's stock is up more than 11% since the start of 2025. Buffett advocates for long-term investing and patience, advising investors not to react impulsively to market fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Energy Secretary Chris Wright stated that the U.S. needs to keep coal plants open to meet the growing electricity demand from AI data centers and other industries. President Trump is expected to sign an order that will classify coal as a critical mineral, aiming to prioritize leases for its extraction on federal lands. The Trump administration aims to increase electricity output by 25%, and Wright believes that coal is a crucial, reliable, and affordable energy source. While the tech sector, which is leading the construction of AI data centers, is increasingly focused on using renewables and nuclear energy, coal is being suggested as a backup power source.</p>

            <p>Mortgage rates have risen to their highest level in over a month due to uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff announcements. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage jumped significantly this week, reversing a period of improvement. This increase is attributed to volatility in the bond market, which is reacting to discussions and negotiations related to the tariffs. The spring housing market is beginning with more sellers and homes for sale, but high buying costs and economic concerns suggest a slow response from buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Jim Cramer suggests that Amazon could be a secret weapon for the U.S. in its tariff dispute with China, by choosing to remain out of stock rather than accepting Chinese goods at the dock. This would send a signal to China due to their reliance on exporting goods. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent echoed this sentiment, noting that China has more to lose in a trade war because the U.S. imports significantly more from China than it exports. The threat of a global trade war has caused market uncertainty, but Bessent believes that deals can be reached if China comes to the table with solid proposals. (not investment advice)</p>

The legislation aims to block efforts that promote Hong Kong as a free and autonomous city if the State Department determines that the city has lost its autonomy.

Justices Sotomayor and Jackson dissented, arguing that the firings should be paused while the case is litigated in lower courts.

            <p>Migrants who entered the US using the CBP One app during the Biden administration are now being told to leave "immediately" under the Trump administration. The Department of Homeland Security stated that the Biden administration abused the parole authority to allow millions of illegal aliens into the US. Notices are being sent to some migrants, informing them that their paroles are revoked and that they are subject to potential prosecution if they remain in the US. The CBP One app has been rebranded as CBP Home and is now used for "self-deportations."</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has blocked a judge's order for the Trump administration to rehire thousands of fired employees, acting in a dispute over his effort to slash the federal workforce. The court put on hold an injunction requiring six federal agencies to reinstate probationary employees while litigation challenging the legality of the dismissals continues. The court said that the non-profit organizations who were granted an injunction lacked the legal standing to sue. Liberal Justices Sotomayor and Jackson dissented from the decision.</p>

            <p>Elon Musk has publicly criticized President Trump's trade advisor, Peter Navarro, calling him a "moron" for comments made about Tesla. Navarro described Tesla as a "car assembler" rather than a manufacturer due to its use of foreign-made parts. Musk, who is also a member of the Trump administration, stated that Navarro's claims were "demonstrably false." Trump has justified his tariffs by saying he wants to revive manufacturing in the US.</p>

            <p>A new survey reveals that a majority of California voters support providing social services for all low-income residents, regardless of immigration status. In contrast to the Trump administration's anti-immigrant rhetoric, Californians value the contributions of immigrants and believe their well-being is intertwined with a well-functioning state. The poll found support for allowing all state residents to purchase health insurance and receive food assistance, regardless of immigration status. Moderate and swing voters see undocumented immigrants as essential to the economy and are worried about the economic fallout from mass deportations.</p>

            <p>Cambodia faces the highest tariff rate under President Trump's new trade plan, but manufacturing is unlikely to return to the U.S. as a result. A trade group representing U.S. interests in Cambodia stated that manufacturers are looking at other countries to mitigate the tariffs, including Egypt, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Indonesia. The Cambodian government is working on steps to mitigate the pressure, such as fiscal policies and tax credits. The White House claims that Cambodia's tariffs on the U.S. reach as high as 97%, a claim disputed by the country.</p>

            <p>The government has rejected a "buy British" campaign in response to Donald Trump's tariffs, arguing that such a campaign would be "inward looking" and "not the way forward." Chancellor Rachel Reeves stated that ratcheting up barriers to trade will not be in the country's interests. The government is keeping its options open for retaliating to US tariffs but does not think the UK should "jump in with both feet." The government will focus on negotiating an arrangement to mitigate the tariffs and backing British producers through government procurement.</p>

Because TSMC's chipmaking equipment includes U.S. technology, its Taiwan factories are subject to U.S. export controls.</p>

            <p>President Trump is expected to sign executive orders aimed at reviving coal, allowing some older coal-fired power plants scheduled for retirement to keep producing electricity. This move is in response to increased US power demand from growth in datacenters, artificial intelligence, and electric cars. Environmentalists have expressed dismay, arguing that Trump is stuck in the past and wants utility customers to pay more for outdated energy. Experts say that any bump for coal is likely to be temporary because natural gas is cheaper and there is a durable market for renewable energy.</p>

            <p>A full-scale trade war between China and the US is possible after President Trump threatened to impose tariffs of more than 100% on Chinese goods. China has vowed to "fight to the end" and has already raised its own trade barriers against the US. This escalating trade conflict could significantly impact the world economy. The US and China import a variety of goods from each other, including soybeans, pharmaceuticals, electronics, computers, and toys. A trade war could lead to higher prices for consumers in both countries and disruptions in global supply chains.</p>
