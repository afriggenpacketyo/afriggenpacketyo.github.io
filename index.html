          <p>Electronic Arts (EA) stock experienced a significant 15% increase following a Wall Street Journal report that the video game giant is nearing a deal to be taken private. The potential acquisition, valued at approximately $50 billion, involves investors such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Silver Lake. If finalized, this leveraged buyout would become the largest in Wall Street history, surpassing the 2007 deal for TXU Energy. EA, known for popular franchises like Madden NFL and The Sims, has seen its stock rise 32% this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Labour Party has restored the party whip to former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum, ending their year-long suspension. They were among seven left-wing MPs suspended after voting against the government's two-child benefit cap shortly after Labour's 2024 election victory. This move follows the reinstatement of four other MPs from the same group seven months ago and comes amid growing pressure within the party to abolish the controversial cap. The policy is expected to be a major topic at the upcoming Labour conference.</p>

          <p>Famed money manager Howard Rubin, 70, was arrested by the FBI on charges of sex trafficking and transporting women across state lines for commercial sex acts over a decade. The indictment alleges he and his former assistant, Jennifer Powers, operated a trafficking network, spending over $1 million to recruit women. Prosecutors claim Rubin engaged in non-consensual and brutalizing acts in a specially outfitted Manhattan penthouse, causing significant injuries. This criminal indictment follows a 2022 civil verdict where Rubin was found liable for sex trafficking six women.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying its use of the Justice Department to target political adversaries, highlighted by the recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. President Trump hinted that others, potentially including former CIA Director John Brennan, could face charges related to the 2016 Russia investigation. This follows a directive for federal prosecutors to prepare investigations into George Soros's Open Society Foundations for potential racketeering and terrorism support. Critics accuse the administration of weaponizing the justice system, while the White House maintains it is pursuing justice, not revenge.</p>

          <p>In an interview on the YouTube show "House Guest," Vice President Kamala Harris shared details about the day she learned President Biden would not seek reelection, effectively launching her own presidential campaign. She recalled the moment happening unexpectedly during a casual family pizza night, which quickly transformed into a campaign strategy session. Harris also discussed her forthcoming book, "107 Days," reflecting on the emotional toll of conceding the election, which she compared to the grief she felt after her mother's death.

Posner, who escaped a Nazi ghetto in Poland as a child, had a distinguished career in dance and theatre.

          <p>The New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner has confirmed that Shane Tamura, who killed four people in a Midtown Manhattan office building in July before taking his own life, had low-stage Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). Tamura, a 27-year-old former high school football player, left notes referencing the degenerative brain disease and asked for his brain to be studied. Although he never played professionally, investigators believe he was targeting the NFL's headquarters.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are advising savers to consider opening a certificate of deposit (CD) in early October to lock in currently attractive interest rates. With the Federal Reserve having already cut rates and a high probability of another reduction at the end of the month, banks may preemptively lower their CD yields. Acting quickly allows savers to begin compounding interest immediately at a fixed rate of around 4.50% before rates potentially fall further. Waiting is unlikely to offer any advantages, as banks often adjust their rates in anticipation of Fed policy changes. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As credit card delinquencies rise, understanding the timeline of consequences for late payments is crucial for consumers to mitigate financial harm. While a payment is technically late the day after its due date, most issuers provide an unofficial grace period of a few days before charging a fee. The first major threshold is at 30 days past due, when a late payment is typically reported to credit bureaus, damaging one's credit score. After 60 days, issuers may impose a high penalty APR, with more severe collection efforts and potential account closure beginning after 90 days.</p>

          <p>This article argues that accusing critics of hypocrisy is a common but flawed tactic used to defend attacks on free speech from both the political right and left. It posits that this approach deflects from the actual principles of liberal norms by suggesting that all sides are equally censorious. The author notes that while illiberalism exists across the political spectrum, the charge of hypocrisy only serves to judge people, not the validity of ideas like free expression. Ultimately, relying on this argument avoids a principled defense of liberal values and presumes opponents lack principles themselves.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly payments on a new home equity loan have become slightly more affordable. A $150,000 loan with a 10-year repayment term now averages around $1,847 per month, while a 15-year term averages about $1,452 per month. These costs are marginally lower than they were earlier in the year and in late 2024, potentially saving borrowers around $1,900 over a decade. With more rate cuts anticipated, homeowners may find home equity a more attractive borrowing option, though careful calculation remains essential. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Costco reported solid fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, though the results were not entirely perfect, leading to a slight dip in its stock price. The company's comparable sales grew by 5.7%, just missing the 5.9% estimate, and membership renewal rates saw a minor decline. Despite these misses, analysts highlighted strong points, including a 14% growth in membership fee income and impressive traffic, particularly given the challenging retail environment. Many Wall Street firms maintained their buy ratings, viewing Costco as a core defensive holding with continued market share potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Dutch government has announced it will return a significant collection of over 28,000 fossils to Indonesia, including parts of the historic "Java Man." These fossils, the first known remains of the human ancestor Homo erectus, were excavated in 1891 by Dutch anthropologist Eugene Dubois when Indonesia was a Dutch colony. The decision follows a recommendation from an independent committee, which concluded the fossils were likely removed against the will of the local population. This repatriation is part of the Netherlands' ongoing efforts to reckon with its colonial past and return cultural artifacts.</p>

The charges stem from his 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding his handling of investigations into Hillary Clinton's emails and Russian interference in the 2016 election. The indictment, filed just before the statute of limitations expired, has intensified accusations that the Trump administration is weaponizing the justice system against political foes.

The biennial U.S. vs. Europe tournament is already known for its tribalistic energy, which starkly contrasts with golf's usual quiet etiquette. The author predicts that the combination of patriotic fervor, New York's notoriously vocal sports fans, and the public-course setting will create a particularly challenging environment for the European team, especially for emotional leaders like Rory McIlroy.</p>

          <p>The "rule of thirds" is a retirement income strategy gaining traction as an alternative to traditional methods like the 4% withdrawal rule. This approach involves converting one-third of one's retirement savings into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the portfolio can then be invested for growth or used for flexible spending and emergencies. The strategy aims to balance financial security with flexibility, reducing stress from market volatility while potentially allowing for higher overall spending in early retirement.
