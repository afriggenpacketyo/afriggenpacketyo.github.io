          <p>The first report from the official inquiry into the Post Office Horizon IT scandal has detailed the "disastrous" human impact on hundreds of sub-postmasters who were wrongly prosecuted. Led by Sir Wyn Williams, the inquiry found that the ordeal led to severe mental health issues, addiction, and financial ruin, with at least 10 individuals attempting suicide. The report makes urgent recommendations for compensation, including for family members, and criticizes the Post Office for its adversarial approach and slow delivery of redress. It calls on the government to respond to its findings by October 2025.</p>

          <p>San Diego Padres third baseman Manny Machado achieved a significant career milestone by recording his 2,000th hit during a game against the Arizona Diamondbacks. He becomes the 297th player in MLB history to reach this mark and the fifth active player to do so. In the same game, Machado also hit his 15th home run of the season, further cementing his place as one of only 12 players in league history with 350 home runs and 2,000 hits by his age-32 season. Despite the personal achievement, the Padres ultimately lost the game 6-3.</p>

          <p>Top-ranked tennis player Aryna Sabalenka fought back from the brink of elimination to secure a place in the Wimbledon semi-finals, defeating veteran Laura Siegemund in a grueling three-set match. Sabalenka, the heavy favorite, struggled against Siegemund's unconventional style, losing the first set and falling behind twice in the final set before ultimately winning 4-6, 6-2, 6-4. The match, which lasted nearly three hours, tested Sabalenka's composure and determination. She will now face either Amanda Anisimova or Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova for a spot in her first Wimbledon final.</p>

          <p>A State Department cable has alerted diplomatic and consular posts to an incident involving an "unknown actor" using artificial intelligence to impersonate Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The impersonator created a Signal account with a spoofed email address and contacted at least five high-level officials, including foreign ministers and a US governor. In some instances, the actor left AI-generated voicemails and sent text messages. The State Department has confirmed it is aware of the incident and has launched an investigation, highlighting growing concerns over the malicious use of AI for deception and espionage.</p>

          <p>BBC News understands that "MasterChef" presenter Gregg Wallace has been fired following an inquiry into alleged misconduct, as 50 more individuals have come forward with new claims. The allegations, which Wallace denies, include inappropriate sexual comments and behavior, with 11 women accusing him of groping or unwanted touching. Wallace has claimed a report cleared him of the most serious allegations but apologized for inappropriate language. The new claims raise further questions about workplace culture and safeguarding practices at the BBC and the production companies involved, as many accusers felt unable to complain previously for fear of career repercussions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), projects that the annual cost of the state pension triple lock will be three times higher than originally estimated, reaching £15.5 billion by 2030. The triple lock policy increases the state pension annually by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%. The OBR's report highlights the UK's "vulnerable" public finances, noting that rising pension costs and recent government U-turns on spending cuts contribute to increasing national debt. This spending pressure places the UK's long-term public finances in an "unsustainable position." (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that President Trump's threat of retaliatory tariffs against Canada over its digital services tax is a bullying tactic that disregards international norms. The author contends that Canada's tax is a fair and efficient way to ensure tech giants pay their share, and that Trump's actions violate principles of national sovereignty. The piece expresses disappointment in Canada's apparent capitulation, suggesting it sets a dangerous precedent and reinforces a "law of the jungle" approach to international relations. It frames the issue as a test of whether countries can stand together against unilateral pressure or will submit to brute force. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan would empower the government, with parliamentary approval, to call up conscripts if needed to rapidly expand the armed forces in a defense scenario. This move is a response to the changed security landscape in Europe and is seen as a compromise between calls for full compulsory service and opposition to such a measure. The proposal also aims to make voluntary service more attractive with significantly higher pay, as Germany seeks to bolster its military capabilities to meet new NATO guidelines.</p>

The case is a stark example of a foreign state-linked entity using local proxies to conduct hostile activity in the UK.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire in southern France has reached the outskirts of Marseille, the country's second-largest city, prompting the closure of the local airport. Residents in the path of the blaze have been advised to stay indoors and keep roads clear for emergency services, while some have evacuated. Over 160 firefighters, supported by helicopters, are battling the fire, which has been fanned by strong winds and fueled by dry conditions in a region that has not seen rain since May. The incident is part of a broader pattern of wildfires across Europe, including in Spain and Greece, following a recent deadly heatwave.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged ten people with attempted murder for allegedly carrying out a "planned ambush" on US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at a detention center in Alvarado, Texas. The incident occurred on July 4th, when attackers allegedly used fireworks to lure officers outside before opening fire, injuring a local police officer. Authorities stated the group fired 20 to 30 rounds at unarmed corrections officers. A subsequent search uncovered tactical gear, weapons, and what prosecutors called "insurrectionist materials," framing the event as an egregious and violent attack on law enforcement.</p>

          <p>An Australian jury has convicted Erin Patterson on three counts of murder and one of attempted murder for intentionally poisoning four family members with a meal containing toxic death cap mushrooms. Prosecutors successfully argued that Patterson knowingly served the lethal fungi in 2023, leading to the deaths of three of her guests. The defense's claim that the mushrooms were accidentally foraged and mixed with store-bought ones was not found credible. Death cap mushrooms contain a heat-stable toxin that causes catastrophic liver failure, and experts testified that their presence in a commercial setting is virtually impossible.</p>

The investment bank announced that Sunak, who worked there in the early 2000s before entering politics, will advise global clients on macroeconomic and geopolitical matters. His appointment was delayed by a governmental watchdog for one year to mitigate risks of unfair influence.

          <p>Pakistan's water security is facing deeper uncertainty after India announced it was suspending the 64-year-old Indus Waters Treaty, a critical water-sharing agreement. India's move came as a retaliatory measure after a militant attack, which it blamed on Pakistan. The treaty, which has survived previous wars, governs the division of the Indus River system, a lifeline for Pakistan's agriculture-based economy. While India's ability to immediately cut off water is limited, its suspension of the treaty and rhetoric about starving Pakistan of water have escalated tensions, with Pakistan warning that any attempt to divert water would be considered an act of war.</p>

          <p>US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins has stated that there will be "no amnesty" for undocumented agricultural workers under the Trump administration's plan to deport all immigrants in the country illegally. This confirmation comes despite warnings from the farm sector that mass deportations could severely disrupt the nation's food supply. Rollins suggested that the administration's goal is a 100% American workforce, and that people currently receiving government aid could potentially fill these roles. The administration is also reportedly moving to curb farmland purchases by "foreign adversaries" and may seek to reclaim land already owned by certain foreign entities.</p>

The loan is part of a cultural exchange that will see British treasures, such as artifacts from Sutton Hoo, travel to France.

          <p>In a major policy reversal, the IRS has stated in a federal court filing that churches can endorse political candidates without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status. This new interpretation effectively nullifies the 70-year-old Johnson Amendment, which had barred non-profits, including religious institutions, from engaging in political campaign activities. The filing was part of a settlement in a lawsuit brought by religious broadcasters and two Texas churches who argued the rule violated their First Amendment rights. The move aligns with a long-standing goal of President Trump to repeal the amendment and could significantly alter the role of churches in politics.</p>

          <p>A monthly survey from the New York Federal Reserve indicates that consumer fears about a sharp spike in inflation due to tariffs have subsided. The June Survey of Consumer Expectations found that respondents anticipate inflation will be at 3% in one year, returning to the same level seen in January before the tariff rhetoric intensified. This marks a retreat from a peak of 3.6% in the spring. While the overall inflation outlook has eased, consumers still expect significant price increases in specific categories like medical care, rent, and college education. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral primary as a model for successful progressive politics. It argues his win was secured through a strategic coalition that bridged ideological divides, notably his cross-endorsement with Brad Lander, a self-described "progressive Zionist." Instead of demanding ideological purity, the alliance acknowledged differences on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict while focusing on shared local goals. This approach attracted a broad base of support, including liberal Jewish and pro-Palestinian voters, and provides a roadmap for Democrats to build winning coalitions rather than alienating potential allies with purity tests.</p>

          <p>This article explores whether budget and staffing cuts at the National Weather Service (NWS) under the Trump administration affected the response to the deadly Texas floods. While the local NWS offices were missing key personnel due to early retirements, reporting suggests these specific vacancies likely did not cause the tragedy, as warnings were still issued in a timely manner. However, experts warn that deep cuts across the NWS have left the agency stretched thin, losing experienced staff. They express concern that while this may not have been the event where vacancies led to disaster, it is a risk that will persist for future events like hurricanes if not addressed.</p>
