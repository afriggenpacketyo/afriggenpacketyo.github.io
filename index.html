          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel faces significant pressure and calls for his removal, despite public backing from President Trump. Sources within the administration, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, reportedly lack confidence in Patel following communication missteps during the Charlie Kirk assassination investigation. Further complicating his position is a lawsuit from former FBI officials alleging political purges and the creation of an unprecedented power-sharing role for Andrew Bailey, fueling speculation about Patel's future. The article details these internal conflicts and the political maneuvering surrounding the FBI's leadership, underscoring the challenges facing the agency.</p>

          <p>Two men have been apprehended in Utah following the discovery of an incendiary device placed under a news media vehicle in Salt Lake City. The device, which failed to function as intended after being lit, triggered a significant law enforcement response. Subsequent searches at a residence in Magna led to the seizure of explosive materials, firearms, illegal narcotics, and even hoax weapons of mass destruction. The 58-year-old and 31-year-old suspects are facing potential charges for weapons possession and making terroristic threats, though the specific motive behind the incident and their connection to each other have not yet been disclosed.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has publicly endorsed democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, a move that could unify the Democratic party. Hochul, in a New York Times opinion piece, highlighted her belief in strong collaboration between state and city leadership and praised Mamdani's focus on affordability and opposing Donald Trump. Mamdani, who secured the Democratic primary with pledges for rent freezes and a $30 minimum wage, expressed gratitude for the governor's support. This endorsement suggests growing mainstream acceptance for Mamdani's progressive platform, despite earlier reservations from some party figures.</p>

          <p>The number of "underwater" car trade-ins has reached a four-year peak, with 26.6% of new car purchases in the second quarter of 2025 involving negative equity. This means drivers owe an average of $6,754 more than their current vehicle's value. Factors contributing to this include longer loan terms, such as the increasing prevalence of 84-month auto loans, and smaller down payments. The article offers practical advice for consumers, recommending credit score checks, pre-approval for new loans, and the consideration of gap insurance to protect against financial shortfalls if a vehicle is totaled.

          <p>Football pundit Danny Murphy argues that Manchester United's recurring problems stem from player selection and positioning rather than their 3-4-2-1 system under manager Ruben Amorim.

He contends that players like Luke Shaw are also shoe-horned into uncomfortable roles. The article suggests that while the system has potential, Amorim's personnel choices are undermining the team's ability to consistently perform.</p>
