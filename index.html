          <p>The U.S. federal government is on the brink of a shutdown as lawmakers fail to reach a funding agreement, which would be the 21st such event since 1977. A shutdown would mean millions of federal employees, including military personnel and TSA agents, would work without pay, while others are furloughed. Essential services like Social Security and mail delivery would continue, but national parks could close, and food safety inspections might be limited. The previous 35-day shutdown in 2018-2019 resulted in an estimated $3 billion in lost economic activity.</p>

The League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) confirmed his death, highlighting the devastating impact on his family, for whom he was the sole provider.

          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley predicts that the market share for electric vehicles in the U.S. could be cut in half, dropping from a record of around 10-12% to as low as 5%, following the end of federal tax credits. The incentives, which offered up to $7,500, are expiring as part of new legislation, and Farley believes customers are hesitant to purchase expensive EVs without them. He noted that the industry has learned that hybrid vehicles are currently more acceptable to consumers. Ford is now re-evaluating its battery plant and EV capacity strategies in response to the policy change.</p>

A man in his 30s has been charged in connection with the deaths, which authorities described as "violent."

          <p>Spotify has announced a major leadership transition, with co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek stepping down from his role to become executive chairman, effective January 1, 2026. He will be replaced by current co-presidents Gustav Söderström and Alex Norström, who will serve as co-CEOs. Ek stated the change formalizes the company's existing operational structure and that his new role will focus on long-term strategy. The announcement caused a temporary 6% dip in Spotify's stock, which remains up 54% year-to-date for the $140 billion company.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's market capitalization exceeded $4.5 trillion after its stock reached a new record high, driven by a series of significant artificial intelligence infrastructure agreements. The chipmaker's recent deals include taking an equity stake in OpenAI and partnering with Oracle on a $500 billion "Stargate" data center project. Additionally, cloud provider CoreWeave, in which Nvidia is a major shareholder, secured a $14.2 billion deal to supply Meta with AI infrastructure. These developments have solidified Nvidia's central role in the AI boom, with its stock up approximately 39% for the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) website displayed a large red banner blaming the "Radical Left" for the impending government shutdown. The highly unusual and partisan message accused Democrats of inflicting pain on Americans by making unreasonable demands, echoing language used by the Trump administration on social media. Critics condemned the move as turning a federal agency into a "propaganda arm." The incident highlights the intensely politicized atmosphere in Washington as leaders from both parties blame each other for the failure to pass a spending bill before the deadline.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Modern soccer is increasingly adopting structured, choreographed tactics reminiscent of American football, particularly in set-pieces like corners and throw-ins. This season, 28.4% of Premier League goals have come from set-pieces, the highest percentage in a decade. Teams like Arsenal, managed by Mikel Arteta, are using pre-determined player movements, blocking, and screening techniques that resemble the NFL's "rub routes" and basketball's screens to create space and scoring opportunities. This shift towards more structured play allows managers to exert greater control over game outcomes, mirroring the play-by-play strategic nature of the NFL.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is applying military tactics from the post-9/11 war on terror to its campaign against drug cartels, including conducting lethal strikes on suspected drug boats. President Trump has promoted videos of these strikes, which have killed suspected traffickers in the Caribbean, justifying them as acts of self-defense under his commander-in-chief powers. However, some experts and lawmakers have condemned these actions as illegal extrajudicial killings, questioning the legality and effectiveness of this approach.

A plurality of independents indicated they would hold both parties responsible for a shutdown, reflecting widespread frustration with partisan gridlock and a lack of compromise from either side.</p>

          <p>Excessive credit card debt is not defined by a specific dollar amount but rather by its impact on an individual's financial health. Key indicators include a debt-to-income ratio for credit cards exceeding 10%, a credit utilization ratio above 30%, and the inability to pay more than the minimum monthly payment. If debt is causing significant stress or preventing other financial goals, it is considered excessive. To manage this, strategies like the debt snowball or avalanche methods, balance transfers to 0% APR cards, and debt consolidation loans can be effective in regaining control over finances.</p>

A major policy announcement was the scrapping of the 50% university attendance target in favor of a new goal for two-thirds of young people to attend university or a "gold standard apprenticeship."
