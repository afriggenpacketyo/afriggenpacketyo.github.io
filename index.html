          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 17:04:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a startling technical issue during her San Francisco concert when a large mechanical butterfly prop she was riding malfunctioned mid-air. While performing her hit song 'Roar' high above the audience, the prop suddenly dropped several feet, causing a visible moment of surprise for the singer. Despite the scare, Perry demonstrated her professionalism by quickly recomposing herself and flawlessly continuing the performance without missing a beat. The incident, which she later referenced with a brief comment, underscores the potential dangers involved in elaborate, high-flying concert stunts used by many contemporary artists.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has initiated a $20 billion libel lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal's publisher, Dow Jones & Company, and its leader, Rupert Murdoch. The suit alleges defamation over an article claiming Trump signed a 'bawdy' birthday letter for Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which Trump has vehemently denied as a fake. This legal action targets the newspaper, its parent company, and the reporters involved, accusing them of journalistic failures and publishing false, unsubstantiated claims. The case highlights the high legal standard for defamation suits by public figures, who must prove 'actual malice' for a successful claim.</p>

          <p>Celebrity couple Rebecca Romijn and Jerry O'Connell have revealed their nontraditional approach to managing finances throughout their 18-year marriage. In a recent interview, they explained that they keep their personal money completely separate, contributing quarterly to a shared 'community pot' for family expenses. The amount each contributes varies depending on who is working more at the time, a system they developed to support their decision that one parent would always be home with their twin daughters. This financial arrangement reflects a tag-team approach to both their careers and their family life, offering a unique perspective on partnership in Hollywood.</p>

          <p>Justin Fulcher, a senior adviser to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has been removed from his position at the Pentagon, according to multiple sources. Fulcher initially joined the Defense Department as part of Elon Musk's government efficiency team before being promoted to his advisory role. His appointment was part of a new leadership team created after a security incident involving the sharing of sensitive military plans on a messaging app. The Pentagon confirmed his departure in a statement, thanking him for his service and wishing him well in his future endeavors, but did not provide a reason for the ousting.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy's third round at The Open featured a moment of high drama and a peculiar on-course incident that captured the crowd's attention. After a strong start, McIlroy encountered a bizarre situation on the 11th hole when his swing in the rough dislodged a buried golf ball, leading to a bogey. However, he electrified his home crowd with a spectacular 56-foot eagle putt on the 12th, producing one of the loudest roars of the tournament. Finishing with a score of 66, he remains in contention but faces a significant deficit behind the leader, Scottie Scheffler, heading into the final day.</p>

The DA's office sources contend they requested limited information and that Aetna sent additional materials by mistake, which were then deleted. The defense is requesting a hearing and sanctions, which could include the dismissal of the charges.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has condemned the United States for imposing visa sanctions on a Supreme Court justice involved in the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro. The sanctions, targeting Justice Alexandre de Moraes and his family, were described by Lula as unacceptable interference in another nation's justice system. This move by the Trump administration is the latest in a series of actions supporting Bolsonaro, who faces charges of attempting to overturn the 2022 election. Lula expressed solidarity with the affected justices, stating that no intimidation would compromise Brazil's democratic rule of law.</p>

          <p>Protests held across the United Kingdom against the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization have resulted in nearly 100 arrests. Demonstrations took place in several major cities, with the largest in London seeing 55 people arrested for displaying placards in support of the banned group. The government outlawed Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act after activists broke into an RAF base and damaged aircraft. The coordinated protests, where attendees held signs reading 'I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action,' highlight the ongoing, contentious debate surrounding the pro-Palestinian activist group's methods and status.</p>

          <p>Major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have voiced criticism of the R&A's enforcement of slow-play rules during the third round of The Open. Both golfers were warned by officials about their pace of play, which they found inconsistent with the handling of much slower rounds earlier in the tournament. Stenson noted the absurdity of being warned for being a few minutes over schedule on Saturday when earlier rounds had run an hour over. DeChambeau advocated for a new system that times every shot for every player, arguing it would be a fairer and more transparent solution.</p>

          <p>Witnesses and hospital officials in southern Gaza report that Israeli troops opened fire on crowds of Palestinians attempting to reach food distribution hubs, killing 32 people. The incidents occurred near centers operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S. and Israeli-backed group intended to replace the UN's aid system. While the Israeli army stated it only fired warning shots at suspects who approached its forces, hospitals reported receiving dozens of casualties with gunshot wounds. This event highlights the extreme desperation and danger civilians face in seeking humanitarian aid amid Gaza's catastrophic crisis and ongoing military operations.</p>

          <p>Russia has continued its intensified bombing campaign against Ukraine, launching a massive overnight attack involving over 300 drones and 30 cruise missiles. The barrage killed at least one person in the port city of Odesa, where a residential building caught fire, and damaged critical infrastructure in the northeastern Sumy region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed the scale of the assault, which is part of a recent Russian strategy of using overwhelming numbers of drones in single attacks. This escalation dashes hopes for a de-escalation of the conflict, which has now lasted over three years.</p>

          <p>A Pennsylvania-based Christian group called Generation Life is engaging in outreach with a message of 'chastity before marriage' for Generation Z. The young activists frame chastity not just as abstinence, but as a countercultural choice to seek deeper, non-transactional relationships in an age dominated by social media and what they see as superficial connections. By focusing on shared anxieties about modern dating and self-worth, they aim to present their message as a path to greater personal dignity and autonomy. This approach attempts to rebrand a traditional value as a radical response to contemporary social pressures.</p>

          <p>Ahead of Japan's upper house elections, far-right political parties are capitalizing on growing public concerns about immigration and tourism to challenge the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Nationalist groups like Sanseito and the Conservative Party of Japan are echoing platforms similar to Western populist movements, advocating for a 'Japanese First' policy and strict limits on foreign workers. This sentiment is fueled by a weak yen causing a surge in tourism and media reports on crimes committed by foreigners.

          <p>A South African government report has concluded that the collapse of an apartment building in George last year, which killed 34 construction workers, was 'entirely preventable.' The investigation revealed that numerous red flags, including the use of substandard materials and visible structural cracks, were ignored for up to a year before the tragedy. Public Works Minister Dean Macpherson stated that work should have been stopped, but instead, the problems were covered up. Following the report's release, there are strong calls for criminal accountability for those whose negligence led to the fatal structural failure.</p>
