        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. military will maintain its current standards for investigating sexual assault claims as it launches a department-wide review of how discrimination complaints are handled. Dr. Nathan Galbreath, director of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, assured reporters that the standard of proof remains the same for all sexual harassment complaints, with each complaint reviewed and analyzed by a legal officer. This decision comes as the Defense Department addresses potential personnel losses and efforts to streamline operations. The military reports that unfounded sexual assault claims are rare, occurring in only 1% of cases. </p>

          <p>Amazon reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, driven by growth in cloud computing and advertising, but issued soft revenue guidance for the second quarter. The company expects second-quarter operating income to be between $13 billion and $17.5 billion, below analysts' forecasts. Amazon noted that tariffs and trade policies are among the factors that could make its guidance subject to change, with the company facing significant exposure to tariffs, primarily through its retail unit and third-party marketplace sellers who rely on China for production. Despite the light guidance, net income rose significantly compared to the previous year.</p>

          <p>Apple reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by strong iPhone, Mac, and iPad sales. However, the company's Services division, which includes iCloud subscriptions and Apple Music, came in slightly below estimates. CEO Tim Cook noted that Apple is already sourcing about half of its iPhones for the U.S. from India and most other products for the U.S. from Vietnam to mitigate tariff impacts.

          <p>Amazon's online advertising business experienced a 19% increase in revenue during the first quarter, exceeding analysts' expectations. Ad sales climbed to $13.92 billion, surpassing the projected $13.74 billion.

Investors are closely monitoring online advertising due to economic uncertainty and increasing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, which could affect Amazon's core retail business and potentially impact its online ad unit.</p>

Online retailers like Shein and Temu have begun listing new prices that reflect the cost of tariffs, with some customers expressing shock at the high import duties.

          <p>A top Trump appointee in the Justice Department ordered an aggressive investigation into student protesters at Columbia University who protested Israel’s conduct of the conflict in Gaza. The demand for the inquiry also prompted pushback from a federal magistrate judge, who believed some of the steps being sought by the official, Emil Bove III, were unjustified and might violate the First Amendment. Prosecutors were told to obtain a membership list of the group and were told that Mr. Bove was seeking a list so the information could be shared with immigration agents.

          <p>Historically, gold has demonstrated consistent performance during economic downturns, often gaining value as investors seek safe-haven assets during stock market declines and economic uncertainty. Factors contributing to gold's resilience include its safe-haven appeal, response to monetary policy, currency concerns, and portfolio diversification benefits. While gold generally performs well in recessions, its value can also be influenced by central bank purchasing, inflation, geopolitical tensions, currency movements, market sentiment, and supply constraints. Despite potential short-term fluctuations, gold remains a long-term investment option for portfolio diversification.</p>
