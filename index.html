          <p>This Fox News opinion article argues that President Trump has the constitutional authority to deploy troops to quell violent protests, citing Supreme Court precedents and legal statutes.  The author contends that the president's power to maintain order and enforce federal law supersedes state objections.  This is particularly relevant given recent anti-ICE protests that have escalated into violence, and the author uses these events to support their argument. The article concludes by emphasizing that those who disagree with immigration policy should use legitimate political channels rather than violence.</p>
