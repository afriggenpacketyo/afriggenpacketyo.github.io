        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major League Soccer is experiencing a significant increase in sponsorships and stadium attendance, driven by the rising popularity of soccer in the United States. This growth is attributed to the sport's increasing cultural relevance, the approaching 2026 World Cup, and the impact of Lionel Messi's arrival in MLS. Brands are investing heavily in MLS, drawn by the league's younger, more diverse fanbase and the high engagement rates associated with live sports. Commissioner Don Garber reported over 12 million fans attended games in 2024, highlighting the league's expanding reach and influence within the U.S. sports landscape.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway shares experienced a significant drop after Warren Buffett announced his plan to step down as CEO, with Greg Abel set to take over in January 2026; Buffett will remain as chairman.

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that Washington D.C. will host the 2027 NFL Draft.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of major Hollywood studios and streaming services, including Netflix, Disney, and Warner Bros. Discovery, fell sharply after President Donald Trump proposed a 100% tariff on movies made overseas. Trump justified the tariff by calling tax incentives offered by foreign countries a 'national security threat'. The potential impact and implementation details of the tariff are unclear, raising concerns about the effect on international film production and relationships with other countries. Hollywood relies heavily on international box office sales, and retaliation from other regions could further restrict access to global markets.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to reopen and expand Alcatraz prison to house violent criminals, citing frustrations with 'radicalized judges' who insist on due process for those being deported. Trump believes reopening Alcatraz would symbolize law, order, and justice, though the practicality and feasibility of this plan are questioned, given the National Park Service's current control of the island. Alcatraz, which closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, is now a popular tourist attraction. Nancy Pelosi criticized the proposal as unserious, questioning the feasibility of reopening the prison after so many years.</p>

          <p>General Motors has been engaged in a decade-long effort to revive Cadillac as the quintessential American luxury car brand, aiming to regain its status as 'the standard of the world'. The strategy involves a product renaissance focused on all-electric vehicles, sporty sedans, and the iconic Escalade. GM President Mark Reuss has been a key figure in this transformation, emphasizing the importance of Cadillac having its own distinct products and not sharing consumer-focused parts with other GM brands. While there have been challenges, such as sales issues in China, Cadillac has largely stayed true to its plan, with a focus on value over volume.</p>

          <p>Sean 'Diddy' Combs is standing trial in New York City on multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, spanning over two decades. Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise since at least 2004, engaging in sexual assault, forced labor, and obstruction of justice. The indictment alleges a pattern of abuse toward women, including manipulation into commercial sex acts and physical assaults. A key piece of evidence is a 2016 security video showing Combs assaulting his then-girlfriend, Casandra Ventura, though Combs has apologized for the behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit.</p>
