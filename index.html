        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stars Christina Applegate and Katey Sagal recently revealed the challenging on-set atmosphere of the popular 1990s sitcom "Married… With Children." On a podcast, the actresses described the environment as cynical and sarcastic, where cast members would frequently talk negatively about each other, which Applegate overheard on her dressing room monitor. Applegate also discussed how the pressure of being a teen sex symbol on the show contributed to a long-lasting eating disorder she kept private for years. Sagal acknowledged the show's misogynistic elements and the intense scrutiny Applegate faced.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant heat wave is affecting large portions of the U.S. Midwest and Southeast, with the National Weather Service issuing alerts for over 163 million people. Forecasters predict dangerously high temperatures, with heat indexes expected to reach 105 to 115 degrees Fahrenheit in some areas, including Florida, the Carolinas, and Virginia. The extreme conditions are caused by a persistent high-pressure system known as a heat dome, which traps hot air over the region. Officials are urging residents to take precautions, such as staying hydrated and avoiding strenuous outdoor activities, to prevent heat-related illnesses.</p>

          <p>Amid growing international pressure, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have announced plans to establish humanitarian corridors for UN aid convoys and resume aid airdrops into Gaza. The first airdrops reportedly contained essential food supplies like flour and sugar. This move comes as aid organizations warn of mass starvation and report deaths from malnutrition within the enclave. While announcing the measures, the IDF denied claims of deliberately starving the population and stated that responsibility for distribution lies with the UN, which must ensure aid does not reach Hamas.</p>

          <p>President Trump's extensive use of tariffs is facing a critical legal test in federal court, which could invalidate many of his recent trade actions. A key lawsuit challenges his authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a power he has used for duties on China, Mexico, and others. While a lower court struck down the tariffs, an appeals court has kept them in place pending a final decision, which is expected to reach the Supreme Court. Experts suggest that if the courts rule against the administration, it could nullify numerous trade agreements and tariffs implemented during his term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi concluded a visit to the Maldives aimed at reinforcing diplomatic and economic relations as the island nation has recently tilted towards China. Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, who previously ran on an anti-India platform, has softened his rhetoric, calling India a "most trusted partner." During the visit, Modi announced a $565 million credit line, reduced debt repayments for the Maldives, and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects. The engagement is seen as a strategic move to counter China's influence in the geopolitically important Indian Ocean region.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team faces uncertainty over the fitness of its captain, Ben Stokes, ahead of the final day of the fourth Test against India. After taking five wickets in the first innings, Stokes did not bowl on day four, with assistant coach Marcus Trescothick citing stiffness and soreness. Stokes has a history of injuries and had to retire hurt while batting on day three due to cramp, raising concerns about his ability to contribute with the ball as England pushes for a victory. His absence from the bowling attack could be a significant blow to England's chances of winning the crucial match.</p>

Trump stated he "hadn't thought about" the possibility, a reply the analyst called an answer to "the easiest question in human history," which should have been an unequivocal "no." Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of underage girls.

In one incident, a strike on a tent camp in Khan Younis killed at least eight people, including four children.

The State Department and the Israeli Defense Forces have forcefully pushed back against the findings.

          <p>In a closely watched recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected a bid to oust 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the balance of power in the legislature. The KMT and its allies currently form a majority bloc, and the failure of the recall means President Lai Ching-te's government will likely continue to face strong legislative resistance. Supporters of the recall had criticized the KMT for obstructing key legislation and passing reforms seen as favoring China.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is coordinating with Jordan and other allies to plan airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza and evacuate children needing urgent medical care. The move comes as Israel announced it would permit foreign countries to conduct airdrops to alleviate the dire situation, which the UN has called a "moral crisis." Meanwhile, violence on the ground continues, with dozens of Palestinians reportedly killed while seeking aid. The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees warned that airdrops are inefficient and cannot replace the need for safe, open land access to address the man-made hunger crisis.</p>

          <p>The debate over how much coffee is safe to drink daily is complex, with experts advising that the right amount depends on individual health and lifestyle. While the FDA recommends a cap of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, equivalent to about four cups, tolerance varies greatly. Some people may experience anxiety or jitters after just one or two cups. Recent research has linked moderate coffee consumption to some health benefits, but heavy intake has been associated with increased risks for certain conditions. Dietitians stress the importance of moderation and being mindful of how caffeine affects your body.</p>

The men, who were recently repatriated to Venezuela in a prisoner swap, have provided harrowing testimonies of their detention. They described being beaten by guards, shot with rubber bullets, and held in inhumane conditions with dirty water and lights on all night. One of the men had never been convicted of a crime and was awaiting deportation to Venezuela when he was instead flown to the El Salvadoran facility.</p>

According to internal documents, the "Doge AI Deregulation Decision Tool" is analyzing 200,000 regulations with the goal of cutting half of them within a year of a potential second term. This initiative aligns with Trump's campaign promise for the "most aggressive regulatory reduction" in history.

The request follows reports that the book contains a "bawdy" letter signed by President Trump, a claim Trump has denied and sued over. Lawmakers argue the book is relevant to their oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation and the Trump administration's selective release of related files.

Analysts noted that futuristic visions are no longer enough to distract from fundamental issues like rising competition from lower-cost EV makers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Political analysts are examining why the Jeffrey Epstein controversy is proving difficult for Donald Trump to deflect, unlike other scandals. One argument is that the case's themes of powerful elites acting behind closed doors directly conflict with the populist, anti-establishment narrative that forms the core of his connection with his base. By appearing to defend powerful interests, Trump risks alienating his core supporters who see him as their champion against a corrupt system. This dynamic has allowed a once-fringe conspiracy theory to evolve into a spiraling political crisis.</p>

Researchers found that while some products had low levels likely from packaging, others contained high amounts, suggesting PFAS were intentionally used in manufacturing.
