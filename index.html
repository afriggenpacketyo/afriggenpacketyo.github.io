          <p>HSBC announced a "world-first" achievement in finance by successfully using quantum computing to enhance bond trading predictions. In a trial collaboration with IBM, the bank utilized a hybrid approach combining classical computers with IBM's Heron quantum processor. This method resulted in a 34% improvement in the accuracy of algorithmic bond price predictions, which could lead to increased margins and greater market liquidity. The successful trial provides the first empirical evidence that quantum computing can solve practical, complex problems in the financial services industry, signaling a new frontier in high-frequency trading technology.</p>

          <p>The National Personnel Records Center, a branch of the National Archives, improperly released a nearly unredacted version of Rep. Mikie Sherrill's military file to a political opponent. The disclosure, which included her Social Security number and other sensitive personal information, is a potential violation of the Privacy Act. The records were requested by an ally of her Republican opponent in the New Jersey governor's race, Jack Ciattarelli, in an effort to find information about a 1994 Naval Academy cheating scandal. The National Archives has admitted the error, apologized to Sherrill, and initiated an internal review.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has accused the United Nations of "triple sabotage" following a series of technical issues during his address at the General Assembly. The incidents included an escalator that stopped abruptly, a malfunctioning teleprompter, and a sound system that allegedly made his speech inaudible to some attendees without earpieces. While Trump initially joked about the problems, he later demanded an investigation, calling the events a "REAL DISGRACE." U.N. officials have suggested a U.S. videographer may have accidentally triggered the escalator's safety stop and stated the U.S. delegation is responsible for the teleprompter.</p>

          <p>The Indian government has signed a $7 billion contract with state-owned manufacturer Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL) to acquire 97 domestically produced Tejas Mk-1A fighter jets. This major defense deal is part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Make in India" initiative, aimed at modernizing the armed forces and boosting the nation's domestic defense industry. The new aircraft are intended to replace the Indian Air Force's aging, Soviet-era MiG-21 fleet, which is being phased out. The procurement underscores India's strategic push towards self-reliance in military hardware amid regional security concerns.</p>

          <p>Citadel CEO Ken Griffin has condemned the Trump administration for engaging in "crony capitalism" by granting tariff exemptions to large, well-connected corporations. In an interview, Griffin argued that such deals, where companies make domestic investments to avoid levies, undermine the American principle of fair competition by allowing the government to pick winners and losers. He described the practice as "nauseating" and warned that it shifts corporate focus from innovation to securing political favors. Griffin also characterized tariffs as a "national sales tax" that disproportionately harms lower-income households.</p>

Approximately 35 million Prime members who were affected by these "deceptive subscription traps" could be eligible for a payment of around $51 each.

          <p>During the launch of her book tour for "107 Days," former Vice President Kamala Harris emphasized her strong relationship with Hillary Clinton, portraying her as a supportive mentor. Harris recounted how both Hillary and Bill Clinton were among the first to offer their full support immediately after Joe Biden withdrew from the 2024 presidential race. This focus on her alliance with the Clintons comes as her memoir reportedly contains critiques of the Biden campaign and his decision to run for re-election. The book has caused friction with Biden's allies, who accuse Harris of attempting to shift blame for her own political challenges.</p>

          <p>The BBC's Executive Complaints Unit has ruled that the broadcast of punk duo Bob Vylan's Glastonbury set partially breached its editorial guidelines on harm and offense. The ruling cited the band's leading of a chant of "death, death to the IDF" and other derogatory comments, which the unit stated could be "fairly characterised as antisemitic." However, the complaints unit cleared the performance of breaching rules on impartiality or inciting crime, arguing the chants were directed at an institution, not individuals.

A key sticking point is the extension of enhanced tax credits under the Affordable Care Act, which are set to expire. Democratic leaders argue that failing to extend them will cause a massive spike in insurance premiums for millions of Americans. President Trump has backed out of negotiations, canceling a meeting with congressional leaders and escalating the risk of a shutdown as Republicans push for a "clean" funding bill without policy additions.</p>

It posits that many high-achievers unconsciously try to buy affection with professional merit, a pattern often rooted in childhood experiences where parental love was conditional on performance. This compulsive behavior is ultimately destructive to personal well-being and incompatible with healthy relationships, which require time and emotional presence. The author suggests addressing the issue by understanding its origins, giving love unconditionally, and making concrete plans to change work habits.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent 25-basis-point rate cut, average 30-year fixed mortgage rates have fallen to 6.13%, their lowest level since early 2022. For a prospective homebuyer financing a $400,000 loan, this translates to a principal and interest payment of approximately $2,432 per month. This represents a significant savings of about $240 per month compared to January 2025, when rates were above 7%. The lower rates provide a more favorable environment for both new buyers and existing homeowners considering a refinance. (not investment advice)</p>

Combs was convicted in July on two counts of arranging interstate travel for prostitution, though he was acquitted of more severe racketeering and sex trafficking charges. His legal team is arguing for a sentence of no more than 14 months, which could result in his immediate release with credit for time served. Prosecutors are expected to recommend a significantly longer prison term, and the judge has previously denied bail, citing Combs' history of violence.</p>

          <p>In the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, numerous foreign e-commerce companies, primarily based in China, have flooded social media with advertisements for unauthorized memorial merchandise. These companies use dozens of social media accounts with patriotic American branding to sell items like "Echo of Freedom" t-shirts, often falsely claiming that profits will be donated to Kirk's family or his organization, Turning Point USA. This practice of "astroturfing" exploits a tragic and politically charged event for profit, using deceptive marketing tactics to target grieving supporters and sow division. A Turning Point USA official confirmed the brands are not affiliated with the organization.</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham is facing a significant backlash from fellow Labour Party MPs after suggesting he could challenge Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for the party leadership. Burnham has been critical of the current Labour government and claimed that some MPs have urged him to stand. However, many MPs have publicly and privately dismissed the idea, calling it "self-indulgent" and urging him to focus on his role as mayor. The criticism indicates little appetite within the parliamentary party for a leadership change so soon after the last general election, despite concerns over the party's direction.</p>

By studying its trajectory and the rate at which it is shedding gas and dust, Loeb's team calculated its mass to be over 33 billion tons, implying a diameter larger than 3.1 miles. This would make it orders of magnitude larger than the two previously detected interstellar visitors, 'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov.
