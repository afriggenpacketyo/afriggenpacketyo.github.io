          <p>A 31-year-old mother in Brazoria County, Texas, is facing two counts of murder and two counts of aggravated assault after allegedly shooting her four children. Two of the children, aged 13 and 4, were fatally wounded, while the other two, ages 8 and 9, are reported to be in stable condition. The mother herself called 911 to report the incident, and authorities recovered a weapon at the scene. She is currently being held on a $14 million bond as the community grapples with the senseless tragedy.</p>

The acquisition follows a recent rocket explosion during a ground test but comes as Firefly continues to secure major government contracts, including one with NASA.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For seniors considering a reverse mortgage to supplement retirement income, lenders typically require at least 50% to 60% equity in their home. This means the outstanding mortgage balance should not exceed about half of the home's appraised value. The actual amount that can be borrowed, however, depends on other factors like the homeowner's age, current interest rates, and FHA lending limits. If a homeowner falls short of the equity threshold, options include paying down the existing mortgage, waiting for home value to appreciate, or downsizing. (not investment advice)</p>

Her legal team expressed disappointment but vowed to continue exploring other legal avenues, while speculation about a potential presidential pardon has been dismissed by the White House.</p>

          <p>Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for Virginia's attorney general, is facing widespread condemnation after 2022 text messages resurfaced in which he used violent and inflammatory language. In the messages, Jones mused about hypothetically shooting a Republican political opponent, former House Speaker Todd Gilbert. Jones has since issued a public apology, stating he is "embarrassed, ashamed, and sorry." The controversy has drawn criticism from both parties, including his own running mate, and prompted calls for him to withdraw from the race.</p>

The British Medical Association (BMA) union highlights that this year, there were only 10,000 jobs for 30,000 candidates, leaving many skilled doctors without a clear career path. The union blames poor workforce planning, where medical school enrollment has expanded without a corresponding increase in NHS training posts.

          <p>The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago have filed a lawsuit to prevent the Trump administration from deploying hundreds of National Guard troops to the city. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul accused the president of using the military to punish political opponents. The lawsuit argues the deployment violates federal law limiting the use of the military for domestic enforcement and infringes on states' rights. The White House has defended the plan, stating troops are needed to protect federal employees from "violent riots," while the state's governor called the move provocative and arbitrary.</p>

          <p>The domestic box office is projected to surpass $9 billion in 2025, potentially reaching its highest total since the pandemic began, thanks to a strong lineup of winter movie releases. After a slower fall season, momentum is expected to build with films like "Tron: Ares," "Wicked: For Good," "Zootopia 2," and "Avatar: Fire and Ash." Analysts project fourth-quarter ticket sales to reach between $2.5 billion and $2.7 billion, representing a significant year-over-year increase. This positive trend is anticipated to continue into 2026 with a slate of other major blockbusters.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva held a video call described as positive, marking a potential thaw in relations. During the conversation, Lula requested the removal of a 50% U.S. tariff on some Brazilian goods, which was imposed in response to the trial of his predecessor. Both leaders reminisced about a recent positive encounter and agreed to future discussions, with Trump appointing Secretary of State Marco Rubio to lead negotiations. The call is the first formal discussion between the two since their relationship became strained over the tariff issue.</p>

          <p>In the largest U.S. coal sale in over a decade, the Navajo Transitional Energy Co. (NTEC) was the sole bidder, offering just $186,000 for the rights to 167 million tons of coal on federal lands in Montana. The bid amounts to about one-tenth of a penny per ton, a stark illustration of coal's declining market value despite the administration's push to expand its use. The low bid reflects predictions of a significant decline in coal demand, as the power plants currently using fuel from the adjacent mine are scheduled to stop burning coal within the next decade.</p>

          <p>Foreclosure filings in the U.S. have been steadily rising, with an 18% increase as of August compared to the previous year, as homeowners grapple with mounting financial pressures. Rising costs for home insurance, property taxes, and general living expenses are stretching household budgets thin, making it difficult to manage mortgage payments. While foreclosure rates remain below pre-pandemic levels, the trend reflects the strain on homeowners, particularly when faced with unexpected events like job loss.

          <p>France's political instability has deepened as Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu resigned after his government collapsed within 14 hours of being formed. The immediate cause was the conservative Republicans (LR) party withdrawing its support after Lecornu appointed a politician they opposed to a key cabinet post. This marks the third prime minister to fail in a short period, highlighting President Emmanuel Macron's increasing difficulty in building a stable governing coalition. The turmoil reflects the splintering of Macron's centrist alliance as political parties begin positioning for the 2027 presidential election.</p>

While the move ensures continued insurance coverage, critics argue this extra step creates an unnecessary barrier to vaccination and could decrease uptake.

          <p>The UK Conservative Party has announced a plan to cut household energy costs by rolling back green energy regulations, including scrapping carbon pricing and renewable energy subsidies. The party claims these measures currently add 20% to electricity prices and that their removal would save the average household £165. This policy marks a significant pivot away from the net-zero agenda previously championed by the party. The move sets up a political battle over the cost of living, with the Labour Party and Reform UK offering competing promises for even larger bill reductions through different energy strategies.</p>

The article contends that the plan sidelines Palestinians, pays only lip service to statehood as a vague "aspiration," and establishes what amounts to a colonial-style administration. It notes that both Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Hamas reject key parts of the deal, making genuine progress difficult.

Employees who do commute are adopting new habits like "coffee badging"—showing up for just a few hours—or "micro-shifting" their work into non-linear blocks to maintain flexibility. This trend indicates that while companies are mandating a return, many employees are complying, but on their own terms.</p>
