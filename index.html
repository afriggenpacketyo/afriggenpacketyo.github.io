          <p>Residents of a South Texas community, primarily SpaceX employees, have voted overwhelmingly to establish a new city called Starbase, fulfilling a long-held ambition of Elon Musk.

While road maintenance will no longer be the county's responsibility, the new municipality gains immunity from lawsuits and the power to condemn property.
