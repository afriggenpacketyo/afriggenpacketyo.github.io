          <p>Rescue teams are continuing an extensive search for more than 170 people who remain missing after catastrophic flash floods devastated Central Texas. The official death toll has climbed to at least 122, with the majority of fatalities occurring in Kerr County, where the Guadalupe River rose to unprecedented levels. A significant tragedy occurred at Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp, where dozens of campers and counselors died. The disaster has prompted a federal declaration and raised scrutiny over the adequacy of weather warnings and local emergency preparedness.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions secured a commanding 48-0 victory against an Australia and New Zealand Invitational XV in their final match before the first Test against the Wallabies. Winger Duhan van der Merwe was a standout performer, scoring a hat-trick of tries in a dominant team performance that saw eight tries in total. The game also saw the return of Owen Farrell as a substitute, though the team faced injury concerns for Luke Cowan Dickie and Garry Ringrose. The decisive win provides the Lions with significant momentum heading into the crucial Test week.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering authorizing a new round of funding for Ukraine, which would be the first such approval during his new term. This potential policy shift comes as Russia intensifies its aerial attacks on Ukrainian cities and could signal a message to Moscow. While Trump has previously criticized the level of U.S. spending, he has recently expressed frustration with Russia's actions. The administration is also continuing to press European NATO allies to increase their share of financial and military support for Ukraine's defense.</p>

The review highlights the book's exploration of various 'what-if' scenarios, including Joe Biden's decision not to run for re-election, and its critical examination of the strategies and delusions within both political parties.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Democrats' Plan to Wait Until August to Attack Trump's Policies is Malpractice</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece delivers a sharp critique of the Democratic Party's perceived passive strategy against the Trump administration, arguing that waiting until the August recess to launch a midterm offensive is political malpractice. The author contends that in the face of destructive policies and human tragedies, such as the recent Texas floods, an immediate and relentless political counterattack is required. The article calls for Democrats to abandon deference and civility, and to aggressively hold the Republican party accountable for the harm being caused.</p>

          <p>Even as Malibu enters its peak summer season, small businesses along Pacific Coast Highway are still recovering from the devastating Palisades fire six months ago. Many shops and restaurants that survived the flames report that customer traffic is down by 25% or more compared to a normal year. The prolonged closure of the highway isolated these businesses, and even after reopening, they face a slow and uncertain return to financial stability in a landscape visibly altered by the fire.</p>

          <p>A new art exhibition at Descanso Gardens in Los Angeles, titled “Roots of Cool,” brings attention to the issue of shade equity and its connection to climate justice. Featuring works by all-women artists, the show explores how historical urban planning decisions have left many communities, particularly those of color, with inadequate access to cooling tree canopies. The exhibition blends art installations with scientific data to provoke visitors to contemplate the unequal distribution of shade and imagine a more verdant, equitable future for the city.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary posits that the right-wing backlash against the new "Superman" film for being "superwoke" is unfounded, as the movie's themes are deeply rooted in traditional American values. Although director James Gunn has noted the character's immigrant story, the film reportedly emphasizes that Superman's heroism is a product of his upbringing by loving parents in the Kansas heartland. The author argues that Superman's story has always been one of assimilation and opportunity, rather than radical politics, making the current culture war controversy overblown.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order that blocks the Trump administration from conducting broad, untargeted immigration arrests in several Southern California counties. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU and other advocacy groups, which accused federal agents of using unconstitutional tactics like racial profiling and warrantless arrests. The judge found that such "roving patrols" without reasonable suspicion were unlawful, a decision praised by immigrant advocates but strongly opposed by the Department of Homeland Security.</p>

This radical approach creates significant economic uncertainty by setting high initial tariff rates while leaving the door open for negotiations to lower them. The policy is an escalation of a global tariff first imposed in April, with higher rates now being threatened against countries that have not yet negotiated new trade agreements with the United States.
