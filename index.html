          <p>A fragile trade truce between the European Union and the United States is under threat after President Trump warned of new tariffs in retaliation for the EU's digital services taxes. The U.S. administration argues these taxes unfairly target American tech giants like Google and Amazon, demanding their immediate removal. This renewed dispute has caught EU policymakers off guard, creating uncertainty just weeks after they had agreed to a deal to stabilize transatlantic trade relations. The EU is now weighing its limited options for a response.</p>

          <p>David Warburton, the former Conservative MP for Somerton and Frome, has died suddenly at the age of 59. The Metropolitan Police are treating his death as unexpected but not suspicious after he was found at a residence in London. Warburton's political career ended in 2023 when he resigned after admitting to cocaine use, following a suspension over sexual misconduct allegations which he denied and were later withdrawn. Colleagues remembered him as a talented and passionate defender of his constituents.</p>

They plan to hold a news conference featuring ten of Epstein's accusers, aiming to increase public pressure for transparency and accountability. Khanna stated that hearing directly from the victims, many of whom have not spoken publicly for decades, will outrage the American people and build support for their bill demanding the release of the documents.</p>

His debut solo EP, "Gemini," is set for release, with its first single featuring his longtime collaborators, the Dirty Heads.

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose widespread tariffs on foreign goods. The decision is a significant legal challenge to his administration's trade policy, which justified the duties by declaring U.S. trade deficits a national emergency. While the court found the action unlawful, it has allowed the tariffs to remain in effect temporarily to give the administration time to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.

It details how difficult terrain, landslides, and limited communications are hampering rescue and relief operations for the hundreds killed and injured. The situation is further complicated by the country's economic collapse and international isolation under the Taliban government, which severely limits the availability of aid, resources, and medical infrastructure needed to cope with the large-scale disaster.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany, France, and the United Kingdom have formally initiated the "snapback" mechanism to reinstate United Nations sanctions against Iran, citing Tehran's ongoing non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal (JCPOA). This diplomatic tool, part of the original agreement, could restore all previously lifted international sanctions if a resolution is not reached within 30 days. The move significantly escalates pressure on Iran, which now faces a deepening diplomatic crisis and the potential for severe economic consequences, further destabilizing regional tensions.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-owned mining company, Sino-Metals Leach Zambia, has been accused of covering up the true extent of a major toxic spill that polluted the Kafue River, a vital water source for millions of Zambians. An environmental cleanup firm hired by the company claims the spill released 1.5 million tons of toxic material containing cyanide and arsenic, at least 30 times more than was admitted. The firm alleges its contract was terminated just before it could submit its final report, raising serious concerns about corporate accountability and environmental safety.</p>

          <p>A new U.S. law, signed by President Trump, makes overtime pay exempt from federal income taxes for many American workers. However, the benefit primarily applies to those covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), meaning certain employees, such as many unionized airline and railroad workers governed by different labor laws, do not qualify. While proponents say it will boost take-home pay for millions, critics argue the law could incentivize overwork and discourage new hiring. The tax exemption is set to expire in 2028.

The visit and Wicker's comments drew a sharp rebuke from Beijing, which firmly opposes any official U.S.-Taiwan exchanges and considers the island part of its territory under its "one-China" principle.</p>

          <p>President Trump has defended his administration's decision to issue 600,000 student visas to Chinese nationals over the next two years, pushing back against strong criticism from some of his populist supporters.

          <p>Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has declared an ambitious goal for the country to become a fully digital, cashless society by 2030. However, financial experts and business owners are skeptical, pointing to significant obstacles such as a large informal economy, a rural population highly reliant on cash, and weak cybersecurity infrastructure. Critics argue the plan is unrealistic and could be dangerous, given recent major cyberattacks on government systems. They also warn it could harm small businesses that are unequipped for a rapid transition away from cash.</p>
