          <p>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a global hunger monitoring initiative, has issued a stark warning that the "worst-case scenario of famine" is currently unfolding in Gaza. According to the report, there is mounting evidence that widespread starvation, malnutrition, and disease are causing a significant increase in hunger-related deaths. The IPC noted that critical data thresholds for food consumption and acute malnutrition have already been surpassed in parts of the Gaza Strip. The situation is described as a developing crisis requiring immediate attention.</p>

          <p>The renowned Shaolin Temple in China has a new leader after its abbot of over 25 years, Shi Yongxin, was removed and placed under investigation for alleged financial and sexual misconduct. Authorities announced that Shi Yinle, the abbot of the White Horse Temple, will take over leadership of the 1,500-year-old monastery. The former abbot's Buddhist credentials have been revoked and companies linked to him have been deregistered. The Shaolin Temple, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is famously known as the birthplace of Zen Buddhism and the cradle of Shaolin kung fu.</p>

          <p>Civilians and workers in downtown Manhattan have described scenes of terror and panic as a gunman opened fire inside a Park Avenue office building, killing four people. Witnesses recounted scrambling for cover as gunfire shattered the building's glass facade, with some comparing the scene to a warzone. People poured out of skyscrapers onto the streets, many with their hands in the air, while others sheltered in nearby buildings for hours. One witness described helping an injured man who ran out of the building pleading for help, encapsulating the fear that gripped the area during the evening rush-hour attack.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials reported that a Russian airstrike on a prison in the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region resulted in the deaths of at least 17 people and left 42 others wounded.

While Pascal has stated that physical touch is a coping mechanism for his anxiety, and Kirby has defended their interactions as innocent, analysts note the undeniable benefit to the studio.

          <p>A new report from insurance firm Munich Re reveals that natural disasters have caused over $131 billion in global economic losses in the first half of 2025. While slightly lower than the same period in 2024, this figure remains above long-term averages, with $80 billion of the losses being insured. The Los Angeles wildfires were the year's costliest disaster, accounting for $53 billion in losses. Climate scientists at Munich Re attribute the rising losses to climate change intensifying weather events and have called for better preventive measures, like more robust construction, to mitigate future damages.</p>

          <p>President Trump's defamation lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal and its owner, Rupert Murdoch, has intensified, with Trump's legal team making a personal push against the media mogul. Trump alleges he personally warned Murdoch that a story about a supposed racy birthday card to Jeffrey Epstein was fake, yet the Journal published it anyway. His lawyers are now seeking an expedited deposition from the 94-year-old Murdoch, citing his age and health as reasons he may be unavailable for a future trial. This legal maneuver is seen by some as a classic Trump tactic to pressure and silence media opponents.</p>

A DHS spokesperson stated that DACA does not confer legal status and that recipients are not automatically protected from deportation.

          <p>The recent trade agreement between the European Union and the United States could unexpectedly benefit the United Kingdom, according to some economic analysts. With the EU facing a 15% tariff on goods imported to the U.S., the U.K.'s lower 10% levy makes its exports relatively cheaper and more attractive. This tariff difference could incentivize U.S. firms to source more goods from Britain and may even encourage EU-based manufacturers to shift production to the U.K. to maintain their profit margins. However, experts note that any potential benefits will likely take time to materialize. (not investment advice)</p>

Fresh food inflation remained steady at 3.2%, but prices for ambient or cupboard goods saw a significant jump to 5.1%.

          <p>China has developed a new AI-powered weather warning system named Mazu, which it says will help developing nations better prepare for natural disasters. The China Meteorological Administration (CMA) stated that the system is designed for global reach and is part of an effort to build an early warning partnership network to jointly tackle extreme weather. Officials highlighted that China's Fengyun satellites already provide data to 133 countries and that this new system will enhance collaborative efforts.

CEO Antonio Filosa stated that the new leadership team will continue making "tough decisions" to re-establish profitable growth. The guidance is based on the assumption that current tariff and trade rules, including the new U.S.-EU framework, will remain stable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid the modern craze for collectible toys like Labubu, this article explores the history of a nostalgic predecessor: the Monchhichi. While the Japanese-designed monkey doll became a global sensation in the 1980s, it was unavailable in communist East Germany due to a ban on capitalist imports. In response, a state-owned enterprise in the toy-making town of Sonneberg created its own version called the Tiemi. The Tiemi became highly popular throughout the Eastern Bloc but ceased production after German reunification, making the surviving dolls sought-after collector's items today, embodying a unique piece of Cold War-era culture.</p>

Like other major banks, Barclays benefited from a turbulent quarter in global markets that boosted trading revenues. CEO C.S.

This call for a stronger soft power strategy comes as global power dynamics are shifting, with emerging economies seeking a more active role in global governance.

Kennedy argued that existing gun laws are sufficient and also suggested a return to a more aggressive "stop-and-frisk" policing strategy. Critics pointed to the senator's long-standing opposition to gun violence prevention measures and his high ratings from the National Rifle Association.</p>
