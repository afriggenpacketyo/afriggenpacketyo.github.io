          <p>President Trump held a gala dinner at his Virginia golf club for investors in his $TRUMP memecoin, sparking controversy and protests. Attendees, some from overseas, paid significant sums to influence Trump and U.S. financial regulations, raising concerns about corruption and the mixing of personal enrichment with presidential duties. Trump promised to promote the crypto industry from the White House, while protesters decried the event as a historic corruption of the presidency. The event has drawn criticism from senators and watchdogs, who see it as an unprecedented effort to enrich the first family through a speculative digital asset. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Japan's population ages, an increasing number of childless elderly individuals are choosing to donate their wealth to charitable causes after death. Bequest donations, mainly to hospitals and nonprofit organizations, are on the rise due to the growing number of childless couples and unmarried individuals. Organizations are now acting as intermediaries, facilitating these donations through wills or trusts, allowing seniors to ensure their savings are used for meaningful purposes.</p>

          <p>Following a landmark decision by China's biggest banks to slash one-year deposit rates below 1%, Chinese households are struggling to find attractive investment options. The move has made an already challenging financial landscape even more difficult for risk-averse savers. With economic uncertainty and weak income prospects, families are seeking alternatives to traditional bank deposits for steady returns. The decline in deposit yields is the seventh such adjustment since September 2022.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, driven by surging rice prices and reduced energy subsidies, marking the highest level in over two years. This increase is putting pressure on the Bank of Japan, as Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled his intention to raise rates while closely monitoring the effects of U.S. tariffs. The country's prime minister has pledged to lower rice prices, staking his job on the line, as the cost of living continues to rise for Japanese consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core consumer prices in April climbed 3.5 percent from a year earlier, increasing at the fastest pace in more than two years, driven by reduced government utility subsidies and surging rice prices, government data showed Friday. The increase in the nationwide core consumer price index, excluding volatile fresh food, followed a 3.2 percent rise in March and was the largest since January 2023, with the key gauge of inflation having remained at or above the Bank of Japan's 2 percent target since April 2022. Higher rice prices are likely to continue pushing up prices in the service sector, which includes the dining industry, supporting the case for the BOJ to raise interest rates if Japan produces a favorable outcome in tariff negotiations with the United States.</p>
