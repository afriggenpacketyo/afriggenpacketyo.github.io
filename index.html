          <p>Jack Draper's pursuit of the Queen's Club title was halted in the semi-finals by Jiri Lehecka, who won 6-4, 4-6, 7-5. Draper, battling tonsillitis, displayed resilience by leveling the match after losing the first set, but Lehecka secured a crucial break in the third set. Despite the loss, Draper expressed his determination to compete, stating he wouldn't have withdrawn even with a broken leg. He will now rest and prepare for Wimbledon, aiming to recover fully for the upcoming tournament. The tennis star's health issues made the defeat even more difficult, but he will now focus on recuperation. Optimism remains high for his future performances. His next tournament will be the prestigious Wimbledon tournament.</p>

          <p>A pilot's attempt to avoid a turtle on the runway at Sugar Valley Airport in Mocksville, North Carolina, resulted in a fatal plane crash. According to a preliminary NTSB report, the pilot raised the right main wheel after landing to avoid the turtle, after which the plane's wings rocked, and it took off again. The aircraft crashed in a wooded area near the runway, killing the pilot and one passenger while seriously injuring another. The NTSB is still investigating the crash's probable cause, with a final report expected in one to two years. The plane was wedged between several trees and remained in one piece except for a few pieces of fabric found in a nearby stream.</p>

Gamboa's father maintains his son's innocence, while police continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding the shooting and appeal for video footage related to the incident.

          <p>The Trump administration has fired hundreds of journalists at Voice of America (VOA), effectively shutting down the US-funded news outlet, which was initially established during World War Two to counter Nazi propaganda. The administration claims the layoffs are due to dysfunction, bias, and waste within the agency. Kari Lake, appointed by Trump to run VOA, stated that 639 employees were laid off, with over 85% of the agency's staff losing their jobs since March. VOA journalists have sued to stop the network's elimination, claiming it marks the death of independent journalism upholding US ideals. The move follows Trump's order to eliminate VOA and the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM) to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law.</p>

          <p>Senator Jack Reed has criticized President Trump's dismissal of his intelligence chief's assessment that Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon. Reed suggests that Trump's rebuke may be politically motivated, particularly as the president contemplates an attack against Iran. He points out that National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard testified weeks prior that the intelligence community believes Iran has not authorized a nuclear weapons program since 2003. Reed argues that if Gabbard's testimony were false, it should be corrected immediately, rather than being dismissed following Israeli actions. Reed's comments highlight the growing tension between the administration and the intelligence community regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

Jamil Atili described the situation as humiliating and deadly, recounting how he was cut and pepper-sprayed without obtaining food for his family. The UN reports that aid delivery is chaotic, with convoys being overwhelmed and dispersed by gunfire, leading to further casualties.

          <p>Despite publicly opposing Israel's attacks on Iran, Jordan and Saudi Arabia have taken actions that indirectly support Israel. Jordan shot down Iranian missiles and drones crossing its airspace, citing the need to protect its territory. Saudi Arabia likely allowed Israel to use its airspace for defensive purposes. These actions reflect a complex balancing act, as both countries navigate domestic tensions stemming from historical antipathy towards Israel. Jordan's government emphasizes self-defense to justify its actions, while Saudi Arabia maintains security cooperation with the U.S., which influences its stance. The situation underscores the intricate geopolitical dynamics in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>The possibility of regime change in Iran, fueled by Israel's ongoing attacks, raises concerns about potential instability. Historical examples, such as Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, demonstrate the disastrous consequences of foreign-imposed regime change. These interventions often lead to power vacuums, violence, and prolonged conflict. Experts warn that a similar outcome in Iran is likely, as a successful regime change would require ground forces and a strong rebel movement, neither of which are currently present. The article cautions against the dangerous dream of regime change, highlighting the need for stability and diplomacy in the region.</p>

          <p>The British-flagged superyacht Bayesian, which sank off Sicily last year, resulting in the death of tech magnate Mike Lynch and six others, has been recovered by salvage crews. The complex operation involved raising the vessel from 165 feet below the surface and pumping out seawater. The yacht will be transported to Termini Imerese for investigators to determine the cause of the sinking. The Bayesian sank during a violent storm while Lynch was celebrating his acquittal on fraud charges.

          <p>Steve Bannon played a significant role in President Trump's decision to delay a potential strike against Iran's nuclear facility. Bannon, who holds no official position, advised Trump that Israeli intelligence couldn't be trusted and the bunker-buster bomb might not work as planned. Other influential conservatives, like Senator Lindsey Graham, urged Trump to support Israel in eliminating the nuclear threat. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were also key figures in the discussions. The uncertainty surrounding Iran's nuclear capabilities and the potential repercussions of a military strike have led to internal debate within the administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave approaches, experts say that US sunscreens are less effective than many available overseas, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. This is largely due to regulatory differences, as the FDA has not approved a new UV-filter for sunscreen in over 20 years. Other countries, like France and South Korea, have approved a wider range of UV-filtering ingredients, allowing for more advanced sunscreens. Despite this, dermatologists stress the importance of wearing sunscreen, suggesting a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. A bipartisan bill aims to modernize sunscreen regulations and allow non-animal testing alternatives for regulatory approval.</p>
