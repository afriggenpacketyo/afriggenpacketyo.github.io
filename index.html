            <h2>UnitedHealth Stock Plummets Amid Rising Medical Costs, Potentially Impacting Insurers</h2>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>UnitedHealth Group's stock experienced a significant drop after the company lowered its profit forecast due to higher-than-expected medical costs in its Medicare Advantage plans, raising concerns for other insurers offering similar plans. Analysts suggest this could be a warning sign for the industry, especially after a challenging year marked by lower government payments and increased medical expenses. The rise in care utilization, particularly in doctor and outpatient services, has significantly exceeded the company's projections, leading to speculation about potential adjustments in care management practices. UnitedHealth is reportedly addressing these issues, anticipating improved results by 2026, while insurers are expected to receive a boost from increased Medicare Advantage reimbursement rates.

While they welcome increased funding and focus on the issue, they caution that rigorous studies require years, not months, and that genetics likely play a significant role.

            <h2>Blind Taste Test Reveals Surprising Results for Plant-Based Meats</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-17 13:30:00 EDT</div>

            <p>A large blind taste test comparing plant-based and animal meats revealed that some plant-based products were rated as equal to or better than their animal counterparts. While animal meats generally received higher scores, a significant number of participants rated certain plant-based meats favorably, particularly those from Impossible Foods. The results suggest that taste may not be the only factor driving consumer preferences, with psychological and social factors also playing a significant role. The study highlights the need for plant-based meat companies to improve taste and address consumer perceptions to gain wider acceptance.</p>

            <p>The Department of Government Efficiency's website quietly removed nearly $1 billion in claimed savings from canceled contracts, grants, or leases, according to reports.

            <p>Tax attorneys are reporting that the IRS has become a 'zombie' as the agency cuts staff and halts audits of the wealthy. The upside for high earners is clear: Fewer agents means fewer audits and reviews. Attorneys say many of their audits have gone dark, and with the statute of limitations on an assessment typically limited to three years after the taxes are filed, many are expected to expire without attention. Since the IRS has historical data on every taxpayer who has ever filed, a missing filing in one year would immediately raise an audit flag by the IRS's automated system. (not investment advice)</p>
