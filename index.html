          <p>Spirit Airlines plans to furlough 270 pilots and downgrade 140 captains to first officers this fall as it struggles with financial instability and softer travel demand. The airline, which recently emerged from bankruptcy, is taking these steps to align its staffing with a reduced flight schedule in an effort to return to profitability. The pilots' union expressed concern over the continued shrinking of the airline and the erosion of pilot careers. This move follows previous furloughs last year as the company navigates a challenging post-bankruptcy environment.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old Michigan man has been charged with terrorism and 11 counts of assault with intent to murder following a knife attack at a Traverse City Walmart that injured 11 people. The suspect, who has a history of mental illness and a criminal background, pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors filed the terrorism charge due to the attack's broad impact on the community's sense of safety.

          <p>JPMorgan Chase claims that fintech data aggregators like Plaid are "massively taxing" its systems with excessive and unnecessary data requests, with only 13% being initiated by customers for active transactions. The bank is preparing to charge new fees for this data access, citing the high costs of maintaining infrastructure and increased fraud risks associated with these transactions. Plaid defended its practices, stating that frequent data pulls are standard for providing critical services like fraud alerts and that JPMorgan's claims are misleading. The dispute highlights growing tensions in the "open banking" ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of California system has offered admission to its largest-ever class of California undergraduates, increasing in-state first-year admits by over 7% while maintaining strong racial diversity. The move addresses public pressure to prioritize local students, even as the system faces significant budget challenges. UC also increased offers to international students, who pay higher tuition, to offset potential enrollment declines due to new visa vetting and higher fees. Despite a slight dip in total applications, Latinos remained the largest group of admitted Californians for the sixth consecutive year.</p>

The judge also questioned if the lawsuit, brought by a firm whose CEO is a vocal Trump ally and critic of Fed policy, was primarily a publicity stunt.

The analysis also suggests China will pivot its trade relationships, with Russia expected to see the largest increase in trade with China.

The challenge stems from a complex series of events where federal judges initially tried to replace Habba, only to have the Justice Department fire their chosen replacement and reinstall Habba through a procedural maneuver.

          <p>President Donald Trump's legal team has asked a federal court to compel a swift deposition of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, citing his advanced age of 94 and alleged recent health issues. The request is part of Trump's $10 billion lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal, owned by Murdoch's News Corp, over an article about a supposedly fake letter linking Trump to Jeffrey Epstein. Trump's lawyers argue Murdoch's testimony is crucial and that his age makes his future availability for an in-person trial uncertain. The judge has given Murdoch until August 4 to respond to the request.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has issued a nationwide preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration from cutting off Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood clinics. The ruling stems from a lawsuit over a provision in a recent tax bill that targeted abortion providers. The judge stated that cutting the funding would likely cause "adverse health consequences" for patients, including reduced access to contraception and STI treatment. This court order protects funding for the organization's nearly 600 health centers across the country while the legal battle continues.</p>

          <p>In a personal opinion piece, a contributor from Gaza describes a long history of what they term systematic humiliation and dehumanization by Israeli forces, culminating in the current conflict. The writer argues that the "human animals" rhetoric used by an Israeli official was a prelude to the destruction of Palestinian society and that starvation is being used as a weapon of war. The article conveys a deep sense of despair and abandonment felt by Gazans, who face not only physical destruction but also the loss of their sense of self and humanity.</p>

          <p>During a joint press conference with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, President Donald Trump used the opportunity to promote his Turnberry golf resort in Scotland. In response to a question about the Federal Reserve, Trump launched into a lengthy description of the "opulent and beautiful" renovations he made to the property. The incident has drawn criticism and renewed scrutiny over the president's mixing of official duties with his private business interests. This comes as his Scottish resorts are already under the spotlight for seeking public funds for hosting a golf tournament.</p>

          <p>China has offered to strengthen economic ties with Brazil, positioning itself as a key ally days before new U.S. tariffs on Brazilian exports are scheduled to take effect.

          <p>The only felony case stemming from the violent mob attack on a pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA has concluded with the defendant entering a diversionary program. The man, charged with assault with a deadly weapon and a hate crime for attacking protesters, will avoid jail time if he completes therapy and anti-bias training. This outcome has drawn criticism from a victim in the case, who viewed the punishment as too lenient. The case highlights the limited number of criminal charges filed in connection with the campus protest violence last year.</p>

          <p>A large-scale, two-year study has provided strong evidence that a combination of diet, exercise, and brain training can significantly improve thinking and memory in older adults. The POINTER study involved over 2,100 sedentary people in their 60s and 70s. Participants who followed an intensive regimen of a Mediterranean diet, regular aerobic exercise, and cognitive training showed cognitive function scores similar to people one to two years younger. The results suggest that such lifestyle interventions can alter the trajectory of age-related cognitive decline.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has significantly shortened his timeline for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, now setting a new deadline of "10 or 12 days." Speaking during a visit to the UK, Trump expressed impatience with the lack of progress in negotiations, stating there is "no reason in waiting." This marks a shift from a previous 50-day timeline and reflects growing frustration after recent talks in Istanbul yielded little more than a prisoner exchange. The president's comments signal escalating pressure on Russia to engage in more substantive peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>An analysis outlines how President Trump's tariffs are likely to increase costs for American consumers on a range of imported goods. Products such as clothing, footwear, coffee, and olive oil are expected to become more expensive as the U.S. levies higher taxes on major manufacturing and agricultural partners. The report also notes that prices for cars, both foreign-made and those from U.S. brands that use foreign parts, could rise. Even the cost of housing could be affected due to tariffs on essential building materials like steel, aluminum, and potentially lumber. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new United Nations report finds that over 2.3 billion people worldwide experienced moderate to severe food insecurity in the past year, with 673 million being chronically undernourished. While global hunger levels have dropped slightly since the pandemic's peak, the number of people unable to afford a healthy diet has increased due to rising food prices. The report highlights stark regional inequalities, with Africa being the hardest-hit continent where nearly 58% of the population faces food insecurity. Women are also disproportionately affected globally due to systemic inequalities.</p>
