          <p>FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino announced that the bureau is actively investigating a potential cover-up regarding the origins of COVID-19, amidst concerns about a newly identified strain. Bongino stated that the investigation spans multiple field offices, emphasizing the American people's right to answers, though he did not disclose specific individuals or entities under scrutiny. This follows previous assessments from the FBI that the virus likely originated from a lab incident in Wuhan, China, a claim consistently denied by Chinese authorities. The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic is also investigating whether early public health messaging downplayed the lab leak theory for diplomatic or political reasons. The article reports that Bongino has increasingly used social media to communicate bureau updates directly to the public, marking a shift in how the FBI engages with the public on sensitive matters. Optimism that truth and justice will prevail is not unwarranted here.</p>

          <h2>US Trade Court Blocks Trump's Sweeping Tariffs, Citing Unilateral Authority Overreach</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, delivering a significant blow to his economic policies, as the Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The Manhattan-based court emphasized that the US Constitution reserves the power to regulate commerce with other nations exclusively to Congress, a power not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The court also blocked levies on China, Mexico, and Canada, which were imposed in response to concerns about drugs and illegal immigration. The Trump administration immediately appealed the ruling, while the attorney general of New York welcomed the decision, asserting that no president has the power to unilaterally raise taxes, as these tariffs would have led to inflation, economic damage, and job losses. The optimism that the court's decision to curb presidential power is not necessarily a sign of the economy's future.</p>

          <p>A Salvadorian immigrant family made three attempts to cross the Rainbow Bridge into Canada, fleeing potential deportations from the US. Despite having relatives in Canada, their initial attempts were thwarted due to documentation issues and stricter border policies. Immigration experts note an increase in asylum seekers at the border, fleeing not only their homelands but also President Trump's immigration policies. Canada has invested in strengthening border security, partly to placate Trump, who has blamed the country for illegal immigration into the US. The family's story highlights the challenges faced by asylum seekers navigating complex immigration laws and policies. The family's persistence and eventual success in seeking asylum provide a glimmer of hope amidst a difficult situation.</p>

The disappearance has caused shockwaves throughout South Africa, drawing comparisons to the Madeleine McCann case.

          <p>China has extended the strike range of its Type 055 destroyer by integrating an airborne early warning system, according to state broadcaster CCTV. The destroyer, Lhasa, can now synchronize with the People’s Liberation Army’s airborne early warning platforms, enabling long-range anti-ship and air-defense strikes without relying solely on the ship’s radars. This advancement represents a major step in operational coordination, facilitating complete interoperability and seamless information sharing across domains. Footage showed the Lhasa participating in a live-fire exercise, firing missiles guided by airborne targeting cues, highlighting the enhanced detection range and battlefield awareness capabilities. The networked capability mirrors Pakistan’s use of similar Chinese technology, according to the article.</p>

          <p>South Korea's central bank has cut its policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.5%, the lowest level since August 2022, marking its fourth cut in the last six meetings. This decision is influenced by protracted political turmoil following a failed attempt by the former leader to impose martial law and the imposition of 25% reciprocal tariffs by the Trump administration. The central bank expects economic growth to decline considerably while inflation remains broadly stable. South Korea's GDP unexpectedly contracted in the first quarter, shrinking 0.1% from a year earlier, and the bank also slashed its full-year GDP forecast for 2025 to just 0.8%. The article notes that a new president will be elected soon, potentially leading to fiscal stimulus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A panel of federal judges has blocked President Trump from imposing some of his steepest tariffs on China and other U.S. trading partners, finding that federal law did not grant him “unbounded authority” to tax imports. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that Trump’s tariffs “exceed any authority granted” to the president by the emergency powers law, delivering a setback to his efforts to pressure other nations into striking trade deals more beneficial to the United States. The ruling does not affect tariffs issued under separate legal authorities, including levies on steel, aluminum, and cars. A White House spokesman rebuked the court, saying that unfair trade relationships had “decimated American communities,” but the administration immediately filed plans to appeal.

Tristan Tate faces 11 charges, including sexual assault, actual bodily harm, and human trafficking, related to one complainant.

The projects, slated for completion in 2036 and 2040 respectively, aim to provide more resilience to future droughts in a dry region with high water demand. The move comes amid concerns about rising temperatures, a growing population, and extra demand from new houses and data centers, potentially squeezing water supplies. Some experts caution that managing water usage and cutting waste should take precedence, while others stress the need to balance local objections with the greater good of securing water resources. The government also intends to pass legislation to automatically make the other seven proposed reservoirs "nationally significant" as well.</p>

The US Court of International Trade's decision argues that Trump surpassed these limits and reads federal trade laws to place rigid constraints on his ability to continue his trade war. The court concluded that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 does not grant Trump unlimited tariff authority and that the tariffs do not effectively address the threat of drug trafficking. The decision, which can be appealed, has significant implications for Trump's trade policies. The legal checks and balances being applied here are a good thing.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk is set to depart the Trump administration after serving as a "special government employee" for 130 days. Musk thanked President Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending through his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). He said the DOGE mission will continue to strengthen throughout the government. As a special government employee, Musk was limited to a 130-day appointment, which he is set to reach. The departure of Musk and his work's legacy in the government efficiency sector will provide some stability to government programs in the future.</p>

Musk has criticized President Trump’s signature domestic policy legislation, complained about a deal given to a rival company, and has yet to fulfill a $100 million pledge to Trump’s political operation. Although he remains on good terms with Trump, Musk has expressed that he spent too much time focused on politics and lamented the reputational damage to his companies. He also expressed disappointment with the domestic policy bill passed by the House, saying it increases the budget deficit.

          <p>As negotiations to end the war in Ukraine stall, the Trump administration is turning to the Middle East to showcase progress toward landmark deals and to fulfill the president’s vow to be a global peacemaker. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff announced that a temporary truce in Gaza was within reach, potentially leading to a peaceful resolution. Trump has also taken a harsher approach to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, stating it would be “inappropriate” to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. The administration has grown increasingly optimistic about brokering a nuclear agreement with Iran, exploring steps to demonstrate tangible progress, while Russia has proposed sending a delegation to present Ukraine with terms for a ceasefire.

Hoover was convicted on federal charges in 1997 and sentenced to six life terms, in addition to a 200-year sentence on state charges for a 1973 murder. Hoover's attorneys expressed their gratitude to President Trump for delivering justice, while the lead prosecutor in Hoover's federal trial expressed disappointment.

          <p>Justice Department lawyers have stated that the government is taking steps to comply with a court order to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man, known as O.C.G., who had been deported to Mexico and then sent to Guatemala. This action comes after a federal judge in Massachusetts ordered officials to “facilitate” his return, finding that his removal lacked any semblance of due process. The government's agreement represents a de-escalation in a case that is shaping up to be one of the key courtroom battles over President Trump’s attempts to conduct mass deportations. In 2024, O.C.G. was kidnapped and sexual assaulted while passing through Mexico on his way to the U.S. border, and he has expressed fear of persecution for being gay.

Trump expressed outrage that about one-fourth of Harvard’s student body is made up of international students, and said they should have a cap of around 15 percent. Applications to four-year colleges have increased, driven mainly by Latino and Black applicants, while universities could face significant financial costs if they face new restrictions on enrolling international students.</p>

The suit also seeks to overturn the Trump administration’s 15% cap on indirect costs related to research, which universities say are critical to carrying out their work.
