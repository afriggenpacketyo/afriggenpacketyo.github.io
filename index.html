          <p>Former President Donald Trump has embarked on a five-day tour of Asia, with scheduled stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea for high-stakes diplomatic and trade discussions. A central focus of the trip is a planned meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping to address the ongoing trade war, with Trump expressing hope for a deal to avert further tariffs. While en route, Trump also stated he is open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, fueling speculation about a potential fourth summit between the two leaders.</p>

          <p>San Diego-based defense technology firm Shield AI has introduced the X-BAT, an autonomous fighter jet designed for vertical takeoff and landing without needing runways or GPS. This innovation is intended to counter China's military strategy, which focuses on neutralizing U.S. air power by targeting airfields and aircraft carriers with long-range missiles. The AI-piloted aircraft can operate in denied environments and is designed to be a more mobile and cost-effective component of future air combat.</p>

          <p>This article examines the significant U.S. military buildup targeting Venezuela, including airstrikes on alleged drug trafficking boats and the deployment of nuclear-capable B-52 bombers. It explores the policy's drivers, suggesting influence from figures like Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and analyzes whether the goal is to foment a coup or provoke a conflict with the Maduro regime. The aggressive posture marks a notable shift from Trump's previously stated anti-interventionist foreign policy principles.</p>

          <p>According to a Goldman Sachs strategist, major Chinese companies are increasingly diversifying their export destinations away from the United States, focusing on markets like Southeast Asia. This strategic pivot coincides with China moving up the value chain to produce more sophisticated, higher-margin goods. Since 2018, Chinese exports to non-US markets have grown at a compound annual rate of 7.5%, while exports to the US have seen a slight decline over the same period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Prince Andrew should be formally stripped of his royal titles by the British Parliament, citing the 1917 Titles Deprivation Act as a precedent. The author contends that Andrew has consistently abused his status for personal gain and brought the monarchy into disrepute, particularly through his association with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Leaked emails revealing his continued contact with Epstein after publicly severing ties are highlighted as evidence of his poor judgment.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has strongly condemned the United States for deploying the USS Gerald R Ford aircraft carrier to the Caribbean, accusing Washington of manufacturing a pretext for war. The deployment, a significant escalation of U.S. military presence, follows a series of American airstrikes against alleged narco-trafficking vessels in the region. This move has intensified fears within Venezuela that the buildup is a prelude to a U.S. intervention aimed at regime change.</p>

          <p>An angel investor who provided early funding to AI voice startup ElevenLabs recalls making the decision to invest after just one 30-minute meeting with co-founder Mati Staniszewski in 2022. At the time, voice AI was an overlooked market, but the investor was convinced by Staniszewski's deep technical expertise and clear vision for the technology. ElevenLabs, which specializes in advanced text-to-speech and voice cloning, has since grown into a multi-billion dollar company, validating the high-risk, high-reward investment.

          <p>Following their decisive 11-4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 1 of the World Series, questions have arisen about whether the Dodgers' week-long break after sweeping the NLCS disrupted their competitive rhythm. Historically, teams that sweep their league championship series have often struggled in the World Series. While manager Dave Roberts dismissed the layoff as a factor, some players admitted to feeling the game's velocity more intensely after the extended period of rest.</p>

          <p>Argentina's far-right President Javier Milei is confronting significant political headwinds as his "shock therapy" economic policies inflict pain on the population ahead of key parliamentary elections. While his radical spending cuts have successfully curbed hyperinflation and achieved a national budget surplus, they have also triggered a deep recession, a sharp decline in real wages, and rising poverty. This growing public discontent has caused a steep drop in his approval ratings and given momentum to the opposition.</p>

The ad, which features former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs, had prompted Trump to halt trade talks with Canada.
