          <p>Former President Donald Trump has threatened to permit a "major lawsuit" against Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, citing mismanagement of renovations at the Fed's headquarters. This move escalates his ongoing public pressure campaign on the central bank to lower interest rates, which he claims would save the country vast sums of money. The Fed has so far maintained steady rates in 2025, defying Trump's demands, and has previously defended the renovation project's costs and scope. The White House declined to provide further details on the potential lawsuit.</p>

          <p>AI search startup Perplexity has made an unsolicited $34.5 billion bid to acquire Google's Chrome browser, a move that follows a U.S. Department of Justice proposal for Google to divest the browser. This proposal came after a court ruled that Google holds an illegal monopoly in the internet search market. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine and new browser, Comet, stated that several investors have agreed to back the ambitious deal.

          <p>Chinese authorities have reportedly instructed companies to avoid using H20 AI chips from Nvidia and similar products from AMD for government and national security purposes. This directive comes after both U.S. companies received approval to resume shipping these less-advanced chips, which were specifically designed to comply with U.S. export restrictions. The situation highlights the escalating tech tensions, as the U.S. government also recently secured an agreement for the chipmakers to give 15% of their China revenues to the U.S. government.</p>

Betro attempted to shoot a man at point-blank range, but her gun jammed, allowing the target to escape unharmed. She later returned to fire shots into the family's home before fleeing the country. The plot was part of a feud between her co-conspirators and the victim's family, though Betro's specific motive for her involvement remains unclear.</p>

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration noted that both conditions increase the risk of a crash.

          <p>Swiss sportswear company On Holding reported a 32% increase in sales for its second quarter, prompting it to raise its full-year revenue and gross margin guidance. The popular sneaker brand, which has been taking market share from competitors, successfully raised prices to offset new tariffs on goods from Vietnam without seeing a slowdown in consumer demand. The company's strong performance in the Americas, Europe, and especially China, where sales grew 50%, has bolstered investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For retirees who are required to take minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts but do not need the funds for expenses, financial experts suggest several smart strategies. These options include reinvesting the money into a tax-efficient brokerage account, often using ETFs to minimize annual tax drag. Another popular choice is making a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows a direct, tax-free transfer to a nonprofit that also satisfies the RMD requirement, benefiting both the charity and the donor.

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for July showed that inflation rose 2.7% on an annual basis, slightly cooler than anticipated. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased by 3.1% over the past year, its highest level in five months. The data indicates persistent price pressures, particularly for food, while gasoline prices fell. This mixed report provides crucial information for the Federal Reserve as it considers a potential interest rate cut at its upcoming September meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A British Army service inquiry has found that some soldiers stationed at the Batuk training base in Kenya are continuing to engage in "transactional sex," despite a 2022 ban on the practice.

The investigation was commissioned amid broader concerns over soldier misconduct at the base, including the 2012 death of a local woman, Agnes Wanjiru, who was allegedly killed by a British soldier.</p>

          <p>As U.S. President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin prepare to meet in Alaska, experts suggest the summit is unlikely to produce major breakthroughs but will primarily benefit Putin. The meeting itself provides legitimacy to the Russian leader on the world stage, which he has been keen to secure. Analysts believe factors like Russia's weakened economy and the threat of further U.S. sanctions may compel Putin to signal an openness to talks, but any concessions are likely to be tactical rather than strategic.</p>

          <p>President Trump's move to federalize the D.C. police force marks a significant escalation, but the nation's capital has a long history of limited self-governance. This article provides historical context, from the post-Civil War era when Congress established presidentially appointed commissioners to the 1973 Home Rule Act. It also covers the 1990s, when a federal control board oversaw the city's finances during bankruptcy. While federal oversight has precedent, historians note that a direct presidential takeover of the local police force is unprecedented.</p>
