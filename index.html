          <p>Ukraine has reported the loss of an F-16 fighter jet and its pilot, Lt. Col. Maksym Ustimenko, during a massive overnight Russian drone and missile attack. The Ukrainian air force stated that Russia launched over 500 aerial weapons, and Ustimenko was credited with shooting down seven targets before his aircraft was damaged. He guided the damaged plane away from residential areas but was unable to eject in time. This event marks a significant loss for Ukraine's air defense, which has been bolstered by the recent deployment of F-16s to counter Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News poll reveals that 50% of Japanese voters hope Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition will lose its majority in the upcoming House of Councillors election. In contrast, only 38.1% of respondents wish for the Liberal Democratic Party and its Komeito partner to maintain their majority. The nationwide telephone survey, conducted over the weekend, highlights significant public sentiment against the current government ahead of the critical July 20 election. This result suggests a challenging political landscape for the ruling bloc as it seeks to retain control.</p>

          <p>A recent incident where a flight attendant asked a passenger to spit out a Zyn nicotine pouch has highlighted the inconsistent and often unclear airline policies regarding smokeless tobacco products. While the TSA permits these items in both carry-on and checked bags, individual airlines have varying rules on their in-flight use. Many major airlines like American, United, and JetBlue do not have specific public policies, leading to confusion and debate among travelers. Delta's policy, however, explicitly prohibits all smokeless tobacco products, including pouches and gum, treating them similarly to smoking and vaping.</p>

          <p>Recent international summits have exposed Europe's perceived weakness as a geopolitical player, particularly in the wake of Donald Trump's return to the U.S. presidency. Despite widespread discussions about achieving strategic independence, Europe's ability to project power and maintain unity has been challenged. This dynamic sets a precarious stage for upcoming engagements with China, where Europe's relevance on the global stage will be further tested. The situation underscores the continent's ongoing struggle to translate economic strength into coherent and influential foreign policy without relying heavily on its traditional allies.</p>

          <p>The head of the UN's nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, has stated that Iran could resume enriching uranium for a potential bomb within months, despite recent US and Israeli strikes on its nuclear facilities. This assessment contradicts claims by President Donald Trump that Iran's program was "totally obliterated," suggesting the damage was severe but not decisive. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) remains concerned about the location of previously enriched uranium. This development complicates diplomatic efforts, as Iran's parliament has voted to suspend cooperation with the IAEA, further heightening international tensions.</p>

          <p>After six years of legal proceedings, Samuel Woodward was found guilty of the first-degree murder of his former high school classmate, Blaze Bernstein, with the jury affirming it was a hate crime. The prosecution successfully argued that Woodward, a member of a neo-Nazi group, targeted Bernstein because he was gay and Jewish. The defense conceded Woodward killed Bernstein but claimed it was an impulsive act of voluntary manslaughter, an argument the jury rejected. The verdict brings a long-awaited sense of justice for Bernstein's family, who endured a painful trial that revisited their tragic loss.</p>

          <p>After a turbulent first half of the year dominated by political tensions and trade disputes, global markets are bracing for continued volatility. This week, focus shifts to monetary policy as central bankers convene for the ECB Forum in Portugal, with President Trump's ongoing pressure on the Federal Reserve casting a shadow. In the UK, the Labour government marks its first anniversary with plummeting approval ratings amid economic challenges. Analysts warn that this combination of elevated policy uncertainty and a worsening macroeconomic backdrop is likely to fuel higher equity volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Five NATO nations bordering Russia or Belarusâ€”Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Polandâ€”have announced their withdrawal from the 1997 Ottawa Convention, which bans anti-personnel land mines. This move reflects growing security concerns following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with these countries aiming to bolster their border defenses. The plan is to restart mine production and deployment capabilities to create a significant deterrent. The decision is controversial due to the long-term danger mines pose to civilians, but the nations argue it is a necessary response to an existential threat.</p>

          <p>Civil servants in China, particularly at local levels, are increasingly avoiding dining out due to stringent and often vaguely defined austerity measures.

An official in Sichuan province reported that his department head recently banned all dining out. This behavior reflects the pervasive pressure on government employees to demonstrate frugality and avoid any appearance of impropriety.</p>
