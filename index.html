        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price has surged past $90,000, reaching levels not seen since March, as investors seek refuge in cryptocurrency amid stock market volatility and a weakening dollar. The cryptocurrency's rise coincides with a sell-off in U.S. equities and increasing pressure from the Trump administration on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. U.S. ETFs tracking spot bitcoin have experienced significant inflows, indicating renewed investor confidence in the asset as a hedge against traditional market risks. Analysts suggest that bitcoin's decoupling from risk assets and resilience in the face of market turbulence could lead to further gains if it surpasses key resistance levels.

          <p>A recent CNBC survey indicates that nearly half of Americans hold a negative view of Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, contrasting with more positive sentiments towards General Motors. The survey highlights a growing concern that Musk's political activities and affiliations may be alienating potential Tesla buyers, with protests occurring at Tesla locations nationwide. While many Americans express positive views on electric vehicles in general, Tesla's brand is facing significant polarization, particularly among Democrats and younger individuals. The survey suggests Tesla's challenge lies in bridging the gap between public support for EVs and negative perceptions of the company itself.</p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant measles outbreak, with the number of cases already surpassing the total for any year since 2019, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Removing Powell could trigger a market sell-off, weaken the dollar, and increase long-term borrowing costs, undermining confidence in U.S. monetary policy. While a more compliant Fed chair might initially deliver desired interest rate cuts, it would come at the cost of the Fed's credibility and independence.

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced a sweeping reorganization of the U.S. State Department, aiming to streamline operations and align the department with the Trump administration's foreign policy objectives. The reorganization plan involves cutting over 700 positions and eliminating numerous offices, with a focus on reducing bureaucracy and prioritizing regional bureaus and foreign missions. Rubio has criticized departments involved in promoting democracy and human rights, arguing that they have become platforms for political activism. The changes have sparked debate, with some questioning the potential impact on the department's ability to promote liberal values and address global challenges.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its global growth forecast, citing the negative impact of the escalating trade war on the global economy, and predicts the U.S. economy will be hit harder than other large countries. The IMF now projects global growth to drop to 2.8% in 2025 and 3% in 2026, down from previous estimates, with the U.S. economy expected to grow at 1.8% in 2025, a significant decrease from earlier forecasts. The fund warns that the global economic system is being reset, ushering in a new era of uncertainty, with tariffs posing a major negative shock to growth. The Chinese economy is also expected to be affected, albeit to a lesser extent.</p>

          <p>Tesla is experiencing a significant drop in used car prices, a concerning trend for the EV maker, with prices falling over 10% in March compared to the previous year. The Model S sedan has seen the largest price decrease, losing over 17% of its value, while the Model Y and Model 3 also experienced notable declines. Analysts attribute the price drops to new Tesla price cuts, impacting the used car market, and a decline in sales amid negative sentiment towards CEO Elon Musk.

The number of freight vessels leaving China for Southern California ports has decreased by 29% week-over-week and 44% year-over-year.

Companies like Johnson & Johnson, Apple, and Chobani are committing significant investments to build and expand U.S. factories, although not all directly cite tariffs as the primary motivator. While tariffs can help nurture emerging industries, economists caution that the decision to locate factories depends on various factors, including labor costs, tax rates, and the regulatory environment. Broad-based tariffs may suppress job growth, according to Goldman Sachs economists.</p>
