          <p>Shares of identity management software firm CyberArk surged following a report that it is in acquisition talks with cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks. The potential deal, valued at over $20 billion, would be Palo Alto's largest ever and highlights a trend of consolidation within the increasingly critical cloud security industry. This move comes amid a series of major acquisitions in the sector, as companies bolster their defenses against new threats posed by artificial intelligence and ransomware.</p>

          <p>A recent CNBC survey indicates a tight race for the next Federal Reserve chair, should President Trump decide not to reappoint Jerome Powell. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh are tied as the leading candidates, with National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett close behind. While most respondents do not expect Trump to fire Powell before his term ends, the speculation underscores concerns about the Fed's independence and future monetary policy.

          <p>Despite recent interest rate cuts, opening a certificate of deposit (CD) account could still be a strategic move for savers. Current rates remain competitive, often in the 4% to 4.5% range, offering consistent returns on deposits. With no Federal Reserve meeting in August, savers have a stable window to lock in these rates before potential further cuts in September. This period may represent a final opportunity to secure higher yields before monetary policy potentially eases again. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bill titled the "Make Entertainment Great Again Act" has been introduced in Congress to rename the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., as the Donald J. Trump Center for the Performing Arts. The proposal, introduced by a Republican congressman, praises President Trump's cultural significance and his efforts as chairman of the center's board to end "woke programming." The move has drawn sharp criticism and is expected to face significant legislative hurdles and potential legal challenges.</p>

A CBS News analysis suggests this decline is steepest among less partisan and independent young voters who initially gave him the benefit of the doubt. Growing dissatisfaction appears linked to perceptions that his policies are making them financially worse off and focusing on the wrong priorities, such as tariffs over lowering prices.</p>
