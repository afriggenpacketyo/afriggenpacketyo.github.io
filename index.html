          <p>A "No Kings" protest in downtown Los Angeles escalated when police deployed tear gas and flash-bangs after protesters allegedly threw objects at the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building.

A city-wide curfew remained in effect, and Mayor Karen Bass requested additional officers to maintain order. The protest was part of a nationwide demonstration against President Trump.</p>
