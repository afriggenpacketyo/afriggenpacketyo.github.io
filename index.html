          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 09:05:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy offers a three-step method for building emotional endurance, which is the capacity to handle stress without being overcome by negative emotions. She suggests using visuals to understand that learning involves struggle, engaging in positive self-talk to reframe internal dialogues, and undertaking small, uncomfortable experiments to build tolerance for discomfort. These practices are designed to help individuals view challenges as growth opportunities rather than signs of failure. The article emphasizes that this process helps in developing resilience by making the difficult moments of life feel less grueling.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has publicly supported redrawing the state's congressional districts before the 2026 midterm elections, a move that could significantly benefit the Republican party. This initiative follows a favorable Florida supreme court ruling that upheld a previous redistricting plan diminishing the voting power of Black communities in the northern part of the state. Allies of the governor are now establishing a committee to explore similar changes in south Florida, potentially targeting districts held by prominent Democrats. Critics and state Democrats have condemned the plan as a partisan effort to gerrymander maps and suppress votes.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin has strengthened into a powerful Category 4 storm over the Caribbean, with maximum sustained winds recorded at 145 mph. While the hurricane is not forecast to make landfall on the continental United States, its powerful winds are affecting nearby islands, prompting warnings for potential flooding and landslides. Tropical storm watches have been issued for St. Martin, St. Barthelemy, and Sint Maarten. Forecasters predict the storm will eventually curve northeast into the Atlantic, passing between the U.S. and Bermuda, though U.S. agencies have preemptively deployed personnel to Puerto Rico as a precaution.</p>

          <p>Following a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, a coalition of European leaders issued a joint statement reaffirming their support for Ukraine. The leaders of Britain, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland, along with EU officials, insisted that Russia cannot have a veto over Ukraine's potential membership in NATO or the European Union. They also stated that any peace agreement must not impose limitations on Ukraine's armed forces or its alliances. The statement underscores Europe's effort to present a united front and manage the diplomatic fallout from the bilateral talks.</p>

While the Alaska summit with Putin did not produce a concrete deal, Trump stated it was an "extremely productive meeting" that set the stage for further negotiations.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has suspended all operations after failing to reach a contract agreement with its flight attendants, leading to a strike by more than 10,000 union members. The strike began early Saturday during the peak summer travel season, potentially stranding thousands of passengers globally. The Canadian Union of Public Employees and the airline remain far apart on key issues, including wages and compensation for unpaid work. The federal government had urged both sides to avoid a work stoppage, which is expected to impact approximately 130,000 travelers daily.</p>

          <p>A recent Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, the lowest level since tracking began in 1939. This trend is accompanied by a decrease in drinking frequency and growing concerns about alcohol's health impacts, with a majority now viewing even moderate consumption as unhealthy. The article highlights a significant drop in underage drinking among teenagers as particularly positive news. While acknowledging the social benefits of responsible drinking, the analysis concludes that the overall reduction in alcohol use is a net positive for public health, potentially leading to fewer alcohol-related deaths and illnesses.</p>

          <p>Farmers in the U.S. Midwest are grappling with a severe economic squeeze caused by the dual challenges of President Trump's trade tariffs and the escalating climate crisis. Extreme weather, from drought one year to excessive rain the next, has drastically reduced crop yields for staples like corn and soybeans. Simultaneously, retaliatory tariffs, particularly from China, have caused U.S. soybean exports to plummet to a 20-year low, depressing prices. This combination of lower yields and reduced international demand has created a perfect storm, placing immense financial and mental strain on agricultural communities across the region.</p>

          <h2>Baltimore's Violent Crime Rate Reaches Historic Lows Through Targeted Intervention Strategy</h2>

          <p>Baltimore has achieved a dramatic reduction in violent crime, with its murder rate falling to levels not seen in decades. This success is attributed to a comprehensive, data-driven strategy that focuses on identifying and intervening with the small number of individuals most at risk of becoming perpetrators or victims of gun violence. Led by Mayor Brandon Scott, the plan uses a "carrot and stick" approach, offering social services, job training, and housing while also ensuring stricter prosecution for violent repeat offenders. This community-wide effort, involving social workers, police, and prosecutors, marks a significant shift from past policing tactics in the city.</p>

          <p>Thousands are expected to participate in a national day of protest called "Fight the Trump Takeover" across 34 states, opposing Republican plans for mid-decade redistricting. The demonstrations are anchored in Austin, Texas, where Republican lawmakers are pushing a plan that could add five GOP seats to the state's congressional delegation. The protests come as California's Democratic governor announced a counter-plan to redraw his state's maps, but only if Texas or other red states proceed with their partisan gerrymandering. Organizers argue the fight is not just about state politics but the future of American democracy.</p>

          <h2>Financial Planners Advise Starting Retirement Savings Earlier Than Public Perception Suggests</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey found that Americans believe the ideal age to start saving for retirement is 27, with a goal of retiring by 58. However, certified financial planners recommend starting even earlier to fully leverage the power of compound interest. While achieving retirement in one's late 50s is possible when starting at 27, it requires aggressive saving. Experts emphasize that the earlier one begins, the more time their investments have to grow, significantly increasing the size of their nest egg over time. Many Americans express regret for not starting their retirement savings sooner. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A great horned owl is undergoing rehabilitation after being found stuck in a glue trap in Orange County, California. A well-intentioned rescuer cut the bird's wings to free it, but this action has severely complicated its recovery, as owls only replace their feathers through a slow, annual molting process. Wildlife experts at the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center are now working to remove the remaining glue and hope the owl can regrow enough feathers to fly within a year. The incident highlights the indiscriminate danger that glue traps pose to wildlife, prompting renewed calls for the public to avoid using them.</p>

          <p>Amid a rising rate of homelessness among adults aged 55 and older, healthcare organizations are increasingly stepping in to provide housing solutions. Groups like the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), funded by Medicare and Medicaid, traditionally aim to keep frail seniors in their homes but now face the challenge of clients having no home at all. This national issue is driven by rising housing costs and economic instability, forcing many older adults into homelessness for the first time. In response, some PACE organizations and even hospitals are partnering with housing providers or developing their own properties to ensure their patients' basic needs are met.</p>

The incident, which is being investigated as an antisemitic crime, has drawn widespread condemnation from French officials. Halimi's murder by a gang that targeted him because he was Jewish sent shockwaves through France and remains a painful symbol of modern antisemitism in the country.</p>
