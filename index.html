        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Justice Department has fired over 35 employees who were involved in investigations into former President Donald Trump, including cases related to classified documents and the January 6th Capitol riot. The terminations were directed by a "weaponization working group" established by Attorney General Pam Bondi to review law enforcement policies and prosecutions from the previous administration. A fired public affairs specialist warned that the separation between the White House and the Justice Department is gone, suggesting a continuing wave of retribution within the agency. The move is seen by critics as a politically motivated purge of officials deemed disloyal to the administration.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to levy a 30% tariff on all imported goods from the European Union and Mexico, with the new duties set to take effect on August 1. The president stated the move is necessary to create a more "reciprocal" global trade landscape and warned that any retaliatory tariffs from the EU or Mexico would be met with further increases. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed disapproval, stating the EU would take necessary steps to safeguard its interests, including potential countermeasures. This action follows a series of similar tariff announcements targeting other major U.S. trading partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A dramatic end to the third day of the Test match between England and India at Lord's was marked by accusations of time-wasting. England's Zak Crawley used delay tactics to ensure he only had to face one over before the close of play, drawing angry reactions from Indian players. However, England's bowling coach pointed out that India's captain, Shubman Gill, had also caused a lengthy stoppage for a massage on the previous day. The exchange highlights the rising tensions and strategic gamesmanship between the two competitive teams in the closely watched series.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old Palestinian-American man from Tampa, Florida, was allegedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers while visiting family in the West Bank. According to his relatives, Sayfollah Musallet was protecting his family's land when he was attacked, and an ambulance was blocked from reaching him for hours. The family is demanding an immediate investigation led by the U.S. State Department to hold the perpetrators accountable. The State Department confirmed the death of a U.S. citizen but deferred to Israeli authorities for the investigation, marking another instance of violence amid ongoing regional tensions.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has publicly defended its $2.5 billion headquarters renovation project against sharp criticism from the Trump administration's Office of Management and Budget. OMB Director Russell Vought accused Fed Chair Jerome Powell of mismanagement and called the renovation an "ostentatious overhaul." In response, the Fed updated its website with a FAQ page to counter the claims, clarifying that no new VIP dining rooms are being built and explaining cost increases were due to unforeseen conditions like asbestos. The dispute represents a significant escalation in the administration's campaign against the central bank's leadership and independence.</p>

The arrests occurred at demonstrations in London, Cardiff, and Manchester, where protesters gathered to oppose the ban. The government proscribed the group after activists broke into an RAF base and damaged aircraft, citing a history of escalating criminal damage. Critics, however, argue the government is misusing terror legislation and that the ban is an authoritarian abuse of power against a protest movement.</p>

          <p>Bank of America has initiated coverage of Super Micro Computer with an "Underperform" rating, setting a price target that suggests a potential 30% decline for the stock. The analyst cited intensifying competition from industry giants like Dell and HP Enterprise in the AI server market as a primary concern. This increased competition could pressure Super Micro's profit margins, which are projected to decrease in the coming years. The report also warned of potential shortages of critical components and the erosion of the company's early lead in liquid cooling technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union and Mexico have reacted strongly to President Trump's announcement of a 30% tariff on their exports to the U.S., set to begin August 1. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated the EU is prepared to take all necessary steps to protect its interests, including "proportionate countermeasures." French President Emmanuel Macron echoed this sentiment, calling for the preparation of credible responses. Mexico's government called the threatened tariff an "unfair deal," signaling a potential escalation of trade disputes between the U.S. and two of its largest trading partners.

          <p>Despite a renewed wave of tariff announcements from the Trump administration, the U.S. stock market has shown notable resilience, with major indices remaining near record highs. This article suggests that investors have become more accustomed to the president's negotiation tactics, preventing the panic selling seen during previous trade disputes. The market's stability is also attributed to strong underlying economic factors, such as the growth driven by artificial intelligence and the potential for increased M&A activity under a deregulatory environment. The focus remains on corporate earnings, which are expected to be strong. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's third heatwave of the year reached its peak on Saturday, with temperatures hitting 33°C in Ross on Wye. The heat has been widespread, with Scotland recording its warmest day of the year and Northern Ireland its hottest in nearly three years. The conditions have led to amber heat health alerts, wildfire warnings in Scotland, and travel disruptions due to heat-damaged railway lines. Several water companies have also implemented hosepipe bans for millions of people in England to manage demand during the dry, hot weather.</p>

          <p>The preliminary investigation into the Air India Flight 171 crash has uncovered a chilling detail: both of the aircraft's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position seconds after takeoff. This action starved the engines of fuel and led to a total loss of power. Cockpit audio recorded one pilot asking the other why he initiated the cut-off, to which the other replied that he did not, deepening the mystery. Investigators are now focused on determining who moved the switches and why, as this action is typically only performed after landing.</p>

In a social media post, Trump called O'Donnell a "Threat to Humanity" and stated he was giving "serious consideration" to the action. O'Donnell responded by calling the president a "criminal con man" and a "dangerous old soulless man with dementia." Legal experts note that birthright citizenship is a protected right under the 14th Amendment and cannot be legally revoked by a presidential order.</p>
