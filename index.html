          <p>President Donald Trump has once again publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, labeling him a "fool" after the central bank decided to keep interest rates steady. The Fed's decision came a day after they voted to hold rates due to economic uncertainties allegedly caused by tariffs. Trump expressed his frustration on Truth Social, claiming there is virtually no inflation and tariff money is pouring into the U.S. The Federal Reserve stated it would maintain the current interest rate range of 4.25% to 4.5% until the economic outlook becomes clearer, citing increased risks of higher unemployment and inflation.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a "comprehensive" trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first such deal since imposing tariffs on numerous trading partners. The agreement aims to strengthen the relationship between the two nations, with details expected to be revealed at 10 a.m. from the Oval Office. A senior British official confirmed the deal, stating it would benefit both countries, although specifics remain unclear.  The agreement is anticipated to address British tariffs on U.S. cars and farm goods, as well as taxes on U.S. technology companies, while trade experts suggest it may be a preliminary framework for future negotiations rather than a finalized agreement.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's army officials have stated that Pakistani forces shot down 25 Indian drones overnight and into Thursday, with one drone strike resulting in the death of a civilian and injuries to four soldiers.

President Donald Trump has offered to help mediate the conflict, while U.S. Senator Tim Kaine urged de-escalation and accountability for a recent terrorist attack in Kashmir.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. has struck a "comprehensive" trade deal with the United Kingdom, making it the first country to do so after the U.S. imposed "reciprocal" tariffs in April. The announcement was made via a post on Truth Social, where Trump stated the agreement would solidify the relationship between the two countries for many years.  While the U.K. government acknowledged ongoing talks, they refrained from commenting on specific details.  The deal comes after Vice President JD Vance indicated the U.K. had a "good chance" of securing a trade agreement with the U.S., though Trump had previously downplayed the necessity of such deals.</p>

          <p>The United States and Britain are expected to announce a trade deal that will reduce the impact of President Trump's tariffs and potentially provide a political boost for Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

The agreement aims to lower or eliminate U.S. import taxes on U.K. cars and steel, while the U.S. seeks greater access to the British market for agricultural products.  The deal is seen as a vindication of Starmer's approach to Trump and could ease pressure on U.K. businesses.</p>

          <p>This article explores the science behind mRNA vaccines, addressing their mechanism, safety, and potential applications beyond infectious diseases.  mRNA vaccines, like those for COVID-19 and RSV, use messenger RNA to instruct cells to produce viral proteins, triggering an immune response. The article clarifies that mRNA cannot alter DNA and that these vaccines have undergone extensive safety monitoring.  Researchers are also exploring mRNA technology for treating cancer, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disorders, and rare genetic conditions like cystic fibrosis, offering hope for new therapies where traditional methods have fallen short.</p>

          <p>The US and UK are expected to announce a deal to reduce tariffs, likely involving exemptions or lowering tariffs on specific goods rather than a comprehensive trade agreement. Cars are a key focus, with potential reductions to the 25% import tax on cars and car parts or a quota system. Steel and aluminum tariffs are also under discussion, with the UK seeking a reduction or removal of the 25% tariff, which impacts various products.  The agreement's impact on pharmaceuticals is uncertain, while the UK may consider lowering its digital services tax on US firms in exchange for lower tariffs on exports.</p>

The spacecraft, which was intended to land on Venus, never left Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction.

          <p>This article reflects on the 45th anniversary of the eradication of smallpox, highlighting the global effort that led to its demise and drawing lessons for current and future pandemics. The disease, which killed an estimated 300 to 500 million people in the 20th century alone, was eradicated through aggressive vaccination campaigns and international coordination, including collaboration between geopolitical foes.  The article emphasizes the importance of a well-funded public health system and international cooperation to address current and future health threats, while also noting that setbacks in global health efforts and rising vaccine hesitancy pose challenges to pandemic preparedness.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin of Russia and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met in Moscow to present their countries as guardians of stability and historical memory. The meeting took place ahead of celebrations marking the 80th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.  Both leaders are navigating President Trump's unpredictability, with Putin addressing the war in Ukraine and Xi dealing with a trade war. They aim to position their nations as alternative world powers advocating for a more equitable, multipolar world, as the United States has not reached a deal with either leader since Trump returned to the White House.</p>
