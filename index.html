          <h2>LAFC Seeks to Rebound in Rivalry Match Against LA Galaxy After Club World Cup Disappointment</h2>

          <p>Los Angeles FC aims to win back fan support by securing a victory against their rival, the LA Galaxy, this Saturday. The team is looking for redemption following a disappointing performance in the Club World Cup and a subsequent loss in the MLS. Despite recent wins, a victory in the "El Tráfico" derby is seen as crucial for morale, especially as it may be the last derby coached by Steve Cherundolo in the regular season. The Galaxy, struggling at the bottom of the conference, and LAFC, dealing with key injuries, both view this rivalry match as one where current standings are irrelevant.</p>

          <p>A 65-year-old grandmother, Deborah Mason, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for orchestrating a family-operated drug trafficking ring valued at up to £80 million. Known as "Gangsta Debbs," she recruited her children and other relatives to distribute cocaine across southeast England, funding a lavish lifestyle that included designer goods for her cat. The Metropolitan Police tracked the gang for seven months, observing numerous drug and cash transactions. The judge highlighted her leading role and condemned her for corrupting her own family, who also received lengthy prison sentences for their involvement.</p>

          <p>Syria's presidency has announced the deployment of a new force to stop deadly sectarian violence between Bedouin and Druze communities in the southern Suweida province, where over 700 people have reportedly been killed. The announcement follows accusations that government troops, previously sent to the area, committed extrajudicial killings against Druze civilians. Amid the escalating conflict, the US ambassador to Turkey reported that Israel and Syria have agreed to a ceasefire, though this has not been publicly confirmed by either nation. The UN has called for an end to the bloodshed and accountability for widespread human rights violations reported in the region.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese medical researchers has developed a more affordable and simpler method for CAR-T cell therapy, a highly personalized treatment for blood cancers and other serious illnesses. The new technique uses gene therapy tools to produce anti-cancer cells directly within the patient's body, potentially reducing treatment costs significantly. The breakthrough, detailed in The Lancet, has already been used to treat four patients with multiple myeloma. This innovation could make advanced immunotherapy more accessible and represents a significant advancement in the field, which has also shown promise for treating autoimmune diseases.</p>

          <p>The UK is bracing for dangerous flash floods as an amber weather warning has been issued for parts of the country, including London, over the weekend. Forecasters predict that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours, leading to fast-flowing, deep floodwaters, transport disruptions, and power outages. The risk of flooding is exacerbated by the preceding heatwave, which has left the ground dry and unable to absorb heavy rainfall effectively. While a yellow warning is in place for wider areas, the amber alert signifies an increased potential for severe weather that could endanger life and property.</p>

The national fertility rate has dropped to a record low of 1.18 babies per woman, far below the level needed to sustain the population. Despite government incentives like cash bonuses and tax breaks, many Italians find the support insufficient due to the high cost of living and a lack of affordable, accessible childcare. This crisis is forcing local officials to devise creative solutions to keep schools open and businesses from shuttering, while companies explore private childcare initiatives.</p>

This development was part of a deal that also secured the release of American prisoners from Venezuela. The declaration was filed in the case of a young migrant who was transferred to the controversial prison in violation of a prior court settlement.</p>

          <h2>Majority of Americans Support Return to the Moon and Future Mars Missions, Poll Finds</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that about two-thirds of Americans favor the U.S. returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support for space exploration is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original Apollo moon landing. The 1969 lunar mission is still widely viewed as a worthwhile achievement, and most people believe the space program contributes to national pride and technological advancements. These positive views on space exploration are broadly consistent across different political and ideological lines, indicating widespread public backing for future NASA missions.</p>

          <p>Chinese companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba are disrupting the global AI landscape by releasing powerful, open-source large language models. This strategy contrasts with the closed, proprietary systems of U.S. giants like OpenAI and Google, which often restrict access to their technology in China. The availability of free-to-use Chinese models has spurred a wave of AI innovation in China and gained support from developers worldwide, creating a viable alternative for global collaboration. Analysts suggest that this open-source movement poses a more significant challenge to the dominance of Western tech firms than previous efforts in other software domains.</p>

          <p>The CEO of U.S. tech company Astronomer, Andy Byron, has been placed on leave after a video of him embracing a woman at a Coldplay concert went viral. The clip, which showed the pair quickly hiding their faces when they appeared on the stadium's large screen, fueled online rumors of an affair, particularly after the band's singer commented on it. Reports identified the woman as another executive, though the firm's statement said no other employees were in the video. The company has launched a formal investigation, stating that its leaders are expected to uphold high standards of conduct and accountability.</p>

          <p>A California state audit has revealed that the state's workplace safety agency, Cal/OSHA, is suffering from "critical weakness" due to severe understaffing, hindering its ability to protect workers. The audit found a 32% vacancy rate last fiscal year, leading to complaint closures without proper inspections and inadequate documentation when investigations did occur. This report echoes long-standing criticism that the agency fails to enforce safety standards effectively, a growing concern with climate-related hazards like extreme heat. While Cal/OSHA states it has recently reduced its vacancy rate, experts argue significant investment is needed to fix the chronic issues.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a $10 billion defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, News Corp, and The Wall Street Journal, along with two of its reporters. The suit alleges the newspaper knowingly published a false and malicious article claiming Trump sent a "bawdy" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which purportedly included a crude drawing. Trump vehemently denies authoring the letter and accuses the defendants of attempting to inextricably link him to the disgraced financier. A spokesperson for the Journal's publisher stated they have full confidence in their reporting and will vigorously defend against the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died from injuries sustained after being violently pulled into an MRI machine at a facility in Westbury, New York. According to Nassau County police, the man was wearing a large metallic chain and entered the MRI room while a scan was in progress for his relative. The machine's powerful magnet reportedly grabbed the chain, drawing the man into the device and causing fatal injuries. Medical experts emphasize that such incidents are rare but highlight the catastrophic danger of bringing metal objects near an active MRI, underscoring the importance of strict safety protocols.</p>
