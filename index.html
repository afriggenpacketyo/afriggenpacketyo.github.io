          <p>Afzal Khan, a Labour MP, has stepped down from his role as the UK's trade envoy to Turkey after facing criticism for a personal visit to the self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. The UK does not officially recognize this territory, and the visit, which included a meeting with Turkish-Cypriot leader Ersin Tatar, was condemned by the Cypriot government. Khan stated his resignation was to avoid distracting from government work, insisting the trip was in a personal capacity.</p>

          <p>Two new clinical trials in India are challenging the common belief that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes due to their sweetness. The research found that consuming mangoes in moderation, as a replacement for carbohydrates like bread, may actually improve blood sugar control and other metabolic health markers. One study showed mangoes produced a lower glycemic response than white bread, while another linked mango consumption to improvements in fasting glucose and insulin resistance.</p>

However, forecasters are urging Caribbean islands, particularly the northern Leewards, to monitor its progress due to the potential for heavy rain and life-threatening surf conditions as it passes nearby.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach, California, celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series win features an altered version of an iconic image of the late Kobe Bryant. Instead of his Lakers jersey, the mural shows him in a No. 24 Dodgers jersey, a creative choice by the artist and restaurant owner who commissioned the piece. While intended as a tribute to a Los Angeles icon within a Dodgers-themed artwork, the alteration has generated mixed reactions and online discussion among sports fans.</p>

          <p>The personal data of up to 3,700 Afghans resettled in the UK has been potentially compromised in a data breach involving a Ministry of Defence sub-contractor. An airport ground-handling service provider, Inflite The Jet Centre, suffered a cyber-security incident, exposing names, passport details, and relocation reference numbers. This is the second major data breach affecting Afghan refugees revealed recently, raising serious concerns about the security of sensitive information for individuals who fled the Taliban.</p>
