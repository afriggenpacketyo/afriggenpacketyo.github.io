          <p>Former UK cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt has publicly spoken about the humiliation of being targeted by violent and explicit AI-generated deepfake pornography while she was a serving MP. In an interview, she highlighted the real-world consequences of such digital fabrications, noting that several other female politicians have also been victimized. Mordaunt expressed greater concern for the impact of such content on children and advocated for stronger age verification on websites with adult material. She also voiced support for Australia's decision to ban social media for those under 16, urging tech leaders to take more responsibility.</p>

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the iconic frontman of the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath, has passed away at the age of 76. Known as the "Prince of Darkness," Osbourne's career spanned over five decades, from his rise with Black Sabbath in the 1970s to a successful solo career and later reality TV fame. Despite a life marked by extreme substance abuse, which led to his initial dismissal from the band, he achieved lasting success with solo hits like "Crazy Train." In recent years, he faced significant health challenges, including a Parkinson's diagnosis, but continued to release music until shortly before his death.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a major trade agreement with Japan, establishing a 15% tariff on Japanese imports, a reduction from a previously threatened 25%. As part of the deal, President Trump stated that Japan will invest $550 billion in the U.S. and open its markets to American products, including cars and agricultural goods. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba confirmed the agreement, noting the auto tariff reduction specifically. This development is part of a broader push by the administration to finalize numerous trade deals, with similar agreements recently announced for Indonesia and the Philippines.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice is set to deliver a historic advisory opinion on the legal obligations of countries regarding climate change. This decision, prompted by a UN General Assembly request lobbied by vulnerable island nations like Vanuatu, will clarify what nations must do under international law to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions. While the opinion is non-binding, it is expected to establish a significant legal benchmark and could serve as a foundation for future domestic and international climate-related lawsuits. The ruling addresses both future climate action and the historical responsibilities of nations for their environmental impact.</p>

          <p>Following the death of heavy metal pioneer Ozzy Osbourne at age 76, tributes have poured in from former bandmates, fellow musicians, and fans worldwide. Black Sabbath's co-founder Tony Iommi stated the band has "lost our brother," while artists like Sir Elton John and members of Metallica remembered him as a trailblazing icon and friend. Osbourne, known for his energetic and controversial stage presence, died just weeks after a farewell performance in his hometown of Birmingham.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has noted that inflation has been lower than anticipated, projecting an average of 0.5%–1.5% for the year. This economic climate, combined with concerns over a subdued global growth outlook, may prompt the MAS to adjust its policy to support the nation's export-dependent economy.

          <p>Germany's top administrative court has finalized the classification of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as a suspected right-wing extremist group. This ruling upholds a previous decision, allowing the domestic intelligence agency, BfV, to continue monitoring the party, which could include the use of undercover informants. The court found sufficient evidence of anti-democratic tendencies within the AfD, particularly concerning the degradation of German citizens with migration backgrounds. While a separate, more severe classification of the party as a "confirmed" extremist group is currently suspended pending another legal challenge, this decision marks a significant step in the state's oversight of the opposition party.</p>

While bilateral aid to some countries will decrease, the government stated that funding for multilateral bodies like the World Bank and the Gavi vaccine alliance will be protected.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered another defeat, falling 10-7 to the Minnesota Twins, largely due to a catastrophic collapse of their bullpen. In the sixth and seventh innings, Dodgers relievers issued a barrage of walks that allowed the Twins to score six runs on only two hits, turning a tied game into a significant deficit. The sloppy performance was highlighted by a bizarre play where a pitcher's errant throw to first base allowed three runs to score. This loss adds to a difficult July for the slumping Dodgers, whose relief pitching has been severely impacted by injuries to key players.</p>

The rise in tourism, particularly from overseas visitors, has also led to a surge in short-term holiday lets, further straining the residential community. While the tourism industry supports over 40,000 jobs, some residents feel the city council has not done enough to balance economic benefits with quality of life.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has issued severe disciplinary actions, including suspensions and expulsions, to dozens of students involved in pro-Palestinian campus protests earlier this year. The protests included the seizure of a campus library and the establishment of an encampment, which drew national attention. The university stated that each case was assessed individually following an investigation into violations of university rules. This move comes as Columbia attempts to restore federal funding that was cut by the Trump administration over allegations the university failed to address antisemitism, with the school agreeing to policy reforms including an overhaul of its disciplinary process.</p>

          <p>Shares of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, experienced a significant surge following an announcement of reduced U.S. tariffs on imported vehicles. The new tariff rate will be 15%, a substantial decrease from the 25% previously in effect, providing relief to Japan's auto industry, a cornerstone of its economy. This market rally came after U.S. President Trump confirmed a new trade framework with Japan, which he claimed would also open Japanese markets to more American goods. The development is seen as providing manageable short-term conditions for the automakers. (not investment advice)</p>

They are urging parents to discuss online safety with their children and utilize parental controls. The warning comes as data shows a concerning rise in the number of individuals under 17 being investigated for terrorism-related offenses.</p>

          <p>Emmy-winning actor Jeff Daniels has once again criticized President Donald Trump and his supporters, issuing a pointed message regarding the economic impact of the administration's policies. In a podcast interview, Daniels expressed hope that voters who supported Trump are "losing tons of money" from policies like tariffs, suggesting that rising costs for groceries and cars would ultimately be the deciding factor for many. A White House spokesman responded by calling Daniels an "out-of-touch left-wing Hollywood clown" and touted economic successes under the current administration. Daniels also lamented the 2024 election loss of Kamala Harris, whom he believed would have been a good choice for president.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered evidence of a 13-million-year-old confrontation between two apex predators after analyzing teeth marks on the fossilized leg bone of a 'terror bird'. These formidable, human-sized flightless birds were top predators, but the bite marks on a fossil found in Colombia match those of an extinct, five-meter-long caiman-like reptile called Purussaurus neivensis. Researchers used 3D digital scans to reconstruct what they believe was a fatal battle. The lack of healing on the bone suggests the terror bird either died in the attack or was scavenged, providing a rare glimpse into the interactions within an ancient ecosystem.</p>

          <p>In a rare move, federal judges in New Jersey voted to sideline interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, who previously served as a personal lawyer for President Trump. The judges appointed her top assistant, career prosecutor Desiree Leigh Grace, to lead the office. However, hours later, the Department of Justice, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, ousted Grace, accusing the judges of a partisan move to undermine the president's authority. The dramatic sequence of events has been condemned by New Jersey's Democratic senators as an attempt to undermine judicial independence and intimidate public servants.</p>

          <p>With Bryan Kohberger pleading guilty to the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, the case concludes without a trial, leaving the community and victims' families with lingering questions, most notably about his motive. Kohberger, a former criminology student, offered no explanation for the gruesome stabbings. The plea deal spares him the death penalty but has elicited mixed feelings from relatives, with some seeking closure and others feeling they made a "deal with the devil." This article recounts the crime that terrified the small college town, the social media frenzy it spawned, and the key evidence that ultimately led to Kohberger's arrest.</p>

          <p>Economic experts are urging Chinese companies to more deeply integrate their operations within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) to navigate US crackdowns on transshipments. The advice comes after the U.S. announced steep tariffs on goods suspected of being diverted through countries like Vietnam to circumvent duties on Chinese products. An economist from the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office suggested that by becoming more ingrained in local economies, Chinese firms can create more resilient supply chains. This strategy would also help them avoid unpredictable tariff policies, as imports directly from China currently face a higher average tariff rate than those from other Asian nations.</p>

          <p>A group representing the Detroit Three automakers—General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis—has raised concerns about the new U.S.-Japan trade agreement. The American Automotive Policy Council argued that the deal, which lowers tariffs on Japanese auto imports to 15%, is unfair because vehicles built in North America with high U.S. content still face a 25% tariff. This criticism comes as both GM and Stellantis have reported significant financial hits from existing tariffs, with GM taking a $1.1 billion blow in the second quarter. The automakers contend that the agreement disadvantages U.S. industry and workers by favoring Japanese imports. (not investment advice)</p>
