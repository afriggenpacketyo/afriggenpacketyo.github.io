          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before the Senate Finance Committee, addressing concerns about vaccine safety and the role of HHS in public health. Kennedy opened with condolences for the family of a police officer killed in a shooting at the CDC. He discussed HHS's shift towards preventative healthcare, addressing issues like food dyes and drug prices. Kennedy faced heckling from protesters and criticism from Senator Ron Wyden, who accused him of lying about vaccines and undermining public trust in healthcare. Wyden's request to have Kennedy sworn in was denied, leading to a debate about the integrity of testimony given to the committee. The article reflects a contentious hearing with deep divisions over vaccine safety and public health policy.</p>

          <p>Orsted, a Danish renewable energy company, is suing the Trump administration to prevent the blocking of their offshore wind farm project off the coast of New England. The Interior Department ordered a halt to construction on Revolution Wind, a project that is 80% complete and would power over 350,000 homes. Orsted claims the stop-work order is unlawful and issued in bad faith, citing President Trump's opposition to wind power. The company asserts that the project has undergone extensive environmental reviews and is environmentally sound and safe.</p>

          <p>Neil Hopper, an NHS vascular surgeon, admitted to insurance fraud and possessing extreme pornography after having his own legs amputated. Hopper defrauded insurers by falsely claiming his leg injuries were due to sepsis, when he had self-inflicted them using ice and dry ice. He made fraudulent insurance claims totaling over £466,000 and had a sexual interest in amputation. Despite the circumstances, the Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust stated that the charges did not relate to Hopper's professional conduct and posed no risk to patients.</p>

          <p>President Trump is urging the Supreme Court to expedite a ruling on his authority to impose worldwide tariffs. Despite losing in lower courts, Trump believes the conservative justices will support strong presidential power in foreign policy. The appeal argues that lower court setbacks undermine his ability to conduct diplomacy and protect the national security and economy. The case hinges on whether the Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the power to impose taxes and duties.</p>
