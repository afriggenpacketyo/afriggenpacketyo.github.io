          <p>The previously amicable public relationship between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin has reportedly soured due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. Trump has expressed frustration with Putin, citing Russia's failure to agree to a ceasefire and its continued missile attacks as impediments to a peace deal. In response to escalating tensions, Trump has threatened "severe tariffs" and disclosed the repositioning of U.S. nuclear submarines to pressure Moscow. A face-to-face meeting between the two leaders is expected soon to advance negotiations, though experts remain skeptical of a significant breakthrough.</p>

          <p>China's steel industry is grappling with a severe price war that is drastically cutting into profit margins, prompting calls for industry-wide changes to curb self-destructive competition. Steel firms are reportedly selling products below cost simply to maintain cash flow and clear excess inventory, a situation described as "drinking poison to quench thirst." While there is a push from Beijing to stabilize various economic sectors, industry insiders remain skeptical about the effectiveness of state-led campaigns. The high cost of innovation and shrinking demand create significant barriers for companies trying to escape the downward spiral. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's leading chip manufacturer, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. (SMIC), is downplaying the potential effects of a proposed 100% U.S. tariff on chip imports. Co-CEO Zhao Haijun stated that demand for their products still exceeds supply and that the company's limited exposure to the U.S. market would mitigate any significant impact on their factory utilization rates. Despite this optimistic outlook, SMIC reported a 19.5% year-over-year decline in net profit for the second quarter. The company has been helping clients build inventory ahead of a typical fourth-quarter industry slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

PragerU, which has already partnered with several states to make its materials available in public schools, produces content that has been criticized as misleading on topics like slavery and climate change. The partnership is seen by some as part of a broader administration effort to counter what it terms "woke ideology" in education.</p>

          <p>A bull moose that had caused the closure of a popular hiking trail in New York's Adirondack mountains was euthanized by state environmental officials. The animal, which had been lingering on the Goodman Mountain trail since May, was found to be severely emaciated and showing signs of advanced disease. Wildlife biologists and a veterinarian determined that euthanasia was the most humane option given its low chance of survival. A necropsy will be performed to understand the cause of its health decline, which may provide insights into threats facing New York's moose population.</p>

Critics argue this vision pales in comparison to the potential of superintelligence and seems primarily aimed at enhancing Meta's existing business model of driving engagement and ad revenue.

Because the U.S. provides generous benefits to seniors through programs like Social Security and Medicare, people living longer means they collect these benefits for more years. This can offset or even outweigh cost savings from public health initiatives, such as treating hepatitis C or reducing smoking.

          <h2>Opinion: The Atomic Bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki Were a Tragic but Moral Necessity</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Truman's decision to use atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki 80 years ago was a morally correct, albeit tragic, choice. The author contends that the bombings were necessary to prevent a full-scale land invasion of Japan, which was projected to cause millions of American and Japanese casualties. The article dismisses criticisms as "presentist moral narcissism," stating that the action shocked Japan's leadership into surrender and saved countless lives by ending World War II. It asserts that America must never apologize for a decision that secured a decisive end to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Recent immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, led by Border Patrol agents, are testing the legal limits of "probable cause" and facing accusations of racial profiling. Tactics such as "roving patrols" far from the border and detaining individuals who run have led to injuries, legal challenges, and community fear. A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against stopping people based solely on race or location, but recent raids suggest the operations are continuing. Civil rights groups argue these aggressive sweeps, often involving armed, masked agents, violate the 4th Amendment and create an environment of fear.</p>

          <p>A man has been charged in a bizarre home invasion where a Woodland Hills family was held captive in their own closet, which was then boarded up with plywood. The masked intruder, who hit the mother on the head and zip-tied the family, claimed he intended to drain their retirement accounts. After the family escaped, police found discarded latex gloves in the home. DNA testing on the gloves led to the arrest of Rodolfo Christopher Gil, the 35-year-old son of the victims' next-door neighbor, whom they had known for 15 years.</p>

          <p>At California's Mono Lake, guided tours educate visitors on the stark ecological consequences of water diversions to Los Angeles, which began in the 1940s. These diversions caused the ancient saline lake to lose half its volume, doubling its salinity and threatening the unique ecosystem that supports trillions of brine shrimp and migratory birds. Although a 1994 state decision mandated that L.A. reduce its water intake to allow the lake to recover, it remains far below the target level. With an upcoming state hearing, advocates are hopeful new efforts will restore this vital oasis.</p>

          <p>A cultural commentary reflects on the prevalence of teen idols named Bobby in American popular music during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Before the British Invasion, charts were frequently topped by singers like Bobby Darin, Bobby Vee, Bobby Vinton, and Bobby Rydell. The popularity of the name Robert for boys in the 1930s and 40s meant a generation of young men named Bobby came of age during this era. This confluence of naming trends and the rise of the teen idol created a unique musical moment where songs about "Bobby" were ubiquitous.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Aston Villa has completed the signing of striker Evann Guessand from French club Nice in a deal worth an initial £26 million. The 24-year-old Ivory Coast international scored 12 goals for Nice last season and was named their player of the season. His arrival provides a much-needed reinforcement to Villa's attacking options, as manager Unai Emery sought to bolster his squad following the departure of several players. This is Villa's second major signing of the summer transfer window, which has been constrained by financial regulations.</p>

          <p>A 38-year-old man, Jeffery Ying, has been federally charged with stealing rare Chinese manuscripts, some over 600 years old, from a UCLA library and returning convincing fakes in their place. The Department of Justice alleges Ying used aliases to access the works, valued at $216,000, before checking them out and frequently traveling to China shortly after. An investigation began after the library noticed several manuscripts were missing, and a raid on Ying's hotel room uncovered blank manuscripts and pre-made asset tags.
