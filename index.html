            <p>Technology stocks experienced a significant rally, with Apple and Nvidia leading the charge, after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for some countries. This decision followed a period of market volatility spurred by aggressive tariff plans from the White House. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite saw a substantial increase, marking its best day since 2008, and Apple regained its position as the most valuable company after a recent dip. This sudden shift in tariff policy provided a much-needed boost to investor confidence in the tech sector. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump declared a 90-day pause on most new tariffs, lowering the "reciprocal tariff" rate to 10%, excluding China, where tariffs were raised to 125%. This decision came after numerous countries sought negotiations with the U.S. regarding trade barriers. The U.S. stock market responded positively to the announcement, although the long-term implications of the tariff adjustments remain uncertain. White House officials clarified that the 10% tariff rate applies to imports from Canada and Mexico as well, pending negotiations with the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

The judge stated that blocking AP journalists based on their viewpoints violates the First Amendment.

The tariffs would tax imported coffee, electronics, and automotive goods, heavily impacting the automotive industry's global supply chains. Experts anticipate higher prices for all vehicles, potentially discouraging consumers from purchasing new, more efficient cars. Electric vehicles are particularly vulnerable, as lithium-ion batteries rely on rare-earth metals sourced overseas, and major EV battery producers are in China, South Korea, and Japan.</p>

However, on April 9 Mr. Trump backed away from parts of his plan, announcing a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs and lowering the tariff rate to 10% for almost all nations. The notable exception was China, with Mr. Trump saying that he's instead raising the tariff rate on the country's imports to 125%. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Rory McIlroy begins his 11th attempt to win the Masters, with psychology being more crucial than technical ability. McIlroy seeks to complete a career grand slam, facing the mental challenges of Augusta National. Scottie Scheffler remains the top contender, known for his exceptional iron play, crucial at Augusta. The Masters has a history of pre-tournament peculiarities, including Fred Ridley's announcement involving Tiger Woods and Cameron Smith wearing a suit jacket during practice.</p>

            <p>Former Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic labeled Andre Onana as "one of the worst goalkeepers in the club's history" after Onana's comments about United being better than Lyon. Onana responded on social media, denying disrespect and highlighting his trophy wins with the club. Matic made 128 appearances for United, while Onana signed for £47.2m from Inter Milan in 2023. The Europa League remains the final opportunity for United to salvage a disappointing season.</p>

            <p>The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to halt lower court decisions preventing President Trump from firing members of independent labor boards. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the orders reinstating Cathy Harris and Gwynne Wilcox harm the president and the separation of powers. The request seeks a stay of decisions that found the removals unlawful, potentially taking up the case before the U.S. Court of Appeals rules. The dispute centers on the president's authority to remove executive branch officers from independent agencies.</p>

            <p>Dmitrii Ovsiannikov, a former Russian government minister and governor in illegally annexed Crimea, was found guilty of breaching UK sanctions. He deliberately avoided sanctions by receiving over £75,000 from his wife and a Mercedes Benz SUV from his brother. The case is the first prosecution in the UK regarding a breach of sanctions under the Russia Sanctions Regulations. Ovsiannikov, who has a British passport, was appointed by President Putin as acting governor of Sevastopol in Crimea in 2017.</p>

            <p>A panel of judges on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has vacated a lower court ruling ordering 20 federal agencies to reinstate employees they had fired. The decision clears the way for the Trump administration to re-fire probationary employees. The court said the Trump administration was likely to succeed in showing that the lower court lacked jurisdiction in the case. The ruling comes a day after the Supreme Court vacated a different lower court ruling that ordered six federal agencies to bring fired employees back to work.</p>

            <p>The US Treasury Department has claimed that China and Mexico are the leading players in a sophisticated global financial system supporting the fentanyl trade. The report details a network of wire transfers, social media marketing, casinos, cash transactions, money laundering, e-commerce, call centers, and illegal online pharmacies financing the opioid trade. The report's release comes amid a second Trump administration that has cited fentanyl trafficking as justification for tariffs placed on China, Mexico, and Canada. Hong Kong-based companies were often reported in conjunction with mainland-based subjects.</p>

            <p>U.S. crude oil futures jumped more than 4% after President Trump announced a lower tariff rate for countries except China. The U.S. benchmark rose $2.77 to close at $62.35 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent was up $2.55 to $65.37 per barrel. The oil market turned around after Trump dramatically reversed course on his trade war, applying lower tariff rates of 10% to most countries for 90 days, while increasing rates on China to 125%. Traders had been worried about a full-blown trade war triggering a recession, hitting crude oil demand.</p>

            <p>President Trump's sweeping "Liberation Day" tariffs have disrupted the global economy, causing stock market turmoil. The tariffs involve a minimum 10% tax on nearly all U.S. imports, with higher levies on goods from China, Japan, and the EU. The motivation behind the tariffs remains unclear, with the Trump administration potentially seeking to radically remake global security, geopolitics, and economics. The tariffs create uncertainty and pain for consumers, who ultimately pay more for goods. The United States, by imposing tariffs on everybody, friends and foes alike, is undermining its strength.</p>

The company wants to maintain flexibility to invest in price as tariffs are implemented. Walmart maintained its first-quarter sales outlook of 3% to 4% growth. Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said operating income has been harder to predict, given the current backdrop.

            <p>House Republicans are preventing future votes on repealing President Donald Trump's tariffs. GOP leaders inserted language into the budget blueprint that would prohibit the House from forcing a vote on legislation to rescind Trump's national emergencies authority until at least September. Speaker Mike Johnson defended the move, stating that the president has executive authority and that it is having the desired effect. Democrats moved to force a vote on terminating the national emergency authority and blocking Trump's tariffs, but that vote is now unlikely.</p>
