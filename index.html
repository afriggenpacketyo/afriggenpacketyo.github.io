          <p>An analysis of Federal Aviation Administration data reveals that helicopters frequently violated altitude limits or flew dangerously close to airplanes at Reagan National Airport in the year before a fatal midair collision. The data, released as part of the NTSB's investigation, indicates hundreds of close encounters within 1,000 feet, suggesting such risky operations may have become normalized. The FAA has since implemented safety changes in D.C. and other airports, while the NTSB's full investigation into the crash that killed 67 people is ongoing.</p>

          <p>A research team from Tianjin University in China has created a pilot production line for a new lithium battery with an energy density of over 600 watt-hours per kilogram, more than double that of Tesla's advanced 4680 cells. This breakthrough could significantly extend the range of electric vehicles, potentially eliminating 'range anxiety' for consumers and accelerating EV adoption. The new battery has also demonstrated superior stability in safety tests, showing resilience against fire, low temperatures, and physical damage.</p>

The complaint seeks to vacate Bondi's order, which installed a new emergency police chief, warning that it creates operational chaos and endangers public safety.</p>

          <p>An extensive underwater survey of Lake Constance in Germany has led to the discovery of 31 shipwrecks, including what is believed to be a paddle steamer destroyed in a World War II air raid. Using remotely operated vehicles, scientists identified a range of vessels, from historic paddle steamers to a remarkably preserved cargo sailing ship with its mast intact. The project provides unique insights into historical shipbuilding and maritime technology, with researchers focusing on documenting the finds rather than costly salvage operations.</p>

          <p>A record number of 18-year-olds in the UK have been accepted into their first-choice university, partly due to institutions facing financial instability. With tuition fees for domestic students not keeping pace with inflation and a decline in international student enrollment, universities are more eager to accept UK undergraduates to ensure financial stability. This has created a competitive environment where some universities offer incentives through the Clearing system, potentially impacting the financial health of less selective institutions.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Bournemouth has initiated talks with Liverpool to sign 19-year-old Scottish winger Ben Doak. Liverpool is reportedly seeking a £25 million transfer fee for the player, who has struggled for first-team opportunities at Anfield, making only ten appearances since his move from Celtic in 2022. Doak, who spent last season on loan at Middlesbrough, is a key target for Bournemouth as they look to strengthen their squad before the transfer window closes, especially after a busy summer of player departures.</p>

          <p>Sana Javeri Kadri, founder of Diaspora Co., a company dedicated to creating a more equitable and sustainable spice trade, is now facing the challenge of new U.S. tariffs on Indian products. Her business model, which involves sourcing high-quality spices directly from regenerative farms in India and Sri Lanka and paying farmers a living wage, is threatened by the increased costs. The tariffs could force her to raise prices, highlighting the vulnerability of mission-driven companies that prioritize ethical sourcing and operate on smaller margins.</p>

          <h2>MIT Professor Reflects on the Value of Poetry for Students in a Technological Age</h2>

          <p>A literature professor at MIT observes that many elite engineering and science students are turning to poetry as a vital form of human expression and connection amid a technological revolution. While their studies often focus on developing advanced technologies like AI, these students are forming poetry collectives to explore the complexities of their inner lives and preserve the particularities of human experience. The article suggests that poetry, as an ancient technology of memory and emotion, offers a necessary counterbalance to the predictive and impersonal nature of large language models.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley," sheds light on the late singer-songwriter's often-overlooked Latino roots through the perspective of his mother, Mary Guibert. While much of Buckley's narrative has focused on his estranged, famous father, Tim Buckley, the film reveals his upbringing in a Latino household where he was sung to in Spanish and deeply influenced by his Panamanian-American heritage. The documentary provides an intimate look at his life, artistry, and the profound bond he shared with his mother before his tragic death in 1997.</p>

          <p>Intense monsoon rains have triggered deadly flash floods and landslides across northern Pakistan and India-administered Kashmir, resulting in the deaths of more than 170 people. In Pakistan, at least 116 people have died, and a rescue helicopter crashed, killing five crew members. In India, a remote Himalayan village crowded with pilgrims was devastated, with at least 60 fatalities and 200 people missing. Experts attribute the increasing frequency of these extreme weather events, known as cloudbursts, to climate change and unplanned development in mountainous regions.</p>

          <p>A rapidly spreading cholera outbreak in Sudan's Darfur region has killed 40 people in the last week alone, with over 2,300 patients treated by Doctors Without Borders (MSF). The medical charity attributes the surge to severe water shortages and a collapsed healthcare system, exacerbated by the country's ongoing civil war between the military and the paramilitary RSF. The conflict has created a devastating humanitarian crisis, displacing millions and leaving vulnerable populations, particularly women and children, susceptible to disease outbreaks amid poor sanitation.</p>

The group was proscribed in July after claiming responsibility for damaging property at an RAF base. While the Home Secretary defended the ban by citing the group's involvement in violent activities, critics argue that using terrorism laws against peaceful protesters sets a troubling precedent for legitimate democratic dissent.</p>

The government stated that offering direct funding would not provide value for taxpayers or solve the industry's long-term issues, a decision that could lead to job losses and affect the UK's domestic supply of clean fuels and commercial CO2.</p>

The program's trust funds are projected to be depleted by 2034 due to a growing gap between income from payroll taxes and payments to a record number of beneficiaries. Without congressional action, this could lead to an automatic 23% cut in benefits, prompting debates over potential solutions like raising the retirement age or lifting the cap on taxable earnings.

The article suggests the show became a squeamish and out-of-touch fantasy, losing the cynical yet anthropological curiosity that defined the original series.</p>
