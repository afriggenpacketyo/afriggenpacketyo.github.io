          <p>Six individuals in Burundi were killed by a militia after being accused of witchcraft, with some being burned alive or beaten to death. The incident, which occurred near the economic capital Bujumbura, was reportedly carried out by members of the ruling party's youth movement, known as the Imbonerakure. Local officials and rights groups have condemned the "unspeakable barbarity," and authorities have arrested 12 suspects in connection with the killings.

          <p>Google DeepMind has launched Gemini Robotics On-Device, a new artificial intelligence system that allows robots to perform complex tasks without needing a cloud connection. This model runs directly on the robot's hardware, enabling faster, more reliable operation in environments with poor or no internet, enhancing privacy by keeping data local. The AI can be trained with a small number of demonstrations and is being made available to developers through a trusted tester program. The development marks a significant step toward more autonomous and versatile robots for real-world applications.</p>

Brink, who served under both Biden and Trump, recounts her experience in Kyiv during the invasion and the challenges of operating within an administration she felt was not committed to Ukraine's sovereignty. The article details her view that the administration's policy seemed to pressure Ukraine into submission to Russia, undermining the global security system.

          <p>Amid recent air traffic control (ATC) system outages and with a record number of travelers expected for the Fourth of July, airlines are highlighting their pilot training for such events. Pilots are trained from early in their careers to handle communication loss, utilizing backup radio frequencies, an emergency channel, and a text-messaging system. Aircraft are also equipped with collision avoidance systems (TCAS) that provide automated instructions to maintain separation. While these outages can cause significant delays, officials maintain that multiple layers of redundancy ensure passenger safety remains the top priority.</p>

          <p>A jury acquitted Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs of the most serious charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, convicting him only on lesser counts of transportation for prostitution. Legal experts suggest federal prosecutors overreached by applying a complex racketeering (RICO) strategy, which is typically reserved for organized crime and difficult to prove. The defense successfully argued that while Combs engaged in a 'swinger' lifestyle and domestic violence, his actions did not constitute a criminal enterprise as defined by the stringent RICO law. The verdict is seen as a significant win for the defense and a major loss for the prosecution.</p>

          <p>The article presents a case for investing in physical gold, such as bars and coins, as a strategic move for portfolio diversification and protection against inflation. It argues that gold's tangible nature provides security in an unpredictable economy, and it has become increasingly accessible to purchase from various retailers and online dealers. With gold prices near record highs and predictions of further increases, fractional gold bars and coins are highlighted as a way for new investors to enter the market at a lower price point.

          <p>Following the split verdict in Sean "Diddy" Combs' federal trial, an attorney for his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura released a statement praising her courage. While the jury did not convict Combs of sex trafficking Ventura, lawyer Douglas H. Wigdor stated that her client "paved the way" for his conviction on two counts of transportation for prostitution. Wigdor emphasized that Ventura's testimony brought critical attention to the misconduct of powerful men and that she showed exemplary strength throughout the process. The statement concluded by vowing to continue fighting on behalf of survivors of abuse.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology suggests that hormone therapy combining estrogen and progesterone for menopause symptoms may increase breast cancer risk in women under 55 who have a uterus. Conversely, the research found that estrogen-only therapy, typically given to women without a uterus, appears to reduce the risk. This research refines understanding from a controversial early 2000s study, focusing on women who begin treatment closer to the onset of menopause. Medical experts advise that individuals should consult their doctors to weigh the specific risks and benefits based on their personal health history.</p>

          <p>The version of President Trump's domestic policy bill passed by the Senate includes approximately $1.1 trillion in healthcare spending cuts over ten years, primarily from Medicaid. According to the Congressional Budget Office, these changes could cause 11.8 million people to lose their health insurance by 2034. The cuts stem from provisions like a new national work requirement for many beneficiaries and a cap on state provider taxes, which help fund Medicaid programs. Critics warn these measures will threaten the financial stability of rural hospitals and disproportionately harm vulnerable populations, including older adults.</p>

          <p>President Trump's sweeping spending bill contains roughly $170 billion for immigration and border-related operations, a sum that would vastly expand federal enforcement capabilities. The legislation funds thousands of new enforcement officers, tens of thousands of new detention beds, and new border wall construction. It also imposes new fees on asylum applications, which critics argue will restrict access to humanitarian protections. Analysts warn the unprecedented funding will fuel the administration's mass deportation campaign, disrupt communities, and fundamentally transform the U.S. immigration system if passed by the House.</p>

This development, combined with budget cuts and staffing shortages at NOAA, is rapidly degrading the nation's state-of-the-art hurricane forecasting capabilities just as the storm season intensifies.

          <h2>Trump Administration Asks Supreme Court to Permit Firing of CPSC Members</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its legal battle over presidential power, asking the Supreme Court to allow the firing of three members of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). A lower federal court had previously blocked the terminations, ruling them unlawful because commissioners of the independent agency can only be removed for cause, not at will. The administration argues that this restriction unconstitutionally infringes on the president's executive authority. This case is the latest in a series of challenges by President Trump aimed at asserting greater control over independent federal agencies.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced it is laying off 9,000 employees, which constitutes just under 4% of its global workforce. This is the latest in a series of job cuts at the tech giant, which previously slashed over 6,000 jobs in May and June as part of an effort to streamline operations and reduce managerial layers. The company stated the organizational changes are necessary to position it for success in a dynamic market. The move comes even as Microsoft remains highly profitable, reporting nearly $26 billion in net income for its most recent quarter.</p>
