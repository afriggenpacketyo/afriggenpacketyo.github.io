          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially withdrawn from his reelection campaign, citing relentless media speculation about his future and a Campaign Finance Board decision that significantly hindered his ability to raise necessary funds. His departure transforms the mayoral contest into a three-way race, pitting Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani against independent candidate Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams' administration faced a tumultuous period, including a federal corruption scandal and criticism over his ties to the Trump administration, though he consistently maintained his innocence. Political figures, including Governor Kathy Hochul and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, acknowledged his accomplishments in areas like housing and crime reduction. However, his opponents quickly leveraged his exit to advance their own campaigns, emphasizing the city's ongoing challenges.</p>

          <p>The United States has strategically deployed its Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) air defense system in South Korea, marking the first known instance of this prototype being stationed at an overseas base. This advanced mobile, ground-based weapon system is designed to intercept and defeat cruise missiles, unmanned aircraft systems, rockets, artillery, and mortars. The deployment, confirmed by a group photo at a Patriot missile tactical site, is widely interpreted as a significant response to escalating regional tensions with both China and North Korea. This initiative underscores efforts to enhance South Korea's air and missile defense capabilities, bolstering security in a critical geopolitical hotspot.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 23:57:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The persistent decline of traditional American shopping malls is paradoxically creating advantageous real estate opportunities for small, local businesses. With rising national vacancy rates and increasing store closures among larger chains, landlords are demonstrating greater flexibility in lease negotiations. This includes offering more favorable monthly rents, flexible lease terms, partial fit-outs, and even rent-free periods, which were previously unattainable for startups. Service-based businesses, health practitioners, and independent retailers are particularly benefiting, gaining access to prime commercial spaces. This shift allows entrepreneurs to establish a physical presence without excessive capital outlay, fostering local economic regeneration and transforming vacant spaces into unique community destinations.</p>

          <p>A tragic incident of targeted violence occurred at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, resulting in at least four deaths and eight injuries. The suspect, 40-year-old Marine Corps veteran Thomas Jacob Sanford, drove his vehicle into the church, opened fire with an assault rifle, and intentionally started a fire, leading to the building's total loss. Sanford was killed in a shootout with law enforcement. The FBI is leading the investigation, which also involves responding to additional bomb threats in the community. Officials, including Governor Gretchen Whitmer and President Trump, condemned the attack, while the NYPD and LAPD increased patrols at religious institutions.</p>

          <p>A criminal investigation has been launched by the Village of Broadview following an incident where a CBS News Chicago reporter's vehicle was struck by a pepper ball fired by an ICE agent.

          <p>China's stock market has experienced a significant rally this year, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence, efforts towards chip self-sufficiency, and government initiatives to curb price wars, boosting investor confidence. However, with retail investors heavily influencing the market and pushing indices like the CSI 300 to multi-year highs, some experts are questioning whether the surge indicates a sustainable boom or the formation of a speculative bubble. While there are few signs of overheating across the entire market, certain sectors, particularly technology and contract research organizations, are considered highly risky. The rally appears disconnected from underlying economic fundamentals, which show signs of slowing, suggesting a potential vulnerability to future pullbacks before corporate earnings can catch up.

The New START treaty, which caps deployed strategic warheads, was suspended by Russia in 2023 but Moscow has continued to observe its limits.

          <p>This article offers guidance on identifying and managing "energy vampire" friendships, where individuals drain your emotional energy. Common signs include excessive complaining, self-absorption, and a lack of genuine interest in your life. Psychologists suggest these friends may also subtly undermine your mood with backhanded compliments or pressure to always be upbeat. To address this, the article recommends honest communication, explaining how their behavior impacts you, and observing their reaction. If change is not forthcoming, establishing clear boundaries, such as limiting interaction time or changing shared activities like opting for a walk instead of a long chat, can help protect your well-being.</p>

          <p>Over 100,000 federal workers are anticipated to formally resign on Tuesday, marking the largest mass resignation in U.S. history, as part of a Trump administration program aimed at significant cuts to the federal workforce. This exodus comes amidst a looming government shutdown deadline, with the White House instructing agencies to prepare for large-scale firings if Congress fails to authorize more funding. Departing workers describe months of "fear and intimidation" that left them feeling they had no alternative but to leave. Many federal employees, who typically stay for the mission, are departing due to perceived attacks on their roles, job insecurity, and erosion of work-life balance.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's aspirations to become a hub for green marine fuels heavily depend on establishing a robust methanol supply chain, according to CM Energy President Wang Yongxin. While the city has already achieved success with liquefied natural gas (LNG) and biodiesel fueling, green methanol requires a reliable upstream-to-downstream system, including tax-free import, storage, and sales of mainland-produced fuel. Wang highlighted this during the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, the world's first large vehicle carrier capable of running on both traditional fuel and methanol. Despite green methanol costing four times more, its usage is expected to increase significantly from 2027, driven by Europe's carbon emissions-based import tariffs.</p>

          <p>Staff at Schoen Clinic York, a specialist eating disorder unit in the UK, have reportedly been photographed sleeping while on duty, when they were supposed to be monitoring vulnerable patients at risk of self-harm.

Patients reported staff witnessing self-harm without intervening, unhygienic food, and the use of triggering language. Although the clinic stated it investigated specific concerns and found no "systemic issues," the unit recently closed due to low referrals, and its co-located dementia unit also faced a temporary halt on new admissions over safety concerns.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is seeking an expedited Supreme Court review of his executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship, following its universal blockage by two federal courts. The administration argues that ensuring American citizenship is granted only to those lawfully entitled is a compelling interest, vital for border security. This order unilaterally reinterprets the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause, aiming to exclude children born in the U.S. to parents without permanent legal status. Legal experts, citing the 1898 Supreme Court ruling in U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark, view the order as illegal and a potential "earthquake" if upheld, though some believe Trump may seek a political win regardless of the legal outcome.</p>

The suspect, Joshua Jahn, had meticulously planned the assault, acquiring the rifle legally and leaving notes at his residence indicating animosity towards ICE personnel. Jahn opened fire from a nearby rooftop, intending to inflict damage and harm. Tragically, one detainee, Norlan Guzman-Fuentes, died, and two others, Jose Andres Bordones-Molina and Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez, were critically injured within the vans Jahn targeted. Authorities emphasize that all evidence suggests Jahn acted alone, dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.</p>

Meanwhile, Labour is also considering a "good citizen test" for those granted leave to remain, alongside potential sanctions for long-term youth unemployed who refuse paid work placements. The Financial Times suggests Labour is frustrated by businesses' silence on Reform's economic policies, while reports also detail councils spending exorbitant amounts on special needs pupil transport, an issue the government plans to address.</p>

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a federal lawsuit to block President Trump's deployment of 200 National Guard troops to Portland, arguing his justification of a "war ravaged" city is "pure fiction." Governor Tina Kotek stated that there is no insurrection or public safety threat warranting military intervention, emphasizing that local law enforcement is managing protests near an ICE facility. The lawsuit challenges Trump's authority to federalize the Guard under claims of "rebellion," especially since his information appears based on a Fox News report mixing current small protests with older, larger ones. Oregon contends the deployment is an unlawful abuse of power that will make residents less safe.</p>

While the government highlights recent large inward investments, smaller businesses feel forgotten, citing increased costs and reluctance to invest. The new Employment Rights Bill, offering greater employee protections, is also adding to employers' hesitancy to hire. (not investment advice)</p>
