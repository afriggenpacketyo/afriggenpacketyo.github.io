          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this right is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change aims to give people adequate time to grieve without work-related pressure. The exact length of the leave is under consultation but is expected to be at least one week, a move welcomed by advocacy groups like the Miscarriage Association.</p>

          <p>The United States has lifted a ban on selling American jet engine parts and technology to China, a move expected to significantly boost production of the home-grown C919 aircraft. This allows the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) to continue importing critical components from a GE-invested joint venture. While this enables Comac to fulfill its current orders, analysts suggest that previous US restrictions have likely strengthened Beijing's determination to develop its own engine technology to ensure long-term self-sufficiency.

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 81 fatalities, with over 40 people, including children from a summer camp, still missing. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, devastating communities and Camp Mystic in Kerr County, which saw the highest number of deaths. A major disaster declaration has been signed by President Trump, and extensive search and rescue operations are ongoing around the clock. Officials noted the rainfall far exceeded forecasts, catching residents and authorities by surprise.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Guardian argues that the increasing financialization of housing across Europe is a primary driver of the continent's housing crisis, fueling inequality and political unrest. Since the 2008 financial crisis, institutional investors like private equity firms have massively increased their ownership of residential properties, treating housing as a lucrative asset class. This has inflated prices and rents, making homeownership unattainable for many and worsening living conditions, which in turn contributes to the rise of far-right politics. This article contends that this system prioritizes profit over social need, creating a political timebomb. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A research team from Fuzhou University in China has developed a novel vision sensor using semiconductor "quantum dots" that can adapt to extreme changes in light in a fraction of a second, faster than the human eye. The system is also designed to be more energy-efficient and provide quicker computation than current technologies. This innovative sensor mimics the human visual system's ability to adjust to varying light conditions and even memorize settings for faster future adaptation. The breakthrough could have significant applications in robotics, autonomous driving, and advanced imaging systems.</p>

          <h2>Officials Face Questions Over Adequacy of Warnings Ahead of Deadly Texas Floods</h2>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly Texas flash floods, questions are being raised about whether officials provided adequate and timely warnings to residents. Local authorities in Kerr County, the hardest-hit area, stated they had no reason to expect the unprecedented severity of the deluge, with the Guadalupe River rising nearly 30 feet. Some officials noted challenges with cell coverage in rural areas and public desensitization to frequent weather alerts. The National Weather Service defended its actions, stating it issued Flash Flood Warnings with more than three hours of lead time before the criteria were met.</p>

          <p>Mexico secured its 10th Gold Cup title by defeating the United States 2-1 in a heated final in Houston. West Ham's Edson Álvarez scored the decisive goal in the second half, which was confirmed after a VAR review. The match was marked by controversy, with U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino criticizing the referee for not awarding a penalty for a handball, suggesting the pro-Mexico crowd influenced the decision. The loss ends a promising but uneven tournament for a second-choice U.S. squad in their last major competitive match before hosting the 2026 World Cup.</p>

          <h2>Elon Musk's Plan to Launch a New Political Party Faces Significant Logistical and Legal Hurdles</h2>

          <p>Following a public feud with President Trump, Elon Musk announced the formation of the "America Party," but creating a viable third party in the U.S. is an exceedingly difficult task. Experts note that any new party must navigate a complex web of 50 different state laws for ballot access, which are heavily biased toward the existing two-party system. The process would require immense financial resources to overcome signature-gathering requirements and inevitable legal challenges from the Democratic and Republican parties. Despite Musk's wealth, building a national party structure is considered a multi-year project.</p>
