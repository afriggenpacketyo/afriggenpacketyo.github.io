            <p>As the federal deadline for REAL ID enforcement approaches, several states have altered their driver's license laws to accommodate undocumented immigrants, a move sparking debate over national security and states' rights. The REAL ID Act, passed in 2005, aims to standardize identification for air travel, requiring higher security standards. A Department of Homeland Security memo indicates the Trump administration views REAL ID enforcement as a means to prevent undocumented individuals from flying domestically, while some critics argue it infringes on personal freedom. The enforcement of REAL ID is set to take effect, raising concerns about DMV backlogs and potential restrictions on domestic travel.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's stance on immigration favors attracting affluent individuals, aligning with the concept of selling citizenship or residency. While many find the commodification of national belonging distasteful, numerous countries, including the United States, offer residency in exchange for investment. Trump's perspective on this matter converges with market principles, suggesting the U.S. golden-visa scheme is inefficient and underpriced. This approach highlights the tension between economic interests and the traditional values associated with national identity.</p>

            <p>An Israeli military investigation into the deaths of 15 Palestinian medics in Gaza concluded that there were "professional failures" by Israeli forces, leading to the dismissal of a deputy commander.

The incident resulted in the deaths of eight Red Crescent personnel, six Civil Defense workers, and a U.N. staffer, sparking accusations of targeted killings and raising concerns about the protection of medical personnel in conflict zones.</p>

The tariffs, which could significantly raise prices on new electronics, are incentivizing consumers to consider used or refurbished options. Analysts predict a potential surge in short-term sales of used devices, especially smartphones, as consumers seek to avoid higher prices. While the long-term impact remains uncertain, the tariffs may lead to a shift in consumer behavior towards more sustainable and cost-effective tech purchases. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Tom Homan, White House "Border Czar," defended the Trump administration's deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, alleging he is an MS-13 member and a public safety threat. Homan claims the administration lacks the authority to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S., despite a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" his return for trial. He criticized Senator Chris Van Hollen's meeting with Abrego Garcia and accused him of neglecting victims of MS-13. Abrego Garcia's attorneys and family deny his gang affiliation, disputing the administration's claims.</p>

            <p>British RAF Typhoon jets intercepted two Russian aircraft flying near NATO airspace in separate incidents this week. The intercepts, part of the UK's contribution to NATO's enhanced air policing, involved a Russian intelligence aircraft and another unidentified aircraft. The UK's involvement, called Operation Chessman, demonstrates its commitment to NATO and its ability to defend the Alliance's airspace alongside Sweden, NATO's newest member.</p>

            <h2>Are Common Economic Indicators Actually Reliable?</h2>

            <p>The article questions the reliability of commonly cited economic indicators, such as the "lipstick index" or men's underwear sales, as predictors of a recession. It argues that even widely used metrics like consumer sentiment, unemployment, and GDP can be contradictory and fail to identify underlying economic problems. Instead, the author suggests focusing on data from companies driving consumer spending, capital, and labor, such as retailers, banks, and payroll companies, to gain a more accurate understanding of the economy. The author concludes that focusing on company-specific data is more reliable than government surveys or trade association reports. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Failing to plan for end-of-life finances can lead to legal battles and tax burdens, as demonstrated by celebrities who died without updated estate plans. Lessons from Aaron Carter, who died without a will, Kobe Bryant, who didn't update his plan after his daughter was born, and James Gandolfini, whose estate was heavily taxed, highlight the importance of having a will, keeping it current, and seeking professional advice. Even a basic will is recommended to ensure assets are distributed as desired and to avoid court involvement. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Investors nearing retirement can protect their savings from tariff-induced market volatility by rebalancing their portfolios, building cash reserves, and considering a bond ladder. Financial planners recommend shifting assets to a more conservative allocation, such as a 60/40 stock/bond portfolio, and maintaining two years of income in cash to avoid selling investments during market downturns. A bond ladder provides a steady stream of income and reduces interest rate risk. (not investment advice)</p>
