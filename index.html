          <p>Tropical Storm Barbara has formed off the southwestern coast of Mexico, according to the National Hurricane Center. While there are no coastal watches or warnings currently in effect, the storm is expected to bring two to four inches of rainfall to western Mexico, potentially leading to flooding and mudslides. The storm is also likely to generate dangerous sea swells and rip currents along the coast, and Barbara is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane on Monday. NOAA officials have predicted an above-normal hurricane season for 2025, with 13 to 19 named storms expected.</p>

          <p>At least four Palestinians were killed by Israeli gunfire near an aid distribution center in Gaza, according to local health workers. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that warning shots were fired after a verbal challenge to a group deemed a threat. The incident occurred near Rafah, where crowds were gathering in hopes of receiving food from a new aid system, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), backed by Israel and the US. The IDF considers the area an active combat zone outside of designated hours, while the GHF has faced controversy following multiple deadly incidents during its operations. Humanitarian groups condemn the GHF system, viewing it as an attempt to bypass the UN.</p>

          <p>The Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning was spotted near Japan's easternmost island in the Pacific Ocean, marking the first time a Chinese carrier has sailed in those waters, according to the Japanese Defense Ministry. The carrier, accompanied by two destroyers and another vessel, was observed approximately 300 kilometers southwest of Minamitori Island. The Liaoning then moved southwest, conducting landing and takeoff drills involving fighter jets and helicopters. This move comes as the Chinese navy expands its activities in the waters surrounding Japan, prompting the Japanese government to increase its surveillance and information gathering.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses the growing trend of American parents financially supporting their adult children and argues that it's detrimental to both the children and the parents' retirement. The author suggests that children should be financially independent between the ages of 22 and 25, contributing to household expenses if they live at home. While parents may still cover health insurance and occasional emergencies, the author stresses the importance of teaching financial responsibility and protecting their own retirement savings. The piece also offers advice on how to have these difficult conversations and set clear expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts suggest the third engine is likely similar to the other two, rather than a more exotic type like a ramjet.

This pushback comes as more people recognize the detrimental effects of technology on students' academic and social experiences, particularly at small residential liberal-arts colleges. While the college administration has yet to fully align with this vision, the movement aims to create a more focused and engaged learning environment.</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll reveals Americans have mixed views on the Trump administration's deportation program, with approval heavily influenced by perceptions of who is being targeted. Support is strong when people believe the program prioritizes dangerous criminals, but drops significantly if they think it targets others. Half of Americans feel Trump is deporting more people than expected, and most in this group disapprove of the program. While more people see the program as making the U.S. safer, more also believe it will weaken the economy, with partisan divides further shaping opinions. The poll also touches on views of the national economy, tariffs, and the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act."</p>

          <h2>Study Examines Effects of Prolonged Fasting on the Human Body</h2>

          <p>A new study analyzing the effects of water-only fasting diets on 20 people over 10 days reveals potential negative impacts. Participants experienced an average body weight loss of 7.7 percent, but also reported side effects such as headaches, insomnia, and low blood pressure. Researchers found that prolonged fasting seemed to increase inflammation and put more stress on the body, potentially leading to health complications. While some proteins linked to muscle and bone breakdown were reduced, the study emphasizes the need for medical advice before starting such diets and further investigation into the long-term effects. The findings suggest that there's no one-size-fits-all strategy when it comes to fasting.</p>

          <p>A state-backed think tank has presented China's "four core principles" as a constructive framework for resolving disputes in the South China Sea. These principles include resolving disputes through consultation, managing differences through co-management, achieving positive outcomes through cooperation, and opposing external interference. The report blames regional tensions on external actors who fuel rival claimants' actions and weaken the willingness for maritime cooperation. China's expansive claims over the South China Sea are contested by several ASEAN member states, leading to frequent face-offs between Chinese and Philippine vessels.</p>

Conservative Chris Philp expressed concern about potential police number cuts and urged the government to protect their budget.

Scottish Labour won the seat unexpectedly, with Davy Russell taking the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse constituency.

Newsom confirmed the federal government's move to "take over" the state's National Guard, calling it purposefully inflammatory and likely to escalate tensions.

          <p>An opinion piece suggests that the US threat of "peaceful evolution" aimed at subverting the Communist Party in China has diminished under the Trump administration. The author, who grew up in China during the Mao era, recalls being taught to be vigilant against American conspiracies. However, the author argues that the US has shifted away from nation-building efforts, while China has emerged as a major economic and political power. This shift has reduced the perceived threat of American influence and interference in China's internal affairs.</p>

          <p>The poem "Under a Supermoon" by Arthur Sze reflects on the beauty and significance of small details in life. The speaker expresses a lack of desire for grand adventures, such as space travel or deep-sea exploration, instead finding joy in simple observations like a gold flare in cottonwood leaves and the smell of split piÃ±on. The poem draws upon Blake's idea that persistence in folly can lead to wisdom, suggesting that perseverance has allowed the speaker to catch how this life has exploding, exploded, and birthing stars inside it. The poem finds a sense of wonder and appreciation in the everyday.</p>
