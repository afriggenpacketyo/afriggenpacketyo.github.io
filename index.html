          <p>China's recent stimulus measures, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, have not significantly impacted the stock market due to concerns about the ongoing trade war with the U.S. Investors are awaiting more targeted fiscal measures to boost consumer sentiment and stabilize the real estate sector, as the current stimulus focuses on industrial and social needs rather than direct market support. Analysts suggest that without these additional measures, a meaningful market rally is unlikely.
