        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annual undergraduate tuition fees in England and Wales have risen by 3% to £9,535, the first increase since 2017, with maintenance loans also seeing a slight rise. The change comes as universities face significant financial pressures from inflation and a decrease in international students, leading to warnings of potential cuts to staff and courses. The article also provides context on the comparatively lower fees in Northern Ireland and free tuition in Scotland for local students. It highlights the growing burden of student debt and rising living costs, which are increasingly forcing students into part-time work.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced plans to construct a new $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, with a capacity for 650 guests, to be completed before the end of President Trump's term. The project, described by Trump as his "gift to the country," will be funded by the president and other private "patriot donors" and will replace the current East Wing. This marks the first major structural change to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948. The new venue aims to provide a more suitable space for large-scale events, which currently require the use of tents on the South Lawn.</p>

          <p>Following design software company Figma's highly successful initial public offering, its major venture capital backers, including Index Ventures and Sequoia, are holding stock collectively worth around $24 billion. The company's shares surged 250% on their first day of trading, pushing its market capitalization to nearly $68 billion, a significant increase from the $20 billion acquisition price offered by Adobe in a deal that later collapsed due to regulatory concerns. This event marks a bright spot for the tech IPO market, which has been subdued since late 2021, providing substantial paper returns for early investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formalized new tariffs on imports from over 60 trading partners, with rates ranging from 10% to as high as 41% for countries like Syria. The executive order gives Customs and Border Protection seven days to implement the new duties, delaying the president's original August 1 deadline. For nations that have recently secured trade agreements, such as Japan and the European Union, the new list reflects the terms of those deals. The article notes that countries not explicitly listed will face a baseline 10% tariff, continuing the administration's strategy of using import duties to reshape international trade rules.

The New York Mets also bolstered their bullpen and acquired center fielder Cedric Mullins, and the San Diego Padres were particularly aggressive, trading for seven new players.

The proposal would source half of the funds from customers of the state's three largest utilities by extending a monthly surcharge, with the other half coming from the utilities' shareholders. This plan has drawn criticism from both consumer advocacy groups, who are disappointed about further ratepayer costs, and utility executives, who oppose the shareholder contribution. The original $21 billion fund was established in 2019 to shield utilities from bankruptcy after their equipment sparked catastrophic wildfires.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal. The ruling postpones the expirations, which were set to begin in August, until a hearing can be held in November. In her decision, Judge Trina Thompson criticized the administration, stating its actions appeared to be based on a "preordained determination to end the TPS program" rather than an objective review of country conditions. Most of the affected individuals have resided in the U.S. for over two decades.</p>

The majority of the over 109,000 arrests took place in Southern and border states, with Texas alone accounting for nearly a quarter of the total. Most of the individuals arrested were from Latin American countries, primarily Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras.

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell reveals that the modern potato evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago through an ancient interbreeding event. Scientists analyzed hundreds of genomes from both cultivated and wild potatoes to solve the long-standing puzzle of the vegetable's origin. The research indicates that a crucial gene from the ancient tomato, which promotes tuber formation, combined with a gene from a wild potato-like species that controls stem growth. This hybridization was essential for creating the starch-rich tubers characteristic of the potatoes we consume today.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation has uncovered that China is evading U.S. sanctions by using a "dark fleet" of tankers to secretly purchase oil from Iran. The illicit trade involves ship-to-ship transfers in international waters off the coast of Malaysia, with tankers often turning off their transponders and obscuring their names to avoid detection. This trade is a major financial lifeline for Iran, reportedly generating as much as $70 billion and helping to fund its regime and nuclear program. Despite multiple rounds of U.S. sanctions aimed at curbing this activity, the investigation found that the practice appears to be increasing.</p>

Currently, drivers must self-declare medical conditions and renew their license every three years after age 70, with no upper age limit or mandatory testing. The article highlights a growing debate as the population ages, with data showing that drivers over 75 are at a higher risk of being killed or seriously injured in a crash. While some advocate for mandatory medical reporting, others emphasize that driving is a lifeline for many elderly people, especially in rural areas.</p>

However, the privately financed project faces strong opposition from environmental groups, local residents, and London's mayor, who cite severe impacts on noise, air pollution, and climate targets.

          <p>Pop star Justin Timberlake has disclosed that he was diagnosed with and battled a "relentlessly debilitating" case of Lyme disease while on his recent Forget Tomorrow world tour. In a candid social media post, the 44-year-old singer explained that the illness caused significant nerve pain and fatigue, but he made the personal decision to continue performing rather than cancel the tour. He shared his health struggle to be more transparent with fans and shed light on the challenges he faced behind the scenes. Lyme disease is a bacterial illness transmitted by ticks, with symptoms that can include joint pain and fever.</p>

          <p>Social media companies like X and Reddit are blocking a wide range of content, including posts about the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, in their efforts to comply with the UK's new Online Safety Act. The legislation, which aims to protect minors from harmful material, requires age verification for certain content, but BBC Verify found that it is also restricting access to public interest material, such as parliamentary debates. Experts warn that companies are over-applying the law, risking the suppression of legitimate public debate. The platforms face substantial fines for non-compliance, creating a complex challenge of balancing child safety with freedom of speech.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Restricts Civil Service Internships to Students from Poorer Backgrounds</h2>

          <p>In a new initiative to increase social diversity within its ranks, the UK government will restrict its main civil service internship scheme exclusively to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The policy change, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to make the civil service more reflective of the country it serves. The assessment of a student's background will be based on their parents' occupations when the student was 14. Successful interns from the program will also be prioritized for entry into the Fast Stream, the primary graduate recruitment program for the civil service.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has outlined a plan to potentially call a special election on November 4, asking voters to approve new congressional maps. This move is a direct response to President Trump's efforts to have Republican-controlled states redraw their districts to maintain a House majority in the midterm elections. Under Newsom's proposal, the legislature would create new maps that, if approved by voters, would remain in effect until 2030, after which the state would return to its independent redistricting commission system. The governor framed the potential gerrymandering as a necessary response to his political opponents' tactics.</p>

          <p>Florida has executed Edward Zakrzewski for the 1994 murders of his wife and two young children, marking the ninth execution in the state this year. This total sets a new single-year record for Florida since the death penalty was reinstated in the U.S. in 1976. Zakrzewski, an Air Force veteran, was sentenced to death after a jury's narrow 7-5 recommendation, a split vote that would not be sufficient for a death sentence under current state law. The execution proceeded after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a final appeal, highlighting Florida's position as the state with the most executions in 2025.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, FICO CEO Will Lansing defended his company's pricing structure against criticism from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which recently allowed mortgage lenders to use a rival score from VantageScore. Lansing argued that the cost of a FICO score, at $4.95 for a mortgage, is a very small part of closing costs and is not a barrier to homeownership. He also expressed "safety and soundness concerns" about the FHFA's decision to endorse what he described as a less predictive credit score model. The CEO emphasized FICO's dominant market share in non-government-mandated markets as proof of its performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's recent implementation of global tariffs, noting that while he has secured some trade deals and avoided immediate financial market chaos, the long-term consequences remain uncertain. The new trade landscape, characterized by higher baseline tariffs, has reduced uncertainty for businesses but may lead to higher consumer prices in the U.S. and could damage the global economy. The strategy has also prompted traditional allies to seek new alliances, potentially eroding America's central position in the global trading order. The ultimate success of the policy in boosting domestic jobs remains in doubt. (not investment advice)</p>
