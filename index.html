          <p>Top Obama-era intelligence officials, including former CIA Director John Brennan and former FBI Director James Comey, are reportedly under criminal investigation. The probe centers on their use of the unverified "Steele dossier" to initiate the 2016 Trump-Russia investigation and brief then-President-elect Trump, despite internal knowledge that it contained "internet rumor." Declassified documents suggest officials knew of a Clinton campaign plan to link Trump to Russia, yet proceeded with the probe, which ultimately found no evidence of collusion.</p>

          <p>Kevin Stein, CEO of TransDigm Group Inc., has become a significant political donor to both Republican and Democratic candidates. His company faced congressional scrutiny in 2019 for earning millions in excess profits from federal defense contracts, which it voluntarily repaid. However, after a 2021 report raised similar concerns, the company did not issue a refund, sparking criticism about corporate influence and accountability in government spending. Stein has since donated hundreds of thousands to political committees and individual campaigns.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Swiss law now requires food producers and sellers to disclose if imported animal products were sourced from animals subjected to painful procedures without anesthesia, such as castration or dehorning. The regulation, which also covers force-feeding for foie gras, aims to increase transparency for consumers at the point of purchase. While animal advocates argue the law doesn't go far enough, it represents a significant experiment in using consumer information to address animal welfare issues. The policy follows a similar successful law from 2000 regarding eggs from caged hens.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has issued a preliminary injunction, blocking the enforcement of a Trump administration executive order concerning birthright citizenship. The ruling came in response to a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU on behalf of immigrant families. The decision temporarily protects the constitutional principle of birthright citizenship for all children born in the United States. The judge's order includes a seven-day stay, allowing the administration time to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in the Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 121 deaths, with dozens of people, including children from a summer camp, still missing. The disaster was caused by a convergence of weather systems that dumped massive rainfall, causing the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in under an hour. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timeliness and adequacy of public warnings and evacuation orders in the flood-prone region. A federal disaster has been declared as extensive search, rescue, and recovery operations continue.</p>

This positions the state to better withstand potential federal budget cuts. However, the state still faces challenges, including high business costs and the potential impact of federal cuts to research grants for its many universities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis by the organization Global Witness found that Donald Trump's presidential inaugural fund received over $19 million from companies and individuals linked to the fossil fuel industry. This amount constituted nearly 8% of the record $239 million raised for the event. Major donors included energy giants like Chevron, which contributed $2 million, and ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, which each gave $1 million. The significant contributions have raised concerns about the industry's influence on an administration that has actively rolled back environmental regulations and promoted fossil fuel extraction.</p>

It cites a range of examples, from the Trump Organization's real estate deals with autocratic regimes to the use of lawsuits against media organizations that result in large settlements. The author contends that the dismantling of anti-corruption agencies and norms, combined with a favorable Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity, has created an environment ripe for kleptocracy, incentivizing foreign powers to seek influence through financial dealings with the president's family.</p>
