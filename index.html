          <p>This article profiles several social media content creators in the Dallas-Fort Worth area who successfully transitioned from traditional 9-to-5 jobs to careers as full-time influencers. They share advice for aspiring creators, emphasizing the importance of building a quality community over just accumulating followers and promoting products authentically. While the influencer market is a growing multi-billion dollar industry, the article notes that success requires significant investment in equipment and consistent effort, and only a small percentage of creators earn over $100,000 annually.</p>

          <p>Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio advises that the current economic environment, marked by high government spending and debt, mirrors the early 1970s. He suggests that investors should consider allocating as much as 15% of their portfolios to gold as a strategic diversifier, arguing it performs well when traditional assets like debt instruments decline. Dalio views gold as a crucial hedge against monetary debasement and geopolitical instability, providing a store of wealth that is not dependent on another party's ability to pay.

          <p>A youth-led movement in Morocco, known as GenZ 212, is organizing the country's largest anti-government protests in years, demanding reforms in health, education, and the judiciary. The movement operates anonymously and democratically through the online platform Discord, which was originally created for gamers, to coordinate daily demonstrations and make collective decisions via online votes. Organizers state they use the platform for its security and because Moroccan authorities are less familiar with it, allowing them to mobilize thousands while maintaining anonymity.</p>

Durbin questioned the rationale and secrecy behind the move, while Bondi defended it as necessary to protect citizens, accusing the senator of hating President Trump more than he loved his city. The confrontation highlights the deep political divisions surrounding the federal intervention, which Illinois state and city leaders are challenging in court.</p>

          <p>In a unified move, the world's leading rugby unions, including England, New Zealand, and South Africa, have issued a blanket ban preventing players who join the proposed R360 competition from being selected for international teams. The unions expressed concerns that the new globe-trotting tournament has not addressed player welfare, its coexistence with the established rugby calendar, or how it would benefit the sport as a whole. This decision presents a significant obstacle for R360, as the ability to play for one's country is a major incentive for top players.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is considering a challenge to Colorado's law banning "conversion therapy" for minors, brought by a Christian counselor who argues it unconstitutionally restricts her free speech. The central legal question is whether the law regulates professional medical conduct, which states have the authority to do, or if it censors specific viewpoints and conversations about gender identity and sexual orientation. During arguments, several justices questioned the state's interpretation and raised concerns about potential viewpoint discrimination, where counseling to accept one's identity is permitted but counseling to change it is not.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is causing significant disruptions to air travel, with staffing shortages at Federal Aviation Administration facilities leading to widespread flight delays and cancellations. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy attributed the issues to a slight increase in sick calls from air traffic controllers, who are required to work without pay and are concerned about their financial situations. Officials have warned that the travel chaos could intensify if the shutdown continues, as safety protocols may require reducing the number of flights to manage the limited staff.</p>

However, the WTO warns of a sharp deterioration in 2026, slashing its growth forecast to just 0.5% as the global economy is expected to cool and feel the full impact of higher tariffs.

The primary reason identified is the fragmented nature of the U.S. healthcare system, which lacks a single, powerful entity to negotiate drug prices on behalf of the entire population. In contrast, countries with national health insurance systems can perform value assessments and leverage their collective bargaining power to demand lower prices from pharmaceutical companies, often refusing to cover drugs they deem overpriced.</p>

          <p>The National Hurricane Center has announced the formation of Tropical Storm Jerry over the central Atlantic Ocean, marking the tenth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. The system is currently far from land and is tracking westward, with forecasters expecting it to steadily strengthen into a hurricane over the next few days. While no coastal watches or warnings are in effect yet, the storm is projected to pass near or north of the Leeward Islands, likely generating life-threatening surf and rip currents later this week.</p>

          <p>When asked about a potential pardon for convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell, former President Donald Trump gave a noncommittal response, stating he would have to "take a look at it." This comment came after the Supreme Court declined to hear Maxwell's appeal of her 20-year prison sentence. The remark prompted a swift and strong warning from staunch Trump ally and far-right influencer Laura Loomer, who publicly urged the president not to consider a pardon, writing, "There will be no coming back from that."</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced plans to double its tariffs on steel imports to 50%, matching the protectionist measures imposed by the U.S. under President Trump. While the EU aims to protect its own industry from a glut of Chinese steel, the move has been condemned by UK Steel as an "existential threat" to the British steel industry. With 80% of UK steel exports going to the EU, industry leaders warn that being subject to these new tariffs could be "terminal" for many UK steel companies.</p>

          <p>A global cocoa shortage and resulting price surge are forcing candy manufacturers to alter their products, particularly noticeable in new Halloween offerings. Companies like Hershey's and Ferrara are launching new versions of classic treats that contain less or no chocolate, substituting it with coatings like cinnamon, vanilla cream, or salted caramel. This trend of "cocoa cutting," along with a reduction in candy sizes, allows manufacturers to manage soaring costs while still presenting consumers with novel flavor experiences during a key sales season.</p>

The instability stems from a hung parliament and the inability to form a stable coalition to address France's significant national debt. Amid the political deadlock, there are growing calls from opposition parties and the public for Macron to dissolve parliament again for new elections, or for him to resign from the presidency altogether.</p>
