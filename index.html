          <h2>General Motors Exceeds Q2 Earnings Expectations While Navigating Tariff Challenges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 06:50:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, maintaining its full-year guidance amidst significant uncertainty from U.S. auto tariffs. CEO Mary Barra confirmed the company is actively working to "greatly reduce" its tariff exposure, which could impact the company by up to $5 billion. Despite beating estimates, GM's net income and revenue saw year-over-year declines, reflecting the financial pressure of ongoing trade disputes and a challenging market landscape. The automaker is implementing strategic manufacturing adjustments and cost initiatives to offset these rising expenses, highlighting the industry's broader struggle with evolving global trade policies.

          <p>Südwestdeutsche Medienholding (SWMH), one of Germany's largest media conglomerates and owner of the Süddeutsche Zeitung, has confirmed it was the target of a significant cyberattack. The company stated that unauthorized individuals briefly accessed its internal network in mid-July, affecting all connected publications. While SWMH managed to stop the attack and maintain uninterrupted newspaper production and online reporting, the incident has been reported to police cybercrime units. The event is part of a growing trend of cyberattacks against German companies and government bodies, with external IT experts now assisting in the investigation to enhance security measures.</p>

          <h2>British Medical Association Warns NHS Strike Plan Puts Patients at Risk</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 06:34:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) has accused NHS England of endangering patients with its new strategy for the upcoming resident doctors' strike. The union argues that the plan to minimize cancellations of routine procedures will dangerously overstretch senior doctors who are providing cover. In previous strikes, non-urgent care was widely postponed to ensure emergency services remained safely staffed, but the new approach insists on maintaining as much routine care as possible. The BMA has formally written to NHS leadership, warning that the policy risks last-minute chaos and potential harm to patients, as talks between the government and the union to avert the strike continue.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola is set to release its second-quarter earnings, with Wall Street analysts watching closely to see how it performs against a particularly strong equivalent period last year. The company previously cautioned that it would face challenging comparisons and potential short-term volatility related to trade tariffs. Despite these headwinds, analysts remain optimistic due to Coke's significant pricing power and extensive global reach. The report will also be viewed in the context of rival PepsiCo's recent results, which showed a decline in beverage volume in North America, suggesting shifting consumer behavior in response to price increases across the sector.

          <p>The death of Phillip Reeder, an unarmed 52-year-old man, has been officially ruled a homicide by the Jefferson County medical examiner's office in Alabama. The autopsy report states he died of heart failure associated with cocaine use and restraint during an altercation with police, during which an officer allegedly knelt on his neck. Reeder's family, who have reviewed the unreleased body camera footage, claim he was tasered and then restrained with a knee on his neck for over three minutes, pleading that he couldn't breathe. The Irondale Police Department disputes this characterization, stating no knee was placed on his neck and that Reeder was resisting arrest.</p>

          <p>A detailed report reveals the intense internal divisions and dramatic negotiations within the House Republican conference to pass President Trump's major legislative bill. The process involved all-night sessions, last-minute vote changes, and direct intervention from the White House to win over holdout members from the party's hard-line conservative wing. Facing a slim majority, GOP leadership struggled to unify their caucus, with a group of holdouts negotiating directly with the White House for concessions on fiscal and social issues. This legislative battle highlights the fragile unity within the GOP and suggests future challenges for funding the government and advancing other key priorities.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the Center for Working-Class Politics suggests that a significant portion of Donald Trump's working-class voter base could be persuaded to vote for Democrats. The research indicates that about 11% of these voters hold economically egalitarian views but are socially moderate, making them a key target for a "social populist" platform. This strategy would involve embracing a worker-focused economic agenda—such as raising the minimum wage and protecting jobs—while adopting more moderate social and cultural stances. The authors argue that winning even a fraction of this demographic, which constitutes about 5% of the total electorate, could be decisive in future elections.</p>

          <p>Millions of Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace could experience sharp premium increases in 2026 if Congress does not extend pandemic-era enhanced subsidies. The expiration of these benefits would reinstate the "subsidy cliff," where individuals earning just over 400% of the federal poverty level lose all financial assistance, potentially raising their monthly costs by hundreds of dollars. The recently passed Republican tax bill did not include an extension for these subsidies, creating uncertainty for many self-employed workers, students, and early retirees.

Historically, private litigants, not the Department of Justice, have brought the vast majority of successful VRA cases. The argument, originating from a 2021 opinion by Justice Neil Gorsuch, could dismantle one of the most successful civil rights statutes in American history if the Supreme Court affirms the lower court's decision.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that the presence of a pet dog helps humans manage stress in a more biologically balanced way than previously understood. Researchers measured biomarkers for the body's two main stress pathways and found that while people with their dogs showed lower spikes in the long-term stress hormone cortisol, they exhibited a healthy, quick activation of the short-term "fight or flight" response. In contrast, participants without their dogs had a dysregulated, flat response, often seen in people with chronic stress or PTSD. The findings suggest that dogs help keep their owners in an optimal stress response zone, promoting better engagement and quicker recovery from stressful events.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The estimated cost for constructing the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk, UK, has surged to £38 billion, a significant increase from the previous official figure of £20 billion. Project officials clarified that earlier estimates did not account for inflation and risk, and the new cost will add approximately £1 per month to household energy bills during the construction phase. The UK government has confirmed it will take a 44.9% stake in the project, alongside investments from private companies like Centrica and EDF. While proponents claim the plant will lower energy bills long-term and create jobs, critics are alarmed by the escalating costs and financial burden on the public.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a new sanctions regime targeting individuals and companies involved in global people-smuggling networks. The first list of targets, expected to be released Wednesday, could include gang leaders, corrupt officials, and businesses supplying small boats, who will face asset freezes and travel bans. This move is a central part of the government's strategy to crack down on illegal small boat crossings by disrupting the criminal enterprises that facilitate them. While the government calls it a decisive step, critics question the ease of enforcement and argue that sanctions alone will not stop dangerous crossings without providing safe, legal alternatives for asylum seekers.</p>

This move comes after a period of recession and economic sluggishness for Germany.

Former Foreign and Home Secretary Sir James Cleverly is anticipated to return to a prominent front-bench role, while Mel Stride will likely remain as shadow chancellor. The shake-up comes eight months into Badenoch's leadership, a period during which the party has struggled in opinion polls. A party source stated the reshuffle reflects the next stage of policy renewal and aims to underline party unity, though Labour has dismissed it as rearranging deckchairs on a failing ship.</p>

          <p>The UK government borrowed £20.7 billion in June, a figure £6.6 billion higher than the same month last year and more than anticipated by economists. The Office for National Statistics reported that increased spending on public services and rising debt interest payments drove the increase, putting additional pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves. With debt interest payments nearly doubling due to inflation-linked debt, analysts now believe tax hikes in the autumn Budget are increasingly likely. The data highlights the difficult fiscal outlook for the UK, as the government struggles to fund its spending commitments while adhering to its rules for managing public finances.

          <p>The European Union's proposal to link development aid for African nations to their cooperation on migration control is facing strong condemnation from African policy experts and humanitarian groups. Critics argue the policy, which could slash aid to countries that don't comply with deportation and border control demands, is a coercive tactic that turns sovereign nations into Europe's border guards. This approach is seen as weaponizing aid for the EU's self-interest, ignoring the root causes of migration like poverty and conflict, and undermining trust between the continents. Experts suggest this could push African nations toward alternative global partnerships with countries like China and Russia.</p>

The author argues that Kentucky has already implemented a comprehensive and effective state-level regulatory system for hemp-derived cannabinoids, including age restrictions, lab testing, and licensing. She contends that federal overreach would undermine Kentucky's successful model, hurt legitimate local businesses, and push the market underground, making it harder to control.

          <p>Scientists who monitor Earth's rotation have noted that recent days in July have been fractions of a second shorter than the standard 24 hours. While variations in the planet's spin speed are common, influenced by factors like the moon's gravity, atmospheric winds, and the Earth's liquid core, the last decade has seen a notable number of shorter days. Experts explain that while the Earth's rotation is slowing down over millions of years, these short-term fluctuations are normal. The recent speed-up has raised the novel possibility of a "negative leap second," though it is considered unlikely to be implemented by international timekeepers.</p>

The book details the desolate and unfit living conditions within the camp and explores the complex emotional aftermath for the family.

This situation highlights a critical flaw in safety-net programs, as new federal rules are set to make it even harder for low-income workers to maintain coverage.

Despite his hardline stance, Fico ultimately dropped his veto, a tactic reminiscent of Hungarian leader Viktor Orban. Critics in Slovakia argue the posturing was a "show for the voters back home" designed to divert attention from pressing domestic issues, including a large budget deficit, a structural economic crisis in the auto industry, and ongoing corruption scandals. This strategy allows Fico to project an image of fighting for national sovereignty while ultimately aligning with EU decisions.</p>
