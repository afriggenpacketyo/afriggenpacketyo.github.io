        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine revealed that the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites involved a complex mission utilizing decoy bombers and "misdirection." Decoy B-2 stealth bombers were flown over the Pacific towards Guam to divert attention, while the actual bombers flew under the cover of darkness for 18 hours. The mission involved dropping 14 bunker buster bombs and launching Tomahawk cruise missiles from a U.S. submarine. Iran did not deploy fighters or surface to air missiles, indicating they were caught off guard during the operation, which maintained the element of surprise.</p>

The Houthi threat against shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has also increased, potentially targeting ships affiliated with Israel or the U.S. Maersk has temporarily suspended port calls to Haifa, Israel's largest container port. The conflict has also caused ocean freight rates to surge from Shanghai to Jebel Ali, the Arabian Gulf's largest port, with spot rates for VLCC voyages between the Middle East and China increasing significantly.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Middle East mostly closed higher on Sunday despite the United States entering the conflict between Israel and Iran by striking three Iranian nuclear sites.

In the Gulf, Saudi Arabia's Tadawul experienced a slight decrease, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Egypt's EGX30 was the major gainer in the region, closing significantly higher, as Gulf countries have called for appeasement and supported a peaceful resolution to isolate themselves from any significant short-term market impact.

          <p>Reem Raouda, a parenting expert, suggests using specific phrases to encourage children's cooperation rather than resorting to threats or bribes. Instead of saying "Because I said so," explain the reasoning behind decisions to foster respect. Replace threats with phrases that give children agency over their behavior, like "When you're ready to do [X], we can do [Y]." Validating a child's emotions and inviting problem-solving can also lead to better cooperation and emotional resilience. The key is to create an environment where children feel respected, safe, and involved.</p>

          <p>The US has entered a new phase of political violence, with multiple acts of politically motivated violence dominating headlines and sparking fears. Experts note a historically high period of American political violence, with perpetrators coming from both the right and the left. Factors contributing to the tension include the Israel-Gaza war and social change as the US transitions to a white-minority country. The normalization of violent rhetoric and the increasing tolerance of political violence are also concerning trends, and American political leaders need to condemn political violence in a bipartisan way.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Florida are accused of racially gerrymandering two state senate districts to disenfranchise Black voters in the Tampa Bay area. The ACLU argues that Republicans manipulated voting districts to their advantage by undercutting Black voting power. The case highlights the removal of Black voters from St Petersburg, diluting their voting power in the newly created district. The plaintiffs argue that the maps represent racial gerrymandering because they pack about half of the regionâ€™s Black population into a single one of its five senate districts.</p>

          <p>Despite facing challenges such as tariffs, ongoing inflation, labor shortages, and higher financing costs, small business owners in the US remain relatively optimistic. Multiple surveys indicate that while optimism is tempered by a weakening outlook on future economic growth, many small businesses report business growth and have maintained or grown their workforce. The top concerns of small business owners have shifted from inflation to taxation, and uncertainty remains. However, most small business owners report their businesses as currently successful and see growth in the past year, maintaining employment levels and reporting average financial results.

          <p>Sen. Tom Cotton, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, stated that the United States must "be prepared for Iran to retaliate" following strikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities. Cotton emphasized the seriousness of the threats and President Trump's priority for the safety of the American people. He echoed President Trump's warning to Iran to opt for peace, saying that any military action against Americans would be met with a response far greater than the recent strikes. Cotton noted that the damage assessment was still underway but asserted that the strikes had severely damaged Iran's critical nuclear infrastructure.</p>

The president warned Iran against retaliating and urged them to strive for a peace deal with Israel. Defense Department officials confirmed that American B-2 Spirit bombers were used in the strikes, dropping U.S.-produced "bunker-buster" bombs.
