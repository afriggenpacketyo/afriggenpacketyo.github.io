        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Liberal Democrats have proposed a plan to establish police counters in accessible public venues like supermarkets and libraries across England and Wales. This initiative aims to make reporting crime easier for the public and improve confidence in policing, which the party argues has diminished. The proposal suggests funding this increased community presence by abolishing the roles of Police and Crime Commissioners, a move the party claims would free up over £100 million. This policy announcement comes as the party seeks to appeal to more voters during its annual conference.</p>

          <p>A shooting at the Mango nightclub in Birmingham has left one man in critical condition and three other individuals injured. The incident occurred early Saturday morning, prompting a major police response and the closure of Bristol Street, a key route into the city center. West Midlands Police have arrested three people in their 20s and 30s on suspicion of violent disorder after locating them in a vehicle on the M6 motorway. Authorities are appealing for witnesses who were in the busy club or have dashcam footage to come forward with information.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order mandating a new $100,000 annual fee for companies applying for H-1B visas for skilled foreign workers, a significant increase from previous administrative costs. The administration states the measure is intended to curb "abuse" of the program and encourage companies to hire American workers first. Critics, including immigration lawyers and business groups, warn that the steep fee will price out small businesses and start-ups, potentially damaging U.S. competitiveness in the tech sector. The order is set to take effect on September 21 and applies to new visa requests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia is hosting the final of its revived Intervision song contest, positioning it as a conservative counterpart to the more liberal Eurovision Song Contest, from which Russian artists are currently banned. President Vladimir Putin relaunched the competition, which Moscow says promotes "traditional values" and "national identity," explicitly contrasting it with Eurovision's pro-LGBTQ+ stance. The event includes participants from former Soviet republics and BRICS nations like China and Brazil, but very few European countries. The contest underscores the growing cultural and political divide between Russia and the West.</p>

          <p>Peter and Barbie Reynolds, an elderly British couple held by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months, have been released and are returning to the UK. Their son expressed being "ecstatic and massively grateful" for the efforts that secured their freedom, which was brokered by Qatar. The couple, who ran a charitable training program in Afghanistan for 18 years, were detained in February for allegedly breaking Afghan laws, though the specific reasons were never disclosed. The family had previously raised serious concerns about the couple's deteriorating health while in detention.</p>

          <p>Estonia has formally requested an Article 4 consultation with its NATO allies after three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets violated its airspace over the Gulf of Finland. The Estonian government reported the jets remained in its territory for 12 minutes without permission, flight plans, or active transponders. In response, NATO allies Italy, Finland, and Sweden scrambled their own aircraft to escort the Russian planes out, with a NATO spokesperson calling the incident "reckless Russian behaviour." Russia has denied the violation, but the event marks another escalation in tensions along NATO's eastern flank.</p>

While useful for reminders about school events and organizing teacher gifts, many parents find the constant notifications and volume of messages overwhelming. The groups can also foster competitive parenting, spread misinformation, and create unnecessary anxiety, leading some parents to leave them entirely. Experts advise setting boundaries to manage the "enforced systems of communication" that these digital groups represent in modern parenting.</p>

          <h2>Global High Seas Treaty to Become International Law After Reaching Ratification Threshold</h2>

          <p>The High Seas Treaty, a landmark global agreement to protect marine biodiversity in international waters, is set to become law after receiving its 60th ratification. The treaty, two decades in the making, will enable the creation of marine protected areas in the high seas, which cover over two-thirds of the world's oceans. Environmental groups have hailed this as a "monumental achievement" that will help countries meet the goal of protecting 30% of the world's oceans by 2030. Currently, only 1% of the high seas are protected, leaving marine life vulnerable to overfishing, pollution, and climate change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz has sharply criticized Federal Communications Commission (FCC) chairman Brendan Carr for his role in the suspension of late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. Cruz compared Carr's threat to review ABC's broadcast license over Kimmel's monologue about slain activist Charlie Kirk to the tactics of a "mafioso." While stating he was "thrilled" that Kimmel was taken off the air, Cruz warned that the government using its regulatory power to police speech is "dangerous as hell." He argued that such actions set a precedent that could be used against conservatives in the future.</p>

          <h2>Japanese Defense Researcher Expresses Concern Over Weakening U.S.-India Relations</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A prominent Japanese defense researcher has warned that declining U.S. engagement in Asia, particularly its weakening ties with India, is undermining regional alliances like the Quad and creating a strategic opening for China. The researcher noted that from Japan's perspective, the Quad—comprising Australia, India, Japan, and the U.S.—is a crucial diplomatic tool for balancing against China's influence. The concern is that President Trump's perceived lack of interest in the framework, highlighted by his decision not to attend a planned summit in New Delhi, could destabilize the region.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Erik Siebert, the acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, has resigned from his position after President Trump publicly stated, "I want him out." The pressure reportedly stemmed from Siebert's office not bringing criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James over allegations of mortgage fraud, a case promoted by Trump allies. President Trump cited his decision was based on Siebert receiving support from two Democratic senators during his confirmation process. James, who previously won a civil fraud suit against Trump, has called the allegations a baseless "revenge tour."</p>

          <p>Qingzhou Wang, an executive of the Wuhan-based company Amarvel Biotech, has been sentenced to 25 years in a U.S. prison for trafficking chemicals used to manufacture fentanyl. Wang and a colleague were convicted in New York for shipping hundreds of kilograms of fentanyl precursors into the United States, often disguising them as common goods and using cryptocurrency for payment. This case marked the first time the U.S. has prosecuted Chinese companies for trafficking these chemicals directly into the country, rather than through Mexico. The prosecution drew strong condemnation from the Chinese government.</p>
