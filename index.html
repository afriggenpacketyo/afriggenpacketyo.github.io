          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 22:11:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has intensified his criticism of India's trade relationship with the U.S., labeling it a "totally one-sided disaster" following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. Trump claimed India had offered to cut its tariffs to zero, but asserted it was "getting late" and should have been done "years ago," without elaborating on the timing of such an offer. This rhetoric unfolds against the backdrop of the U.S. imposing significant tariffs on India, including secondary duties for its continued purchase of Russian oil, which New Delhi has publicly decried as "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable." The article underscores how these trade disputes and geopolitical alignments, particularly India's ongoing ties with Russia and its engagement with China, are significantly straining more than two decades of improving U.S.-India relations and shaping the future of global trade dynamics.</p>

          <p>Oscar-nominated actor Graham Greene, widely recognized for his powerful portrayal of Kicking Bird in the Academy Award-winning 1990 film "Dances With Wolves," has passed away at the age of 73 after battling a "lengthy illness." His agent confirmed his death, emphasizing Greene's deep love and dedication to his people and the world, describing him as a man of profound morals, ethics, and character. Beyond his iconic role alongside Kevin Costner, which earned him a Best Supporting Actor nomination, Greene also left a lasting impression in other notable films such as "Maverick," "Die Hard With a Vengeance," and "The Green Mile." He will be eternally missed by his family and the film community.</p>

          <p>Weston Halsne, a 10-year-old survivor of the Annunciation Catholic Church mass shooting, is scheduled to undergo surgery on Wednesday after doctors discovered a bullet fragment lodged in his neck, dangerously close to his carotid artery. Weston garnered significant attention for his harrowing account of the attack, crediting his friend, Victor, for saving his life by shielding him, an act that tragically left Victor injured. While two children were killed and 21 people were hurt in the incident, Weston's father reports that his son is recovering well, enjoying time with friends, and eagerly anticipating the Vikings season. A community fundraiser for Weston's medical costs has already raised nearly $60,000, showcasing widespread support for his ongoing recovery.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 21:54:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded with mixed results as investors closely assessed the outcomes of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) meeting in Tianjin, alongside ongoing uncertainties surrounding U.S. tariffs. This market sentiment follows a recent U.S. federal appeals court ruling that declared most of President Donald Trump's global tariffs illegal, adding to economic unpredictability. India's markets are particularly under scrutiny after Trump's public comments about India's offer to reduce tariffs to zero and his characterization of the U.S.-India trade relationship as "one-sided." While Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi saw moderate gains, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index remained flat, and mainland China's CSI 300 experienced a slight downturn, reflecting a cautious regional outlook.

          <p>Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler, the longest-serving New Yorker in the House, has announced his decision not to seek re-election in 2026, citing a "necessity for generational change" within the Democratic Party. His decision was influenced by observing former President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 election. Nadler, 78, first elected to Congress in 1992, has had a distinguished career, notably serving as chair of the House Judiciary Committee from 2019 to 2023 and as a manager during former President Trump's first impeachment. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries lauded Nadler as a "relentless fighter for justice, civil rights and liberties," acknowledging his significant contributions to American public service and the party.</p>

Investors are increasingly seeking alternative safe havens, driving gold prices just shy of record levels. This dollar weakness is largely attributed to President Donald Trump's public attacks on the Federal Reserve, including his decision to remove Governor Lisa Cook, which raises fears about the central bank's independence amid an unclear path for interest rate cuts. Upcoming U.S. economic data for August, including manufacturing and services purchasing managers' indices and the non-farm payrolls report, will be closely watched for further market direction.

This development suggests a growing family of versatile land-, sea-, and air-launched hypersonic missiles tailored for various combat scenarios. While satellite imagery has indicated ongoing development of the air-launched variant since 2018, China has not yet officially confirmed these advanced missiles are in service.</p>

The study, employing Bradford University's Deep Face Recognition algorithm, indicated a "high probability" match between the mortuary image and photographs of Sadr taken during his lifetime. This discovery, coupled with the observation of a damaged skull on the corpse, strongly suggests Sadr was likely killed, potentially under the orders of Muammar Gaddafi.

          <p>The UK Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, will gain the power to veto any new sentencing guidelines proposed by the independent Sentencing Council, a significant policy shift aimed at addressing a "democratic deficit." This change, introduced as part of the new Sentencing Bill, will require both the Justice Secretary and the Lady Chief Justice to approve future guidelines before their issuance, ensuring parliamentary oversight. The reform follows earlier controversy where ministers intervened to block guidance advising judges to consider the background of minority offenders. While the Justice Department asserts this will not compromise judicial independence in individual sentencing decisions, it fundamentally alters the balance of power in setting sentencing policy.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani was hospitalized with multiple broken bones, including fractured thoracic vertebrae, along with lacerations and injuries to his left arm and lower leg, after his vehicle was struck from behind at high speed in New Hampshire. The collision occurred on Saturday night, shortly after Giuliani and his associate had stopped to provide assistance to a woman reporting domestic violence on the side of Interstate 93. State police confirmed that a 19-year-old driver hit their vehicle, though the injuries were non-life-threatening for all involved. Giuliani's son, Andrew, praised his father's resilience, adding another notable event to the public life of the former New York mayor and Trump adviser.</p>

          <p>Premier League clubs have shattered previous financial records, with summer transfer spending surpassing an unprecedented £3 billion, largely driven by significant deadline day deals. The total outlay of £3.087 billion dramatically exceeds last summer's £1.96 billion and collectively surpasses the spending of Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1, and Serie A clubs combined. Liverpool's British record £125 million acquisition of Alexander Isak was a major contributor, pushing their individual spending to a new high for a single club in one window. This unprecedented financial activity underscores the Premier League's escalating economic power and its dominant position in the global football transfer market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool has dramatically transformed its transfer strategy under new manager Arne Slot, becoming the highest-spending club in a single window with a record £415 million outlay, a stark contrast to previous claims of financial "ceilings."

The strategy aims to capitalize on their recent title triumph, making the club more attractive to high-profile signings like Florian Wirtz and British record-breaker Alexander Isak. The tragic death of forward Diogo Jota also necessitated key replacements, adding a somber backdrop to their unprecedented financial commitment and ambition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking new study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a critical human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, to at least 286,000 years old, firmly placing it within the Middle Pleistocene era. Researchers utilized advanced uranium-series dating techniques on calcite found directly on the skull, finally resolving decades of conflicting age estimates. This accurate dating strengthens the theory that the skull, often grouped with Homo heidelbergensis, represents a distinct, more primitive human population that coexisted alongside emerging Neanderthals in Europe. The findings not only clarify the fossil's timeline but also significantly reshape our understanding of human prehistory in southeastern Europe, highlighting a complex evolutionary narrative.</p>
