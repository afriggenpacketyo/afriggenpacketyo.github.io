        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Postal Service operates a Remote Encoding Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, dedicated to deciphering poorly handwritten addresses on mail. When automated systems fail to read an address, images are sent to this facility where data conversion operators, or keyers, work around the clock to manually decode them. These experts process approximately 75,000 images of mail daily, with an individual keyer handling about 900 pieces per hour. This specialized center ensures that even mail with the most challenging penmanship has a chance to reach its intended destination, preventing it from being returned to the sender.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley and former Democratic Governor Roy Cooper are both preparing to run for the U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina in 2026. The seat is being vacated by Republican Senator Thom Tillis, setting the stage for a major political battle in the state. Whatley is expected to announce his campaign soon, reportedly with the endorsement of former President Trump, who publicly encouraged him to run. Cooper is also anticipated to declare his candidacy next week, making this one of the most-watched contests of the upcoming election cycle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its "sanctuary city" policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The lawsuit argues these policies obstruct federal law and endanger public safety by preventing local police from assisting in immigration arrests. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the action was necessary to protect citizens, as the administration intensifies its crackdown on undocumented migrants. This legal challenge is part of a broader effort by the administration to compel compliance from cities and states with similar sanctuary policies across the country.</p>

          <p>During a press conference, a heckler interrupted Florida Governor Ron DeSantis as he was paying tribute to the late professional wrestler Hulk Hogan. The individual shouted profanities and criticized the governor's immigration policies, specifically referencing the "Alligator Alcatraz" detention center. The governor responded by telling the man to leave before security removed him from the room. The incident, which was caught on camera, occurred just as DeSantis was sharing a personal memory of Hogan, momentarily derailing the event before he continued with his remarks.</p>

          <p>Three former federal immigration judges who were recently fired without cause are speaking out, describing their dismissals as arbitrary and an attack on the rule of law. The judges, who handled thousands of cases, claim they were pressured by the administration on how to rule, particularly to dismiss cases in a way that would make immigrants vulnerable to immediate detention by ICE. They express concern that such actions undermine judicial impartiality and due process amid a growing backlog of nearly four million immigration cases. The union representing immigration judges reports over 100 have been fired, transferred, or retired since the Trump administration began.</p>

          <p>Intel announced second-quarter revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, but its stock fell after the company revealed significant cuts to investments in its foundry division. CEO Lip-Bu Tan stated there would be "no more blank checks," canceling planned factory projects in Europe and slowing construction in Ohio. The company reported a net loss of $2.9 billion for the quarter and is undergoing major restructuring, including a 15% reduction in its workforce. The move signals a strategic shift to rein in costs and align investments more closely with customer demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new Marvel film, “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” features a mid-credits scene that officially introduces the iconic villain Doctor Doom into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The scene depicts a cloaked figure with a distinct green cloak and mask interacting with the son of Reed Richards and Sue Storm, setting up a future conflict. This reveal is highly significant as it directly teases the plot of the upcoming crossover film, “Avengers: Doomsday,” where Robert Downey Jr. is slated to portray the character. The film's post-credits sequence solidifies Doom's role as a major antagonist for the franchise's next phase.</p>

His lawsuit names the former state's attorney, who was later disbarred over the case, and several detectives.

          <p>Germany, France, and the United Kingdom are scheduled to hold talks with Iran in Istanbul to discuss its nuclear program, though prospects for a major breakthrough are considered low. The meeting follows a warning from the European nations that they will reimpose UN sanctions if Tehran does not demonstrate verifiable progress in curbing its nuclear activities. The diplomatic effort aims to revive negotiations and de-escalate tensions after recent U.S.-Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. However, with high levels of distrust, analysts believe the primary goal is to keep the channel for diplomacy open rather than achieve a comprehensive agreement.</p>

Following his record-setting rookie year and strong performance last season, Nacua has become a key player for the team. His potential payday is highlighted by recent massive extensions signed by other young star receivers, such as Garrett Wilson's $90 million guaranteed deal. Currently earning just over $1 million this season, Nacua's continued high-level production could secure him a nine-figure contract, reflecting his rapid rise to NFL stardom.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at making it easier for local governments to remove unhoused individuals from streets and other public areas. The order directs federal agencies to push for the reversal of legal precedents that limit the ability to clear encampments and to redirect funds toward treatment and rehabilitation facilities. It promotes moving people into long-term institutional settings through civil commitment to "restore public order." Critics, however, condemn the measure as a punitive approach that criminalizes homelessness and will ultimately worsen the crisis without addressing its root cause of housing shortages.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes why the full collection of Jeffrey Epstein files was not released during the Biden presidency, despite political pressure and public curiosity. It posits that appearing in the files does not inherently imply wrongdoing and that releasing such sensitive information, particularly secret grand jury testimony, requires exceptional court approval that is rarely granted. The government's standard practice is to protect privacy and ongoing investigations unless charges are filed. Therefore, even if the Biden administration had a political desire to release the documents, it faced significant legal and procedural hurdles, the same ones the Trump administration is now encountering.</p>

The settlement is seen by critics as part of a broader pattern by the administration to pressure institutions, including universities and corporations, that do not align with its demands.

The trial centered on the issue of consent during the incident, which occurred after a Hockey Canada gala. The highly publicized case has drawn significant attention in Canada, and the verdict concludes a years-long legal battle for the five players.</p>
