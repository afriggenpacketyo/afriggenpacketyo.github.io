          <h2>Samsung Forecasts Over 50% Drop in Second-Quarter Profits Amid AI Chip Market Challenges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 20:09:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Samsung Electronics anticipates its second-quarter operating profit will plummet by 56% year-over-year, significantly missing market expectations. The decline is largely attributed to the company's struggle to secure a leading position in the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chip market, which is crucial for artificial intelligence applications. Competitors like SK Hynix have become key suppliers to AI leader Nvidia, while Samsung has faced delays in getting its advanced chips certified, impacting both its memory and foundry businesses.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Texas, which have claimed over 100 lives, were caused by immense rainfall over the July 4th weekend, with some areas like Bertram and Liberty Hill receiving over 20 inches. This deluge caused the Guadalupe River to rise an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes, overwhelming communities. The region's geography, characterized by dry, packed soil, exacerbates flash flood risks by preventing water absorption and promoting rapid runoff. More rain is forecasted, posing a continued threat to the devastated areas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The current U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal for Gaza involves a 60-day truce in exchange for the release of some Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, alongside a surge in humanitarian aid. Israel has agreed to the main tenets, but Hamas is seeking stronger assurances that the temporary ceasefire will lead to a permanent end to the war, a point of contention. The Trump administration is actively involved, with officials engaging in talks in Doha, aiming to resolve differences over the future governance of Gaza and the role of international aid organizations.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have decided against pursuing legal action against the thousands who participated in the city's prohibited Pride parade in late June. Organizers, including Budapest's liberal mayor Gergely Karacsony, had declared the event a municipal function to circumvent a government ban, creating public belief that the march was legal. This decision comes amidst a broader anti-LGBTQ+ agenda from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which had passed laws allowing for such bans to be enacted. Despite the prohibition, the parade saw a record turnout of over 200,000 people.</p>

While the types of storms may differ, California's topography and history of atmospheric rivers create significant potential for devastating floods and debris flows, particularly in low-lying areas. Climate change is increasing these risks by enabling storms to carry more moisture. Although California may have stronger building regulations in floodways, researchers note that many communities and homeless populations remain highly vulnerable to catastrophic inundations.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz is facing criticism after it was revealed he supported cuts to weather forecasting funds in a spending bill just before catastrophic floods devastated his home state of Texas. Cruz reportedly inserted language into a Republican bill that eliminated $150 million from a NOAA fund intended to improve forecasting research and systems. This action, combined with his vacation to Greece during the disaster, has drawn sharp condemnation from critics who argue that defunding these systems makes such disasters more deadly. Cruz has dismissed the complaints as "partisan finger pointing."</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price fell by 6.8% on Monday, erasing $79 billion from the company's market capitalization, as investors reacted to CEO Elon Musk's announcement of a new political party. Analysts suggest shareholders are concerned that Musk's increasing political involvement will serve as a distraction and could create further friction with the White House. The move comes after a period of tension between Musk and President Trump, and investors appear wary of the potential for political blowback to negatively impact Tesla's business operations and brand image.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic suggests that U.S. foreign and defense policy is currently operating in a state of dysfunction, with no one clearly in charge. The article argues that President Trump's interest is episodic, while key cabinet members are either detached or incompetent, leaving critical decisions to lower-level, unelected officials like Undersecretary of Defense Elbridge Colby. This ad-hoc process, where functionaries can drive policy based on personal preference, has led to confusing and contradictory actions, such as halting weapons to Ukraine while striking Iran. This creates a dangerous void in leadership on the world stage.</p>

The House Oversight Committee is investigating Biden's mental fitness, with some Republicans claiming policies may be invalid if he was incapacitated.

          <p>In a report to a United Nations working group, the government of El Salvador has stated that the United States holds exclusive legal responsibility for the more than 200 migrants sent to its CECOT mega-prison. This claim appears to contradict the Trump administration's position that it cannot retrieve the migrants because they are under Salvadoran authority. The migrants were deported under a deal where El Salvador agreed to house alleged gang members.
