          <h2>Tesla Seeks Approval to Launch Robotaxi Service in Phoenix</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 17:23:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla has formally applied to operate its autonomous Robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, aiming to compete directly with Waymo, which has been active in the area since 2020. The move follows a pilot program in Austin, Texas, that has faced some operational challenges and regulatory scrutiny, including minor accidents captured on video. This expansion represents a key step in Tesla's effort to catch up in the autonomous vehicle market, relying on its camera-based system which it claims is more economically viable than competitors' sensor-heavy approaches. The company is expected to provide further updates during its upcoming earnings call.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and recent Columbia University graduate student, has filed a $20 million claim against the Trump administration. The claim alleges he was falsely imprisoned and maliciously prosecuted in an effort to deport him over his pro-Palestinian campus activism. Khalil was detained for 104 days in a Louisiana immigration facility, an experience he describes as harrowing, before a federal judge ordered his release. The Department of Homeland Security has called the claim "absurd," while Khalil's deportation case continues separately in the immigration court system.</p>

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in central Gaza has killed at least 15 Palestinians, among them eight children and two women, who were waiting in line for nutritional supplements outside a health clinic. The aid group Project Hope, which runs the clinic, condemned the attack as a blatant violation of international law. The Israeli military stated it was targeting a Hamas operative involved in the October 7th attacks and expressed regret for any harm to civilians, adding that the incident is under review. This tragic event highlights the extreme dangers civilians face while seeking essential aid amid the ongoing conflict and ceasefire negotiations.</p>

          <p>Japan, the only nation to have suffered a nuclear attack, is facing a potential shift in its decades-long identity as a proponent of disarmament, according to an analysis in The Atlantic.

Ironically, the prospect of South Korea developing its own nuclear weapons could be the final push for Japan to reconsider its non-nuclear position due to historical antagonisms.

          <p>Brazil's government is formulating a response to President Trump's surprise decision to impose a 50% tariff on Brazilian exports. Trump justified the hike by citing what he called unfair trade barriers and the political "persecution" of former president Jair Bolsonaro. In response, Brazilian officials are cautiously weighing retaliatory actions permitted under local law, such as suspending U.S. patents or taxing American profits. Analysts suggest the trade dispute could push Brazil, a major economic power, into a closer relationship with China, altering global trade dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Svetlana Dali, who was convicted of stowing away on a Delta flight from New York to Paris, has been sentenced to time served and one year of supervised release. During her sentencing, Dali told the judge she illegally boarded the plane to escape the U.S. because she believed the military had poisoned her. The judge acknowledged Dali's difficult life but emphasized the need for deterrence, as stowaways pose a danger to air travel safety. The supervised release is intended to help her receive mental health treatment, though she still faces separate charges in Connecticut for another airport security breach.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are currently on a six-game losing streak, sparking concerns about the team's vulnerabilities as the trade deadline approaches. The slump, characterized by a struggling offense and a worn-down pitching staff, is reminiscent of a similar dip the team experienced this time last year. While manager Dave Roberts has downplayed alarm, the absence of key injured players and the poor performance of superstars have exposed potential weaknesses. The front office now faces decisions on whether to acquire reinforcements, particularly for the bullpen and potentially another bat, to ensure the team is prepared for a deep postseason run.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new record high on Thursday, climbing above $113,000 just a day after setting its previous record.

The positive momentum also extended to other cryptocurrencies, with altcoins like Ether and Solana seeing gains. This climb follows a period of consolidation and comes amid continued institutional buying and optimism about potential crypto-related legislation in Congress. (not investment advice)</p>
