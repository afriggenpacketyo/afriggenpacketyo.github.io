          <p>President Trump stated his priority is a "real end" to Iran's nuclear program, demanding Tehran abandon it entirely, rather than focusing solely on a ceasefire with Israel. Speaking on Air Force One, Trump dismissed French President Macron's suggestion that he left the G7 summit to work on a ceasefire, asserting the issue is "much bigger." He predicted Israel would continue its attacks on Iran and emphasized the importance of ensuring the safety of people in Tehran. Trump denied considering peace talks with Iran, stating they should have accepted the previous deal, and warned against any threats to U.S. troops. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an order confirming parts of a trade agreement between the UK and US, reducing tariffs on UK cars shipped to the US, but maintaining a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars. The agreement allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier in the year. The order also said the US would set up a similar system for steel and aluminium, but did not specify what it would be, though the UK government said it would "continue to go further and make progress towards 0% tariffs on core steel products as agreed". The deal will come into effect seven days following its official publication.</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court has rejected an attempt to revive the copyright trial over Ed Sheeran's hit song "Thinking Out Loud," ending a decade-long legal battle. Structured Asset Sales (SAS) claimed Sheeran's song copied Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On," but the court sided with previous rulings in Sheeran's favor. Amy Wadge, co-writer of "Thinking Out Loud," expressed immense relief, stating the trials had "haunted" her for 10 years. The legal dispute began in 2016, with Townsend's family seeking $100m in damages, but Sheeran's team successfully argued that the shared chord pattern was a common element in pop music.</p>

          <p>An article in The Guardian argues that the US immigration system is a "scam" that dehumanizes people for profit, stemming from xenophobia, racism, and corporate greed. The author contends that closed borders, combined with free trade agreements, benefit multinational corporations by creating a vulnerable workforce. NAFTA and the IIRIRA are cited as examples of policies that trap Mexican workers and give artificial negotiating advantages to corporations. The piece concludes that the immigration system divides communities, hurts workers, and subjects people to state violence, while taxpayers subsidize the companies profiting from it.</p>

Key strategies include rebooking online while in line, calling customer service hotlines in other languages, and seeking assistance at airport lounges.

Booking early-morning flights and direct routes can minimize the risk of disruptions, while maintaining a polite demeanor with customer service representatives can improve the chances of receiving refunds or flight credits.</p>

Critics argue this approach prioritizes efficiency over human expression, potentially disenfranchising artists and cheapening creativity.

          <p>Al-Hilal's chief executive stated that a loan move for Cristiano Ronaldo before the Club World Cup would have been "completely counter-intuitive" because he plays for their "biggest opponent," Al-Nassr. Despite FIFA introducing an additional transfer window, the CEO explained that signing Ronaldo, who is out of contract at Al-Nassr at the end of June, for only a few weeks would not be strategic. He added that while he respects Ronaldo, bringing the biggest player from their rival team for such a short period didn't make sense. The club is still looking to reinforce the team in the traditional transfer window after the tournament.</p>

This agreement comes after the government intervened to prevent the closure of the plant's blast furnaces, highlighting the importance of domestic steel production.
