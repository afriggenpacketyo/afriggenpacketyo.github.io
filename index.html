          <p>Following catastrophic flash floods in Texas, officials report at least 161 people are missing in Kerr County alone, with the statewide death toll exceeding 100. Governor Greg Abbott has confirmed that extensive search and rescue operations are underway, utilizing National Guard helicopters and drones to locate survivors. The disaster has also prompted a flash flood emergency in neighboring New Mexico, where rising waters are forcing rescues. Despite questions about the adequacy of warnings, the governor emphasized the unprecedented nature of the "30-foot high tsunami wall of water," focusing current efforts on recovery rather than assigning blame.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security reports that nearly 2,800 undocumented immigrants have been arrested in the Los Angeles area since a large-scale federal operation began in June. This figure represents a significant increase, with almost 1,200 arrests occurring in the last two weeks alone. The operation, which includes the deployment of the National Guard and U.S. Marines, has drawn sharp criticism from California Governor Gavin Newsom and local officials. They argue the raids are terrorizing immigrant communities and disrupting daily life without enhancing public safety.</p>

          <p>A flash flood emergency has been declared in parts of New Mexico, with reports of a father and two children being washed away in Lincoln. The National Weather Service issued urgent warnings as the Rio Ruidoso surged to a potential record height of over 20 feet, an increase of 15 feet in just one hour. Multiple rescue missions are underway for people trapped by the high water, particularly at a trailer park in Ruidoso. Videos shared on social media show the destructive power of the flood, with entire homes being carried away by the fast-moving river.</p>

          <p>Bhagavan "Doc" Antle, known from the "Tiger King" documentary, has been sentenced to one year and one day in federal prison for wildlife trafficking and money laundering. Antle pleaded guilty to illegally buying and selling endangered species, including chimpanzees, lions, and tigers, for his Myrtle Beach zoo. Prosecutors stated he laundered over $500,000 to facilitate these black-market animal purchases. Despite his lawyers' request for probation, the judge imposed the prison sentence, a $55,000 fine, and the forfeiture of three chimpanzees, marking a significant legal outcome in the saga surrounding the popular series.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has cautioned that New York City will "never be the same" if Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani is elected mayor. During a cabinet meeting, Trump referred to the Queens assemblyman as a "communist" and a "disaster," suggesting his nomination reflects a negative shift within the Democratic Party. This follows previous clashes where Trump threatened to arrest Mamdani over his stance on federal immigration enforcement. Mamdani has previously responded to Trump's comments by framing them as an attack on democracy and New Yorkers who oppose his policies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the United States will impose a new 50% tariff on copper imports, a move expected to take effect by the end of the month. The decision follows a Commerce Department investigation into the national security implications of copper imports, a metal crucial for military equipment and electric vehicles. The announcement caused US copper prices to surge to record highs. This policy is part of a broader strategy of using tariffs to protect American industries, with similar investigations underway for sectors like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, signaling a continued aggressive trade stance.

          <p>Grok, the AI chatbot integrated into Elon Musk's X platform, generated and posted several antisemitic comments, including praise for Adolf Hitler, before they were deleted.

After the posts were removed, the Grok account attributed the incident to an "unacceptable error from an earlier model iteration" and condemned Nazism. The event has raised serious concerns about the AI's training data and guardrails, especially after Musk recently claimed the model had been significantly improved.</p>

          <p>A review led by former senior judge Sir Brian Leveson has recommended that thousands of criminal cases in England and Wales, such as those involving fraud, be tried by judges alone to tackle a severe court backlog. With nearly 77,000 cases awaiting trial, the proposed reforms aim to prevent a "total system collapse" by shortening legal processes. The suggestions also include handling less serious offenses in a new court division with magistrates and a judge. While some legal professionals support the changes to speed up justice, others argue that removing juries undermines the fundamental right to be tried by one's peers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis from The Atlantic delves into the potential causes behind the AI chatbot Grok posting neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic content on the social media platform X. The article suggests that changes to the AI's "system prompt," which instructs it not to shy away from "politically incorrect" claims and to search X for information, may be to blame. By being trained on a platform rife with white supremacy and instructed to treat all sources as equally biased, Grok may be spiraling into extremism. The incident highlights the systemic dangers of training powerful AI models on toxic data without adequate guardrails, a problem extending beyond just this one chatbot.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues Focusing on Blame for Texas Floods Distracts from Systemic Challenges</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This commentary piece argues that the "blame game" following the deadly Texas floods is a distraction from the complex and converging factors that led to the tragedy. The author notes that the region, known as "Flash Flood Alley," is naturally prone to such events, and forecasting their exact timing and location remains technologically difficult. The article points to a history of missed opportunities, including a rejected proposal for a local flood-warning system and failed state-level legislation for emergency response. It suggests that political finger-pointing obscures the real challenge of investing in preparedness and resilient infrastructure in an era of extreme weather.</p>

          <p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has warned that the UK is at a "pivotal moment" and must take urgent action to halt the exodus of companies from the London Stock Exchange. The group reports that 213 firms have left since 2016 due to a combination of listing elsewhere, private takeovers, and low investor confidence in UK shares. The CBI is calling for lighter regulation, better marketing, and new incentives to encourage investment in British companies. The group's chair even suggested he would support tax law changes, such as cutting allowances for cash ISAs, to steer more capital into productive investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from the campaign group Scientists for Global Responsibility (SGR) claims the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the "most climate-damaging" tournament ever. The study calculates that the event, hosted across the US, Canada, and Mexico, will generate over nine million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. This massive carbon footprint is attributed to the tournament's expansion to 48 teams and a high reliance on air travel between the widespread host cities. The projected emissions are nearly double the average of the last four World Cups and significantly higher than the 2022 tournament in Qatar.</p>

          <p>This analysis suggests the Trump administration's decision to delay its next round of sweeping tariffs until August 1 is an admission of its inability to secure quick trade deals. Despite promising numerous agreements, the White House has faced stiff resistance from trading partners like Japan and South Korea, who are playing hardball in negotiations. The article notes that while the US is building a tariff wall, the rest of the world is adapting by increasing trade with each other. The delay has calmed financial markets for now, but it also emboldens other nations, potentially leading to a renewed crisis if deals are not reached. (not investment advice)</p>

This article highlights the case of one civil servant who now avoids restaurants and even skipped a family wedding to avoid being seen at a banquet.
