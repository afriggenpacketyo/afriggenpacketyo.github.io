          <p>Spirit Airlines is making significant strides in its revitalization efforts, securing up to $475 million in debtor-in-possession financing from debtholders and an additional $150 million from an aircraft lessor, pending court approval. The budget airline filed for its second Chapter 11 bankruptcy within a year due to high costs and weak demand, leading to over $250 million in losses since its last emergence. The carrier plans to cut 40 routes, furlough a third of flight attendants, and reject leases on 27 Airbus aircraft, while competitors aim to capture its customer base. CEO Dave Davis expressed gratitude for stakeholder support in building a stronger Spirit.</p>

          <p>The Senate rejected both Republican and Democratic stopgap funding measures, making a government shutdown at midnight Wednesday almost certain. The Republican-backed seven-week bill failed 55-45, as Democrats sought health care provisions. The Democratic bill, including health care, also failed 47-53. President Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi placed blame on Democrats, with Trump falsely claiming they insist on health care for immigrants without legal status. Bondi informed Justice Department staff of potential furloughs and curtailed activities due to the funding lapse.</p>

          <p>Venice, Illinois, a town that lost two-thirds of its population and essential services after steel and manufacturing jobs disappeared, is experiencing a revitalization. Led by retired superintendent Ed Hightower, the community is building a new grocery store, medical clinic, and affordable housing, funded by a $2.4 million state grant and Hightower's personal $3.5 million investment. A new school has already been completed, offering hope for residents like Alexis Williams, whose daughter now attends. This initiative is seen as a model for other small towns aiming for community-driven change and economic recovery.</p>

          <p>Federal agents with Homeland Security Investigations have uncovered an additional 200,000 SIM cards in New Jersey, following the U.S. Secret Service's discovery of a vast telecommunications network in the Tri-State area. This network, believed to be linked to Chinese actors and used by organized crime and human trafficking rings, could have severely disrupted New York's telecom systems and threatened the UN General Assembly meetings. The initial seizure included 300 SIM servers and over 100,000 SIM cards, capable of sending millions of texts per minute and disabling cell towers. No arrests have been made as the forensic analysis continues.</p>

          <p>A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing witnessed a heated confrontation between Senator Josh Hawley and former Biden official Gregory Jackson Jr. Hawley questioned Jackson, formerly of the Office of Gun Violence Prevention, about a report advocating for "two spirit" safe spaces and defunding police, which Jackson admitted he was not fully aware of the terminology. Jackson, a shooting survivor, accused Hawley of opposing violence reduction, while Hawley criticized Jackson's policies as "absurd" and a denial of his own words.

          <p>While a looming U.S. government shutdown is unlikely to halt conventional mortgage processing, it could cause minor delays for borrowers seeking government-backed loans. Agencies like the FHA and VA will continue to guarantee loans, but furloughs may slow processing. The USDA, however, will halt new direct and guaranteed home loan issuances. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, though federally sponsored, could face bottlenecks if the IRS, vital for tax verifications, shuts down. Additionally, securing flood insurance through FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program could be complicated, potentially delaying closings for homes in flood zones.</p>

          <p>A government shutdown would still require student loan borrowers to make repayments, according to the U.S. Department of Education, despite most of its employees being furloughed. This could make it difficult for borrowers to resolve issues with their servicers. While federal aid like Pell Grants and Direct Student Loans are expected to be disbursed due to mandatory funding, new grants would halt. Students applying for aid via FAFSA should not expect delays, as the process opened early and uses permanent appropriations. However, some veterans' GI Bill benefits could face delays if the shutdown is prolonged.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government is on the brink of a shutdown as lawmakers failed to agree on extending funding by the October 1 deadline. The impasse stems from Democrats' insistence on including health insurance subsidies, set to expire, in any funding measure, while Republicans demand a "clean" temporary extension. With 53 Senate Republicans needing 60 votes to pass legislation, Democratic support is crucial. This stalemate, following a failed meeting between President Trump and congressional leaders, will furlough hundreds of thousands of federal workers and halt non-essential functions, with potential economic costs similar to past shutdowns.</p>

Israel would maintain security control around Gaza.

          <p>A wealthy coastal community in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, is experiencing ongoing land instability as parts of several backyards crumbled towards the ocean. This event, though unrelated to the larger Portuguese Bend Landslide Complex, highlights the continuous land movement in the area, which has accelerated after years of heavy rains. The region sits on an ancient landslide complex that destroyed 140 homes in 1956. While no structural damage to homes or injuries were reported in the latest incident, residents frequently face intermittent gas and electricity cuts due to the persistent geological activity.</p>

          <p>Mexico's National Autonomous University (UNAM) has canceled or moved online over half its department classes due to heightened security concerns. This follows the recent killing of a 16-year-old student at a feeder school and threats against female professors, some linked to "incel" ideology. Authorities have a suspect in custody for the killing. UNAM's rector committed to strengthening security and emotional support, while President Claudia Sheinbaum proposed "safe spaces" for reporting harassment.

          <p>A recent Supreme Court order, decided along partisan lines, has potentially granted President Trump the power to "impound" funds, effectively canceling $4 billion in foreign aid despite congressional appropriation. This decision, which legal experts largely consider unconstitutional, interprets the Impoundment Control Act in a way explicitly forbidden by its text, according to Justice Elena Kagan's dissent. The timing is critical as the federal government faces a shutdown; the ruling suggests Trump might not honor spending agreements made to reopen the government, making bipartisan compromise exceedingly difficult. This could lead to a prolonged period of extraordinary dysfunction.</p>

          <p>Lithium Americas shares surged over 35% after U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced the government would take a 5% equity stake in the company and its Thacker Pass project in Nevada. This move aims to boost North American lithium production, with Thacker Pass expected to become one of the continent's largest sources, commencing operations in late 2027. General Motors also holds a minority stake. This represents the White House's latest effort to secure the mineral supply chain critical to U.S. interests, marking the first such stake in a Canadian-domiciled company, as the government seeks to ensure domestic lithium mining and refining.

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed hundreds of military leaders, delivering a highly critical speech that dismissed diversity initiatives, facial hair accommodations, and systems for accountability as "woke." He vowed to transform the military into a "War Department" with stricter fitness standards, no shaving waivers, and less adherence to "stupid rules of engagement." Hegseth's remarks, which followed his book "The War on Warriors," were seen as a blatant effort to align the military with a MAGA agenda. Officers were reportedly uncomfortable with the overtly partisan nature and the secretary's warning that dissenters should resign.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 288, significantly expanding the state's power over workplace disputes and union elections. This legislation allows the California Public Employment Relations Board to intervene when the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) fails to act, particularly after the Trump administration hampered the federal agency by firing a board member and proposing budget cuts. The law aims to safeguard private employees' rights to unionize, creating an enforcement fund from civil penalties. While the California Chamber of Commerce opposes it, legal experts suggest it revives a system similar to the NLRB's early decades, ensuring worker protections amidst federal inaction.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The impending federal government shutdown is largely driven by a dispute over Affordable Care Act (ACA) enhanced premium tax credits, specifically regarding eligibility for immigrants. Republicans, including President Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson, falsely claim Democrats seek to provide health care to "illegal immigrants." Democrats clarify they aim to restore coverage options for "lawfully present" immigrants, which were eliminated by Trump's tax bill, and to extend subsidies for millions of Americans. These enhanced credits, set to expire at year-end, significantly lower health insurance premiums, and their extension is a red line for Democrats in funding negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premiums for Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace health plans are projected to more than double in 2026 if enhanced subsidies expire as scheduled at year-end, according to a KFF analysis. These subsidies, which make health insurance cheaper for 22 million enrollees, are a central point of contention in the current government shutdown stalemate. If they end, average premiums would surge 114%, from $888 to $1,906. The Trump administration's changes to tax credit calculations and insurers' proposed 18% rate hikes would further compound costs. For example, a 60-year-old couple earning $85,000 could see their yearly payments rise by over $22,600. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the finalization of this code has been delayed within the UN agency, primarily because of growing environmental concerns.
