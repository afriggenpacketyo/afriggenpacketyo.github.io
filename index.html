          <p>The Supreme Court addressed the extent of presidential authority over federal agencies, ruling that while President Trump could fire members of certain federal boards, the Federal Reserve board members have greater protection against presidential removal. The court's decision clarifies the boundaries of executive power in relation to independent agencies. The justices suggested the Federal Reserve's unique structure affords its members more job security. This ruling comes after challenges to Trump's firing of Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris from other federal agencies' boards, with implications for the independence of various regulatory bodies.</p>

          <p>Gas prices are projected to be the cheapest since 2021 for the upcoming Memorial Day weekend, averaging $3.08 per gallon, which is significantly lower than last year. This decline is attributed to economic uncertainty and increased oil production, with some analysts predicting prices could drop below $3 a gallon later in the summer. While gas prices are down, other vacation-related expenses are expected to increase, potentially offsetting savings at the pump. The article also lists the states with the highest and lowest average gas prices.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the National Institutes of Health have developed blood and urine tests capable of detecting the amount of ultraprocessed foods a person consumes. By utilizing machine learning, scientists identified metabolites correlated with processed food intake, creating a biomarker score to predict ultraprocessed food consumption. The tests could reduce errors associated with self-reported dietary questionnaires, providing objective biomarkers for future studies linking processed foods to chronic diseases. While the new method requires further validation across various age groups and diets, researchers suggest using Nutrition Facts labels to limit intake of added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is set to host a gala for top holders of his cryptocurrency token, despite the fact that nearly half of the attendees have suffered financial losses from purchasing it. The event, a meme coin competition prize, has drawn criticism as many attendees profited from the coin's initial hype before selling. Experts raise ethical concerns about potential pay-to-play policymaking, given that some attendees have strategic policy incentives or have faced regulatory scrutiny. The event coincides with an easing of financial regulation regarding meme coins, raising questions about investor protection.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-to-4 decision, rejected a plan to allow Oklahoma to use public funds for a Catholic charter school, as Justice Barrett recused herself from the case. The tie upholds a previous ruling by the Oklahoma Supreme Court, preventing the establishment of St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, which aimed to integrate Catholic teachings into its curriculum. This decision sets no national precedent regarding the constitutionality of states sponsoring religious charter schools, and the issue is likely to return to the court in the future. The case sparked debate over the role of religion in public education and the definition of charter schools as public or private entities.</p>

He emphasizes that the forces driving populism are mainly about immigration, cultural values, and distrust in institutions, rather than purely economic factors, and concludes that the economic policies of the past 30 years have been largely successful.</p>

While the findings are not statistically significant for men, women treated with GLP-1s had a notably lower risk of obesity-related cancer and all-cause mortality, prompting researchers to call for further investigation.</p>

          <p>The UN reports that 90 lorry loads of humanitarian aid have been collected inside the Gaza Strip, following a three-day delay at the Kerem Shalom crossing. The aid includes flour, baby food, and medical equipment, and bakeries have begun producing bread. The UN states that this amount is insufficient to meet the vast needs in Gaza, where acute levels of hunger and significant shortages persist. Concerns about security along the access route have contributed to delays, and the UN and other agencies have rejected a US-Israeli aid plan, citing humanitarian principles.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing an amendment to a domestic policy bill that would create $1,000 "Trump accounts" for newborns, aimed at kickstarting wealth creation. These accounts, managed by banks or investment firms, would be invested in the stock market and could be used for specific expenses like education or a down payment on a home. While families could contribute up to $5,000 annually, some experts are questioning the accounts' tax benefits and whether the initial government contribution will be sufficient for long-term goals. Concerns also exist regarding tax penalties for low-income families needing to withdraw funds for unapproved expenses.</p>
