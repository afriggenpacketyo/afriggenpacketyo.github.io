          <p>Alphabet executives anticipate a slight headwind to their advertising business in 2025, primarily from the Asia-Pacific region, due to changes in de minimis exemptions impacting retail. This comes amid broader concerns about the potential economic impact of new trade policies, particularly tariffs, on business spending. While Alphabet CFO Anat Ashkenazi confirmed plans to spend $75 billion in capital expenditures in 2025, the company remains focused on driving efficiency and productivity, including potential cost-cutting measures, to navigate uncertain economic times.

The attack comes after weeks of peace negotiations appeared to be culminating without an agreement in sight and hours after President Trump criticized Zelenskyy for prolonging the conflict.

The extent of the impact depends on the duration of the tariff levels and the ability of companies to shift sourcing, with close monitoring of port container volumes in the coming months to assess the health of the supply chain.</p>
