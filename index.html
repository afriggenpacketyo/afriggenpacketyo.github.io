          <p>Former Arizona Cardinals kicker Jay Feely, now a CBS analyst, is reportedly considering a run for Congress in Arizona's 5th district.  The seat will be open next year, and Feely's connections to Republican leaders and President Trump could aid his campaign.  His potential candidacy highlights the increasing trend of former athletes entering politics.  The district's Republican lean could favor Feely.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced new tariffs, dubbed "Liberation Day," despite warnings from economists about potential price increases for consumers.  The tariffs are expected to affect nearly all U.S. trading partners, potentially impacting various industries.  While supporters believe this will boost domestic manufacturing, critics fear it could trigger a trade war and harm economic growth.  The announcement caused immediate market volatility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments on South Carolina's attempt to block Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood, even for non-abortion services.  This action, stemming from a 2018 executive order, aims to effectively "defund" Planned Parenthood due to its abortion services, despite federal law already restricting Medicaid abortion coverage.  The case could impact access to reproductive healthcare for millions and set a precedent for similar actions in other states.  A ruling against Planned Parenthood could significantly limit healthcare access for low-income individuals.</p>

          <h2>Analyzing the Effectiveness of Tariff Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-02 06:30:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While President Trump's tariff policies have been criticized for their breadth and lack of clear rationale, tariffs can be effective tools for promoting industrial development when implemented strategically and complemented by other policies.  Targeted tariffs can protect domestic industries from unfair competition, such as heavily subsidized foreign steel or products from countries with exploitative labor practices.  However, Trump's approach is flawed due to its broad scope and lack of accompanying investment strategies.  Effective tariff policies require specific objectives and complementary measures to support targeted industries.</p>

          <p>A survey reveals that over half of the UK's butterfly species are experiencing long-term population declines, with 2024 marking the fifth-worst year on record.  Thirty-one of 59 species have seen their numbers fall since 1976, attributed to habitat destruction, pesticide use, and climate change impacts.  The decline highlights broader environmental problems, as butterflies serve as key indicators of ecosystem health.

          <p>California's snowpack reached 96% of average on April 1, marking the third consecutive year of ample water supplies—a phenomenon unseen in 25 years.  This follows extremely wet years in 2023 and 2024, offering relief from the severe drought of 2020-2022.  The abundant snowpack and reservoir levels have led to increased water allocations for both state and federal projects.  However, officials caution that this doesn't guarantee future water security, given the increasing intensity of droughts due to climate change.</p>

          <p>Le Petit Four, a long-standing West Hollywood bistro, closed after 44 years due to declining foot traffic and increased costs.  The closure is part of a larger trend of businesses shutting down on the Sunset Strip.  Despite a late surge in support, including a GoFundMe campaign, the restaurant was unable to overcome financial challenges, including back rent.  West Hollywood is launching an initiative to boost midweek sales for local businesses in an effort to revitalize the area.</p>

          <p>New blood and spinal fluid tests for Alzheimer's disease focus on detecting memory impairment, rather than solely on amyloid plaques.  A new blood test measures a specific region of the tau protein, a key indicator of neuronal damage and memory loss.  A spinal fluid test measures a ratio of proteins involved in synapse regulation, predicting cognitive decline years before diagnosis.  These tests could help doctors identify patients who will benefit from amyloid-clearing drugs and improve treatment strategies.</p>
