        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A lawsuit has been filed against the Trump administration, alleging a "systemic pattern" of targeting individuals with "brown skin" in Southern California for arrests and deportations without probable cause. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and Public Counsel, claim detainees are held in "dungeon-like" facilities lacking basic necessities. The Department of Homeland Security denies these allegations, asserting that law enforcement does not target individuals based on skin color and that detention centers meet high standards. The lawsuit seeks to halt these operations, which attorneys say have led to over 1,500 detentions.</p>

          <p>Seven people remain "unaccounted for" following multiple explosions and a fire at the Devastating Pyrotechnics fireworks warehouse in Esparto, Yolo County, Northern California. The incident, which occurred Tuesday evening, prompted mandatory evacuations and spread into 80 acres of grass fires, impacting nearby communities. Two people were injured, and families are desperately seeking contact with missing loved ones, including an 18-year-old on his first day of work. Authorities are actively investigating the cause, with Cal Fire leading the probe into the licensed fireworks facility and its past safety checks.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has ruled against the Trump administration's policy that denied entry to individuals seeking asylum at the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss stated that the President lacks the constitutional or federal immigration law authority to implement such a ban, which was enacted on Trump's first day in office. Immigrant rights groups, who filed the lawsuit, argued the proclamation endangered thousands fleeing persecution. This significant decision reaffirms the 1980 U.S. asylum law, preventing the executive branch from unilaterally altering the established immigration system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate's version of the "one big, beautiful bill" includes a 1% tax on international cash transfers, known as a remittance tax, aiming to discourage illegal immigration. This measure, which would also apply to U.S. citizens sending cash abroad, is projected to generate $10 billion in revenue. Proponents argue it makes sending money home harder for undocumented immigrants, potentially incentivizing self-deportation. However, critics suggest it could backfire by worsening economic conditions in recipient countries like Honduras and El Salvador, potentially spurring more migration. The bill is currently under consideration in the House of Representatives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservationists are raising alarms about the endangered Southern Resident killer whales in Washington's Puget Sound, whose population has dwindled to just 73 due to a crashing Chinook salmon food source.

Key evidence included Baker's DNA at the scene, surveillance footage, and Monica's alleged attempts to establish an alibi and monitor home cameras. Despite Baker's later claim that Monica was unaware of his plans, the jury ultimately believed the prosecution's case, leading to her life sentence.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon's chief spokesperson, Sean Parnell, stated that intelligence assessments suggest U.S. strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities last month have set back Iran's nuclear program by approximately one to two years. While Parnell's estimate is more measured than President Trump's claim of "obliterated" sites, he affirmed significant degradation. The assessment, based on evolving intelligence, suggests centrifuges at Fordow were destroyed, even if the facility itself remained. Iran has since suspended cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog, a move the U.S. calls "unacceptable," further complicating verification of the damage and its implications.</p>

          <p>British tennis star Emma Raducanu has delivered a "statement" performance at Wimbledon, outclassing 2023 champion Marketa Vondrousova to reach the last 32 for the third time. The 22-year-old, ranked 40th, expressed pride in her assured play, setting up a blockbuster third-round clash against world number one Aryna Sabalenka. Despite recent personal news and ongoing back spasms, Raducanu's athleticism and aggressive game, honed with coach Mark Petchey, are flourishing on the grass courts, and she feels "at home" in the tournament environment.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that the Sun Belt housing market, once a refuge from high coastal prices, is beginning to resemble California's crisis, challenging conventional housing wisdom. Over the past decade, median home prices in cities like Phoenix and Miami have surged by over 130%, outpacing traditional expensive markets. Experts attribute this to restrictive zoning laws and the limits of urban sprawl, exacerbated by NIMBYism—the opposition to new development driven by economic and aesthetic concerns. While California has seen some environmental law reforms, Sun Belt cities are urged to enact proactive housing and zoning policy changes to avoid a similar fate.</p>
