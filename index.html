            <p>Former President Trump stated that the U.S. would cease brokering peace talks between Russia and Ukraine if either party proves difficult to negotiate with, a comment that came after Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned of abandoning talks if progress isn't made quickly. Despite initial confidence, attempts at a ceasefire have yet to materialize, with both sides blamed for the lack of progress. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov acknowledged the difficulty of negotiations, while U.S. Vice-President JD Vance expressed optimism about ending the war. Simultaneously, the U.S. and Ukraine are progressing toward a minerals deal, aiming to establish an investment fund for Ukraine's reconstruction. </p>

            <p>A Somali short film titled "Clan Vengeance," which warns against the futility of clan revenge killings, has tragically mirrored reality after one of its actors, Guudey Mohamed Geedi, was shot dead in a clan-related feud. Geedi, who played a role trying to prevent a killing in the film, became a victim of the very violence the film sought to condemn. The film, which has gone viral, highlights the devastating consequences of long-standing clan rivalries in Somalia, often stemming from competition for resources or minor disputes. The director hopes the film will raise awareness about the human cost of clan violence and promote peace within Somali communities.</p>

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has granted clemency to 25 felons, including Sithy Bin, a Cambodian immigrant facing deportation. Bin, a former gang member sentenced in 2008 for a shooting, became a minister in prison and demonstrated significant rehabilitation. Newsom's pardon aims to prevent Bin's deportation to Cambodia, a country he left as a toddler. The governor also posthumously pardoned Sgt. Richard Allen Penry, a Vietnam War veteran and Medal of Honor recipient, whose later crimes were attributed to service-related PTSD.</p>

            <p>A divided panel of judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily halted a lower court's investigation into whether the Trump administration engaged in criminal contempt by defying an order to halt deportation flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador. The appeals court's order does not rule on the merits of the inquiry but provides a deadline for the petitioners to file their reply to the government. The original inquiry stemmed from a District Court judge's finding of probable cause that the Trump administration acted in contempt of court by defying his order to return the deportation flights.</p>

            <p>The US bond market has experienced unusual volatility, with government bond yields rising sharply as investors lose confidence in the US economy due to uncertainty surrounding trade tariffs. This volatility can affect ordinary Americans through higher interest rates on mortgages, credit cards, and car loans, potentially hindering economic growth and job creation. Small businesses are particularly vulnerable to changes in borrowing rates. The bond market's reaction prompted President Trump to pause higher tariffs on most countries except China, demonstrating the market's influence on policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

Kennedy, comprising roughly 10,000 pages of previously classified documents.

The ruling provides clarity on the interpretation of the Equality Act, stating that biological males who identify as women cannot use women-only spaces. While some women's groups celebrate the ruling for protecting privacy and safety, trans rights groups express concern about exclusion and potential discrimination.

            <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated the U.S. may cease efforts to broker a Russia-Ukraine peace deal if no progress is made soon, stating "It's not our war." His comments contrast with the Biden administration's stance and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's warnings about Putin's expansionist goals. The U.S. and Ukraine are nearing a deal for U.S. access to Ukraine's mineral resources, intertwined with Trump's peace push. Despite U.S. impatience, Rubio called recent talks constructive, with European negotiators proving helpful. The Kremlin acknowledges ongoing negotiations, but no direct talks between Trump and Putin are scheduled.</p>

            <p>Trump White House border czar Tom Homan defended the administration's deportation of Kilmer Abrego Garcia, alleging he is an MS-13 member and a public safety threat. Homan dismissed responsibility for Garcia's status and claimed the administration does not have the authority to bring him back to the U.S. He criticized Senator Chris Van Hollen's visit to El Salvador, accusing him of inaction on border concerns. Van Hollen's office stated the trip was to conduct oversight of U.S. foreign assistance programs and follow up on a constituent's case.</p>

            <p>President Trump is considering removing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, according to National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett. Trump has criticized Powell's performance and the Fed's interest rate policies, stating his "termination cannot come fast enough." Legal experts note that the Fed chair is an independent role, and a Supreme Court ruling affirmed that board members of independent agencies can only be forced out "for cause." Kevin Warsh is being considered as a potential replacement for Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

While some voters were impressed with Liberal leader Mark Carney's business-like approach, others found Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre to be the clear winner. Concerns about the environment, cost of living, and Canada's sovereignty were key issues for voters. Overall, the debate was described as civil and useful, but some hoped for more concrete discussions on climate policy.</p>

The page also questions the efficacy of social distancing, masking, and lockdowns.

Concerns persist about under-representation from various groups, including those from working-class backgrounds, in higher awards.
