        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, driven by investors seeking refuge from the U.S. markets following President Trump's trade policies, with institutional investors being the primary drivers. The shift was prompted by concerns over Trump's tariffs and their potential impact on the U.S. economy, leading investors to diversify into perceived safe-haven assets like Japanese stocks and bonds. While the U.S. has since softened its trade stance, the initial surge into Japanese assets highlights the sensitivity of global markets to trade policy uncertainties. The article suggests that while confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, the long-term impact on Japanese markets remains to be seen. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Georgia hospital is under scrutiny after a brain-dead pregnant woman was kept on life support for three months due to the state's abortion ban, as the family says they were told that this was required under the law. The woman, Adriana Smith, was declared brain-dead in February but is being kept alive to allow the fetus to develop, sparking ethical and legal debates about patient rights and fetal personhood. The family is upset that Georgia's law that restricts abortion once cardiac activity is detected doesn't allow relatives to have a say in whether a pregnant woman is kept on life support. Bioethicists note that Georgia law does not explicitly require continued life support in such cases, raising questions about the hospital's interpretation and application of the abortion ban.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article discusses the potential for a far-right candidate, George Simion, to win the upcoming presidential runoff election in Romania, which would give him power to appoint a prime minister and direct foreign policy. The rise of the far-right is attributed to decades of economic failure, chronic underdevelopment, and mass emigration, fueling anti-establishment anger. Despite respectable growth numbers, Romania consistently performs poorly on social indicators, with a significant portion of the population at risk of poverty. The article critiques the mainstream parties for failing to address the broken economic model and notes that Simion's economic policies cater to the domestic business class while offering limited benefits to the poor.

          <p>The Japanese parliament has enacted a law to allow preemptive acts of cyberdefense, enabling the government to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers in the event of an attack. The "active cyberdefense" law mandates operators of key infrastructure to report cyber breaches, with police initially handling server neutralization and the Self-Defense Forces intervening in sophisticated incidents. This move aims to enhance Japan's cybersecurity capabilities to match those of the United States and major European nations. An independent panel will oversee data acquisition and server neutralization to ensure proper government surveillance and protect personal rights. (article)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp fall in exports. The contraction exceeded economists' expectations, with exports dropping by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, offsetting the positive impact of domestic demand, which grew by 0.6%. Uncertainties surrounding U.S. trade policies are cited as a contributing factor to the export decline. Despite the contraction, Japan's GDP expanded by 1.7% year-on-year, the largest expansion since the first quarter of 2023. (article)</p>

The case highlights the enforcement of civil fines under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which has historically been rarely enforced. The woman's attorney argues that her client is eligible for residency due to her long-term presence in the U.S. and her U.S. citizen children.

          <p>Europe has been warned that it must reform quickly or become a “shock absorber” of tectonic upheavals in global trade imbalances resulting from the US-China trade war. While the recent easing of tensions between the superpowers has led to a mutual reduction in tariffs, economists caution that Europe must adapt to Washington's efforts to reorder trade. Without deeper political integration and better coordination of fiscal and industrial policies, Europe risks being forced to adjust to the choices of others without shaping the outcomes.

          <p>Australia's most-decorated living soldier, Ben Roberts-Smith, lost an appeal against a landmark defamation judgment which found he committed war crimes. A judge in 2023 ruled that news articles alleging Roberts-Smith murdered four unarmed Afghans were true, but Roberts-Smith argued the judge made legal errors. The civil trial was the first time a court has assessed claims of war crimes by Australian forces, and the appellate court unanimously upheld the original judgment. Roberts-Smith maintains his innocence and plans to appeal the decision to the High Court of Australia. (article)</p>

The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should be able to dictate policy for the entire country through nationwide injunctions.

While the study did not highlight a specific reason for this increase, the country is already grappling with challenges caused by its rapidly ageing population.
