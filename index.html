          <p>Albania is preparing for a crucial parliamentary election that will determine the country's democratic progress and its aspirations for EU integration. Prime Minister Edi Rama and the ruling Socialist Party are vying for a historic fourth term, while a fragmented opposition seeks to challenge their dominance. The election is seen as a pivotal moment for Albania's commitment to fighting corruption and implementing institutional reforms necessary for EU membership. Despite promises from both major parties, concerns remain about the inclusion of candidates under investigation, potentially undermining the justice system. The article highlights the importance of this election in shaping Albania's future and its relationship with the European Union.</p>

          <p>Graham Parsons, a philosophy professor at West Point, resigned after 13 years, citing the academy's shift away from its educational principles due to the Trump administration's policies. Parsons claimed that the academy was eliminating courses, modifying syllabi, and censoring arguments to align with the administration's ideology. He expressed feeling ashamed to be associated with the academy in its current form, criticizing the executive orders and memos that restrict what faculty members can teach. Pete Hegseth responded to Parsons' resignation by saying that he will not be missed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a significant surge in April, primarily driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which compensated for a sharp decline in exports to the United States due to tariffs. While exports to the U.S. plummeted by over 21%, overall exports jumped by 8.1%. This shift indicates a strategic realignment in China's trade relationships, with ASEAN countries like Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand becoming increasingly important destinations for Chinese goods. However, analysts expect trade data to weaken in the coming months.</p>

          <p>The 19th Venice Architecture Biennale is exploring how cities can become resilient to extreme heat caused by climate change. Curator Carlo Ratti emphasizes the need for architecture to harness collective intelligence and adapt building approaches. The biennale highlights the overheating of urban areas due to sealed surfaces and lack of green spaces, and it showcases solutions such as redesigning public spaces and transforming cities into flood-resistant "sponge cities." The German Pavilion features an immersive exhibition to illustrate the future urban climate, urging a global "construction revolution" to address the challenges of climate change.</p>

          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, experienced a nearly 7% decline after its first-quarter earnings fell short of expectations. While revenue increased by 28% year-on-year to $2.24 billion, and profit attributable to shareholders surged 162% to $188 million, these figures missed analysts' estimates. The company attributed the miss to "production fluctuations" that led to lower average selling prices, with expectations of continued impact in the second quarter. However, SMIC's wafer shipments increased, driven by changes in geopolitics and government policies, and capacity utilization reached 89.6%.</p>

          <p>Despite President Donald Trump's tariffs on imported aluminum, the U.S. aluminum sector is struggling to revive due to soaring electricity prices, leading to smelter closures instead of restarts. While tariffs have reshaped global trade flows and increased costs for American consumers, they haven't spurred domestic production. High energy costs in the U.S. put domestic smelters at a disadvantage compared to those in Canada, Norway, and the Middle East, which have access to competitively priced, long-term power contracts. The aluminum tariffs are effectively leading to higher prices for U.S. consumers.</p>

While China's exports to the U.S. have declined, its overall exports have risen, providing confidence in managing trade issues.

          <p>An ex-model, Kaja Sokola, testified in court that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her when she was 16, claiming he "took her soul." Sokola recounted the alleged incident in a Manhattan hotel in 2002, stating that Weinstein ordered her to remove her blouse, touched her inappropriately, and told her to remain silent. Weinstein denies the allegations and is facing a retrial after his conviction was overturned last year. Sokola is also testifying about a separate alleged incident in 2006, where Weinstein is said to have forced oral sex on her.</p>

The article suggests that the U.S., Denmark, and Greenland could apply a model similar to the "Compact of Free Association" agreements used in the Pacific to balance U.S. interests with international stability and avoid conflicts over sovereignty.</p>
