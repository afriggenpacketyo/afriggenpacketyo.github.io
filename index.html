            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen visited Kilmar Abrego Garcia in El Salvador, who was deported due to an administrative error, and reported that Garcia was "traumatized" by his experience at the CECOT prison. Abrego Garcia, who maintains he has committed no crimes, expressed that thoughts of his family helped him persevere through the ordeal. Despite being moved to a better detention center, Garcia remains unable to communicate with the outside world. The Trump administration continues to assert Garcia's alleged ties to MS-13, which Garcia's attorney and family deny, and the legal battle for Garcia's return to the U.S. continues.

            <p>A bin strike in Birmingham, now in its sixth week, has exposed a divide between the city's rich and poor, with waste piling up in densely populated, inner-city areas while wealthier areas remain relatively unaffected. The strike, initiated by Unite union members over pay cuts, has resulted in 22,000 tonnes of uncollected waste. Residents report rat infestations and a lack of civic pride, with some accusing the council of operating a two-tier waste collection system. While the council acknowledges the problems and pledges improvements, the strike continues to highlight the disparity of wealth in Britain's second city.</p>

            <p>California Senators Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff are urging the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to end "welfare checks" following unannounced visits to Los Angeles elementary schools. The senators claim the actions "terrorized" students and undermined public trust, requesting a briefing on the nature, scale, and objectives of the checks. The senators also questioned why DHS did not coordinate with the California Department of Social Services if they believed the children were in danger. (not investment advice)</p>

The US tariffs and China's retaliatory measures are creating challenges for Apple and highlighting the complex interdependence between the two economies. (not investment advice)</p>
