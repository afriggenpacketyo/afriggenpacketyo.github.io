            <p>Former President Joe Biden delivered his first public address since leaving office, focusing on the importance of preserving Social Security and criticizing the current administration's policies without directly naming Donald Trump. Biden assailed the Trump administration for cutting staff at the Social Security Administration and criticized Elon Musk for calling Social Security a 'Ponzi scheme.' He emphasized that Social Security is a 'sacred promise' and touted his administration's efforts to combat Social Security fraud. Biden's appearance comes as Democrats seek to reorganize after losses in the 2024 elections. </p>

            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to check on the well-being of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a constituent who was mistakenly deported and remains detained. Van Hollen requested to meet with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele to secure Abrego Garcia's release, emphasizing that U.S. courts have ordered his safe return. Abrego Garcia was arrested by ICE and deported despite having a 'withholding of removal' protection order. ICE admitted the deportation was an 'administrative error,' but initially did not act to return him, leading to court intervention and a Supreme Court decision requiring the Trump administration to facilitate his return.</p>

            <p>Nvidia expects a $5.5 billion hit due to tightened US export rules to China, requiring licenses for its H20 AI chip, a key product for the region. The restrictions are part of an escalating trade war between the US and China, affecting Nvidia's inventory and purchase commitments. Experts suggest this move could lead to a decoupling of US and China AI semiconductor supply chains, with Chinese customers seeking alternatives. Nvidia's AI chips have been a focus of US export controls, impacting the company's revenue and market strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump White House has reduced permanent press pool access for wire services after a court ordered the Associated Press (AP) to be reinstated. The move expands the pool to include more print journalists, networks, and new media outlets, diluting the influence of wire services like AP, Bloomberg, and Reuters. The decision follows AP's victory in a lawsuit over its exclusion from the press pool after refusing to comply with the president’s Gulf of Mexico name change. The administration claims the new pool makeup reflects the media habits of the American people in 2025.</p>

            <p>President Trump has expressed interest in sending US citizens convicted of violent crimes to foreign prisons, but legal experts believe this would be unconstitutional. They cite numerous constitutional provisions that prevent the president and attorney general from deporting American citizens. The Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment, would likely be violated. Experts suggest a potential loophole could involve targeting naturalized citizens who have committed fraud during their naturalization process, but even this is rare.</p>

            <p>Katy Perry was mocked after going to space aboard Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin rocketship, with critics questioning the value and purpose of space tourism. Despite the mockery, Perry’s decision to go to space is consistent with her personality as a performer who doesn't mind looking silly. Perry's willingness to embrace absurdity contrasts with the more serious and calculated personas of other pop stars. She is a performer who embraces her role as a clown, and this is why she is able to get away with it.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump’s tariff policies are disrupting operations at US ports, particularly those handling goods from China. The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, which handle a significant portion of US containerized cargo, are experiencing disarray and uncertainty. Supply-chain analysts warn of potential rerouting, uneven port utilization, slowed trade, and job losses. As US importers stockpile goods ahead of potential tariffs, the ports face a 'bumpy' ride, with the potential to disrupt global trade networks.</p>

            <p>President Trump signed an executive order directing his health department to collaborate with Congress on revising a law that allows Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices. The order seeks to delay the timeline for small molecule drugs to become eligible for price negotiations, aligning it with the longer wait for biotech drugs. The move benefits pharmaceutical companies, who have lobbied for this change. The order also aims to align Medicare payments for drugs with those of hospitals and standardize patient payment rates across locations.</p>

The author suggests that Trump's actions are based on outdated assumptions about America's industrial strength and global dominance. There are concerns that escalating tariffs could lead to military conflict, reminiscent of the pre-World War II era. The author believes China will not yield to the US on core interests but will prepare for confrontation without seeking it.</p>

            <p>The New Orleans Saints won a trademark case against a man claiming to be a descendant of French royalty, who sought to wrest control of the fleur-de-lis symbol. The US appeals court ruled that Michel J Messier lacked standing to challenge the team's decades-old trademark. Messier argued his family held intellectual property rights due to their royal lineage, but the court found he had no commercial interest in the mark or reasonable belief of damage from its use. The decision affirms the Saints' right to use the fleur-de-lis on football helmets and merchandise.</p>
