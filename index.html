        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alphabet reported second-quarter revenue and earnings that exceeded analyst expectations, driven by strong performance in its Google Cloud and advertising units. The company's overall revenue grew 14% year-over-year, with its cloud business seeing a 32% increase, bolstered by a new partnership with OpenAI. Despite the positive results, Alphabet announced it will raise its capital expenditure forecast for 2025 by $10 billion to $85 billion, signaling a deeper investment in its artificial intelligence infrastructure and talent acquisition to meet growing demand.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter, surpassing economists' expectations and successfully avoiding a technical recession. This growth marked a significant reversal from the 0.2% contraction experienced in the first quarter of the year. The expansion comes as the nation navigates crucial trade negotiations with the United States, with potential tariffs looming over its export-driven economy. The Bank of Korea has maintained its interest rates, prioritizing financial stability despite forecasts of low growth and stable inflation near its 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The power of the American passport has continued to decline, dropping to 10th place in the 2025 Henley Passport Index, a significant fall from its top-ranked position in 2014. The annual ranking measures visa-free access to global destinations, with U.S. passport holders currently able to enter 182 countries without a prior visa, compared to 193 for top-ranked Singapore. The report suggests that the U.S. and U.K. are adopting more restrictive entry policies, which affects the reciprocal travel agreements that bolster a passport's strength. The U.S. also ranks low on "openness," allowing only 46 other nationalities visa-free entry.</p>

          <p>According to a Wall Street Journal report, Attorney General Pam Bondi informed President Trump in May that his name appeared multiple times in Department of Justice files concerning sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. This briefing allegedly occurred weeks before the DOJ announced it would not release the files, a decision that drew criticism from some of Trump's supporters. The report noted that the files contained unverified hearsay about many prominent individuals, including Trump, and that being mentioned is not an indication of wrongdoing. The White House has dismissed the story as a continuation of politically motivated fake news.</p>

          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix announced record-breaking second-quarter financial results, with operating profit soaring 68% and revenue hitting an all-time high. The surge was driven by sustained, strong demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) technology, which is a critical component in chipsets used for generative artificial intelligence. As a leading supplier to major tech companies like Nvidia, SK Hynix's performance underscores the ongoing boom in the AI sector. The company's revenue rose by approximately 35% compared to the same period last year, significantly outperforming market estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

The orders are part of a broader AI action plan designed to expedite the development of data centers, promote the export of American AI, and remove regulatory hurdles. The directive against biased AI reflects ongoing conservative criticism that tech companies embed liberal ideologies into their products.

While the official cause is still under investigation, a leading theory suggests an old Edison transmission line may have ignited the fire.

The decision is a setback for those demanding more information on the case but does not affect separate requests to unseal materials in New York.

This funding supports the president's campaign promise to conduct the largest deportation operation in the nation's history.

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's pressure to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over high interest rates is a dangerous power play, not a debate about monetary policy. The author contends this push for lower rates is an attempt to subordinate the central bank to the government's fiscal needs, a situation known as "fiscal dominance" that historically leads to inflation and instability. While acknowledging Powell's past policy missteps, the piece asserts that political control of the Fed would erode market confidence and worsen the national debt crisis. The true solution, it concludes, is to address excessive government spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and the European Union are in a race against time to secure a trade deal by a self-imposed August 1 deadline, with President Trump threatening a 30% tariff on EU imports if no agreement is reached. Economists warn such a move could significantly raise costs for consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. Recent U.S. trade pacts with other partners, including Japan, have raised hopes for a resolution. The deal with Japan, which set a 15% tariff in exchange for investment commitments, is seen by some experts as a potential template for an agreement with the EU. (not investment advice)</p>

Kohberger, who pleaded guilty to avoid the death penalty, was sentenced to four consecutive life sentences.

          <p>An inquest has concluded that former Premier League and Sheffield United defender George Baldock died by accidental drowning. The 31-year-old footballer was found deceased in the swimming pool at his home in Glyfada, Greece, in October 2024. A post-mortem examination found no traces of drugs or alcohol in his system, leading the senior coroner to rule his death an accident.

Despite the downturn, which executives attribute to broader consumer economic concerns, the company reported that sales trends began to turn positive in June.

          <p>This opinion piece explores which countries might take sides in a potential military conflict between the United States and China over Taiwan, concluding that very few would likely get involved. The author suggests that China's only formal ally is North Korea, while its strategic partner Russia would probably not offer direct military aid. On the U.S. side, even key allies like Japan and the Philippines would likely offer only limited, cautious support, such as patrols or logistical assistance, rather than full-scale military intervention. The analysis posits that most nations would prefer to remain neutral in such a high-stakes confrontation.</p>

          <p>This article explores the origins of the word "OK," one of the most universally understood terms on the planet. Most scholars trace its first appearance to a Boston newspaper in 1839, where it was used as a jocular abbreviation for "oll korrect," a deliberate misspelling of "all correct." The term gained widespread popularity during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, as his nickname "Old Kinderhook" conveniently aligned with the letters O.K. Its simplicity and versatility helped it spread globally, particularly through its use in telegraphy and by American soldiers in the 20th century.</p>

Currently, sellers face taxes on profits exceeding $250,000 for individuals or $500,000 for married couples, a threshold that an increasing number of homeowners now surpass due to rising property values. The proposal, which follows a similar bill from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, aims to boost the housing market and provide financial relief to long-term homeowners.

In addition to regular movement, cardiologists recommend staying well-hydrated and being aware of personal risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, and a history of smoking. The article stresses that while blood clots are a normal bodily function, abnormal clotting can be life-threatening and requires preventative measures.</p>
