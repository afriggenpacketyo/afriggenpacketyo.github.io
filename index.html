          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing the peak of a four-day heatwave, with temperatures predicted to reach 34Â°C (93Â°F) in central and eastern England, potentially making it one of the hottest June days on record. An amber heat-health alert remains in effect for five regions, indicating a high risk of impacts on the health service and a rise in mortality among vulnerable populations. The London Fire Brigade has warned of a "severe" risk of wildfires due to the high temperatures and recent low rainfall, while travel disruptions are also expected.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has begun a contentious debate on President Trump's signature spending and tax bill, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." The legislation, which narrowly passed a procedural vote, faces strong opposition from Democrats and skepticism from some Republicans like Senator Thom Tillis. Tillis condemned the bill on the Senate floor, arguing it breaks Trump's promises by making deep cuts to Medicaid. The debate is expected to be lengthy, with the bill's final passage remaining uncertain due to shaky GOP support and a critical CBO report.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, are engaged in an active shooter situation after at least one gunman opened fire on firefighters responding to a brush fire on Canfield Mountain. The Kootenai County Sheriff confirmed that two people, believed to be fire personnel, have been killed in the ambush. The suspect or suspects remain at large in the mountainous terrain, prompting a large-scale law enforcement response and a shelter-in-place order for the area.

          <p>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi reported that recent U.S. airstrikes inflicted "severe damage" on Iran's nuclear facilities, though they did not result in their complete destruction. He noted that Iran retains the industrial and technological capacity to rebuild its program if it chooses to do so. Grossi's assessment provides a more nuanced view than some U.S. officials' claims of obliteration, and he stressed the urgent need for IAEA inspectors to regain access to the sites. He also acknowledged the possibility that Iran may have moved some of its enriched uranium before the attacks occurred.</p>

The inquiry will scrutinize policies that led to nearly 46,000 care home resident deaths, the use of "do not resuscitate" notices, and prolonged visiting bans that isolated residents from their loved ones.</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has expressed serious concerns that the expanded 32-team Club World Cup could "destroy" his team's 2025-26 season due to the demanding schedule. With some players having minimal rest before the tournament, Guardiola admitted he tries not to think about the potential for exhaustion and disaster to avoid anxiety. While respecting fellow manager JÃ¼rgen Klopp's similar criticisms, Guardiola acknowledged that as a manager, he must follow the rules set by FIFA and other governing bodies, even if the situation is not ideal for player welfare.</p>

          <p>A four-alarm vegetation fire, named the Mandalay fire, has burned over 80 acres in Riverside, California, leading to mandatory evacuation orders for residents in the area. The fire produced heavy, drifting smoke, and multiple fire departments, including Cal Fire, are on the scene to combat the blaze. While officials reported that the fire's forward progress had slowed, the situation remained active Sunday evening.

Despite thousands of reported sightings, no definitive proof of its survival has emerged. The obsession is fueled by hope and a sense of remorse over the animal's human-caused extinction. In parallel, a high-profile de-extinction project, backed by significant investment, is attempting to resurrect the thylacine by editing the DNA of its closest living relative, though many scientists remain skeptical about the project's feasibility.</p>

Former quality managers have claimed that pressure to speed up production led to compromised safety standards, including the use of substandard parts.

          <p>The UK punk duo Bob Vylan has faced widespread condemnation for comments made during their Glastonbury Festival performance. Frontman Bobby Vylan led chants including "death, death to the IDF," which UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called "appalling hate speech." Glastonbury organizers also stated they were "appalled" and that the chants "very much crossed a line." The BBC, which broadcast the set live, called the comments "deeply offensive" and announced the performance would not be available on its iPlayer service, while local police are reviewing footage to determine if any criminal offenses were committed.</p>

          <p>Vin Diesel has announced that the final installment of the "Fast & Furious" franchise, slated for April 2027, will feature the return of Paul Walker's character, Brian O'Conner. Walker, who died in 2013, last appeared in "Furious 7" through a combination of archived footage, digital effects, and his brothers as stand-ins. Diesel stated that bringing the character back was one of his conditions for making the final film, responding to fan demand. The potential posthumous performance adds to a growing debate over the use of digital recreation for deceased actors in major franchises.</p>
