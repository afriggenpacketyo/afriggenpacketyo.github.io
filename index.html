          <p>More than 300 NIH officials signed a letter, the Bethesda Declaration, to condemn recent changes under the Trump administration that have caused chaos within the agency. Since January, the NIH has been forced to fire workers and rescind funding from research projects due to political reasons. The letter is modeled after the Great Barrington Declaration, written by NIH director Jay Bhattacharya. Officials express concerns that the agency is becoming a weapon of the state, censoring science and punishing institutions.</p>
