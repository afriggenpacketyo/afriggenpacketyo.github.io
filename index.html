            <p>West Bromwich Albion has sacked head coach Tony Mowbray after a mere three months in charge, following a 3-1 defeat to Derby County which significantly diminished their playoff hopes. Mowbray's second spell at the club saw only five wins in 18 games, leaving them six points outside the play-off positions. Former Albion midfielder James Morrison has been appointed as interim manager, assisted by Damia Abella and Boaz Myhill, as the club seeks a new direction after Mowbray's unsuccessful return.</p>
