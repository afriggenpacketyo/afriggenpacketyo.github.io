          <p>Michael Bolton's daughters shared that the Grammy-winning singer experienced unusual symptoms, such as bowling out of turn and falling out of his chair, before his brain cancer diagnosis. These incidents, initially dismissed as fatigue or stress, were early signs of glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. After experiencing headaches, an MRI revealed a brain tumor, leading to surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy treatments. Experts emphasize that while glioblastoma symptoms are not unique, any unexplained changes in behavior or motor control should prompt immediate medical evaluation, and that current treatments are limited but clinical trials offer hope.</p>

          <p>Dr. Awais Aftab, a psychiatrist, acknowledges the transformative benefits of antidepressants for some patients, while also highlighting the less discussed challenges, such as sexual side effects and severe withdrawal symptoms.

The article underscores the need for more research into the long-term effects and safe withdrawal strategies for these medications, advocating for a balanced perspective that acknowledges both the benefits and potential harms. It cautions against ceding the conversation to those who exploit patient suffering for political gain, urging the medical establishment to engage with patient concerns with scientific transparency.</p>

          <p>Voice of America (VOA) may resume broadcasting as early as next week, following a media watchdog's report that the Department of Justice indicated a phased return to work for VOA staff. This development follows an executive order by former President Trump that effectively gutted the network, prompting legal challenges from organizations like Reporters Without Borders. A federal appeals court upheld a temporary stay on the order, mandating the restoration of employees' accounts, and the DOJ email suggests that over 1,400 employees' accounts have been reactivated, signaling a potential return to normal programming for VOA.</p>

          <p>Mali's military junta plans to extend its rule until 2030 without elections and restrict the number of political parties, drawing condemnation from the opposition. The junta-organized "national conference" proposed dissolving the 2005 Political Parties Charter and limiting the number of permitted parties to five, requiring substantial funds to establish new ones. Amnesty International has criticized the move as an attack on freedom of expression and association, while opposition parties fear a crackdown on political dissent.

          <p>The United States has imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing the cost of new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. The tariffs, intended to promote domestic manufacturing, follow earlier levies on imported cars and are expected to have a broad impact since even US-made cars often use foreign components. While the tariffs exempt parts from Canada and Mexico that meet certain requirements and provide temporary relief for US carmakers, analysts predict rising car prices and unpredictable side effects, such as supplier bankruptcies and parts shortages. Jim Farley, the CEO of Ford Motor, stated that many parts are simply not available in the United States.</p>

          <p>Singapore's People's Action Party (PAP) is on track to secure another sweeping victory in the general elections, reinforcing its long-standing governance since 1959. Projections indicate the PAP will win 87 parliamentary seats, with the Workers Party retaining 10. This outcome bolsters Prime Minister Lawrence Wong's mandate, as he faced his first electoral test since assuming office last year. While a younger, more vocal electorate has emerged, the PAP's strong showing underscores its continued dominance in Singaporean politics. The election was influenced by concerns over living costs, housing availability, and potential economic impacts from international trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second term, leading the center-left Labor Party to a resounding victory over the conservative opposition. The election outcome reflects a rejection of Trump-style messaging and policies, as voters prioritized stability amid global uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration. Dutton, the opposition leader, also lost his parliamentary seat, echoing the defeat of Canadaâ€™s conservative leader who embraced Trump-like rhetoric. Albanese emphasized facing global challenges the Australian way, without copying overseas models, as his government expanded its parliamentary majority. Voters expressed concerns about the rising cost of living, prompting both parties to propose incremental relief measures.</p>

          <p>Capital One's acquisition of Discover Financial could yield even greater benefits than initially anticipated if the company successfully expands Discover's payment network internationally. The acquisition allows Capital One to become both a credit card issuer and a payment network operator, similar to American Express. While Capital One plans to shift more of its Capital One-branded credit cards away from Mastercard and Visa, a key to achieving these benefits is moving payment volume onto the Discover network that previously ran on Visa and Mastercard, saving on some fees previously paid to those rivals to facilitate the transactions. CEO Richard Fairbank emphasized that building international acceptance of the Discover network would create a "flywheel effect" for the combined business.</p>
