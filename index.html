          <p>President Trump's initiative to construct a new ballroom at the White House is being funded by private donors, who may receive permanent recognition for their contributions. Companies such as Google, Lockheed Martin, and Palantir have reportedly pledged millions, with discussions underway about etching donor names into the structure or listing them online. The fundraising effort, led by a top Trump fundraiser and the Trust for the National Mall, offers tax benefits for these donations. While the White House confirms nearly $200 million has been pledged for the project, the exact amount of the president's personal contribution remains undisclosed.</p>

          <p>A significant majority of UN member countries, now totaling 147, officially recognize Palestine as a state, a number that has grown following the ongoing conflict in Gaza. In a notable policy shift, several Western nations, including the UK, Australia, Canada, and France, have recently announced intentions to grant recognition, joining others like Ireland, Norway, and Spain who did so in 2024. This trend angers Israeli officials, who argue it rewards terrorism. Despite widespread support in the General Assembly, Palestine's bid for full UN membership remains blocked by a U.S. veto in the Security Council.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz has sharply criticized FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, comparing his warnings to ABC over Jimmy Kimmel's show to tactics used by the Mafia. Cruz argued that Carr's suggestion that ABC's broadcast license could be at risk over Kimmel's commentary on Charlie Kirk's death constitutes a governmental threat to free speech. Despite being pleased that Kimmel faced consequences, Cruz warned against the government gaining the power to censor media based on content. This positions Cruz in opposition to former President Trump, who praised both Kimmel's suspension and Carr's actions.</p>

          <p>Louisiana has reported five deaths this year from Vibrio vulnificus, a flesh-eating bacteria found in warm coastal waters, a significant increase from the state's annual average of one death. State health officials have recorded at least 26 infections, with most cases involving wound exposure to seawater in individuals with underlying health conditions. This spike aligns with scientific warnings that rising sea temperatures due to climate change are making such infections more common. The bacteria can be contracted through open wounds or by consuming raw seafood, and infections can be fatal within days.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) died in a Nassau County, New York, jail cell after being found unresponsive. This marks the first death of an ICE detainee in the county, which began a partnership with the federal agency in February to house individuals in local jails. The New York State Attorney General's office is conducting a preliminary assessment of the death. According to ICE figures, at least 14 people have died in the agency's custody during the 2025 fiscal year, as the number of individuals held for immigration authorities in New York's county jails has risen sharply.</p>

          <p>Prominent U.S. late-night television hosts have collectively condemned the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel by ABC, framing it as a direct assault on free speech orchestrated by the Trump administration. Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, and Jon Stewart used their platforms to satirize and criticize the pressure from the FCC, which had threatened ABC's broadcast licenses over Kimmel's comments about the killing of Charlie Kirk. The unified response from the comedy community highlights a growing concern over media censorship and corporate capitulation to political pressure. The hosts defended Kimmel's character and the essential role of political commentary in a democracy.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to fire Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, for refusing to bring mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Sources indicate that federal prosecutors found no clear evidence of wrongdoing by James, but Trump administration officials still pushed for an indictment. Siebert was reportedly notified that Friday would be his last day, a move an attorney for James called a "brazen attack on the rule of law." The anticipated firing has caused alarm within the Justice Department over the politicization of one of the nation's most important prosecutor's offices.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has dismissed President Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, calling the 85-page filing "decidedly improper and impermissible." The judge criticized the complaint for containing excessive political rhetoric and self-praise rather than focusing on legal claims. However, the dismissal is without prejudice, granting Trump's legal team 28 days to refile a more concise and professional complaint, capped at 40 pages. A spokesperson for The Times welcomed the ruling, stating the original lawsuit was more of a political document than a serious legal filing.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation reveals that Walmart's push to expand its third-party online marketplace involved relaxing its seller vetting processes, resulting in a proliferation of counterfeit and fraudulent products. To compete with Amazon, Walmart reportedly made it easier for sellers to join, sometimes leading to vendors using stolen business identities to list fake goods, including potentially dangerous health and beauty items. Former employees stated they were pressured to approve applicants quickly to accelerate growth. In response to the findings, Walmart asserted its commitment to trust and safety and has recently tightened vetting for some product categories.</p>

The piece contends that these moves, if unchecked, could consolidate power and compromise the fairness of future elections.

          <h2>New Fed Governor Stephen Miran Argues Tariffs Do Not Cause Significant Inflation</h2>

          <p>In his first public comments since joining the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Stephen Miran stated that he does not believe President Trump's tariffs will have a macroeconomically significant inflationary effect. This view places him in the minority on the Federal Open Market Committee, where he was the lone dissenter in the recent decision, advocating for a larger half-point rate cut instead of the quarter-point reduction that passed. Miran argued there is no clear evidence that tariffs have driven up core inflation, pointing to a lack of divergence between import-heavy goods and overall inflation rates.

          <p>Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed that NBA star Kevin Durant has successfully regained access to his Bitcoin holdings after being locked out of his account for years. Durant, an early investor in both Bitcoin and Coinbase itself, had purchased the cryptocurrency in 2016 when its value was a small fraction of its current price. The high-profile case sparked a broader conversation about the cryptocurrency exchange's customer service protocols, with many users sharing similar frustrations. Armstrong acknowledged the concerns and stated that the company is putting a "big focus on getting better" at customer support. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran stated that he was not pressured by President Donald Trump on how to vote during this week's interest rate meeting. Miran, who was the sole vote against the quarter-point rate cut in favor of a larger reduction, said he had only a brief congratulatory call with the president before the decision. The comments address concerns about the central bank's independence amid Trump's frequent public calls for aggressive rate cuts. Miran affirmed that his decision was made independently and that the atmosphere at his first FOMC meeting was collegial. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NPR analysis details how Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr has become a key figure in President Trump's campaign against media outlets critical of his administration. Since becoming chair, Carr has initiated investigations into major broadcast networks and has openly supported the use of the FCC's regulatory power to influence corporate decisions, as seen in the recent suspension of Jimmy Kimmel. This approach marks a departure from the traditionally more autonomous role of the FCC, with critics like former FCC official Gigi Sohn calling his actions an unprecedented use of the office to intimidate networks over political speech.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, along with several state attorneys general, has filed a lawsuit against Live Nation and its subsidiary Ticketmaster, accusing them of facilitating illegal ticket scalping. The complaint alleges that the companies privately enabled brokers to acquire large quantities of tickets, bypassing artist-set limits, and then resell them at inflated prices on the secondary market. The lawsuit also claims the companies used deceptive "bait-and-switch" pricing tactics, violating federal law. This legal action follows a separate antitrust lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice in May, which accused the companies of monopolizing the live entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>Bridget Phillipson, the UK's education secretary and a candidate for Labour's deputy leadership, has indicated that the government is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap. In her strongest comments on the issue to date, she called the policy "spiteful" and stated that its removal is "on the table" as part of a forthcoming child poverty strategy. The cap, introduced in 2017, prevents families from claiming universal credit or child tax credit for a third or subsequent child. The issue has become a key topic in the deputy leadership race, with rival Lucy Powell also advocating for its removal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The artificial intelligence boom, driven by companies like Nvidia, has intensified investor interest in the semiconductor industry, leading to more concentrated exchange-traded funds (ETFs). While traditional funds remain popular, newer options provide different strategies, such as equal-weighting or focusing on "fabless" chip designers that outsource manufacturing. This trend allows investors to make more targeted bets on the chip sector's growth, though it also comes with varying levels of single-stock concentration risk. Experts suggest the industry is still in the early stages of a "super cycle," signaling continued investor focus. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A public disagreement has erupted between former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and MP Zarah Sultana over the formation of their new political party, currently known as "Your Party." The dispute centers on an unauthorized email sent to supporters, allegedly by Sultana's faction, soliciting paid memberships, which Corbyn's team publicly disavowed. Sultana responded by accusing Corbyn's inner circle of being a "sexist boys' club" and sidelining her. The infighting has disappointed allies and raised doubts about the viability of the new left-wing venture before it has officially launched.</p>

The band, which denies the charges and calls the ban "deeply malicious," has been a source of controversy for its pro-Palestinian advocacy and has previously canceled a U.S. tour due to the ongoing legal case.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that President Trump's own public statements have undermined attempts by his defenders to portray Jimmy Kimmel's suspension as a decision based on ratings or accuracy. The author points to Trump's remarks on Air Force One, where he explicitly suggested that critical networks might have their broadcast licenses revoked by the FCC, as direct evidence of his intent to pressure media outlets. This follows earlier posts where Trump linked negative coverage to license revocation. The piece argues that these comments reveal a clear pattern of using regulatory threats to silence critics, contradicting more convoluted explanations from his supporters.</p>
