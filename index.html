          <p>Liam Ã“g Ã“ hAnnaidh, a rapper from the Irish hip-hop group Kneecap, has been released on unconditional bail after appearing in a London court on a terror charge. The charge stems from an accusation that Ã“g Ã“ hAnnaidh displayed a flag supporting the proscribed organization Hezbollah at a London gig. Supporters of the group gathered outside the court, displaying signs and flags in support of Ã“g Ã“ hAnnaidh and free speech, while denouncing discriminatory phrases. Ã“g Ã“ hAnnaidh is scheduled to appear in court for his next hearing in August, and Kneecap has denied the offense and pledged to defend themselves.</p>

          <p>Chocolate prices in the UK have surged at the fastest rate on record in May, contributing to an overall increase in food costs, according to recent data. The main inflation rate remained at 3.4%, consistent with the previous month and the highest in over a year, while food prices have risen for the third consecutive month, reaching levels not seen since February of the previous year. Economists suggest that businesses might be passing on increased employer National Insurance payments to consumers, exacerbating the rise in food prices. Bad weather in key cocoa-producing regions such as Ghana and Ivory Coast has severely impacted harvests, leading to concerns that chocolate prices will remain high through the end of the year.

          <p>Vance Boelter, the suspect in the shooting that killed Democratic Minnesota state Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and wounded Democratic state Senator John Hoffman and his wife, was described as a frustrated idealist, according to his previous writings and a web designer who worked with him. Boelter was preoccupied with societal problems and sought to find solutions to serve the greater good. Projects included plans to end American hunger and a multifaceted collection of corporations to help start-up and expanding businesses in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Boelter's motives for the shooting remain unclear, leaving those who knew him struggling to reconcile his past idealism with the alleged violent acts.</p>

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has confirmed that Israeli strikes targeted two centrifuge facilities in Iran, specifically at the TESA Karaj workshop and the Tehran Research Center. According to the IAEA, one building at the Tehran site, where advanced centrifuge rotors were manufactured and tested, was hit, and at Karaj, two buildings where different centrifuge components were manufactured were destroyed. Both sites were previously under IAEA monitoring and verification as part of the JCPOA, also known as the Iran nuclear deal, which the U.S. withdrew from in 2018 during the Trump administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A heated debate has emerged regarding the legality of Israel's attack on Iran, with arguments focusing on whether it constitutes self-defense under international law. Israel claims the attack was a preemptive measure to neutralize Iran's nuclear threat, while international law experts argue that self-defense requires an imminent attack, which was not evident. Some legal analysts suggest the attack should be viewed within the context of the larger conflict between Iran and Israel, while others emphasize the need to exhaust all other options before resorting to force. The debate underscores the challenges of interpreting international law in complex geopolitical situations.</p>

          <p>The inter-Korean border has fallen silent after South Korea's new president, Lee Jae Myung, ordered a halt to propaganda broadcasts via loudspeakers, a move reciprocated by North Korea. For a year, villagers near the border had endured unnerving noises day and night as both countries engaged in psychological warfare. Lee's decision marks a shift from his predecessor's policy of "peace through strength," aiming to alleviate military tensions and restore trust through dialogue. While some argue the broadcasts were effective in informing North Koreans, others highlight the detrimental impact on the health and well-being of South Korean villagers.</p>

          <p>China's state media has cautioned that the ongoing austerity campaign, aimed at curbing corruption and extravagance, is being excessively implemented at local levels, negatively affecting the dining culture. The People's Daily, the party mouthpiece, noted that some localities are equating "prohibiting illegal dining and drinking" with "banning all eating and drinking," leading to businesses losing customers. Beijing launched the austerity push in March to improve the ruling party's image and cut wasteful spending, but concerns are rising that overzealous implementation is harming daily life and local economies. The graft-busting Central Commission for Discipline Inspection has begun releasing details of excessive drinking by officials as a warning.</p>

          <p>Several U.S. senators are considering running for governor, signaling a potential shift in the perceived prestige and influence of the Senate. Factors contributing to this trend include increased partisanship, legislative gridlock, and a sense of frustration among senators. Some senators believe that serving as governor offers a better opportunity to address state-specific issues and enact meaningful change.

          <p>California is facing a potentially dangerous wildfire season, exacerbated by changes at federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service, NOAA, and FEMA. Budget cuts, layoffs, and restructuring at these agencies could weaken the state's ability to prepare for and respond to wildfires. Experts warn that the combination of dry conditions, a hot summer forecast, and reduced federal support puts California at a significant disadvantage. Despite these challenges, state officials are working to enhance their firefighting capabilities and collaborate with nonfederal entities.</p>
