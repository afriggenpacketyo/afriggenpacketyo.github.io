          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced Canada's intention to respond forcefully to new tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. While Canada was exempted from a universal 10% tariff, the existing 25% tax on imported cars remains a major concern. Carney's response has been politically advantageous, highlighting the Liberal party's competence in handling US relations.  The situation underscores the ongoing tension between the two North American neighbors.</p>
