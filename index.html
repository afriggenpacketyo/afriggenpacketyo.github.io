        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following two days of violent disorder in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, police have deployed additional officers to the affected areas. The unrest, which resulted in injuries to 32 officers and the arrest of six individuals, began after a peaceful protest concerning an alleged sexual assault. Assistant Chief Constable Ryan Henderson condemned the violence as "racist thuggery" targeting ethnic minorities and police officers, emphasizing that all footage of the incidents is under review and prosecutions will follow. The police have also requested assistance from colleagues in Great Britain to maintain public order and bring offenders to justice, as the violence undermines the criminal investigation and causes further distress to the victim and her family. The community is waking up in genuine fear for their lives and their livelihoods, as businesses and homes were attacked and damaged and a number of vehicles were also set on fire in the area.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi defended the Trump administration's response to immigration protests in Los Angeles, asserting they are "very different" from the January 6th Capitol attack, where many rioters received pardons. Bondi stated that the Los Angeles protests involve people "out there hurting people in California right now" and that the situation is ongoing. This statement came in response to criticism from California Governor Gavin Newsom, who pointed out the inconsistency in President Trump's actions. Bondi dodged questions about the legal standards for invoking the Insurrection Act, instead highlighting improved conditions in California, while reiterating the administration's readiness to take further action if necessary.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is piloting a new banana-flavored protein cold foam at five locations in the U.S., paired with their iced latte. This move comes as protein drinks and snacks have seen a surge in popularity. The protein beverage sector is now a $6 billion industry. This test is part of a broader initiative to revamp the Starbucks menu. The company is testing an array of new products at select U.S. locations known as the Starting Five before launching them nationally. To make way for these new items, Starbucks plans to reduce its food and beverage offerings by 30% by the end of Fiscal Year 2025, aiming to create a more intentional and thoughtful experience for customers.</p>

          <p>This article explores how society often prioritizes romantic relationships over friendships, leading to a decline in the latter when people become romantically involved. Rhaina Cohen, author of "The Other Significant Others: Reimagining Life With Friendship at the Center," notes that our culture places unnecessary limits on friendship, despite historical evidence showing the importance of platonic bonds. The article suggests that individuals can prioritize both love and friendship by reimagining free time and challenging the expectation that romantic partners should fulfill all emotional needs. By investing in friendships, individuals can create a more balanced and supportive life, ultimately benefiting their mental health and overall well-being.</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have reached an agreement regarding Gibraltar's status post-Brexit, aiming to avoid border checks between Spain and the British Overseas Territory. The agreement ensures that passport checks at Gibraltar airport will be conducted by both Gibraltar and Spanish officials, similar to the Eurostar system at London's St Pancras. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated that the deal protects British sovereignty and supports Gibraltar's economy, while Spanish Foreign Affairs Minister JosÃ© Manuel Albares and EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic hailed the agreement as "historic." All parties have committed to finalizing a UK-EU treaty text on Gibraltar as quickly as possible, with the UK emphasizing that the final treaty does not impact the territory's British sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer is defending the UK's Â£3.4 billion deal to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, while retaining control of the Diego Garcia military base. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has criticized the deal as "terrible," questioning why British taxpayers should fund tax cuts in Mauritius. Starmer argues that the deal is necessary to secure the "vital intelligence and strategic capability" on Diego Garcia, which would be compromised without the agreement. The terms of the deal involve the UK leasing the Diago Garcia base for 99 years, with payments indexed to inflation, while Mauritius plans to use the funds for debt repayment and tax cuts. A panel of experts has urged the UK to renegotiate the deal to better guarantee the rights of the Chagossian people.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's legal team is seeking to move his appeal of the New York hush money conviction to federal court, arguing that the case involves "official acts" undertaken while he was president. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit heard arguments on whether the appeal should be removed from state appellate courts. Trump's attorney, Jeffrey Wall, argued that the former president is entitled to a federal forum, particularly given the unique nature of the prosecution. The Manhattan district attorney's office contends that it is too late to move the case, as the purpose of removal is to decide where to hold the trial, not to divert the appeal to federal court.</p>

The lawsuit claims that Midjourney used and distributed AI-generated characters from movies like Star Wars, The Simpsons, Toy Story, and Shrek, despite requests to stop. The studios are demanding a jury trial, asserting that Midjourney's actions threaten the bedrock incentives of U.S. copyright law. The companies argue that Midjourney is a "quintessential copyright free-rider and a bottomless pit of plagiarism," highlighting the growing concerns over protecting content from illegal copyrighting in the age of AI.</p>

The article emphasizes that real payouts depend on more than just the investment amount and suggests requesting quotes from multiple insurers to compare options. Annuities can provide a reliable income stream in retirement, but understanding the factors that influence payouts is essential for making informed decisions (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Social Security beneficiaries may see a 2.5% increase in their benefits in 2026, according to estimates from The Senior Citizens League and Mary Johnson, an independent Social Security and Medicare policy analyst. This potential cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is based on recent government inflation data and would be considered "about average," according to Johnson. The official COLA for the following year is calculated based on third-quarter inflation data and is typically announced in October. The COLA may increase further if President Trump's tariff policies prompt inflation and consumer prices to rise (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The entire Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board has resigned, citing meddling by the Trump administration in the board's authority to award scholarships. The board contends that the State Department denied Fulbright awards to numerous individuals selected for the 2025-2026 academic year and is subjecting additional foreign Fulbright recipients to an unauthorized review process. Members of the board, appointed by former President Joe Biden, believe these actions contradict the Fulbright mission and its values of free speech and academic freedom.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced plans to begin phasing out the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) after the hurricane season, with states receiving less federal aid for natural disasters. Trump stated that disaster relief funds would be distributed directly from the president's office. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem added that FEMA "fundamentally needs to go away as it exists" and that governors are encouraged to collaborate on disaster response. The move marks a significant shift in disaster relief protocols and raises concerns about the federal government's role in assisting states during emergencies.</p>

The NHS will receive a 3% annual real-terms increase in spending, but capital spending will remain unchanged. The government also plans long-term investments in transport infrastructure, including a new Liverpool to Manchester rail line and a freeze on bus fares, though these plans may not materialize until the 2030s.</p>
