            <p>The White House has claimed that a letter sent to Harvard University outlining a series of demands regarding hiring and admissions policies was sent without proper authorization. The letter, which requested the elimination of DEI programs and stricter screening of international students, sparked a public dispute between the White House and Harvard. While acknowledging the authenticity of the letter's contents, sources within the administration cited by the New York Times claim that the letter was mishandled.

            <p>Pakistan has deported tens of thousands of Afghan refugees, citing national security concerns and pressure on public services. The UN reports that over 19,500 Afghans have been deported this month, with more than 80,000 having left ahead of the April 30 deadline. Many of those expelled were born in Pakistan and have never lived in Afghanistan. The deportations have raised concerns about the future of Afghan girls' education under Taliban rule and the difficulties refugees face in settling into an unfamiliar country.</p>

Mazyar Azarbonyad sped away from officers after being stopped for a defective light.

Azarbonyad, who came to the UK from Iran aged 15 or 16 and had no previous convictions, was later seen approaching the A1 and was pursued by police. He also admitted to driving again despite an interim ban and driving without insurance and a license.</p>

High interest rates provide inflation-beating returns on cash through online high-yield savings accounts that are FDIC-insured. For those who have been keeping cash on the sidelines rather than investing, now is the time to start allocating toward equities and riskier assets, considering the recent market drop.

The case raises questions about religious freedom and the role of public schools in teaching about diverse perspectives.</p>
