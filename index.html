          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has publicly endorsed Chancellor Rachel Reeves, stating she is doing an "excellent job" and will remain in her role for years to come. This support follows an incident where Reeves was seen crying in the House of Commons, which her spokesperson attributed to a personal matter unrelated to politics. The event occurred during a period of intense political pressure over welfare reform U-turns and sparked turmoil in financial markets, with the pound falling and government borrowing costs rising. Starmer emphasized that he and Reeves work "in lockstep," dismissing any speculation of a professional rift between them.</p>

          <p>U.S. financial markets reacted positively to a new trade agreement with Vietnam, which is expected to lower costs for imported goods from companies like Nike and Lululemon. This optimism overshadowed a concerning report from ADP indicating that the U.S. private sector unexpectedly lost 33,000 jobs in June, the first contraction since March 2023. The S&P 500 reached a new closing high as investors focused on the trade deal's immediate benefits rather than the potential economic weakness suggested by the job losses. This market behavior highlights a potential disconnect between financial market sentiment and broader economic realities for workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has issued a stark warning that over three million residents could lose their Medi-Cal health coverage due to Republican fiscal proposals. He criticized the plan, which includes significant cuts to Medicaid and the imposition of work requirements for beneficiaries, as a "devastating" and "cruel" betrayal of voters. According to state analysis, up to 3.4 million of the 15 million Californians on the low-income health program could be dropped from the rolls. Newsom stated the state would lose billions in federal funding and could not afford to cover the shortfall, potentially leading to the closure of rural hospitals.</p>

          <p>A team of researchers from China has developed a new form of blockchain technology designed to be secure against attacks from future quantum computers. Traditional blockchain, which underpins cryptocurrencies and other secure digital ledgers, relies on encryption methods that could be vulnerable to the immense processing power of quantum computing. Scientists from the Beijing Institute of Technology and Guilin University of Electronic Technology created the system to address this emerging security threat. This innovation aims to safeguard the integrity of digital records in critical sectors like finance and supply chain management as technology advances.</p>

          <p>A large forest fire on the Greek island of Crete has prompted authorities to evacuate four settlements, including the popular tourist resort of Achlia. The blaze, which broke out Wednesday afternoon, was intensified by strong winds, making it difficult for firefighters to contain. Over 150 firefighters worked through the night to control the flames, while water-dropping aircraft were grounded until morning. At least 1,500 people, including residents and tourists, were moved to temporary shelters, and some individuals received treatment for breathing difficulties. This fire occurs as Greece, like much of Europe, contends with a significant heat wave.</p>

Starmer took responsibility for the chaotic process, acknowledging it had been a "tough" period but insisting the government would emerge stronger.

          <p>Following Clayton Kershaw's historic 3,000th career strikeout, this opinion article argues that his sustained excellence and longevity establish him as the greatest pitcher in the history of the Los Angeles Dodgers, surpassing even the legendary Sandy Koufax. While acknowledging Koufax's unparalleled dominance over a shorter period, the author contends that Kershaw's 18 seasons of elite performance represent a more significant body of work. The article highlights that Kershaw has outlasted Koufax in nearly every major statistical category, including innings pitched and strikeouts. It frames Kershaw as the enduring cornerstone of the modern Dodgers era, comparing his career to a constant flame versus Koufax's brilliant but brief meteor.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has lifted its export restrictions on critical chip-design software to China, according to announcements from semiconductor software firms Synopsys and Cadence. The U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security reversed a policy implemented in May that required companies to obtain licenses before exporting such technology. The three dominant firms in the electronic design automation (EDA) market—Synopsys, Cadence, and Siemens EDA—are now working to restore access for their Chinese customers. This move, which caused shares of the involved companies to rise, comes amid signs of a potential trade truce and agreements to resume some technology exchanges between the two countries.</p>

          <p>This opinion article celebrates the dynamic evolution of the Spanish language, arguing that its global nature and diverse variations are a source of strength and richness. The author contrasts the Spanish-speaking world's general acceptance of regional differences with the more rigid attitudes sometimes seen among English speakers. With nearly 600 million speakers worldwide, Spanish is constantly being enriched by new contexts and cross-cultural interactions, particularly in the Americas. The author concludes that attempts to enforce a single, "pure" version of a language are futile and that the collective, cross-continental usage is what keeps languages like Spanish and English alive and vibrant.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw achieved a historic milestone, becoming just the 20th pitcher in Major League Baseball history to record 3,000 career strikeouts.

The achievement was celebrated by a sellout crowd and his teammates, with the Dodgers marking the occasion with a video tribute. The milestone highlights a long and decorated career for the 36-year-old, who has been a central figure for the Dodgers since his debut in 2008.</p>

The object, believed to be a large comet, is moving at over 60 kilometers per second, a speed indicating it is not bound by the Sun's gravity and originated from outside our solar system. It poses no threat to Earth and will pass just inside the orbit of Mars before exiting the solar system again.

However, he was found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, which carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison each. The verdict followed a seven-week trial featuring graphic testimony from former girlfriends about a culture of abuse and coercion. Combs, who will remain in detention pending sentencing, reacted with emotion in the courtroom, while his attorneys argued for his immediate release.

According to House rules, unlike in the Senate where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, a tie in the House means the motion or bill in question fails. This procedural reality was highlighted in a February 2024 vote to impeach Secretary Mayorkas, which initially resulted in a 215-215 tie. In such cases, a question "shall be lost," effectively defeating the measure without any mechanism to break the deadlock, a critical factor in closely contested votes.</p>

Conservative fiscal hawks in the House Freedom Caucus are outraged by this figure. Simultaneously, moderate Republicans from swing districts are concerned about the Senate's steeper cuts to Medicaid, which could cause millions of their constituents to lose healthcare coverage, creating a difficult two-front battle for party leadership.</p>

In contrast, for women without a uterus who can take estrogen alone, the therapy was found to reduce breast cancer risk. This research refines previous understandings from older studies, emphasizing that the type of hormone therapy and a woman's individual health profile are crucial factors in determining its safety and effectiveness.</p>
