            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen reports that the El Salvadorian government initially obstructed his access to Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national mistakenly deported from the U.S., before reversing course. Van Hollen believes El Salvador staged photos during his visit to falsely portray Abrego Garcia's conditions as favorable. Abrego Garcia was transferred to a different facility following Van Hollen's visit. The Trump administration has acknowledged the error, but a legal battle continues over his return to the U.S., with the White House and Bukele resisting despite court orders. </p>

            <p>President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador proposed a prisoner swap with Venezuela, offering to repatriate 252 Venezuelan deportees from the U.S. in exchange for the release of 252 political prisoners held by the Maduro government.

            <p>Solicitor General John Sauer responded Saturday to the Supreme Court's extraordinary overnight order that temporarily blocked the removal of any alleged Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang members to El Salvador calling it "unprecedented" and wrong. Sauer argued that the detainee plaintiffs have no standing to seek an injunction from the high court since the government has already paused their pending deportations and is allowing the legal process to play out. He noted no lower court has weighed in on the facts of the government's "notice" and "opportunity to appeal" process implemented in the wake of the SCOTUS order last month.</p>
