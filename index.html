        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from the National Energy System Operator (NESO) has concluded that the power outage and subsequent fire that shut down Heathrow Airport were caused by a problem identified seven years prior but never rectified. The issue stemmed from moisture entering electrical components at a key substation, leading to a short circuit and fire. This catastrophic failure affected nearly 67,000 customers and disrupted the travel of around 270,000 passengers. Heathrow has criticized National Grid for failing to maintain its infrastructure, citing outdated regulations and inadequate safety measures as contributing factors.</p>

          <p>MethaneSAT, an $88 million satellite designed to monitor greenhouse gas emissions, has been declared lost after it stopped responding to ground control.

Despite the setback, the EDF views the mission as a valuable learning experience rather than a complete failure, emphasizing the progress made.

The lawsuit alleged election interference through deceptive editing of an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. The settlement, which includes Trump's legal fees but no apology, was reportedly pushed by Paramount's corporate leadership against the wishes of CBS News executives. This move comes as Paramount's controlling owner seeks to finalize a sale of the company, a deal that requires approval from the FCC, now led by a Trump appointee.</p>

Facing a large-scale rebellion from within his own Labour Party, Starmer had to abandon key proposals aimed at changing eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). The climbdown has left a substantial hole in the public finances and has weakened the Prime Minister's authority, drawing comparisons to the chaotic parliamentary battles of previous, less stable governments.

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is preparing for a critical vote on the Senate-passed version of President Trump's major policy bill, but severe weather is complicating travel for lawmakers. Numerous members of Congress reported their flights to Washington D.C. were canceled due to thunderstorms, raising concerns about attendance for the vote. With a razor-thin Republican majority, Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged that any absences could jeopardize the bill's passage. The situation has forced some representatives to drive long distances to ensure they are present for the legislative session, highlighting the high stakes of the vote.</p>

          <p>British qualifier Oliver "Ollie" Tarvet, ranked 733rd in the world, has captured the attention of Wimbledon after advancing to the second round of his Grand Slam debut.

Despite being a massive underdog, Tarvet remains quietly confident, stating he is focused on "playing the ball, not the player." His journey from a relatively unknown player to facing a tennis superstar represents a classic underdog story at the historic tournament.</p>

          <p>At least 180 current and former UK armed forces aircrew are pursuing legal action against the Ministry of Defence, claiming their cancer diagnoses were caused by exposure to toxic fumes in military helicopters. The claims relate to aircraft such as the Sea King, Puma, and Chinook. The MoD has reached out-of-court settlements in at least six cases without admitting liability but maintains it believes engine exhaust emissions pose no health risk. Veterans' groups and solicitors are calling for a cancer screening program and greater transparency, arguing many more individuals could be affected and unaware of the potential risks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The G7 nations have agreed to a deal that will effectively exempt American multinational corporations from a previously agreed-upon global minimum tax framework. This decision, a result of intense pressure from the Trump administration and corporate lobbying, undermines the 2021 OECD/G20 agreement designed to ensure large companies pay a minimum tax rate of 15% globally. Critics, including Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, argue the move puts the interests of multinationals over those of citizens and developing countries, risking a renewed "race to the bottom" in corporate taxation. The deal weakens the global effort to curb tax avoidance by large corporations. (not investment advice)</p>

He specified that the Gaden Phodrang Trust, which he founded, will have the sole authority to recognize his successor.

While market leader BYD continues to dominate, other rivals like Nio and Li Auto have seen more mixed results.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs as high as 30% or 35% on Japanese imports if a new trade deal is not reached by the July 9 deadline.

Trump expressed doubt that a deal with Tokyo would be finalized, while also criticizing Japan's policies on rice imports.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants living in the U.S. The administration had planned to end the program for Haitians in September, years ahead of a previously established 2026 deadline. The judge determined that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before its official expiration date. The ruling is a significant, albeit potentially temporary, victory for migrants who had enrolled in schools and jobs in reliance on the program's continuation. The White House has stated it will appeal the decision.</p>
