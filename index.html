          <p>Rescue teams are in their fifth day of searching for missing individuals after catastrophic flash floods struck central Texas, with the death toll now at 109 and expected to increase. The majority of fatalities occurred in Kerr County, where a summer camp was devastated by the rapidly rising Guadalupe River. A federal disaster has been declared, enabling FEMA support, though ongoing storms have complicated recovery operations. The disaster has also prompted scrutiny over the adequacy of weather warnings and potential impacts from cuts to the National Weather Service.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A person claiming to be an airline baggage claims manager posted on Reddit advising travelers not to discard their luggage tags at the airport. The user alleged that thieves are using information from the tags, such as names and confirmation numbers, to file fraudulent claims for missing items, complicating the reimbursement process for legitimate claims. While some travel experts expressed skepticism about the scam's prevalence due to the limited personal information on tags, the post sparked a debate among travelers, with many recommending shredding or disposing of tags and boarding passes at home to be safe.</p>

          <p>A major wildfire has spread to the edge of Marseille, France, mobilizing a thousand firefighters to combat the blaze described by the city's mayor as an "apocalyptic" situation. The fire, which authorities believe was started by a car fire on a motorway, has burned approximately 700 hectares and forced the evacuation of at least 400 residents. Strong winds and dry conditions have exacerbated the fire's rapid spread, leading to the closure of Marseille Provence airport. This event is part of a series of wildfires across southern Europe, including in Spain and Greece, amid a scorching early summer heatwave.</p>

          <p>Consumers and restaurants in the United States are facing searingly high beef prices, which reached a record $5.98 per pound in May. The primary cause is a significant reduction in the nation's cattle herds, now at their lowest levels since the 1960s, largely due to widespread drought conditions that have diminished feedstock for ranchers. Despite the availability of cheaper alternatives like pork and poultry, American demand for beef has remained robust, further straining the tight supply. Experts predict that prices will likely continue to rise and remain elevated for the next several years as the industry slowly rebuilds its herds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent anti-government protests in Kenya have led to 31 deaths and over 100 injuries, the highest single-day toll this year, according to the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. The demonstrations, driven by demands for better governance, police accountability, and the removal of President William Ruto over corruption allegations, have seen widespread property destruction. Protesters took to the streets on a date historically significant for pro-democracy movements in the country. The UN has urged for calm and for the grievances fueling the protests to be addressed by the government.</p>

          <p>A review of the 2025 "Superman" film, directed by James Gunn, notes its intentionally lighter and more humorous tone, a stark contrast to Zack Snyder's darker interpretations. The movie is described as a nostalgic throwback to the 1978 film, which may please fans who sought a more classic portrayal but could disappoint others with its dramatic simplicity. While the article praises the performances of David Corenswet as Superman and Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane, it criticizes Nicholas Hoult's portrayal of Lex Luthor and the film's often artificial-looking visual effects. The film also introduces a significant, and potentially divisive, change to the hero's origin story.</p>

However, the analysis highlights that for longer terms, the variable rate of a savings account could potentially yield more, assuming rates remain stable.

          <p>Homeowners looking to tap into their home equity with a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) may be attracted to no-closing-cost options, but there are important trade-offs to consider. This article explains that these products don't eliminate fees but rather roll them into the loan, often resulting in a higher interest rate or penalties for early closure. Borrowers should calculate the break-even point to see if paying costs upfront is cheaper in the long run. Additionally, these HELOCs often have stricter credit requirements and clawback provisions that require careful review of the fine print before committing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following his conviction on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, Sean "Diddy" Combs faces a potential prison sentence of up to 20 years, with each count carrying a maximum of 10 years. However, legal experts suggest a sentence of that length is unlikely. Prosecutors are expected to argue for a term of roughly four to five years, while the defense has suggested 21 to 27 months. The final decision rests with Judge Arun Subramanian, who has significant discretion and will consider a pre-sentence report before the scheduled October 3 sentencing date.</p>

          <p>Supporters of President Donald Trump, including prominent MAGA-world figures, have expressed outrage over a Justice Department memo stating that no evidence of a Jeffrey Epstein "client list" was found. The backlash has been directed at Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel, and others in the administration, with some accusing them of a cover-up and calling for resignations. The frustration stems from earlier promises by Bondi to release Epstein-related records and her comments that were interpreted as confirming the existence of such a list. The memo has created a rare moment of vocal criticism against the Trump administration from its own loyal base.</p>

          <p>The Court of Arbitration for Sport has cleared French fencing champion Ysaora Thibus of doping, accepting her explanation that a banned substance entered her system through kissing her partner. The court found it scientifically plausible that ostarine, which her partner was using, could be transferred via saliva over a nine-day period, leading to a positive test. Consequently, the panel ruled that Thibus bore no fault or negligence for the anti-doping rule violation. This decision dismissed an appeal from the World Anti-Doping Agency, which had sought a four-year ban for the athlete.</p>

A flood gauge near Camp Mystic, a site of numerous fatalities, recorded a staggering rise in the Guadalupe River of over 25 feet in just two hours before it stopped reporting data. This level is categorized as "major flooding," with the river nearly reaching the 32-foot mark designated as "disastrous life-threatening flooding." The region, known as "flash flood alley," is particularly susceptible to such events due to its unique geography and weather patterns.</p>

          <p>Amazon has expanded its Prime Day sales event to four days, a move that tests consumer willingness to spend in a climate of economic uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariff policies. Despite this, spending is projected to hit a record $23.8 billion, with shoppers expected to hunt for deals on electronics and other goods before potential tariff-driven price hikes take effect later in the year. While retailers have so far absorbed many of the tariff costs, the event serves as an early indicator of consumer resilience.
