          <p>Donald Trump asserted that "obliteration" is an accurate term to describe the damage inflicted on Iran's nuclear sites following U.S. military strikes. General Dan Caine stated there was "severe damage and destruction" to facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, but stopped short of confirming total obliteration. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth reported that precision munitions struck intended targets with the desired effect. The UN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said it was not yet possible to assess the damage at Fordo, while a senior Iranian source claimed that most of the highly enriched uranium had been moved prior to the strikes, which involved B-2 bombers and Tomahawk missiles.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant jump after the U.S. joined the conflict between Iran and Israel, escalating tensions in the Middle East and sparking concerns about potential disruptions to oil supplies. Experts warned of the possibility of triple-digit oil prices, as investors closely monitored Iran's response to the U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities. The Strait of Hormuz, a critical artery for global oil trade, is under scrutiny, with threats of closure adding to market jitters. Analysts suggest that a prolonged closure could drive oil prices towards $100 per barrel, potentially mirroring the supply shock experienced during the Ukraine war.</p>

          <p>The Indian rupee is expected to open weaker due to rising crude oil prices and risk aversion following U.S. military action against Iran. Non-deliverable forwards indicate the currency will decline, pressured by concerns over energy supply disruptions.

          <p>A federal judge in Nashville ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia can be released on bail while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges. Despite the ruling, Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native who was previously deported, is likely to be taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody. The judge acknowledged that her determination on detention issues might be largely an academic exercise, given the likelihood of ICE involvement. Prosecutors argue that Abrego Garcia conspired to transport thousands of migrants across the U.S., while the defense contends that the charges are a distraction from due process concerns in his case.</p>

          <p>China criticized the United States and Israel, calling for de-escalation of the conflict with Iran and adherence to international law. China's UN ambassador, Fu Cong, stated that Washington has violated Iranian sovereignty and exacerbated tensions in the Middle East. The criticism came after the U.S. attacked Iranian nuclear facilities, and China urged the international community to uphold justice and restore peace and stability. While acknowledging the importance of ending the conflict, statements from UN Security Council members revealed geopolitical divisions.</p>

          <p>World leaders responded to President Donald Trump's announcement that the U.S. had attacked three nuclear sites in Iran. Iran's foreign minister stated that his nation "reserves all options" in responding to the attack, while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu praised Trump's decision.

Foreign affairs experts suggest that China may announce a new panda loan during high-level bilateral talks to stabilize relations with Tokyo amid escalating tensions with the U.S. Since 1972, pandas have symbolized friendship between the two countries, and China's decisions on leasing them abroad are typically revealed during significant bilateral discussions.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia will likely be placed in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody due to an immigration detainer the government has on him, despite a Tennessee judge on Sunday ordering his release in his criminal case. This comes after the mistakenly deported Salvadoran native was brought back to the United States from El Salvador's mega-prison earlier this month. Abrego Garcia faces criminal charges for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants within the U.S. in what federal prosecutors say was a conspiracy involving the domestic transport of thousands of noncitizens from Mexico and Central America, including some children, in exchange for thousands of dollars. The court does not find that these circumstances, when considered together, compel a determination that Abrego poses a risk of danger to the community or has the proclivity and incentive to flee rather than face prosecution of this case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships reveals that parents who rarely encounter defiance avoid threats, bribes, and harsh consequences, instead using language that encourages cooperation. Traditional parenting phrases can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response, while language that respects a child's autonomy while setting boundaries promotes cooperation. The key is to create an environment where children feel respected, emotionally safe, and involved, leading to reduced power struggles and emotionally resilient children. This approach shifts from control to empathy and leadership, viewing defiance as a call for connection or support.</p>

Cyberstalking involves using digital tools for harassment and threats, causing fear and distress, and is exacerbated by the normalization of digital surveillance. Sharing locations and constant messaging, often seen as signs of love, can set precedents for unhealthy relationships.</p>

          <p>China has become the world leader in electric vehicles (EVs) through a strategic master plan involving long-term planning and extensive government funding. The Chinese government spent an estimated $231 billion from 2009 to 2023 developing the EV industry, providing subsidies to consumers, carmakers, electricity providers, and battery suppliers. This support has enabled companies like BYD and CATL to thrive and dominate the EV market. While other countries impose taxes on Chinese EVs, the UK does not, making it an attractive market for firms like XPeng and BYD.</p>
