          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass described a climate of fear gripping the city due to the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement. In an interview, Bass stated that ICE raids have led many residents, including legal immigrants and citizens, to stay home, impacting local businesses and culture. She criticized the tactics of federal agents, such as using unmarked vehicles and masks, which she argued creates confusion and terror. While acknowledging the administration's help during past wildfires, she condemned the deportation policies as punitive and unnecessary.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged to remain in his position despite exit polls indicating his ruling coalition is set to lose its majority in the upper house of parliament. The coalition, comprising the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Komeito, is facing voter frustration over rising prices and other economic issues. This potential defeat, following a loss in the lower house last year, could significantly weaken Ishiba's political influence and destabilize the government during critical trade negotiations with the United States.</p>

          <p>A new peace declaration signed by the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the AFC/M23 rebel group is being met with cautious optimism and significant skepticism. The agreement, mediated by Qatar, establishes a permanent ceasefire and outlines a timeline for comprehensive peace talks. However, experts and analysts point to the lack of enforcement mechanisms and immediate disagreements over key terms, such as the withdrawal of rebel forces. The success of this deal, like previous failed attempts, will ultimately depend on the political will for implementation from all parties involved.</p>

          <h2>Families of Israeli Hostages Express Growing Mistrust in Their Own Government's Efforts</h2>

          <p>The families of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza are increasingly voicing their mistrust in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure their release. Campaigners and relatives feel that the government is not prioritizing a deal, pointing to the deaths of hostages who could have been freed in earlier agreements. Many now place more hope in the US administration to pressure Israel into a deal. They express frustration that far-right elements in the coalition seem to value land over human life, undermining the long-held Israeli ethos of not leaving anyone behind.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to personality scientists and author Olga Khazan, it is possible for individuals to intentionally redesign aspects of their personality. Research suggests that core traits like neuroticism or introversion are not fixed and can be altered through sustained behavioral changes. The process involves consciously acting in ways opposite to one's natural tendencies, such as a shy person forcing themselves into social situations. While the principles are simple, experts note that the execution is difficult but can lead to dramatic and lasting changes in how people think, feel, and behave.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is facing bipartisan criticism for restoring the names of Confederate generals to several U.S. Army bases, circumventing a 2021 law that mandated their removal. Hegseth claims the bases are being renamed for other historical soldiers who happen to share the same last names as the Confederate figures, a move lawmakers have called a transparent effort to flout the law. The House Armed Services Committee recently voted to block the action, with some Republicans joining Democrats to rebuke the administration for ignoring a congressional mandate.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that understanding Oklahoma, with its complex and often violent history, is key to understanding the United States as a whole. The state's identity was forged through the forced removal of Indigenous nations and land runs that are still celebrated, reflecting a national tendency to mythologize a painful past. The author traces this legacy from the state's founding to its modern efforts at reinvention, suggesting that Oklahoma has always been a testing ground for America's deepest contradictions. Confronting this history is presented as essential for navigating current divisions.</p>

          <p>In a new memoir and interview, Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Senate, reflects on her historic career and the current political landscape. She recounts facing both racism and sexism in Washington, arguing that sexism remains a more difficult barrier to overcome than racism. Moseley Braun expressed concern that the Democratic party seems to be "walking around in a daze" in its efforts to counter Donald Trump. Despite recent political backsliding on civil rights, she remains optimistic that Americans ultimately value democracy.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that public support for President Trump's deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the policy. This shift coincides with a perception that the program is targeting more than just dangerous criminals and a widespread disapproval of the use of detention facilities. The poll also shows continued public concern over the economy, with most Americans wanting the administration to focus more on lowering prices rather than on tariffs or spending cuts. Trump's overall approval rating has continued to slide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This commentary expresses the fear and uncertainty felt by many of the 25 million naturalized U.S. citizens under the Trump administration. The author points to the Justice Department's prioritization of denaturalization and the president's rhetoric as creating a distinction between natural-born and naturalized citizens, undermining the principle that citizenship is permanent. The article argues that this climate chills free speech and political participation, as naturalized citizens may fear that exercising their constitutional rights could lead to scrutiny or even the revocation of their citizenship.</p>
