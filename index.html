            <p>LAFC's journey in the 2025 Concacaf Champions Cup ended with a 3-1 defeat against Inter Miami, led by Lionel Messi. Despite an early goal by Aaron Long, Inter Miami mounted a comeback, fueled by Messi's equalizer and subsequent goals from Federico Redondo and Messi again from a penalty. LAFC coach Steve Cherundolo acknowledged Messi's impact and the team's failure to contain him in the second half, while Inter Miami coach Javier Mascherano praised Messi's leadership and competitive spirit, adding that luck was on their side. Inter Miami will now face Cruz Azul in the semi-finals.</p>

            <p>The Library of Congress has added José Alfredo Jiménez's iconic song 'El Rey,' popularized by Vicente Fernández, to the National Recording Registry, recognizing its cultural, historical, and aesthetic significance. Despite being originally written and performed by Jiménez, it was Fernández's version from his 1973 album that cemented the song's legendary status. The list also includes Freddy Fender's 'Before the Next Teardrop Falls,' which features Spanish verses, further highlighting the influence of Latino artists in American music. While some view Jiménez's work as having machismo undertones, 'El Rey' is seen as a song of self-improvement and triumph, regardless of one's economic status.</p>

            <h2>Analysts Warn of Ongoing Trade War Despite Trump's 'Tactical Retreat'</h2>

            <p>Analysts are cautioning against complacency despite President Trump's 90-day pause on tariffs for most nations, describing it as a 'tactical retreat' rather than a shift in his overall trade objectives. Tariffs on Chinese imports have been raised to 125%, escalating the trade war between the world's two largest economies, with potential disruptions to global supply chains. Experts predict a 'much higher tariff world' and foresee continued market volatility and economic pain for various countries. A report by ING suggests current tariffs could generate significant tax revenue, but this would cease if China halts exports.</p>

Other headlines include discussions about potential interest rate cuts by the Bank of England, the impact of the trade war on weight-loss drug prices, and a study suggesting adults have only a few close friends.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump mistakenly called his former National Security Advisor, H.R. McMaster, and proceeded to criticize him after realizing his error, according to CBS News sources. The call occurred shortly after Trump publicly attacked McMaster on social media for his skepticism regarding Trump's relationship with Vladimir Putin. Trump intended to speak with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, but reached the wrong McMaster and launched into a scathing critique. The White House declined to comment on the private call, while McMaster also declined to comment.</p>

            <p>As the trade war between Beijing and Washington intensifies with escalating tariffs, observers suggest that diplomatic backchannels may be crucial for bringing the leaders back to the negotiating table. President Trump's recent tariff hike on Chinese imports, while pausing tariffs for other countries, has deepened the rift between the two largest economies. Despite the escalation, Trump hinted at the possibility of a deal with China, stating that they 'just don't know how quite to go about it'. The use of discreet diplomatic channels could provide a pathway for renewed dialogue and potential resolution.</p>

            <p>China's consumer prices have contracted for the second consecutive month, while producer price deflation has worsened, as the country faces increasing trade tensions with the United States. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) fell by 0.1% year-on-year in March, while producer prices dropped by 2.5%, marking the largest contraction since November 2024. Experts suggest that core consumer prices show signs of recovery, while producer prices are expected to decline further due to trade disruptions. The Chinese government is reportedly preparing stimulus measures to boost domestic consumption in response to rising tariffs from the U.S.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump has directed the Justice Department to investigate two former senior officials from his first administration who have become critical of him. The targets include Miles Taylor, who wrote an anonymous New York Times op-ed and a tell-all book, and Christopher Krebs, who was Trump's election security director and corrected claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election. Trump accused Taylor of 'treason' and fired Krebs in 2020. The move raises concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department.</p>

            <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has postponed a vote on the Senate-approved GOP budget blueprint due to dissatisfaction from a small group of members. Johnson intends to revisit the vote before the House enters its two-week April recess. The budget blueprint is intended to fund President Donald Trump's agenda, but some GOP hardliners have concerns about how the plan would reduce the deficit. Trump has urged the House to pass 'THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'.</p>

            <p>A group of UK MPs is calling for a levy on streaming services' revenue to help fund British TV production. The Culture, Media and Sport Committee suggests that streaming companies should pay 5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund. The report highlights the importance of distinctly British content and the challenges faced by independent producers. Netflix has expressed concerns that levies could diminish competitiveness and penalize audiences, while others suggest the levy risks damaging streamers' investment in the UK.</p>

Abrego Garcia, who had protected legal status, was deported to El Salvador despite escaping political violence in 2011. The White House maintains that Abrego Garcia was a member of MS-13, but his wife insists he is a loving father with no criminal convictions. A U.S. District Judge had ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego Garcia from El Salvador, but the Supreme Court Chief Justice delayed the deadline.</p>

            <p>China's consumer prices have fallen in March as the trade war with the US intensifies, with US President Donald Trump implementing a combined 125% in import duties on all Chinese goods. The national consumer price index (CPI) decreased by 0.1% year on year, reflecting continued deflationary pressures on the Chinese economy. Experts believe the trade war will exacerbate the downward pressure on prices as demand from the US declines, leaving Chinese producers with unsold inventory. The Chinese government is expected to launch a stimulus to boost domestic demand.</p>

A United Launch Alliance rocket carrying 27 Kuiper satellites was set to lift off from a launchpad in Cape Canaveral, Florida, but the launch was pushed outside its planned window due to heavy winds and clouds. Amazon is racing to compete with SpaceX's Starlink in the market, with a deadline to have half of its total constellation up in the air by July 2026. Commercial service is expected to come online later this year.</p>

            <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, is reportedly using 35 methane gas-burning turbines to power its supercomputer facility in Memphis without proper permits. The Southern Environmental Law Center claims these generators are a major source of air pollution and violate the Clean Air Act. The generators are located near residential neighborhoods that have historically dealt with industrial pollution, leading to concerns about increased cancer and asthma rates. The group is calling for an emergency order to cease the use of the generators and impose penalties for violations.</p>
