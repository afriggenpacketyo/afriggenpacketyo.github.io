          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has announced a new phase of operations in the Gaza Strip, involving extensive strikes and troop mobilization aimed at achieving operational control, securing the release of Israeli hostages, and dismantling Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to continue the Gaza operations "with full force," potentially following the conclusion of US President Donald Trump's visit to the region. The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry reports almost 53,000 Palestinian deaths since the conflict began in October 2023, figures deemed broadly reliable by the UN despite criticisms from Israel and the US. International organizations have criticized Israel's actions, citing deliberate starvation and ethnic cleansing, as the conflict continues to escalate. </p>

          <p>Severe storms, including a possible tornado, swept through St. Louis, resulting in at least five fatalities and extensive destruction. The storms tore roofs off buildings, shattered windows, and uprooted trees and power lines, affecting over 5,000 homes and leaving approximately 100,000 customers without electricity. A curfew was implemented in parts of the city as officials conducted building-to-building searches for potential victims, while nearby areas also experienced severe weather, including tornadoes and large hail. The National Weather Service confirmed a tornado above Venice, Illinois, and warned of severe weather across Appalachia and the Midwest, including the risk of strong tornadoes and damaging winds. </p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, significantly reducing visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue a dust storm warning, only the second time their Chicago office has done so and the first time including the city itself. High winds blowing over dry farmlands caused the dust storm, which forced drivers to pull over on Interstate 55 and delayed flights at Midway International Airport. Residents described the event as feeling like debris in the wind and dirt in their eyes, while some compared it to something out of history books.

          <p>Proposed cuts to Medicaid, a joint federal and state health insurance program for disabled and low-income Americans, are causing concern among those who rely on the program. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that these cuts could increase the number of uninsured Americans by at least 8.6 million by 2034. While some Republicans argue that the cuts will only eliminate fraud and abuse, many Medicaid recipients fear losing access to essential healthcare services.

          <p>Former German Finance Minister Christian Lindner criticized Chancellor Friedrich Merz's new government as he stepped down as chairman of the Free Democratic Party (FDP). Lindner argued that the government is delivering "more state and more debt" despite voters wanting less state intervention and more freedom. He warned that the government's new fiscal policy, which includes a €500 billion fund for infrastructure, could backfire economically. Christian Dürr was chosen to replace Lindner as FDP chairman. </p>
