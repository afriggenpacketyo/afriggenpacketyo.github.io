          <p>A large explosion and subsequent fire occurred at the Rajaei port in southern Iran, near Bandar Abbas, causing injuries to at least 115 people. The blast, which originated from containers at the port, resulted in billowing smoke and shattered windows kilometers away. While authorities have not yet determined the cause, they have ruled out energy infrastructure as the source. This incident occurred as Iran and the United States engaged in a third round of nuclear program negotiations in Oman, adding a layer of geopolitical context to the event.</p>

          <p>Hamas has expressed openness to a five-year truce with Israel in exchange for the release of all hostages seized during the October 7, 2023, attack.

          <p>The Chinese embassy in Washington has refuted claims made by President Trump that China and the United States are engaged in tariff negotiations. The embassy described Trump's assertions as "purely misleading," stating that no consultations or agreements on tariffs have been reached. This denial follows a pattern of conflicting statements between the two countries regarding trade relations. The conflicting reports highlight the ongoing tensions and uncertainty surrounding trade negotiations between China and the U.S.</p>

          <h2>Chimpanzees Display Empathy Similar to Bonobos, Study Finds</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Durham University study has found that chimpanzees exhibit empathetic behaviors, such as comforting distressed individuals, to a similar extent as bonobos. The research challenges the common perception of chimpanzees as violent and despotic compared to the more empathic bonobos. The study observed consolation behaviors like embracing and hand-holding in both species. The findings suggest that emotional sensitivity emerges early in ape development, potentially shedding light on the evolution of human social behavior.</p>
