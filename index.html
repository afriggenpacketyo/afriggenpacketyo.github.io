          <p>Two firefighters were killed and an unknown number of others were injured after being ambushed by at least one shooter while responding to a brush fire on Canfield Mountain in Idaho. The Kootenai County Sheriff described the event as an active sniper situation, with authorities taking fire from multiple directions. Law enforcement is investigating whether the fire was deliberately set to lure first responders into an attack. A shelter-in-place order has been issued for the area as the suspect remains at large, and the FBI is assisting local authorities in the ongoing investigation.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Istanbul detained over 50 people who attempted to participate in the city's annual LGBTQ+ Pride parade, which has been officially banned since 2015. The governor cited threats to "social peace, family structure, and moral values" as the reason for the ban, deploying a heavy police presence to prevent gatherings. Despite homosexuality not being a crime in Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government has increasingly adopted hostile rhetoric against the LGBTQ+ community. Human rights organizations have warned that this official stance is fostering an environment of increased discrimination and violence against LGBTQ+ individuals.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, a decision that followed threats from former President Trump to support a primary challenger against him. The conflict arose after Tillis opposed provisions in Trump's major tax and spending bill, citing potential cuts to Medicaid that would harm his state. In his statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and compromise in Washington, suggesting that independent thinkers are becoming an "endangered species." His departure opens up a key Senate seat in a state that has historically favored Republican presidential candidates.</p>

In New York, the theme was "Rise Up: Pride in Protest," commemorating the 1969 Stonewall Riots. Simultaneously, a massive Pride march in Budapest, Hungary, defied a government ban, highlighting the global nature of the struggle for LGBTQ+ rights against conservative political movements that have been cracking down on public expression and legal recognition.</p>

Kitagawa, who initially admitted to the charge, has since recanted and claimed the encounter was consensual. In a press conference, Hikari revealed a letter from Kitagawa in which he apologized but also asked her to remain silent, citing potential damage to the prosecutor's office and threatening suicide if the incident became public.</p>

He has denied the allegations, claiming he is a victim of political persecution.

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department is increasing its efforts to combat a significant rise in attacks against religious institutions, which have nearly doubled between 2021 and 2023 according to FBI data. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon described these attacks as a form of terrorism intended to intimidate communities and deter worship. The department has recently secured lengthy prison sentences in cases involving planned attacks on churches and is prioritizing hate crime investigations. The Southern Poverty Law Center notes that the surge is partly driven by white nationalism and the targeting of minority groups or congregations welcoming to LGBTQ communities.</p>

Enthusiasts spend significant time and money setting up trail cameras and searching for evidence, fueled by thousands of reported sightings and a deep-seated hope. This quest has also entered the scientific realm, with a de-extinction project at the University of Melbourne aiming to resurrect the species. Researchers are working to engineer the genome of the thylacine's closest living relative, the dunnart, to bring back the iconic marsupial predator, though some experts remain skeptical about the project's feasibility.</p>

          <p>A photo album belonging to Karl HÃ¶cker, a high-ranking SS officer at Auschwitz, provides a chilling glimpse into the daily lives of the camp's perpetrators. The photos, donated to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, show officers and staff socializing, singing, and enjoying leisure time, even as the extermination of over a million people was underway. Historians find the images terrifying because they depict the perpetrators as ordinary people, seemingly without remorse, participating in one of history's greatest atrocities. The album includes the only known photos of the infamous Dr. Josef Mengele at Auschwitz and has become the subject of a Pulitzer-nominated play, "Here There Are Blueberries."</p>

          <h2>U.S. Military Grapples with Threat of Drone Swarms over Sensitive National Security Sites</h2>

          <p>The U.S. military is confronting a significant national security challenge posed by mysterious drone swarms flying over sensitive sites, including nuclear facilities and air bases. A notable incident involved drones repeatedly appearing over Langley Air Force Base for 17 nights, forcing the relocation of advanced F-22 fighter jets. Despite the incursions, officials face major hurdles in responding due to outdated radar systems unable to track low-flying drones and legal restrictions on using force in domestic airspace. The Pentagon is now developing new detection systems and rapid-response "fly-away kits" to counter this emerging threat, which some officials believe could have a foreign intelligence nexus.</p>

          <p>Renowned German director Werner Herzog, now 82, is known for his extensive and unusual body of work, comprising over 70 films that explore the extremes of nature and human sanity. In a recent interview, he reflected on his career, from the grueling production of "Fitzcarraldo," where he famously had a real 340-ton steamship hauled over a mountain, to his unromantic view of nature as depicted in "Grizzly Man." Herzog, who never had formal film training, emphasizes the need for "good criminal energy" and real-life experience for aspiring filmmakers, even teaching unconventional skills like forging permits and lock-picking in his workshops.</p>

          <p>The investigation into a photo album from Auschwitz, belonging to SS officer Karl HÃ¶cker, has shed light on the young female secretaries, or "Helferinnen," who worked at the concentration camp. These women, often recruited from the Nazi party's League of German Girls, were true believers in the ideology and played a crucial role in the camp's operations. Their duties included communicating information about train arrivals and the number of prisoners selected for labor versus the gas chambers. This article reveals that despite their seemingly mundane roles, they were direct participants in the machinery of the Holocaust, a reality that complicates their depiction in the album.</p>

          <p>The U.S. faces significant challenges in stopping drone swarms over sensitive military and civilian sites due to a combination of technological, legal, and jurisdictional issues. Modern drones can evade standard radar, and countermeasures like shooting them down or jamming their frequencies pose significant risks to public safety and civilian infrastructure in domestic airspace. Furthermore, a lack of a single, empowered agency to handle such incidents complicates a coordinated response. To address these gaps, the military is developing "fly-away kits" with advanced detection and counter-drone technology, aiming to have a rapid response capability within the next year.</p>

While the 787 had operated for nearly 15 years without a single fatality, it has been plagued by production and quality control issues, particularly at its South Carolina plant. Multiple whistleblowers have alleged that pressure to speed up production led to compromised safety standards, including the use of substandard parts and flawed assembly processes. Boeing has consistently denied these claims, but the crash has brought renewed attention to concerns that hidden defects could exist in the fleet.</p>

The genre has a large following among young Chinese women, who see it as a creative outlet to explore desire in a culture where female sexuality is often policed.
