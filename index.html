          <h2>UK Economy Experiences Unexpected Contraction for Second Consecutive Month</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 04:48:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1% in May, marking the second straight month of contraction and challenging the government's goal of fostering economic growth. The Office for National Statistics attributed the decline primarily to a drop in manufacturing, oil and gas extraction, and weak retail sales. Despite the monthly downturn, the economy saw 0.5% growth in the March-to-May period compared to the previous three months, buoyed by stronger activity earlier in the year. Chancellor Rachel Reeves acknowledged the figures were disappointing but affirmed her determination to stimulate growth amid a fragile economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of a person who appeared to fire a weapon at federal law enforcement officers. The incident occurred in Camarillo, California, during clashes between protesters and agents conducting immigration-related operations at a local farm. U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli released images and video of the suspect, who was wearing a black T-shirt and a white medical mask. Authorities have emphasized that any attacks on federal agents will be met with the full force of the law as the investigation continues. </p>

          <p>A major price war has erupted in China's "instant commerce" sector, with giants like JD.com, Alibaba, and Meituan offering massive subsidies to dominate the rapid delivery market. This competition has resulted in extremely low prices for consumers, such as coffee for $0.28, but has negatively impacted the companies' stock values. The conflict has escalated to include accusations of anti-competitive practices and has drawn scrutiny from Chinese market regulators concerned about the economic effects. Despite record order volumes, the long-term impact on the companies' profitability remains a significant concern for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's cricket captain, Ben Stokes, has been declared fit to resume playing on the second day of the third Test against India at Lord's. Stokes experienced a right groin issue on the first day while batting, raising concerns about his ability to continue in the crucial match. After receiving on-field treatment and bowling before the start of play on Friday, he was cleared to continue his innings. The decision provides a significant boost for England, though his vice-captain noted the importance of managing Stokes's physical condition carefully given his history of injuries.</p>

          <p>Germany's lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, held a crucial vote to appoint three new judges to the Federal Constitutional Court. The process highlighted political tensions, as electing a judge requires a two-thirds majority, potentially making the conservative bloc reliant on votes from the far-right AfD party. The Social Democrats nominated two law professors, while the conservatives proposed a federal labor court judge. The vote occurred as the upper house, the Bundesrat, considered a major corporate tax cut package aimed at boosting the German economy, reflecting a busy day in German federal politics.</p>

          <p>As millions in Yorkshire face a hosepipe ban due to drought conditions and low reservoir levels, many residents are expressing frustration over significant water leaks going unrepaired. The ban, the UK's first of the year, restricts water use for activities like gardening and car washing, with fines up to £1,000 for violations. However, citizens have reported numerous instances of water pouring down streets for weeks from leaks that the utility company, Yorkshire Water, has failed to fix. This has led to public anger over being asked to conserve water while the company loses an estimated 260 million litres daily to leakage.</p>

With the US set to host major events like the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Olympics, the country's turn inward under the Trump administration creates a strange paradox. The article argues that the commercial appeal of the US is being undermined by policies like travel bans and tariffs, which conflict with the internationalist spirit of these global sporting events.

          <p>Julie Eadeh, a career U.S. diplomat who served as the political section chief at the American consulate in Hong Kong during the 2019 anti-government protests, is reportedly the leading candidate to become the next consul general. Her name has allegedly been presented to Chinese authorities for approval, a necessary step for the appointment. Eadeh's potential return to a prominent role in Hong Kong is significant given her previous tenure during a period of intense political turmoil and strained U.S.-China relations. The final decision now rests on receiving a green light from Beijing.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration escalated global trade tensions this week by threatening numerous countries with new tariffs, to be implemented by August 1 if deals are not reached. Powerhouse suppliers like Japan and South Korea face potential tariffs of at least 25%, while Canada was targeted with a 35% levy. Steeper rates up to 50% were announced for other nations, including Brazil and developing countries in Southeast Asia. Despite the widespread threats and market uncertainty, the US has so far only secured new trade agreements with the UK and Vietnam, leaving the global economic landscape in a state of confusion.

          <p>The global pharmaceutical industry is in a state of alarm over President Trump's threat to impose a 200% tariff on foreign-made drugs. Analysts warn that such a steep levy would severely disrupt supply chains, compress corporate profit margins, and lead to significant drug shortages and price hikes for U.S. consumers. While the administration suggested a grace period of about 18 months, industry experts say this is insufficient time for companies to relocate complex manufacturing operations to the U.S. Firms are now engaged in scenario planning while hoping for sector-specific carve-outs in future trade deals.

          <p>The White House faced widespread ridicule on social media after posting a digitally altered image depicting President Donald Trump in a Superman costume. The post, which included the hero's slogan "Truth, Justice And The American Way," coincided with the release of a new Superman movie and right-wing criticism of the film's themes. Critics online quickly responded to the bizarre post, with many suggesting that the president was playing the role of a villain rather than a hero. The incident was widely shared and mocked as a strange and out-of-touch communications effort from the administration.</p>

The 84-year-old Labour peer, a BMA member since 1964, argued that the five-day walkout over pay is inappropriate when the country is struggling and that it ignores the vulnerability of patients. The BMA is in a dispute with the government over pay restoration, but Lord Winston believes the strike action could damage public trust in the medical profession, urging doctors to consider their responsibilities more seriously.</p>
