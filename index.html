          <p>A gunman killed a New York City police officer and three civilians in a Midtown Manhattan office building, with one person critically injured. The suspect, Shane D. Tamura, 27, died by suicide after a rampage that involved firing a high-powered rifle on multiple floors of the 44-story building at 345 Park Avenue, which houses major firms like Blackstone and the NFL. NYPD Officer Didarul Islam, a 36-year-old immigrant and four-year veteran, was on a paid security detail and is being honored as a hero for his actions, leaving behind a pregnant wife and two young sons. The incident has left the city mourning, with officials condemning the "despicable attack" as investigations into the motive continue.</p>

          <p>Large investment firms like BlackRock and Blackstone are actively acquiring utility companies, aiming to profit from grid upgrades driven by increasing energy demand from data centers. This trend is sparking alarm among consumer advocates and regulators who fear that profit motives will override public service, potentially leading to higher electricity bills for households. An administrative law judge in Minnesota has recommended denying BlackRock's bid for Minnesota Power, citing concerns about the pursuit of excessive profits. While proponents argue these investments can modernize aging infrastructure, critics emphasize the need for regulation to balance investment with energy affordability for Americans.

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has called on Technology Secretary Peter Kyle to apologize for suggesting that Farage, by opposing the government's new online safety law, was siding with sexual offenders like Jimmy Savile. Reform UK advocates for repealing the law, arguing it fails to protect children and stifles free speech, while Kyle asserts the act is a significant step in preventing harmful content from reaching children. The new regulations mandate stricter age verification and swift action against harmful content, with non-compliance incurring substantial fines. This contentious exchange highlights deep divisions over balancing online safety with freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>Russian forces launched a series of glide bomb and ballistic missile attacks across Ukraine, killing at least 22 people, including 17 inmates in a prison in Zaporizhzhia and four in the Dnipro region. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned these "conscious, deliberate strikes" as Russia continues its bombardment of civilian areas. The attacks persist despite President Trump's escalated ultimatum, giving Russia 10 to 12 days to cease hostilities or face sanctions and tariffs. Moscow, however, rejected Trump's deadline, with a top official warning against "playing the ultimatum game with Russia," signaling continued geopolitical confrontation.</p>

          <p>In a horrific incident in northern Zamfara state, kidnappers in Nigeria killed at least 35 of the 56 people they abducted from Banga village, even after a ransom was paid. The victims, mostly young individuals, were "slaughtered like rams," according to a local official, with survivors forced to witness the brutal killings. Three pregnant women reportedly gave birth in captivity, but their newborns died due to lack of care. Despite a 2022 law criminalizing ransom payments, families often feel compelled to pay, highlighting the government's struggle to ensure safety and combat the lucrative kidnapping industry.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is expected to keep its key short-term interest rate unchanged this week, maintaining the federal funds rate between 4.25% and 4.5% since December.

Credit card rates have slightly nudged down to around 20.1% from a peak near 21%, while auto loans and 30-year fixed mortgages have seen very little movement. Experts note that a Fed rate cut doesn't guarantee lower consumer costs, as mortgage rates are more tied to Treasury yields and the broader economy, potentially rising with increased inflation.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) announced plans to "tighten oversight" and phase out outdated production capacity in crowded manufacturing sectors, including electric vehicles (EVs) and solar power. This initiative aims to combat excessive competition and promote high-tech consumer goods as part of a broader strategy to revive domestic demand. The ministry will strengthen mandatory national standards to force out inefficient operations. Concurrently, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation pledged to regulate "low-quality, cut-price competition," signaling a concerted effort to optimize industrial output and ensure healthier market practices.

          <p>World Rugby's chief executive, Alan Gilpin, has dismissed Australia coach Joe Schmidt's claim that a controversial clearout leading to the British and Irish Lions' match-winning try violated player welfare. Schmidt argued the decision to allow Hugo Keenan's try, despite a potential head contact during a ruck clearout, went against the sport's safety focus. Gilpin defended the match officials, stating they "stand by their decision" after review and emphasized World Rugby's significant investment in player welfare research and technology. While acknowledging the complexity of rugby laws and the controversy, Gilpin highlighted the need to balance physical contest with player safety.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest the UK could be an unexpected beneficiary of the new EU-U.S. trade agreement, which imposes a 15% tariff on most EU goods imported to the U.S., compared to the UK's 10% levy. This tariff differential could make British exports relatively cheaper, potentially boosting UK trade as American firms might favor British products. Additionally, EU-based manufacturers with tight profit margins may consider relocating some production to the UK to avoid higher tariffs, leveraging the UK's spare manufacturing capacity post-Brexit. While both the UK and EU face a tougher trade environment, the deal averts a more severe transatlantic trade war, which also benefits the UK. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK food price inflation rose to 4% in July, marking the sixth consecutive monthly increase, primarily driven by higher meat and tea costs, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC). Tighter global supplies for these staples have significantly impacted wholesale prices, contributing to an expected £275 increase in annual household grocery bills. While fresh food inflation remained steady, cupboard goods saw a rise to 5.1%. Experts attribute the surge in meat prices to factors like avian flu and reduced stock intensity in chicken farming.
