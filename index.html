        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coinbase shares experienced a significant drop on Tuesday after the company revealed plans for a $2 billion private offering of convertible senior notes. This decline contributes to a more than 30% fall from its record high in July, a peak reached amid legislative momentum for cryptocurrency. Despite a disappointing second-quarter revenue report, some analysts remain optimistic, citing potential gains from new laws, rising bitcoin prices, and the expanding Ethereum ecosystem. The stock's recent volatility comes after it joined the S&P 500 in May and is still up for the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of current interest rates reveals the potential earnings from a $500 Certificate of Deposit (CD) opened this month, with returns varying by term length. For example, a one-year CD at 4.40% could yield $22, while a five-year CD at 4.15% could generate over $112. The article notes that while these returns are modest, they are guaranteed, which is an advantage with potential interest rate cuts looming. It also compares CDs to high-yield savings accounts, which offer similar rates but with more flexibility and variable interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korean national team captain Son Heung-min is transferring from Tottenham to the Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC) for a record-breaking MLS transfer fee, reportedly around $26 million. The move is seen as a monumental event, particularly for Southern California's large Korean community, drawing comparisons to major signings by the Dodgers. Beyond the community impact, the acquisition is expected to boost LAFC's performance, increase the MLS's global profile, and help Son acclimate to North America ahead of the 2026 World Cup. The deal is considered a strategic investment for LAFC, which expects to recoup the cost through sponsorships and media rights.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A spending package enacted by President Donald Trump will introduce significant changes to the charitable tax deduction for high-income individuals starting in 2026. The new rules will establish a "floor," allowing deductions only for amounts exceeding 0.5% of adjusted gross income, and will also cap the benefit for those in the top 37% tax bracket. Financial planners advise proactive strategies, such as "bunching" several years of donations into 2025 using a donor-advised fund to maximize the current, more generous deductions. The legislation also introduces a new, limited charitable deduction for non-itemizers who donate cash. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Great Barrier Reef has suffered its most severe annual decline in coral cover since record-keeping began nearly 40 years ago, according to the Australian Institute of Marine Science. A recent survey found that the northern and southern sections of the reef experienced their most widespread coral bleaching event to date, primarily driven by heat stress from climate change. The report warns that the ecosystem may be approaching a tipping point where it cannot recover between catastrophic events, threatening the vast biodiversity it supports. While efforts to cull coral-eating crown-of-thorns starfish have shown some success, experts emphasize the need for urgent climate action to save the reef.</p>

          <p>Veteran quarterback Teddy Bridgewater is returning to the NFL, with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers intending to sign him. The 32-year-old is coming out of retirement for the second time to join a quarterback room that includes Baker Mayfield and Kyle Trask. The move follows Bridgewater's recent suspension from his coaching position at his Miami high school alma mater for allegedly providing financial benefits to players. Bridgewater, who has played for six NFL teams over 10 seasons, most recently joined the Detroit Lions for their 2023 playoff run before officially retiring earlier this year.</p>

Under the deal, Rwanda will provide the deportees with workforce training, healthcare, and accommodation, while retaining the right to approve each individual. The arrangement is part of President Trump's broader mass deportation initiative and involves migrants whose home countries have refused to accept their return. The deal echoes a previous, now-scrapped agreement Rwanda had with the U.K., and has drawn criticism from human rights experts concerned about third-country removals and Rwanda's own human rights record.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Open Network shows that a cancer diagnosis leads to a substantial increase in monthly out-of-pocket costs for privately insured patients. The research found that costs jumped by an average of $592 per month in the six months following a diagnosis. This financial burden grows as the disease progresses, with costs for stage 4 cancer patients rising by nearly $720 per month compared to non-cancer patients. The report highlights the financial toxicity of cancer treatment even for the insured and underscores the need for policy reforms like paid sick leave to support patients.</p>

          <h2>CDC to Release Delayed Overdose Prevention Funds, But Other Programs Face New Freeze</h2>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is set to release $140 million in delayed funding for its Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) program, which states rely on to combat the fentanyl crisis. According to CDC staffers, this and other previously frozen funds are being disbursed after months of delays from the Trump administration. However, a new challenge has emerged as the Office of Management and Budget has now frozen the budget lines for several dozen other specific CDC programs. These newly frozen programs primarily address chronic diseases, youth violence, and injury prevention, creating continued funding uncertainty within the agency.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues Pro-Israel Right is Shifting the Definition of Anti-Semitism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 14:35:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece in The Atlantic argues that a segment of the pro-Israel right is actively shifting the definition of anti-Semitism to encompass most criticism of Israel while downplaying traditional forms of Jew-hatred. The author points to instances where critics of Israeli policy, including Jewish Senator Bernie Sanders, are accused of "blood libel," a term for a medieval anti-Semitic slander. This rhetorical strategy, the article contends, mirrors illiberal tactics from the left and provides cover for political figures who engage in genuinely anti-Semitic tropes. The author warns that this devalues the charge of anti-Semitism and harms the fight against it.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly considering a plan for the full military occupation of the Gaza Strip as the war approaches its 22nd month. According to Israeli media, Netanyahu discussed options with the army chief and favors a complete takeover, a move that would require approval from the security cabinet. This potential escalation comes despite reported concerns from military leaders about the high risks to both Israeli troops and the remaining hostages held in Gaza. The news has drawn criticism from figures like former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who warned it would lead to an endless war with many casualties.</p>

          <p>Austin Drummond, the 28-year-old suspect accused of killing four family members in Tennessee, was captured on Tuesday, ending a weeklong manhunt. The investigation began after an infant was found abandoned in a car seat, which led authorities to discover the bodies of the child's mother, uncle, grandmother, and the mother's partner. Drummond, who was reportedly dating a close relative of the victims, now faces four counts of first-degree murder. The search involved a reward of up to $32,500, and authorities had warned that the suspect was armed and dangerous.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service has announced it will restore and reinstall a bronze statue of Confederate General Albert Pike that was toppled by protestors in Washington D.C. during 2020. The agency stated the restoration aligns with historic preservation laws and a recent executive order from President Trump to "beautify the nation's capital." The statue, the only one of a Confederate general in D.C., has long been controversial, and its removal was a key moment during the social justice protests following George Floyd's murder. D.C.'s House delegate has announced plans to reintroduce a bill to have the statue permanently removed.</p>

          <p>Health officials in Florida are warning of the dangers of consuming unpasteurized raw milk after 21 people were sickened by bacteria linked to a single farm. The outbreak, involving E. coli and campylobacter, has hospitalized seven people and caused severe complications in two. While it is illegal to sell raw milk for human consumption in Florida, it can be sold as pet food, a loophole that has allowed its popularity to grow. The CDC and FDA maintain that pasteurization is necessary to kill harmful bacteria, stating that raw milk offers no nutritional benefits over pasteurized milk.</p>

          <p>An article from The Atlantic provides a harrowing account of a family of seven's struggle to survive amidst the famine in Gaza. It follows Asala Ferany as she tries to feed her five children, including a one-year-old daughter suffering from severe acute malnutrition, with meager aid rations and a single daily meal from a community kitchen. The family, displaced five times, lives in a makeshift tent where essentials like milk, medicine, and soap have vanished, and market food prices are staggeringly high.

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation has concluded that the catastrophic implosion of the Titan submersible in June 2023, which killed five people, was preventable. The final report states that owner OceanGate used "intimidation tactics" and exploited regulatory loopholes to operate outside established safety protocols for years. Investigators found the vessel's design was flawed, its structural integrity was likely compromised in prior incidents, and the company fostered a "toxic" safety culture where concerns were ignored. The report places significant blame on CEO Stockton Rush, stating his overconfidence and negligence contributed directly to the tragedy.</p>
