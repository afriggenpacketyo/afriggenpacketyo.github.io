        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registered 49.8 in September, signaling a smaller-than-expected contraction in factory activity. This reading, the strongest since March, offers a nuanced perspective as Beijing intensifies efforts to curb industrial overcapacity amid persistent sluggish domestic demand and global trade disruptions. The article highlights that the index has remained below the 50-benchmark, separating growth from contraction, since April. Manufacturers continue to face challenges from tepid domestic consumption and the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on exports to the world's largest consumer market, necessitating ongoing government support measures.

          <p>Zijin Gold, the overseas gold-mining arm of China's partially state-owned Zijin Mining, saw its shares surge over 60% during its Hong Kong trading debut. The company raised nearly 25 billion Hong Kong dollars (about $3.2 billion), making it the world's second-largest initial public offering this year. This successful listing follows a resurgence in Hong Kong's IPO market and occurs as spot gold prices have reached record highs, driven by safe-haven demand, anticipated rate cuts, and global economic uncertainty.

          <p>An opinion article suggests that Hong Kong should serve as China's primary gateway to the United Nations, advocating for the city to host the UN's Asia headquarters. The author argues this move would aid UN reforms and align with Beijing's vision for global governance, leveraging Hong Kong's unique attributes like its common law system, English as an official language, and low corporate taxes. Positioning Hong Kong in this role could enhance China's engagement with the UN, where it is the second-largest donor.

          <p>Afghanistan is experiencing a total internet blackout after the Taliban government cut fibre-optic cables nationwide, citing "immorality" as the reason. This action follows weeks of internet disruptions in various provinces, severely impacting mobile internet, satellite TV, and international news agencies' contact with offices in Kabul. The article highlights that this move aligns with the Taliban's imposition of numerous restrictions since 2021, based on their interpretation of Islamic Sharia law. Business leaders had previously warned of severe economic repercussions if the internet ban continued, leading to concerns about the country's isolation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge temporarily suspended the Trump administration's plan to eliminate 532 jobs at the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the parent agency of Voice of America (VOA). The ruling prevents the job cuts, which represent the majority of VOA's remaining staff, from taking effect. This decision follows previous rulings by Judge Royce Lamberth, who ordered the restoration of VOA programming and blocked the removal of its director. The judge accused the administration of "concerning disrespect" towards the court, as employees argued the cuts would hinder VOA's statutory mission to provide reliable news globally.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's campaign of vengeance, aimed at retaliating against perceived past injustices, is proving shortsighted and counterproductive. The author cites examples such as the attempted censorship of Jimmy Kimmel, which only boosted the comedian's popularity, and the "flimsy" prosecution of former FBI Director James Comey, which risks appearing as prosecutorial misconduct. The article suggests that while the presidency offers power, it is not absolute, and Trump's efforts to silence critics or use state power for intimidation are being met with resistance. It posits that his strategy risks alienating supporters who value his rebellious image.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has reiterated his threat to impose a 100% tariff on all films not produced in the United States, asserting that the American film industry has been "stolen" by other countries. He claimed this levy would "solve this long time, never ending problem," particularly benefiting California. The announcement follows a recent wave of tariffs on other imports. Industry experts, including the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, expressed deep concern, warning that such tariffs would punish U.S. studios, drive up costs, and jeopardize thousands of jobs in both economies. The article highlights confusion over the tariff's implementation and potential impact on streaming services. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite their contact details being passed to authorities, police stated not everyone who contacts them would be interviewed. The article highlights the family's anger and a former detective's belief that the lack of interviews constitutes "sloppy police work."</p>

James exercised his player option for the current season, making him a free agent next summer if he doesn't retire or sign an extension.

          <p>This article provides a reality check on President Trump's newly presented 20-point peace plan for Gaza, delivered alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While Trump optimistically declared it a path to "eternal peace," the analysis highlights significant unresolved disagreements. The plan proposes Hamas releasing hostages for Palestinian prisoners, Israeli withdrawal to a security perimeter, and a temporary governance by qualified Palestinians and international experts, including Tony Blair. However, fundamental obstacles remain, such as Hamas's likely refusal to disarm and Israel's reluctance to fully withdraw. The article suggests Netanyahu might be counting on Hamas's rejection, potentially gaining U.S. backing to "finish the job."</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer believes a looming government shutdown will have a minimal impact on the stock market, citing historical data that shows mixed market reactions to past shutdowns. His primary concern is the potential delay in releasing key economic data, which could complicate the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. Cramer differentiates a shutdown from a debt ceiling default, assuring that U.S. bondholders will still be paid. While acknowledging the shutdown would hurt furloughed federal workers and potentially reduce GDP growth, he suggests that delayed data collection, though an inconvenience for the Fed, is not a reason for major market concern.

The plan also prioritizes advances in the exploration of critical metals like copper, lithium, and nickel, alongside developing ultra-pure materials and enhancing recycling efforts.
