          <p>A 13-year-old boy in New Zealand required emergency surgery after ingesting between 80 and 100 high-powered magnets, leading to the loss of part of his bowel. The magnets, reportedly purchased from the online retailer Temu, clamped together inside his intestines, causing pressure necrosis, a condition where tissue dies due to prolonged pressure. This case highlights the dangers of small, powerful magnets often sold as toys, which are banned in New Zealand but still accessible online. The incident has renewed calls for better enforcement of regulations on such hazardous products available through e-commerce platforms.</p>

          <p>Senator JD Vance criticized New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani for comments made at a campaign event, suggesting Mamdani framed his aunt as the "real victim of 9/11" due to facing prejudice while wearing a hijab. Mamdani's original statement was part of a broader address about the suspicion and discrimination faced by Muslims in New York City following the attacks. The exchange comes amid a heated mayoral race where Mamdani has also accused his opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, of engaging in Islamophobic rhetoric after a radio host speculated Mamdani would cheer for another 9/11-style attack.</p>

          <p>The popular passive investment strategy of buying S&P 500 index-tracking ETFs, like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), may be losing favor among investors seeking better diversification. Financial experts note that the S&P 500 has become heavily weighted towards the technology sector, which now comprises a record high of over 35% of the index. This concentration has led traders to explore other areas, such as small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 index recently outperforming the S&P 500. This shift indicates a broader search for returns beyond the market's largest companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reclusive billionaire Timothy Mellon, a major financial backer of Donald Trump, has been identified as the anonymous donor who gave $130 million to help pay U.S. troops during the ongoing government shutdown. The donation, which President Trump had praised without naming the source, equates to about $100 per service member. The legality of the contribution has been questioned, as it may violate the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from accepting voluntary services or spending unappropriated funds. Mellon is one of the top political donors in the 2024 election cycle, having given over $165 million to support Republican candidates.</p>

          <p>The upcoming ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur is set against a backdrop of escalating rivalry between the United States and China, forcing member nations into a difficult geopolitical balancing act. While the official agenda covers economic integration and security, the underlying tension revolves around trade disputes, the status of Taiwan, and conflicting claims in the South China Sea. Many Southeast Asian countries are wary of being pressured to choose sides, as both superpowers vie for influence in security, technology, and trade. Consequently, nations like the Philippines and Indonesia are pursuing a strategy of maintaining security ties with the U.S. while fostering crucial economic relationships with China.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the EU is actively working to end its dependency on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for manufacturing smartphones, electric vehicles, and military technology. The move is a response to Beijing's recent export curbs, which have disrupted European industries and are seen as a strategic leverage tool in global trade disputes. The EU's strategy involves securing alternative sources through partnerships with countries like Australia and Canada, boosting domestic production and processing, and significantly increasing the recycling of critical raw materials from used products like batteries.</p>

          <p>Christopher Moynihan, a Capitol rioter who received a presidential pardon from Donald Trump, has been arrested for allegedly threatening to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. According to court documents, Moynihan sent text messages stating his intent to "eliminate" Jeffries at an event in New York City. This incident highlights concerns about recidivism among the more than 1,500 pardoned January 6th defendants, some of whom have committed subsequent crimes. The arrest also comes amid a sharp increase in threats against members of Congress, with Capitol Police reporting over 14,000 threat investigations in 2025 alone.</p>

          <p>California's Proposition 50, which would allow Democrats to redraw congressional districts to create five new safe seats, is being marketed to voters as a direct countermeasure to Republican gerrymandering in states like Texas. The campaign, led by Governor Gavin Newsom, frames the vote as an opportunity to "fight fire with fire" and oppose Donald Trump, a strategy that appears to be resonating in a state where the former president is deeply unpopular. While opponents call it a partisan power grab that undermines the state's independent redistricting commission, polls suggest a majority of Californians are willing to support the measure as a way to push back against national Republican tactics.</p>

          <p>A woman is in a difficult situation with her two sisters over a $160,000 inherited home after agreeing to buy out their shares. The conflict arose when her mortgage lender advised that the transaction should be a cash-out refinance, not a new purchase, and that a realtor was unnecessary for the intra-family buyout. However, her sisters are insisting that the realtor who initially listed the property remain involved and handle all paperwork, even demanding earnest money. This has created a stalemate, with the woman caught between her lender's professional guidance and her family's reliance on the real estate agent.</p>

The author notes that the 2025 U.S. National Defense Authorization Act includes a blockchain testing program, indicating that digital assets are being recognized as a significant strategic tool.

Designed by the U.S. Capitol's first architect, the home was spared destruction because a French ambassador was staying there, allowing the French flag to fly over it. During their six-month stay, President Madison signed the Treaty of Ghent in the house's circular office, officially ending the War of 1812.

          <p>A new study has found that nearly 18% of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in a Southern California patient group were caused by E. coli strains genetically linked to contaminated meat from local grocery stores. Researchers used genomic analysis to trace the infections, finding that turkey and chicken were the most common sources, followed by pork and beef. The findings suggest that foodborne pathogens are a more significant cause of UTIs than previously understood and that improved food safety practices could reduce their incidence. The study also noted a higher risk of foodborne UTIs in lower-income areas, pointing to potential systemic issues in food supply and handling.</p>

This halt in talks could prolong steep tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum, which are key components in many manufactured products.

          <p>A new report reveals that more than a third of Manhattan condos resold between July 2024 and June 2025 were sold at a loss, indicating a decade of stagnant prices in the market. The median price per square foot for condos has remained essentially flat for ten years, a stark contrast to the significant home price increases seen across most of the U.S. When accounting for inflation, transaction costs, and renovations, the actual losses for sellers are likely even higher. The luxury market, with sales over $10 million, was the exception, consistently yielding double-digit profits for sellers. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan was reportedly formulated based on extensive investigations during Xi's national tours throughout the year, with multiple revisions made by the Politburo Standing Committee before its presentation.

However, the reliance on this technology was highlighted when an Amazon Web Services outage caused high-tech Eight Sleep beds to malfunction, trapping some users in upright positions or at extreme temperatures. While some sleep tech, like devices for PTSD-related nightmares, can be beneficial, the increasing integration of technology into sleep routines introduces new points of failure.

While her win was not a landslide, it is seen as an expression of unease among party members who feel Labour is losing political momentum. Powell has indicated she will articulate her critiques of the party's direction privately, but her return to a senior elected role signals a period of internal adjustment for Labour.</p>

This trend, sometimes called "bridesmaid inflation," forces loved ones to spend significant time and money to participate in the celebration.
