          <p>U.S. crude oil prices plummeted below $60 a barrel, reaching their lowest level since 2021, driven by concerns that President Trump's global tariffs could trigger a recession. The decision by OPEC+ to increase production and Saudi Aramco's price cuts further contributed to the downward pressure. Investors are worried that tariffs will increase business costs, leading to an economic slowdown and reduced demand for oil. &#x3C;br&#x3E; &#x3C;i&#x3E;(not investment advice)&#x3C;/i&#x3E;</p>
