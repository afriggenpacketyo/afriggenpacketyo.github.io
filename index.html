          <p>A broken water control valve has left thousands of households in Los Angeles without service during a heatwave. Officials are urging residents, even those with restored water, to cease usage to allow a 10-million-gallon tank to refill and pressurize, a process crucial for completing repairs. The Department of Water and Power is working to fix the valve, which is 20 feet underground, and hopes to restore full service by Monday morning, but progress is dependent on residents' cooperation. The situation was complicated when a temporary pipe failed, further delaying the repair efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A social media account linked to China's state broadcaster CCTV has declared Nvidia's H20 AI chips unsafe for the Chinese market, alleging they contain a hardware "backdoor" for remote shutdowns. This follows a summons from China's cyberspace watchdog demanding Nvidia address potential security vulnerabilities. The article states the chips, developed for China after U.S. export restrictions, are neither advanced nor environmentally friendly. This public criticism signals escalating tech tensions and pressure on Nvidia to prove the security of its products to regain trust in the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>Northern China is experiencing its traditional rainy season with significant impact, marking the fifth major flood disaster in the region since 2012. This year's late-July storms have been unusual as they primarily affected the northern parts of Beijing. This contrasts with severe floods in 2016 and 2023, which were concentrated in the city's southern areas. The recurring and shifting nature of these extreme weather events highlights ongoing environmental and infrastructural challenges for the capital city. The article provides context on the historical pattern of flooding in the region.</p>

          <p>New Barcelona signing Marcus Rashford is set for his home debut, but his first weeks have been marked by significant club chaos, including a dispute over the registration of new players due to financial issues. A conflict with captain Marc-Andre ter Stegen nearly delayed Rashford's eligibility, but a resolution should allow him to play in the La Liga opener. The club is also racing to complete renovations on its Nou Camp stadium, forcing early games to be played away or at a small training ground. Despite the off-field drama, Rashford has impressed in pre-season, scoring his first goal.</p>

          <p>Simon Tisdall argues that the world is facing a renewed and perilous nuclear arms race, marked by Russia's formal withdrawal from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty and provocative rhetoric from both Russian and U.S. leaders. The piece highlights the deployment of new hypersonic missiles and the buildup of nuclear-capable hardware across Europe, transforming it into a potential nuclear battleground. Despite the Doomsday Clock being closer to midnight than ever, public opposition is strangely muted compared to the anti-nuclear movements of the 1980s. The author calls for a revival of public awareness to halt the slide towards potential global extinction.</p>

Various publicly funded projects and non-profits like 'Work for Refugees' are addressing these challenges.

          <h2>CDC Employees Express Fear and Lack of Surprise Following Violent Attack on Atlanta Campus</h2>

          <p>In the wake of a deadly shooting at the CDC's Atlanta headquarters, some longtime employees expressed that they were terrified but not shocked by the violence. They attribute the attack to an escalating climate of hostility against public health workers, fueled by verbal attacks from high-profile politicians and anti-vaccine activists. Staffers noted the sluggish response from government leadership following the incident, viewing it as the latest sign of abandonment. The attack, which left one police officer and the gunman dead, has intensified feelings of vulnerability among employees who now feel at risk.</p>

          <p>The rapidly growing Lee Fire in northwestern Colorado has prompted the evacuation of 179 inmates from the Rifle Correctional Center. The Colorado Department of Corrections announced the transfer of the inmates to other secure facilities as a precautionary measure. As of Saturday evening, the wildfire had burned over 92,000 acres, becoming the sixth-largest in the state's recent history, with only 6% containment. Shifting winds on Friday caused the fire to advance southward, triggering new evacuation orders in Rio Blanco and Garfield counties, where the minimum-security prison is located.</p>
