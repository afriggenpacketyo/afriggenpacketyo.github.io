        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has dismissed criticism over the demolition of parts of the White House's East Wing as "manufactured outrage." The construction is for a new 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project President Trump has stated will be financed by himself and private donors. Amid public anger and concern from some lawmakers, the Treasury Department has reportedly asked its staff not to share photos of the demolition, citing potential security risks. The project highlights ongoing controversial changes to the historic presidential residence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed administrative claims demanding $230 million in compensation from the Department of Justice. The claims are related to the investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election and his handling of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence. The New York Times reported that these claims often precede lawsuits and could present a conflict of interest, as any settlement might require approval from his own appointees. Trump publicly acknowledged the awkwardness of essentially suing his own government while in office.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a major heist at the Louvre museum, the French Ministry of Culture has confirmed that the stolen crown jewels were not privately insured. French law typically prohibits state-owned collections from being insured unless they are on loan, meaning the state itself bears the financial loss. Experts explain this is standard practice for national museums in France, where collections are considered state property. The estimated value of the stolen items is over $100 million, but this loss will not be covered by any insurance payout.</p>

          <p>A high court in Bogotá has overturned the bribery conviction of former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe, who was previously sentenced to house arrest for witness tampering and procedural fraud. The court ruled that the charges were not proven "beyond reasonable doubt," citing methodological errors and biased evaluation of evidence in the initial sentence. Uribe, who served from 2002 to 2010, had been accused of bribing former paramilitary members to lie about his alleged ties to their groups. The case has been a source of political division within Colombia and has strained relations with the U.S.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve having cut interest rates multiple times, the window for securing high-yield certificate of deposit (CD) accounts is closing. While rates are lower than in previous years, they remain competitive compared to traditional savings accounts, offering a fixed return in an uncertain economic climate. Financial experts suggest that savers looking to lock in current rates, which can still be found around 4%, should act quickly before anticipated future rate cuts further diminish returns. The opportunity to earn significant interest on accounts like a $10,000 CD may not return for several years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former ESPN personality Sam Ponder has publicly shared her frustration after her middle school daughter competed against a transgender girl in a basketball tournament in New York City. Ponder described the opponent as an "obviously naturally born boy" and expressed that watching the physical dominance was "maddening," while placing blame on the parents rather than the child. Her comments add to the ongoing national debate over the participation of transgender athletes in female sports. The Trump administration has issued an executive order on the matter, though its implementation is contested in several states.</p>

This test compares an individual's household income over the last six months to their state's median income for a similar-sized household. If income is below the median, qualification is likely; if above, a more detailed calculation of disposable income after expenses is required.

Dr. Jon LaPook explains that while they can increase calorie burn and improve cardiovascular workload, they also act as a mini stress test on the heart, making it important for those with health conditions to consult a doctor. To avoid injury, it is recommended to start with a light weight, such as 5% of one's body weight, and ensure the vest fits properly to prevent stress on joints.

          <p>Japan has elected Sanae Takaichi as its first female prime minister, an ultraconservative lawmaker known for her admiration of Margaret Thatcher. Beyond her political persona, Takaichi has revealed some surprising personal interests, including a passion for heavy metal music. She is a longtime fan of bands like Iron Maiden and Deep Purple and plays the drums to relieve stress, with an electronic kit in her parliamentary residence. Takaichi, who also holds a black belt in karate and enjoys motorcycles, brings a unique and multifaceted personality to Japan's highest office.</p>

          <p>The recent brazen jewelry theft at the Louvre museum is drawing comparisons to the infamous "Pink Panther" gang, a network of thieves responsible for over $500 million in heists across Europe and Asia. While there is no evidence linking the two, the professional and swift nature of the Louvre robbery is reminiscent of the gang's signature style. The Pink Panthers, many of whom had military backgrounds, were known for meticulous planning and rapid, high-value thefts from the 1990s to the 2010s. This article provides context on their methods and history, highlighting the challenges authorities face in recovering stolen gems, which are often quickly recut and sold.</p>

          <p>China's commerce minister has accepted an invitation for urgent talks in Brussels to address escalating trade tensions with the European Union. The discussions will focus on China's recently broadened restrictions on the export of rare earth minerals, which are critical for the EU's high-tech and green industries. Another key issue is the fallout from the Netherlands' decision to effectively take control of the Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia, citing national security concerns. The EU's trade chief described China's export controls as "unjustified and harmful" and is seeking immediate solutions to the disputes.</p>

          <p>Lauren Taylor Wolfe, co-founder of activist investment firm Impactive Capital, has stated that the market is currently in an artificial intelligence bubble that is destined to burst. She argued that investors are underestimating the risks associated with the trillions of dollars being allocated to AI-related capital expenditures by major tech companies. Wolfe pointed out that these massive investments are not yet matched by clear returns or profits, creating a valuation mismatch reminiscent of the dot-com era. She advised investors to look for value in overlooked sectors rather than chasing overpriced AI-related stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear Trump v. Illinois, a case concerning President Trump's authority to federalize and deploy the National Guard to quell domestic protests. The case stems from Trump's attempt to use troops against protesters at an Illinois immigration facility, which lower courts have blocked. The administration argues that the president has exclusive and unreviewable power to decide when to deploy the Guard for such purposes. The ruling could have profound implications for the balance of power, potentially granting the president unchecked authority to use military force against U.S. citizens on American soil.</p>

          <p>A family-medicine clinic in Aurora, Colorado, called Mango House, has developed a sustainable and profitable model while serving a community of largely refugee and immigrant patients. The clinic thrives by preferring Medicaid, an insurance program often considered financially unviable by other providers. Founder Dr. P. J. Parmar achieved this through radical efficiency, such as eliminating appointments in favor of a walk-in system, which keeps wait times short and patient volume high. By streamlining operations and focusing solely on mastering Medicaid's billing system, the clinic provides accessible care while remaining financially independent and successful.</p>

Silver futures also tumbled more than 7%, marking their biggest decline since 2021. The sharp downturn in the precious metals market is attributed to easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, a stronger U.S. dollar, and technical indicators suggesting the assets were overbought. Despite the slide, some analysts view it as a temporary correction in a longer-term bullish trend for gold, driven by inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

According to aid officials, the new rules allow for groups to be de-registered for reasons like "inciting racism," which they fear could be broadly applied. This move follows Israel's ban on the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, UNRWA, and is seen as an attempt to control the flow of humanitarian assistance into Gaza, where famine has been declared in some areas.
