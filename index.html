          <p>Famed money manager Howard Rubin, 70, was arrested by the FBI on federal charges of sex trafficking and transporting women for commercial sex acts over a decade. The indictment alleges he engaged in non-consensual and sadistic acts with women in a Manhattan penthouse converted into a "sex dungeon." Rubin's former assistant was also arrested in connection with the case, which follows a 2017 lawsuit where models accused him of being sexually assaulted. Prosecutors emphasized that wealth and status do not place anyone above the law in such exploitation cases.</p>

Top American golfer Scottie Scheffler stated that the president's presence would provide a boost to the team during a challenging time for the country.

          <p>A federal grand jury has indicted former FBI Director James Comey on charges of making a false statement and obstruction related to his 2020 congressional testimony about the Hillary Clinton email investigation. The indictment follows public pressure from President Trump for Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute his political adversaries. Comey has proclaimed his innocence and readiness for trial, framing the charges as a politically motivated attack on the justice system. The move has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, who accuse Trump of weaponizing the Department of Justice.</p>

His address prompted a walkout by dozens of delegates and was met with both shouts and applause from the chamber.

He also praised former President Trump and announced that his speech was being broadcast into Gaza via loudspeakers and mobile phone networks.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old nursery worker, Roksana Lecka, has been jailed for eight years after being convicted of multiple counts of child cruelty against 21 babies at two London nurseries. Her actions were described by the judge as "gratuitous" and "sadistic," involving pinching, slapping, kicking, and pushing infants headfirst into cots. The abuse was discovered after she was sent home for pinching children, leading to a police investigation.

The study proposes that the divergence of our ancient ancestors may have occurred 400,000 years earlier than previously believed and potentially originated in Asia rather than Africa. The skull, known as Yunxian 2, displays a mix of features from both early hominins like Homo erectus and later species like Homo sapiens.

          <p>Nathan Gill, the former leader of Reform UK in Wales, has pleaded guilty to eight counts of bribery for accepting money to make pro-Russian statements while he was a member of the European Parliament. The charges detail that between 2018 and 2019, Gill received payments from a pro-Russian Ukrainian politician in exchange for promoting a narrative beneficial to Russia regarding events in Ukraine. The activity was uncovered after Gill was stopped at Manchester Airport in 2021. His defense counsel acknowledged that an immediate prison sentence is expected when he is sentenced in November.</p>

          <p>A UK court has dismissed a terrorism charge against Liam Og O hAnnaidh, a member of the Irish rap group Kneecap known as Mo Chara, on a technicality. The charge stemmed from O hAnnaidh waving a Hezbollah flag during a 2024 concert in London; Hezbollah is a proscribed terrorist organization in Britain. The chief magistrate ruled that prosecutors had missed the legal deadline to bring the charge by one day, rendering the proceedings unlawful. The Belfast-based trio is known for its provocative political statements and has faced controversy and bans in other countries.</p>

          <p>The UK government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is proposing a digital ID scheme aimed at preventing migrants without the right to work from finding employment. The plan would make a digital ID, accessible via smartphone, mandatory for employers to verify a person's identity and residency status. While the government claims this will reduce a key "pull factor" for illegal immigration, critics argue it will not stop the black economy where cash payments are common. The proposal revives a long-standing debate in the UK over national identity systems, which have historically been met with suspicion.</p>

          <p>Auto dealers across the U.S. are reporting significant delays from the IRS in approving and reimbursing federal electric vehicle tax credits, creating financial strain just before the program is set to expire on September 30.

President Trump has previously called the USPS "a joke" and supported plans to restructure it for potential privatization, a move that could eliminate unprofitable but essential services, particularly in rural areas. While the agency is implementing a 10-year modernization plan to cut costs, critics fear this will erode its universal service mandate.

Analysts suggest the market reaction is less about the direct impact of this specific tariff and more about the recent pattern of punitive U.S. trade actions against India, including other tariffs and visa fee hikes. This has created uncertainty and fear of further escalations, even in sectors where India holds a competitive advantage. (not investment advice)</p>

It clarifies that maximum sustained winds are confined to a small area within the eyewall and that the forecast "cone of uncertainty" only predicts the path of the storm's center, not the extent of its impacts like storm surge and rain. The report also emphasizes that forecasts can change, storms that stall are harder to predict, and significant dangers like flooding and tornadoes can occur far inland, long after a hurricane has made landfall.</p>
