          <p>According to reports, Donald Trump is considering accepting a luxury Boeing 747-8, valued at approximately $400 million, as a gift from Qatar's royal family, raising concerns about potential bribery and violations of the Emoluments Clause. The article details that the plane, dubbed a ‚Äúpalace in the sky,‚Äù would be used as Air Force One until Trump's second term concludes, after which it would be transferred to his presidential library foundation. Legal experts and Democratic politicians have criticized the potential acceptance of this gift, viewing it as a possible conflict of interest and a violation of constitutional restrictions on foreign gifts. The article mentions that Trump's attorney general and White House lawyer have concluded the gift is legally permissible.</p>
