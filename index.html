        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores why German footballers have not won the prestigious Ballon d'Or award in nearly 30 years, despite their country's and clubs' significant team successes. The analysis points to a historical shift in the award favoring attacking players, a category where Germany has not consistently produced world-class talent compared to other nations or its own past. It highlights how even exceptional German goalkeepers like Manuel Neuer only reached third place, often overshadowed by eras dominated by players like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. The article concludes by identifying young German attackers like Jamal Musiala and Florian Wirtz as potential future contenders, suggesting a new era might offer them a chance.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the cancellation of a meeting with Democratic congressional leaders, citing their "unserious and ridiculous demands" in the ongoing government funding dispute. With an October 1st deadline approaching, Democrats had proposed extending funding and boosting healthcare tax credits, while Republicans passed a measure funding the government until November 21st. Trump stated he would only meet when Democrats become "realistic" about national priorities, leading to accusations from Democratic leaders like Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer that the president is avoiding negotiations and will be responsible for a potential shutdown. The impasse heightens fears of a government funding lapse at month's end.</p>

          <p>Baltimore Ravens running back Derrick Henry displayed significant frustration, slamming his helmet on the bench after a crucial fumble contributed to the team's loss against the Detroit Lions. This marks Henry's third fumble in three games, directly impacting the Ravens' momentum in the fourth quarter. The Lions capitalized on the turnover, extending their lead and ultimately winning 38-30. Henry publicly apologized to fans, acknowledging his self-criticism and vowing to address the recurring issue of ball security as the team's season record falls to 1-2.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump delivered a contentious address to the United Nations General Assembly, criticizing the international body and touting his administration's achievements. He accused the UN of failing to address global conflicts and creating new problems, particularly on migration, while also threatening Russia with strong tariffs if a peace deal is not reached. Trump urged European nations to reduce their reliance on Russian oil, calling their current actions "embarrassing." The speech underscored his "America First" stance, challenging the UN's effectiveness and the approaches of other world leaders on critical global issues.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications has created widespread confusion among immigrant workers and employers, particularly regarding travel for current visa holders. While the White House clarified the fee is a one-time cost for new applicants, not renewals or existing holders, immigration attorneys advise against international travel due to lingering uncertainties. The fee, roughly ten times previous costs, is expected to deter many employers, aligning with the administration's goal to prioritize American workers. Experts anticipate a "chilling effect" on skilled foreign workers, impacting industries like technology and healthcare, with exemptions for national interest remaining unclear.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee expressed a cautious stance on lowering interest rates, despite voting for a recent cut, due to ongoing concerns about slower economic growth and a weaker labor market. He indicated that future rate adjustments would be contingent on economic progress and a return of inflation to the Fed's 2% target. Goolsbee suggested that while rates could eventually come down, an overly aggressive approach is unwarranted given inflation has remained above target for over four years. The article notes the FOMC's projection for further gradual cuts this year and next, with the labor market showing stability despite softening hiring trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office was denied permission to appeal a temporary injunction that prevents the removal of an Eritrean man to France under the new "one in, one out" migrant agreement. The High Court ruled there was a serious issue regarding whether officials followed legal guidance in deeming the 25-year-old eligible for removal, particularly after he claimed to be a victim of modern slavery. While this specific removal is delayed, the government has successfully sent four other individuals to France under the pilot scheme.

          <p>BBC Verify has fact-checked several claims made by President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. regarding autism, Tylenol, and vaccines, which have drawn condemnation from health experts. The article confirms Trump's statistic on rising autism rates (1 in 31 among 8-year-olds) but clarifies that this increase is primarily due to improved diagnosis, not the figures he cited. It debunks his claim that MMR vaccinations should be taken separately, citing multiple studies that find no link between the combined vaccine and autism, and warns against the re-emergence of diseases like measles. The article also addresses Trump's unproven assertions about lower autism rates among the Amish due to Tylenol use, noting limited research and alternative explanations for reported figures.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs, initially 25% and then doubled to 50%, have severely impacted India's $2.5 billion shrimp export industry, which previously supplied 40% of US shrimp consumption. The article highlights the devastating effect on workers, particularly women in processing plants who face job losses and financial hardship. Exporters are struggling to diversify markets, while farmers face prices below their break-even point. Experts warn that the 50% tariff rate is unsustainable, potentially destroying the industry and broader labor-intensive sectors in India. This situation stems from Trump's policy to punish India for its Russian oil purchases, reversing previous US efforts to boost India as an economic rival to China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio controversially asserted that Britain and other allies recognized Palestinian statehood primarily due to "domestic political pressure" from populations "flooded with foreigners." His comments, made on Fox News, criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's formal recognition of Palestine, claiming it was irrelevant and would only embolden Hamas. Rubio reiterated Donald Trump's disagreement with Starmer's decision, which was announced to revive hopes for a two-state solution.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines four expert-backed strategies for homebuyers and refinancers to find low mortgage rates in October, despite current rates remaining higher than in previous years. Key recommendations include comparing offers from multiple lenders, as rates and fees can vary significantly, and improving one's credit score, which can substantially reduce rates on conventional loans. Borrowers are also advised to consider adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) or shorter-term loans for potentially lower initial rates, weighing the trade-offs in payment structure. Finally, the article suggests buying mortgage points to reduce the interest rate if a long-term stay in the home is planned. (not investment advice)</p>

The suspension had sparked widespread debate about free speech and media scrutiny in the Trump era, with some local affiliates, including Sinclair, still planning to preempt the broadcast.

          <p>The Trump administration has fired nearly 20 more immigration judges this month, adding to over 80 dismissals this year, according to NPR. These terminations, particularly concentrated at the end of a two-year probationary period for many judges, are at odds with the administration's stated goal of increasing deportations, as they exacerbate an already historic case backlog of nearly 4 million. Union leaders and advocates criticize the move as illogical and costly, arguing it undermines due process and creates a culture of fear within the Executive Office for Immigration Review. The firings have led to significant delays, with some cases now pushed out to 2029.</p>

The article highlights Israel's strong opposition, with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterating that "there will be no Palestinian state," and ultra-nationalists advocating for annexation.
