        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ezra Klein discusses the surprising debate surrounding his book "Abundance," co-written with Derek Thompson, which has become a focal point in the Democratic Party's post-2024 reimagining. The book, advocating for policies that increase the supply of essential resources, has sparked a civil war within the party, particularly between those embracing abundance and anti-corporate populists. Klein notes that while establishment Democrats have largely embraced the book's arguments, some on the populist left see it as a threat to their rising influence, preferring to focus on concentrated corporate power as the primary problem. The article highlights the contrasting viewpoints and the broader struggle within the Democratic Party to define its future direction.</p>

The current account includes trade in goods and services, as well as income and transfers between Japan and the rest of the world. The surplus suggests a strengthening of Japan's external financial position during the specified period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Protests against federal immigration sweeps in Los Angeles intensified, leading to demonstrators blocking the 101 freeway and clashes with authorities. The Trump administration deployed the California National Guard in response, prompting California Governor Gavin Newsom to request the deployment be rescinded, calling it inflammatory and an overreach of federal power. The protests were sparked by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in the area, which resulted in multiple arrests and sparked outrage among immigrant rights advocates. The situation remains tense as local and federal authorities clash over the handling of the protests and the deployment of the National Guard.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs has filed a motion for a mistrial, alleging prosecutorial misconduct based on claims that the prosecution knowingly presented false testimony during his federal trial. Diddy's legal team argues that Cassie Ventura's friend, Bryana "Bana" Bongolan, provided perjured testimony regarding an alleged 2016 balcony incident, which the defense contends was demonstrably false. The defense team asserts that the government knew or should have known that Bongolan's testimony was false, as evidence suggests Diddy could not have caused the alleged injuries at the time and location claimed. The trial, involving charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, is expected to conclude by July 4.</p>

Hong Kong is currently a leading IPO market globally, and HSBC aims to leverage its position to serve the growing wealth management clientele in the region.

While the Veterans Administration cautions against self-medicating with psychedelics, it is also conducting clinical trials to study the potential benefits of these substances for treating PTSD, depression, and addiction.

The retreat involved ceremonies using psilocybin, which allowed Giardina to confront painful memories and emotions related to his abusive father and the loss of his sister. Giardina described the experience as an "exorcism," enabling him to release pent-up emotions and find peace. The retreat underscores the potential of psychedelic therapies to address deep-seated trauma, with the VA now conducting clinical trials to explore these treatments further.</p>

          <p>The Mossad's pager operation, combined with subsequent Israeli airstrikes and the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, significantly weakened the organization and undermined Iran's regional influence. The loss of key leaders and fighters, coupled with the disruption of supply lines and training grounds in Syria, has diminished Hezbollah's military capabilities and political standing in Lebanon. This has led to a reassessment of Iran's proxy war strategy, as its reliance on groups like Hezbollah to project power in the Middle East faces increasing challenges. The events have also impacted the broader geopolitical landscape, including the fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the isolation of Hamas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British energy firms are receiving substantial payments to curtail power generation due to grid capacity limitations, highlighting a critical issue in the UK's energy infrastructure. Wind farms like Moray East and West are frequently paid to reduce output when the grid cannot handle the surplus electricity, while gas-fired power stations are simultaneously compensated to increase production. This imbalance has cost the country over Â£500 million this year, potentially reaching Â£8 billion annually by 2030, raising concerns about rising energy bills and the feasibility of cheaper electricity through net-zero policies. The government is considering a radical shift to regional electricity markets to address these inefficiencies, but the plan faces significant opposition and uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) is appealing for 200,000 new blood donors to bolster critically low blood supplies and avert a potential "red alert" situation. The number of regular donors needs to increase from 800,000 to over one million to ensure a safe and reliable supply, particularly of O negative blood, which is universally compatible. The NHS is emphasizing the need for more black donors to address specific blood types required for treating sickle cell disease, as only a small percentage of the population donates regularly. The appeal comes nearly a year after the NHS issued an amber alert due to a "perfect storm" of factors, including unfilled appointments and increased demand.</p>

          <p>During Indira Gandhi's Emergency in the mid-1970s, India flirted with the idea of transitioning to a presidential system, a move that would have centralized executive power and sidelined the judiciary. Gandhi's government began exploring a reimagining of the country, inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France, and aimed to reduce Parliament to a symbolic role. The idea, though never fully realized, involved a directly elected president, curtailed judicial powers, and a reined-in press. While the proposal did not materialize, it influenced the Forty-second Amendment Act, which expanded Parliament's powers and limited judicial review.</p>
