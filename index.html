          <p>Federal prosecutors have accused Mahmoud Amin Ya'qub al-Muhtadi, a 33-year-old Louisiana resident, of involvement in Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel and entering the U.S. on a fraudulent visa. Unsealed court documents allege al-Muhtadi, a member of the National Resistance Brigades, coordinated armed fighters to cross into Israel shortly after the attack began, with his phone pinging near a kibbutz where 60 people were killed. He is charged with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization and visa fraud, having falsely claimed no terror affiliations or firearm training on his application. This case highlights the international reach of such conflicts and the ongoing efforts by U.S. authorities to prosecute individuals linked to foreign terrorist activities, underscoring national security concerns.</p>

          <p>During a U.S. military live-fire exercise over Interstate 5 in northern San Diego County, metal shrapnel from a prematurely detonated explosive ordnance struck and damaged a California Highway Patrol (CHP) vehicle. The incident occurred in an area where CHP officers were gathered to close traffic for a Marine Corps 250th anniversary celebration featuring Vice President JD Vance. Fortunately, no injuries were reported, and the Marines promptly canceled further live-fire rounds over the freeway, initiating a sweep for additional evaluation. CHP Border Division Chief Tony Coronado expressed significant concern, stating such an event over an active freeway is highly uncommon. He reiterated his foremost responsibility for ensuring the safety of California's citizens and the officers who protect them, prompting a review of military training protocols.</p>

          <p>Lakers center Jaxson Hayes sustained a "light sprain" on his right wrist during a preseason game but expects to be ready for the regular-season opener. The injury occurred after a hard fall while dunking a lob from Luka Doncic, highlighting the team's ongoing adjustment to Doncic's unique passing style, with coach JJ Redick noting several missed assist opportunities. Hayes, whose chemistry with Doncic has grown significantly, is now pursuing a Slovenian passport to join the national team, a process Doncic and his family have supported for over a year. This article also details recent roster cuts, including waiving four players, and provides updates on other minor player injuries as the Lakers finalize their lineup.</p>

          <p>Several individuals disguised as construction workers executed a brazen heist at the Louvre Museum, stealing at least nine pieces of jewelry of "inestimable heritage and historical value" from the Napoleon collection. The thieves used a mobile freight elevator to access a second-floor gallery, breaking through a window and display cases with an angle grinder before fleeing on motorcycles in less than seven minutes. French President Emmanuel Macron vowed the recovery of the stolen items, which include crowns, necklaces, and earrings, and pledged to bring the perpetrators to justice. This article reports on the initial details of the sophisticated, high-profile robbery, which forced the museum to close for the day and has prompted a major investigation.</p>

          <p>England is set to introduce new vocational V-level courses for 16-year-olds, aiming to simplify the "confusing landscape" of post-GCSE qualifications. These V-levels will replace existing Level 3 BTecs and other technical qualifications, with plans also including an alternative qualification to reduce GCSE maths and English resits, a policy that has proved controversial due to low pass rates. Skills minister Baroness Jacqui Smith stated V-levels will build on the practical, employment-focused aspects of BTecs, offering a clearer pathway for students less certain about specific occupations compared to T-levels. This article highlights a significant reform in the English education system designed to enhance vocational training and student opportunities.</p>

          <p>Liu Qian, founder of Wusawa Advisory and former managing director of The Economist Group in Greater China, discusses the U.S.-China rivalry, Chinese innovation, and gender equality. She argues that the economic impact of US tariffs on China is exaggerated, with exports to the US now comprising only about 2.8% of China's GDP, a significant reduction from its historical peak. Qian emphasizes that the rivalry extends beyond trade to technology and ideologies, warning of global harm if unhealthy competition persists. She also highlights the critical importance of women's voices in policymaking, underscoring that a multipolar world necessitates diverse perspectives for managed accommodation rather than confrontation, drawing parallels to historical transitions of power.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered that X and xAI's antitrust lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI must remain in Fort Worth, Texas, despite "at best minimal connections" to the area. Judge Mark Pittman, in an ironically worded order, encouraged the companies to relocate their headquarters to Fort Worth given their preference for the venue. This decision implicitly criticizes "forum-shopping," a practice by some plaintiffs, including those associated with Elon Musk, to file lawsuits in specific districts for potentially favorable rulings. The article highlights the judge's reservations about the case's connection to Fort Worth but notes the lack of a transfer request from Apple or OpenAI, and the high standard for venue transfers in the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service discovered a "suspicious stand" near Palm Beach International Airport, an area used by Air Force One when President Trump travels to Florida, according to the FBI.

While there was no impact on presidential movements and no individuals were present or involved, the discovery highlights ongoing security concerns. This incident comes after a previous assassination attempt against the president near his Mar-A-Lago club last year, underscoring the vigilance required for presidential security.</p>

Prince Andrew, who reached a financial settlement with Giuffre in 2022 and recently relinquished royal titles, has consistently denied the accusations.

          <p>Millions across the U.S. participated in "No Kings" demonstrations, protesting President Donald Trump's policies and perceived overreach of presidential authority. The massive, peaceful rallies, which surpassed previous turnouts, signaled widespread Democratic, liberal, and anti-Trump Republican sentiment, drawing families and young children. Despite White House derision and Trump's social media posts mocking protesters, the scale of the protests, coupled with Trump's net negative approval ratings, suggests a potential opportunity for Democrats to rebound from electoral defeats. However, the party faces divisions on how to effectively oppose Trump amidst an ongoing government shutdown, which has raised concerns about its impact on federal workers and low-income support programs.</p>

          <p>Tufan Erhurman, a moderate candidate, won the Turkish Cypriot presidential elections with 62.8% of the vote, defeating hardliner incumbent Ersin Tatar. This pivotal victory signals a major policy shift, as Erhurman advocates for exploring a federal solution to reunify Cyprus, a stance long supported by the United Nations. His predecessor and Turkey, the only country recognizing breakaway North Cyprus, had backed a two-state policy, which Greek Cypriots rejected. Turkish President Erdogan congratulated Erhurman, emphasizing continued support for Turkish Cypriot sovereign rights. This article highlights a renewed hope for stalled peace talks on the island, which has been divided since a Turkish invasion in 1974, potentially impacting Turkey's EU aspirations.</p>

          <p>A spectacular robbery at the Louvre Museum, the most significant since the Mona Lisa's disappearance in 1911, has raised serious questions about security for French artworks.
