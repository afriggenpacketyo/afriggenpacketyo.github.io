          <p>Mortgage demand and interest rates showed minimal movement for the second consecutive week, with total application volume slightly down by 0.5% and the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate marginally increasing to 6.69%. Refinance applications decreased by 4%, while applications for home purchases rose by 2%, marking the strongest week for purchase demand in a month, indicative of higher home prices. An MBA economist suggested that prospective buyers are becoming less sensitive to current rates, encouraged by more available inventory and decelerating home-price growth across the country. This article also touches upon President Trump's recent dismissal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, implying that her successor might advocate for more aggressive interest rate reductions.

          <p>Kohl's shares surged over 15% after the retailer surpassed Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, despite an overall decline in sales. The company narrowed its full-year sales guidance and revised its earnings per share outlook, reflecting improved financial performance. Interim CEO Michael Bender attributed the positive results to progress in strategic initiatives, including inventory reduction, lowered expenses, and better customer engagement. This financial update signals a potential turnaround for Kohl's, which has faced leadership turmoil and a three-year streak of declining annual revenue, indicating efforts to stabilize its market position.

          <p>Conservative Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) Graham Simpson has defected to the Reform party, making him their sole MSP in Holyrood. Simpson announced his move alongside Reform leader Nigel Farage, describing his departure from the Conservatives, a party he joined at 15, as an "enormous wrench." This defection marks the second MSP to leave the Conservative Holyrood group in the past week, highlighting significant shifts within Scottish political alignments. Simpson, who has represented the Central Scotland region since 2016, indicated that his move might not surprise many, given prior speculation about his potential defection.</p>

          <p>Denmark's foreign minister has summoned the top US diplomat in Copenhagen following reports of alleged covert influence operations by American citizens in Greenland. Danish public broadcaster DR cited sources suggesting the aim is to infiltrate Greenlandic society and promote its secession to the US, though the operatives' employers remain unclear. This diplomatic move comes after President Trump repeatedly expressed interest in annexing Greenland and Vice-President JD Vance accused Denmark of underinvesting in the territory. The Danish intelligence service warned of "various kinds of influence campaigns" targeting Greenland, aiming to create discord between Denmark and Greenland and influence its future within the Kingdom.</p>

The family lost their home to Israeli bombardments, highlighting the widespread destruction and famine conditions in Gaza, with over 50,000 children killed or injured.

          <p>President Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, accusing her of mortgage fraud, is viewed as an unprecedented assault on the central bank's independence. The article argues that while the Supreme Court and Congress should act as checks, their response has been weak, and financial markets have reacted with muted concern so far. Experts fear that political interference in monetary policy could lead to uncontrolled inflation, higher borrowing costs for individuals and the government, and a weakened dollar's global standing. The piece concludes that the responsibility to defend this vital American institution ultimately rests with the courts, Congress, and voters, rather than expecting markets to intervene.

          <p>A study by the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin) reveals a significant increase in concerns about xenophobia among refugees in Germany, rising from one-third in 2019 to over half in 2023. Only 65% of respondents felt welcome in 2023, a notable drop from 84% in 2017, with discrimination often linked to ethnicity, language, or names, particularly impacting housing and job searches. Despite these challenges, 98% of refugees surveyed express an intent to become German citizens, with a sharp increase in naturalizations and pending applications, especially among Syrian refugees. This trend is partly influenced by Germany's new citizenship law, which reduces the required residency period.</p>

          <p>China has firmly rejected President Trump's suggestion to join denuclearization talks with the United States and Russia, deeming it "neither reasonable nor realistic." Beijing's foreign ministry spokesman, Guo Jiakun, stated that China's nuclear capabilities are not on the same level as the US and Russia, urging the countries with the largest arsenals to earnestly fulfill their special responsibility for nuclear disarmament. While China maintains its nuclear forces at the minimum level required for national security, it has consistently declined Washington's invitations to trilateral talks. This stance highlights the ongoing complexities and disagreements in global nuclear arms control discussions, particularly amidst geopolitical tensions and the lack of progress in US-Russian agreements.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK households are set to face a 2% increase in their energy bills from October under the latest Ofgem price cap, raising a typical annual bill by £35 to £1,755. This rise, slightly higher than analysts expected, is attributed partly to increased costs for energy transmission and government-announced support measures for consumers. Campaigners warn that this will lead to another winter of high energy prices, exacerbating existing cost-of-living struggles, including rapidly rising food costs. Ofgem suggests that billpayers consider shopping for fixed-price deals, while local initiatives, such as the Fuel Bank Foundation, continue to provide vital short-term relief for struggling families.</p>

Increased courier incentives, a 51.8% jump in selling and marketing expenses, and higher research and development spending all contributed to the sharp profit reduction.

          <p>Roth IRA conversions, a popular strategy for reducing lifetime taxes, could inadvertently diminish the state and local tax (SALT) deduction for high earners. President Trump's "big beautiful bill" temporarily increased the SALT deduction cap to $40,000 for 2025, but it phases out for modified adjusted gross incomes between $500,000 and $600,000. Experts warn that the additional income generated from Roth conversions within this specific range could trigger a "SALT torpedo," effectively creating an artificially higher tax rate of 45.5%. While the increased cap primarily benefits higher earners, this intricate tax interplay highlights the complexities of financial planning under evolving tax laws. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Argentine police have raided a villa in Mar del Plata in search of "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Vittore Ghislandi, a 17th-century Italian painting believed to have been looted by Nazis during WWII. The artwork, originally owned by a Jewish art dealer, was reportedly spotted in a real estate ad for a home belonging to descendants of Nazi fugitive Friedrich Kadgien. This investigation reopens a dark chapter in Argentina's history of sheltering Nazi war criminals and their plundered property. While the painting was not found during the raid, officers seized other potentially useful items, highlighting ongoing international efforts for the restitution of stolen art.</p>

          <p>Investigations are underway following the tragic deaths of two young people and the hospitalization of two others after attending the Emerge dance music festival in Belfast. Mia Keevan, 17, became unwell at the event and later died in hospital, while Trae Keenan, 24, died in rented accommodation hours after the festival concluded. Mia is remembered as a "bright, fun and much loved girl," and Trae, a chef and father, was described as "very funny, very strong-hearted" and adored by his community. While Trae's family reported he suffered a panic attack unrelated to drugs, the specific causes of both tragic deaths are still under investigation.</p>

          <p>A DW article explores the complex relationship between antidepressants and chronic pain, noting that while many patients feel insulted by the suggestion, these medications are often considered when conventional pain relief fails. Researchers from the University of Southampton, in collaboration with Cochrane, reviewed 176 trials and found unreliable data for most antidepressants, with only duloxetine showing short-term efficacy for pain reduction. Amitriptyline, a commonly prescribed antidepressant for chronic pain, lacked sufficient reliable trials despite individual anecdotal success, raising questions about its widespread use. The article emphasizes the need for better research and suggests that engaging in joyful activities can also help individuals live with chronic pain.</p>

Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino announced "significant" naval patrols and drone deployment, while a US source indicated two more ships would be sent to curb drug trafficking. President Trump has intensified pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, accusing him of heading a cocaine trafficking cartel and offering a $50 million bounty for his capture. Venezuela has petitioned the UN to intervene and deployed 15,000 troops to its Colombia border to fight drug trafficking, asserting its territory is free from drug production.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has initiated steps to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, citing unconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud, a move that has sparked widespread outcry from Democrats as unprecedented political interference. Cook, the first African American to serve in the role and whose term was due to end in 2038, has vowed to legally challenge her dismissal, asserting Trump lacks "just cause." The Federal Reserve Act permits removal "for cause," but legal experts question the validity of Trump's claims, which include an ally's criminal referral that remains unproven. This situation highlights a critical challenge to the central bank's independence, with markets showing a muted but watchful reaction to the unfolding legal battle.</p>

Despite internal challenges and leadership scrutiny, there is a growing consensus and renewed energy to move past recent election losses and unify the party.

          <p>Reform UK's ambitious plan to tackle "uncontrolled illegal migration" includes mass deportations of 500,000-600,000 people within a parliamentary term, requiring the construction of detention facilities for 24,000 individuals monthly. This analysis questions the plan's achievability, noting current operations are far below these targets and the estimated £12 billion cost for secure facilities is significantly underestimated. The party's proposals for "cutting edge data fusion" and mandatory biometric capture could conflict with UK data protection laws, while fast-tracking removals has previously been ruled unlawful by courts. Pulling out of the ECHR and UN Convention Against Torture, though suggested, carries significant legal and international influence risks, including implications for the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

He highlights the erosion of voting rights, with 29 states passing restrictive laws since the Shelby County vs. Holder decision, and deepening economic inequality, particularly for communities of color. The racial wealth gap continues to widen, and disparities in healthcare persist, illustrating a system still rigged against vulnerable populations. Despite these formidable challenges, King III remains hopeful, calling for renewed activism to protect the vote, close the wealth gap, invest in communities, and ultimately advance the dream of a "Beloved Community."</p>

This impressive growth highlights the increasing traction of local alternatives to Nvidia as Beijing seeks to bolster its domestic AI chip industry amidst continuous threats of being cut off from American technology. Despite its significant growth, Cambricon's figures remain considerably smaller than Nvidia's $44 billion quarterly revenue, indicating the scale of the challenge. The company is also enhancing its software offerings and developing next-generation hardware, though it faces long-term obstacles due to export controls on advanced chipmaking techniques.

Mahdawi argues that despite access to subtle procedures, these individuals deliberately choose an artificial aesthetic, reflecting an obsession with optics and traditional gender norms within their conservative circles. This phenomenon is seen as ironic, given the group's vocal opposition to gender-affirming care for trans people while undergoing their own aesthetic transformations.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Nature Neuroscience challenges previous beliefs about brain reorganization after limb amputation, suggesting that the brain's map of a lost limb remains largely intact. Researchers, using MRI scans before and after amputations, found that the "phantom hand representation" in the somatosensory cortex was similar to the pre-amputated state, even years later. This finding contradicts the idea that neighboring brain areas expand to fill the void and offers significant hope for brain-computer interfaces, which rely on stable neural circuits for controlling prosthetic limbs. The research also proposes that phantom limb pain may stem from the brain still expecting signals from the missing body part, rather than brain map changes.</p>
