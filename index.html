          <p>Texas Republicans are leading a push to redraw congressional maps to gain five House seats, prompting Democratic lawmakers to flee the state to block the vote. This move has sparked a potential nationwide "redistricting arms race," with states like California, New York, and Missouri also exploring altering their maps for partisan benefit ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The unusual mid-decade efforts are raising legal and political questions, with a related Supreme Court case concerning the Voting Rights Act looming. This widespread maneuvering could significantly reshape the U.S. political landscape.</p>

          <p>Shares of Intel experienced a drop after President Trump publicly demanded the immediate resignation of its CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, citing him as "highly CONFLICTED." This call follows scrutiny from Senator Tom Cotton regarding Tan's investment ties to Chinese companies, raising national security concerns. Intel responded by affirming its commitment to U.S. security and its continued investment in domestic semiconductor manufacturing. The controversy adds pressure on the company, which has recently announced spending cuts amid efforts to recover from declining sales. (not investment advice)</p>

The company noted that a significant portion of its user base is now Gen Z.

          <p>Mexican IndyCar driver Pato O'Ward expressed shock and concern over a social media post by the Department of Homeland Security promoting its partnership with Indiana. The post, captioned "The Speedway Slammer," featured an AI-generated image of an ICE-sponsored race car with O'Ward's number, 5, and a jailhouse in the background. IndyCar stated it was unaware its imagery would be used and preferred it not be associated with the matter going forward.

Wright claimed the congressionally mandated reports, authored by hundreds of scientists, were politically biased and did not offer a fair assessment of climate data. This move follows the dismissal of over 400 experts working on the next report and is seen by critics as an unprecedented effort to politicize science. Environmental experts expressed alarm, calling it an attempt to downplay the climate crisis to advance a pro-fossil fuel agenda.</p>

The Israeli army's chief of staff has reportedly warned that such a move would be a "trap," endangering soldiers and the remaining hostages. Families of hostages are advocating for a negotiated deal, fearing an expanded conflict would be fatal for their loved ones. The proposal has also drawn criticism from international allies like the UK, deepening Israel's isolation as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to worsen after nearly two years of war.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a memorandum requiring colleges and universities to submit more detailed admissions data to the Department of Education. The policy aims to ensure compliance with the 2023 Supreme Court ruling that banned affirmative action by scrutinizing whether schools use proxies like diversity statements to consider race. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated the goal is to restore meritocracy, but critics call it a "fishing expedition." Education experts and department union members have raised concerns about the practical challenges of collecting and analyzing the vast new dataset, especially given recent staff reductions.</p>

At least five similar incidents have occurred at games across the country, prompting the WNBA to reiterate its zero-tolerance policy.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the United States' recent response to a Chinese research vessel, the Xue Long 2, operating in the Arctic reveals inconsistencies in its approach to international maritime law. The U.S. Coast Guard's monitoring of the vessel within America's "extended continental shelf" and implying it was "malign state activity" is criticized as a legal overreach. The author contends that the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) permits such scientific research on the high seas.

The event occurred as new global tariffs ordered by Trump took effect, sparking widespread concern among businesses and consumers about potential price hikes and inflation.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, pausing further construction at the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, who argue the project violates environmental laws and threatens a fragile ecosystem. While the facility can continue to operate and hold detainees, the 14-day order blocks any new paving or infrastructure work. The lawsuit is one of several legal challenges facing the facility, which has also been criticized for inhumane conditions and holding non-criminal immigrants.</p>

          <p>A recipe for the classic Roman pasta dish cacio e pepe published on the UK's Good Food website has caused fury in Italy. The recipe was criticized for incorrectly listing parmesan and butter as ingredients, and suggesting cream as an option, when the traditional dish contains only pecorino cheese, black pepper, and pasta. An Italian restaurant association was so incensed it contacted the British embassy in Rome to complain about the "astonishing" error. The incident highlights the deep cultural importance of culinary tradition in Italy and the passionate reactions that can be provoked by perceived misinterpretations of classic recipes.</p>

          <p>The California Supreme Court has unanimously sided with environmental groups, ruling that a lower court was wrong to block a legal challenge against the state's decision to cut rooftop solar incentives. The case, which now returns to the appeals court, contests the Public Utilities Commission's 2022 move to slash credits for solar panel owners who send excess power to the grid. Environmental groups argue the commission violated state law and that the cuts disincentivize solar adoption. The ruling affirms that the commission is not above the law and must be held to the same standard of judicial review as other state agencies.</p>
