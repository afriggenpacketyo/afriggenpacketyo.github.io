          <p>Meta Platforms is set to release its first-quarter earnings, with analysts anticipating $5.27 EPS and $41.39 billion in revenue.  Concerns exist regarding the impact of President Trump's China tariffs on Meta's advertising business, particularly its significant revenue stream from China.  Analysts predict a potential $7 billion revenue loss if China-linked companies continue reducing ad spending due to the trade dispute.  The article also notes the cautious outlook expressed by other tech companies regarding the broader economic climate.</p>

          <p>The article reports a 0.3% decline in U.S. GDP during the first quarter of 2025, a significant reversal from the previous quarter's strong growth. This downturn is largely attributed to the uncertainty and resulting stockpiling of goods by businesses and consumers in anticipation of President Trump's new tariffs.  While underlying economic indicators suggest a slowdown rather than a contraction, the negative GDP figure reflects the disruptive impact of Trump's trade policies. Economists predict further economic slowdown in the coming months.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% in the first quarter of 2025, marking the first negative growth since Q1 2022.  This contraction is largely attributed to a surge in imports driven by businesses front-running President Trump's new tariffs.  Despite positive consumer spending, the overall economic picture is concerning, particularly given the decline in government spending and weak job growth.  Trump attributed the decline to his predecessor's policies.</p>
