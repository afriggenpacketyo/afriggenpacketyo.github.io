          <p>During his sentencing hearing, Sean 'Diddy' Combs was visibly emotional as his defense team presented a lengthy and personal case for mitigation. The presentation included a video montage of his life and accomplishments, along with tearful testimonials from his six adult children and one of his attorneys. They pleaded with the judge for leniency, highlighting his role as a father and his positive contributions to his community, arguing that his remorse is genuine and that he can be more beneficial outside of prison.</p>

          <p>Following a request from the Department of Justice, Apple has removed the ICEBlock app, which used crowdsourced user data to track the locations of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The developer attributed the removal to pressure from the Trump administration, while law enforcement officials argued that such apps pose a significant safety risk to their officers. Attorney General Pamela Bondi stated that the app was designed to put agents at risk, a sentiment echoed by the Department of Homeland Security.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a review of federal funding for Portland, Oregon, in response to ongoing clashes between protestors and federal law enforcement. The White House cited the recent detention of a conservative journalist during the demonstrations as a key factor, vowing to launch a full investigation into his arrest.

          <h2>Taylor Swift's New Album Highlights How Vinyl Records Avoid US Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 14:29:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The release of Taylor Swift's latest album, "The Life of a Showgirl," underscores a unique exception in U.S. trade policy that protects physical music from import tariffs. A Cold War-era provision known as the Berman Amendment classifies items like vinyl records and CDs as "informational materials," exempting them from regulations such as the recent rollback of the "de minimis" threshold for low-value imports. While this exemption benefits consumers and record labels, some U.S.-based vinyl manufacturers argue that it puts them at a competitive disadvantage.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is set to vote on rival Republican and Democratic funding bills aimed at ending the ongoing government shutdown, though neither is expected to pass. This continued legislative impasse has left approximately 750,000 federal employees on furlough and has halted numerous government services. Both parties are engaged in a public blame game, with Republican leaders accusing Democrats of obstruction and Democrats holding President Trump responsible for the stalemate, leaving little hope for an immediate resolution.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has set a Sunday evening deadline for Hamas to accept a US-brokered peace plan for Gaza, warning of severe consequences if the proposal is rejected. The 20-point plan, developed with Israel, calls for an immediate ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans. While the proposal has received support from some international leaders, Hamas has indicated it is likely to reject the terms, particularly the requirement to release all hostages within the first 72 hours.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the cost of borrowing through a home equity loan has become slightly more affordable for homeowners. For a $15,000 loan, current monthly payments are marginally lower than they were in previous months, with a 10-year loan at 8.36% costing around $185 per month. The article suggests that while the savings are not substantial, the downward trend in rates makes home equity a potentially more attractive option compared to high-interest personal loans or credit cards.

The share of long-term unemployed has reached its highest point in over three years, with 1.9 million people in this category as of August. This trend suggests a "low-hire, low-fire" environment where fewer new jobs are being created, making it increasingly difficult for sidelined workers to re-enter the workforce and posing a risk to the broader economy.</p>

While not necessary for everyone, these plans are critical for many retirees to protect against substantial medical bills as healthcare needs typically increase with age, offering a stable alternative to network restrictions.</p>

          <p>In response to a recent wave of drone incursions, European leaders are accelerating plans to create a unified air and drone defense network, sometimes referred to as a "drone wall." Meeting in Copenhagen, leaders emphasized the growing threat of hybrid warfare from Russia and the need to bolster the continent's defensive capabilities, aiming for total self-defense by 2030. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has offered his country's extensive experience in countering drones to aid in the development of this pan-European security shield.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has entered its third day of a shutdown because Congress failed to pass a spending bill, leaving about 750,000 federal workers on unpaid leave and suspending many non-essential services. The impasse stems from a dispute between Republicans and Democrats over funding for healthcare programs, with Democrats demanding an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies and a reversal of Medicaid cuts.
