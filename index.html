        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has signaled that "further measures on tax" and public spending adjustments are being explored for the upcoming Budget on November 26. This move is driven by challenging economic forecasts and the need to stabilize the UK's finances, potentially requiring around £20bn in fiscal tightening. Reeves also linked some economic difficulties to Brexit's "severe and long-lasting" effects. Speculation points to possible increases in income tax thresholds or property taxes, despite earlier pledges not to raise major revenue-generating taxes. The government aims to ensure economic and fiscal stability. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leading US news organizations, including The New York Times and CNN, are pushing back against a new Pentagon policy that limits journalists to reporting only officially authorized information. The Department of Defense, rebranded as the Department of War under Secretary Pete Hegseth, defends the rules as necessary for national security. However, press associations argue the policy intimidates DoD employees and undermines press freedom, with many reporters refusing to sign and facing credential revocation. President Trump has publicly supported the restrictions, citing concerns about press disruption and potential mistakes by military personnel.</p>

          <p>At Wolverhampton Crown Court, a hotel chef testified that asylum seeker Deng Majek stared intently at staff, including Rhiannon Whyte, making them feel "really scary" and as if he "was planning something" prior to Whyte's murder. Another duty manager corroborated the intimidation, stating staff asked security to monitor Majek. The 27-year-old victim, Rhiannon Whyte, was fatally stabbed over 20 times at a railway station after her shift, allegedly tracked by Majek from the hotel. Majek, who claims to be 19, denies both murder and possessing an offensive weapon.</p>

          <p>Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi's diplomatic visit to India sparked controversy after female reporters were excluded from an initial press conference. This prompted widespread condemnation from Indian journalists and politicians, who decried the "blatant gender discrimination." Following backlash, the Taliban held a second press conference, inviting women journalists. While India aims to upgrade ties without formal recognition of the Taliban government, critics argue Indian diplomacy missed an opportunity to address the severe subjugation of Afghan women and girls under Taliban rule.</p>

Bessent indicated that the U.S. might also take equity stakes in strategic companies, emphasizing the need for self-sufficiency or allied sufficiency in the face of Beijing's export restrictions.

White House Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson stated Democrats are causing the shutdown by pushing to reinstate Medicaid policies that previously covered illegal immigrants, including those accused of serious crimes like murder and sexual assault. While federal law prohibits undocumented individuals from Medicaid, some states use federal funds for state-funded healthcare.

The deceased are buried quickly and simply, without embalming, in plain wooden caskets or shrouds, reflecting humility. A ritual bath, Taharah, precedes the burial, and public viewings are generally avoided. Close family members perform K'riah, a ritual tearing of clothing, to express grief. The seven-day period of Shiva follows, during which mourners refrain from work and grooming, receiving support from friends. The Mourner's Kaddish, a communal prayer focusing on faith, is recited for varying periods, and gravestones are typically added later.</p>

          <p>Tucson, Arizona, is embroiled in a significant local conflict over "Project Blue," a proposed $3.6 billion data center, with community members strongly opposing it due to its enormous demands for water and electricity in a desert environment. Concerns also stem from a lack of transparency by the developer, Beale Infrastructure, and local government. The project's potential impact on groundwater and the Santa Cruz River, alongside rising electricity rates, has fueled public outrage. Despite a city council vote to discontinue discussions, the company is pursuing an air-cooled design and state approval, highlighting a national trend of communities pushing back against data center development.</p>

          <p>Legal analysts suggest that China is increasingly extending the application of its domestic laws beyond its borders, a strategy termed "foreign-related rule of law," largely in response to pressure from the United States. Key legislative measures supporting this include the 2023 Law on Foreign Relations, the Law on Foreign State Immunity, and the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law of 2021. Beijing has also implemented export controls on dual-use products and rare earth metals. Experts note this trend raises a fundamental dilemma for the international community regarding whether the global order should be governed by international or domestic law.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed to publishing the witness statements submitted by Deputy National Security Adviser Matthew Collins in the recently collapsed case against two men accused of spying for China. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, expressing disappointment over the case's failure, stated the evidence would be released "in full." This decision follows strong calls for transparency from opposition parties, including the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, who accused the government of a "cover-up." The debate also centers on the previous Conservative government's classification of China as a threat, which Sir Keir insists guided the case's evidence.</p>

          <p>Despite Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine, historically known as the "world's breadbasket," continues to be a vital global food supplier. The war initially devastated its agricultural sector, causing export volumes to nosedive and global food prices to soar. However, strategic efforts like the Black Sea Grain Initiative and EU Solidarity Lanes have significantly restored exports, reaching 75% of pre-war levels. While challenges persist, including damaged infrastructure, landmines, and climate threats, Ukrainian farmers defy extraordinary odds to ensure domestic and international food security.
