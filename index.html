        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has publicly refuted the idea that tariffs implemented by the Trump administration act as a tax on American consumers. In a recent interview, he dismissed concerns from major corporations, arguing that the economy's strong performance contradicts claims of negative impact. This stance comes despite a federal appeals court ruling that found the administration overstepped its authority, a decision now being appealed to the Supreme Court. The policy's effects on manufacturing jobs and household costs remain a point of significant economic and political debate.</p>

          <p>In response to threats of federal intervention and immigration crackdowns from the Trump administration, Chicago churches are urging their communities to remain calm but prepared. Pastors are advising congregants to know their rights, carry identification, and stay connected with family, framing the potential deployment of federal agents as a form of authoritarianism. Community leaders are emphasizing a call for resources to address root causes of violence, rather than an increased law enforcement presence. The situation has created a palpable sense of anxiety, particularly in the city's Black and Latino neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>English cricketer Jacob Bethell, 21, recently scored his first professional century in a one-day international match against South Africa, fueling discussion about his potential role in the upcoming Ashes series. Despite being highly rated, the lack of a century had been a notable gap in his otherwise promising career. His performance has been praised by team captain Harry Brook, who suggested it could be a turning point for the young batter. However, some cricket analysts remain cautious, questioning if his white-ball success translates to the demands of red-ball Test cricket.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that President Trump's recent summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska "gave Putin what he wanted." In an interview, Zelenskyy argued that the Russian leader's primary goal was to secure a meeting with the U.S. president to project strength and legitimacy, which he achieved. Zelenskyy expressed regret that Ukraine was not involved and reiterated that ending the war requires more pressure on Russia from the U.S. and European allies. His comments underscore Ukraine's precarious position and its reliance on unwavering international support.</p>

          <p>Postal traffic to the United States has experienced a dramatic drop of more than 80% following the Trump administration's suspension of the "de minimis" trade exemption. According to the Universal Postal Union, the rule change, which ended tariff exemptions for small packages valued under $800, brought the global postal network to a "near halt." The administration has defended the move as necessary to combat illicit goods. However, the sudden change has caused significant disruption, with dozens of international postal operators suspending services to the U.S.</p>

          <p>A Guardian editorial criticizes the Trump administration's recent military actions against alleged drug traffickers, arguing it dangerously militarizes the "war on drugs." The piece references a U.S. strike that killed 11 people on a boat in the Caribbean, warning that such extrajudicial killings set a perilous precedent for using military force without oversight. The author contends that this approach is counterproductive, making international cooperation more difficult and inevitably leading to innocent casualties. The article suggests that addressing demand and stemming the flow of U.S. arms to cartels would be far more effective strategies.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis of government data shows that spending on lottery tickets varies widely across the United States, with Massachusetts residents spending the most at an average of $915 per year. Rhode Island follows at $573, while North Dakotans spend the least, averaging just $50 annually. The disparity may be linked to access, as urban states offer more opportunities to purchase tickets than rural ones. For some states, lottery sales represent a significant source of revenue, accounting for up to 3% of their general funds.</p>

          <p>U.S. authorities are investigating a malware-laden email, disguised as a message from a Republican congressman, that was reportedly aimed at spying on trade talks with China. Cybersecurity analysts have traced the malware to a hacking group known as APT41, which is believed to have ties to Chinese intelligence. The email was sent to various trade groups, law firms, and government agencies involved in the contentious negotiations. The incident is seen as the latest effort by Beijing-linked hackers to gain an illicit advantage by accessing confidential information related to U.S. trade strategy.</p>

          <p>Over 15,000 demonstrators gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv to pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure a deal for the release of remaining hostages held by Hamas. Protesters, including families of the captives, urged for an end to the war in Gaza, arguing that continued military expansion further endangers the lives of those still held. The large-scale protests reflect growing domestic dissent against the government's strategy, which insists that total military victory is the only path to freeing the hostages. This comes as Israel prepares to intensify its offensive in Gaza City.</p>

          <p>The UK's defence secretary, John Healey, has confirmed that the government is exploring the use of more military sites to accommodate asylum seekers. This initiative is part of Labour's broader plan to move individuals out of costly hotels, which have become a source of public and political controversy. The government is also considering other "non-military" locations for temporary housing as it faces the challenge of a growing number of Channel crossings. The move signals an "all of government effort" to manage the asylum system, though it continues to face criticism from opposition parties.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Rand Paul has condemned comments made by Vice President JD Vance regarding a recent U.S. military strike that killed 11 alleged drug traffickers. Vance had described killing cartel members as the "highest and best use of our military," a sentiment Paul labeled as "despicable and thoughtless." Paul argued that glorifying the execution of accused individuals without a trial is a dangerous departure from legal principles. The exchange highlights a sharp division within the Republican party over the administration's increasingly aggressive and militarized approach to combating international drug cartels.</p>
