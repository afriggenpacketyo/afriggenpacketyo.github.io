          <p>A recent report from the housing watchdog reveals a significant increase in complaints regarding substandard living conditions in social housing in England, with issues such as asbestos, electrical hazards, and damp being primary concerns. Housing Ombudsman Richard Blakeway highlights an imbalance of power between tenants and landlords, leading to frustration and a breakdown in trust. The report calls for a transformative overhaul of the system, including an independent review of funding practices and the establishment of a national tenant body to amplify tenant voices and landlord accountability. Prime Minister Starmer acknowledges the right to a safe place to live as central to the government's housing efforts, with a Ministry of Housing spokesperson outlining plans to clamp down on hazards and introduce competence standards for social housing staff.</p>

          <p>United Airlines is set to return to New York's JFK International Airport through a new partnership with JetBlue Airways, named Blue Sky, which will allow customers of both airlines to earn frequent flyer miles and enjoy reciprocal loyalty benefits such as priority boarding and roomier seats. The partnership aims to enhance JetBlue's competitiveness against larger airlines like United and Delta, stopping short of the flight coordination seen in JetBlue's previous alliance with American Airlines, which was blocked on antitrust grounds. JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty emphasizes that this collaboration is a bold step forward, bringing together two customer-focused airlines to provide more choices for travelers and value across their networks.</p>

          <p>Israel has announced plans to establish 22 new settlements in the occupied West Bank, a move that includes legalizing existing unauthorized outposts, sparking criticism from allies and Palestinians alike. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich stated that the decision aims to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state, while Defense Minister Israel Katz claims it strengthens Israel's hold on the territory. The Palestinian Authority condemned the expansion as a dangerous escalation, with human rights groups asserting that Israel is moving towards de facto annexation. This decision further complicates the prospect of a two-state solution, potentially undermining international efforts to revive peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>Global markets experienced a boost following a U.S. court's decision to block President Trump's sweeping tariffs, which were seen as a threat to economic and corporate growth. The ruling, though subject to appeal, was welcomed by investors, leading to a rise in stock futures and indexes across Asia and Europe. While analysts suggest the court's decision reduces uncertainty in the long run, they also caution that challenges to the ruling could cause short-term market volatility. Investors are now closely monitoring court rulings and appeals alongside Trump's trade policies, as the market attempts to plan for the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Trump's sweeping global trade tariffs, citing that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations.

Canadian licensing officials and recruiting businesses report a surge in inquiries and applications from U.S.-trained physicians. These doctors are motivated by a desire to escape what they perceive as increasing violence, cruelty, and political interference in healthcare, with some willing to accept pay cuts for the opportunity to practice in Canada's universal healthcare system.</p>

          <p>A growing wellness industry reflects a shift in America where health is increasingly viewed as a luxury commodity rather than a fundamental right, with the rise of movements skeptical of conventional medicine and open to alternative cures. This trend is exemplified by the nomination of wellness influencer Casey Means for surgeon general, highlighting a merger between anti-establishment forces on both the left and the right. With access to primary care services becoming increasingly limited and costly, many Americans are turning to wellness products and services as a means of bridging the gap in medical care. The emphasis on individual responsibility for health, however, raises questions about the role of government in creating wide-scale solutions.</p>

          <p>The filibuster, a parliamentary maneuver in the U.S. Senate, faces an uncertain future as both parties have chipped away at its traditional role. A recent ruling by the Senate's parliamentarian has prompted Republicans to find ways to maneuver around the 60-vote threshold, further weakening the filibuster. The article explores the historical context of these changes, noting that Democrats previously eliminated the 60-vote threshold for most confirmations, a move that had monumental consequences. As Republicans prepare to consider a sweeping spending- and tax-cut package, they will face similar pressure to dismiss or ignore the parliamentarian if decisions go against them, suggesting the filibuster's future remains precarious.</p>

          <p>A federal court has blocked many of President Trump's tariffs, stating the president overstepped his authority, while the White House has announced it would appeal. Meanwhile, Trump has expressed frustration with Russian President Putin regarding the slow progress in ending the war in Ukraine, but has not indicated he is ready to impose new sanctions. In Hungary, American and European conservatives are gathering for the Conservative Political Action Conference, where the country's prime minister, Viktor Orban, is seen as an inspirational model for conservatives. This comes as Trump and Orban show parallels in style and substance, particularly in their handling of universities.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced that he is leaving his government position with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), thanking President Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. As a special government employee, Musk's tenure was limited to 130 days, marking the end of his official role in the administration. Despite his departure, Musk stated that the DOGE mission will continue to strengthen, becoming a way of life throughout the government. He also expressed criticism of Trump's spending bill, saying it undermines the work of the DOGE team.</p>

          <p>UK car manufacturing has experienced a sharp decline, reaching its lowest April output in over 70 years, primarily due to US tariffs and the timing of Easter. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) also cited the industry's shift to electric vehicles as a factor temporarily reducing output. While a US court blocked many of Trump's tariffs, the ruling does not apply to the tariff on steel, aluminum, and cars. Despite this, the SMMT expressed hope that new trade deals with the US, EU, and India may help boost upcoming production. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite this, the company posted financial results for the April quarter that beat market expectations, allaying fears that demand for its graphics processing units, which have become key for training huge AI models, is dwindling.

          <p>A deceptively simple reform that could unlock more housing is single-stair housing, a design that is standard in urban housing throughout Europe, South America, and Asia. The concept of single-stair housing is being introduced to American audiences and is winning even in the face of opponents who warn it’s unsafe. Allowing single-stair construction for buildings up to six stories offers a practical solution to construction costs and zoning restrictions. Advocates argue that features like sprinklers make the design just as safe and current rules may actually steer people toward less safe housing.</p>

          <p>A new report from the World Meteorological Organization warns that the planet is poised to get even hotter, with a high likelihood of surpassing the 1.5 degrees Celsius warming threshold set by the Paris Agreement within the next five years. This warming trend is expected to lead to more frequent and intense natural disasters, including droughts, heat waves, and wildfires. Scientists emphasize that the current climate chaos is just the beginning, with the western U.S. particularly vulnerable to these effects. Despite these warnings, the U.S. is facing reduced capacity for disaster forecasting due to budget cuts and a rollback of climate mitigation efforts.</p>
