          <p>Federal officials discovered a "suspicious stand" near Palm Beach International Airport, an area used by President Trump during Florida visits. FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed the find, while the Secret Service stated it located "items of interest" during pre-arrival sweeps. Investigations revealed the stand, which appeared to be a hunting platform, had been there for months and was only discovered once the Secret Service resumed using that specific airport section after construction. Authorities confirmed no impact on Trump's movements and no individuals were present at the location.</p>

          <p>Disgraced former US congressman George Santos described his recently commuted prison sentence as "disproportionate" but acknowledged it served as a "large slice of humble pie" in his first interview since release. Speaking to CNN, Santos expressed that he is "all politicked out" and called for his former campaign staffer, Sam Miele, to also receive a commutation. He stated that President Trump's decision to commute his sentence came as a surprise, and he would pay restitution if legally required. This article highlights Santos's immediate reactions and future outlook following his unexpected release.</p>

          <p>Investors are closely monitoring three significant factors influencing the stock market this week: escalating US-China tensions, concerns about credit quality, and the ongoing federal government shutdown, all posing risks to the broader economy. Earnings season is gaining momentum, with major companies like Danaher, Capital One, GE Vernova, Honeywell, and Dover scheduled to report results. Additionally, crucial economic data, including existing home sales and the Consumer Price Index, are anticipated, despite delays caused by the government shutdown. These elements will shape market sentiment and investment strategies in the coming days. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A five-day strike impacting numerous Kaiser Permanente clinics and hospitals in California and Hawaii has ended, with the union, UNAC/UHCP, indicating renewed momentum for bargaining. The union sought a 25% wage increase over four years and increased staffing, emphasizing patient safety. Kaiser officials, however, argued their employees already earn 16% more than industry peers and offered a 21.5% wage increase, asserting that wages are the primary point of contention. Both parties are scheduled to resume negotiations later this week.</p>

          <p>Universities across the US are resisting the Trump administration's proposed compact, which seeks to align higher education institutions with presidential priorities, including banning race/sex in admissions and hiring, freezing tuition, and capping international enrollment. The deadline for feedback is tomorrow, with no colleges agreeing to sign and at least six, including USC and UVA, having rejected it. Professors express concerns that the compact infringes on academic freedom and constitutional rights, and could undermine research funding and diversity. The administration implies federal benefits may be withheld from non-compliant institutions.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police are actively investigating a report that Prince Andrew, in 2011, allegedly asked a bodyguard to "dig up dirt" on sexual assault accuser Virginia Giuffre, providing her date of birth and social security number. This investigation follows Andrew's recent relinquishment of royal titles after emails surfaced showing his continued contact with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Giuffre's family views Andrew's demotion as vindication and calls for him to be stripped of his prince title, intensifying the ongoing scrutiny of his conduct.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter utilized her hosting and musical guest appearance on Saturday Night Live to humorously address public criticisms regarding her "winking pop persona" and perceived sexuality. Through a QVC sketch featuring a suggestively shaped pillow and a "girlboss" seminar, Carpenter subtly pushed back against the notion that she is deferential to misogynist fantasies. The article highlights her self-aware approach, suggesting that she is in on the joke and that the discourse often stems from others' over-concern with her image.</p>

          <p>Following his release from prison after President Donald Trump commuted his seven-year sentence, former US Representative George Santos has declared a new mission: prison reform. Santos, who served 84 days for wire fraud and identity theft, described his experience as "dehumanizing" and criticized the "broken" prison system, citing rotting facilities and inadequate conditions. He reportedly informed Trump of his intentions to contribute to the administration's efforts in this area. Santos stated he is not interested in running for office again for at least a decade.</p>
