Investors and economists are keenly awaiting any indications about the Fed's next interest rate decision, scheduled for September 17. Powell must balance the dual mandate of maximizing employment and minimizing inflation, a task complicated by slowing job growth and creeping inflation. The central bank is expected to maintain a data-dependent "wait and see" approach despite calls for rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Erik Menendez was denied parole by California officials after a lengthy hearing, decades after he and his brother Lyle were convicted of killing their parents in 1989. The parole panel cited Menendez's "behavior in prison," including multiple rule violations since 2013, as the primary reason for the denial, despite family support. He must wait three years before his next hearing. His attorneys argue the brothers acted in self-defense due to alleged abuse, a claim disputed by the district attorney.</p>

          <p>Agricultural machinery giant John Deere faces a challenging period marked by declining demand in the farming sector, leading to significant drops in net income and sales. The company recently announced 238 layoffs, attributing them to reduced order volumes and tariff costs. Despite these headwinds, Deere is committing $20 billion to U.S. manufacturing over the next decade and sees growth in European and South American markets. Analysts suggest that while the short-term outlook is uncertain, the long-term prospects for the cyclical agricultural sector and precision agriculture remain attractive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new 1% tax on remittances, part of President Trump's spending bill, is set to significantly impact the world's poorest families, potentially diverting billions from crucial support. Immigrants in the U.S. send over $700 billion globally, with these funds often serving as a vital social safety net for basic needs like food, shelter, and healthcare in their home countries. Experts warn that this tax, coupled with cuts to foreign aid, could lead to increased famine and further destabilization in vulnerable nations. The tax disproportionately affects cash transfers, which are common among those without digital banking access.</p>

          <p>The UK government is seeking to appeal a High Court decision that granted Epping Forest District Council a temporary injunction against housing asylum seekers at the Bell Hotel. The council argued the hotel's presence escalated community tensions, especially after an asylum seeker was charged with sexual assault. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper's attempt to dismiss the case was refused, and the court ordered the 140 asylum seekers to leave by September 12. This legal battle highlights the broader challenges and increasing legal actions by councils regarding asylum accommodation.</p>

          <p>A newly identified dinosaur species, unearthed on the Isle of Wight, has been named Istiorachis macaruthurae, honoring record-breaking sailor Dame Ellen MacArthur. The medium-sized herbivore, dating back 125 million years, featured an "eye-catching sail" along its back, which Dr. Jeremy Lockwood likened to MacArthur's sailing achievements. The fossil remains, initially assumed to be existing species, were re-analyzed to reveal its unique long neural spines. Dame Ellen expressed immense honor at the tribute, noting the touching connection between the dinosaur's sail and her life at sea.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has immediately paused the issuance of worker visas for commercial truck drivers, citing concerns about road safety and the livelihoods of American truckers. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the change, which will allow for a comprehensive review of screening and vetting protocols. This move is part of the Trump administration's broader efforts to enforce proficient English language requirements and address perceived risks from foreign truckers. The American Trucking Association supports the scrutiny, despite an existing shortage of drivers in the industry.</p>

          <p>The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the leading authority on food crises, has officially declared a famine in Gaza City, warning it will likely spread without a ceasefire and increased humanitarian aid.

Israel immediately rejected the assessment, maintaining there is no famine, despite aid groups' warnings of systematic obstruction.

The court also banned feeding strays in public spaces, requiring dedicated areas instead. This ruling aims to address the rising issue of dog bites and rabies, which accounts for a significant portion of global deaths, while seeking a more humane and structured approach to managing the city's large stray dog population.</p>

          <p>The plague, historically known as the Black Death, recently infected a resident in South Lake Tahoe, prompting questions about its persistence and current dangers. Experts confirm that while rare, the disease, caused by Yersinia pestis, still exists and primarily affects wild rodents in the U.S. Humans typically contract it from infected flea bites or contact with infected animals, often during outdoor activities. Although treatable with antibiotics if caught early, the plague has not been eradicated due to its presence in mammalian populations and lack of an approved vaccine. Public health officials emphasize timely treatment to prevent fatal outcomes.</p>
