        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CNBC analysis reveals that states are losing hundreds of millions in tax revenue to attract data centers, benefiting tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google. These tax breaks, designed to stimulate economic growth, have sparked debate due to the relatively few jobs created by data centers compared to their immense electricity consumption. While some states itemize the tax exemptions received by companies, others do not, making it difficult to assess the true impact. Some argue that even partial tax revenue is better than none, as data centers drive economic growth, but others view it as a losing proposition for taxpayers, potentially reducing public services or raising taxes elsewhere.

          <p>Tokyo police and prosecutors have apologized to two men for their wrongful arrest and indictment in 2020 related to the suspected unauthorized export of sensitive equipment. The apology follows a Tokyo High Court ruling ordering compensation for Masaaki Okawara, president of Ohkawara Kakohki Co., and Junji Shimada, a former director. The men were arrested on suspicion of exporting spray dryers that could be used in biological weapons production, but the indictment was later withdrawn. The family of a third man involved, who died during detention, expressed dissatisfaction with the apology, and the company is seeking a third-party review of the investigation.</p>

          <p>A heatwave in the UK is expected to intensify, with temperatures reaching up to 34C and a yellow warning issued for thunderstorms in parts of England and Wales. The UK Health Security Agency has issued an amber heat-health alert, warning of pressures on health and social care services, including a potential rise in deaths among vulnerable populations. Firefighters have responded to a significant surge in wildfires, prompting concerns about the escalating threat this summer.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump can maintain control over the California National Guard troops deployed in Los Angeles. The decision blocks Governor Newsom's efforts to regain control, with the court stating the situation in LA warranted the president's use of the Guard to enforce federal immigration laws. Meanwhile, the White House announced Trump will decide within two weeks whether the U.S. will strike Iran, amid growing concerns from supporters who believe it betrays his "America First" principles. European diplomats are meeting with Iran's foreign minister in Geneva to seek a diplomatic solution, while Israel suggests it may continue attacking Iran's nuclear sites even without U.S. involvement.</p>

The author suggests that the Left's rhetoric, comparing Trump to figures like Hitler, is a form of indoctrination that could trigger individuals with troubled minds.

          <p>Experts are expressing concerns that the U.S.'s pandemic preparedness is "dramatically eroding" under the Trump administration, citing controversial dismissals of health advisors, lackluster responses to outbreaks, and a lack of quality information from officials.

The response to the H5N1 bird flu outbreak is also criticized for incomplete information and a lack of testing.

          <p>The article argues that the prospects for expanding the welfare state in the U.S. have dimmed due to the Democrats' limited electoral power and aversion to broad-based tax increases. The author suggests that Democrats have grown more ambitious in social spending but less willing to raise taxes on anyone but the super-rich, creating fiscal constraints. If President Trump's tax cut plan passes, interest rates and inflationary risk are likely to remain elevated, further limiting space for new welfare programs. The author concludes that Democrats must build the electoral power and political will necessary for raising taxes on the middle class to achieve their goals.</p>

          <p>Administration officials are portraying President Trump's two-week timeline for deciding on a potential strike against Iran as an opportunity for diplomacy. Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff and Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi have been in communication, although no meetings are planned. Officials cite heavy losses among Iran's senior leadership and nuclear policy experts as a reason for the timeline, arguing it allows Iran room to reconsider. European diplomats are also set to hold talks with Araghchi in Geneva.</p>

          <p>Eutelsat shares experienced a significant increase after the European satellite operator announced a 1.35-billion-euro capital raise led by the French state. The company plans to use the funds to support its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focusing on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. The French state will become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, followed by India's Bharti Space Limited. Eutelsat sends satellites to space using rockets from companies like SpaceX and recently secured a 10-year deal with the French armed forces for priority-access space resources.</p>

The allure of "unknown surprises" in the boxes hides "commercial traps" that induce impulsive spending.

          <p>Retail sales in the UK fell in May at the fastest pace in over a year, with sales volumes dropping 2.7%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The decline was mainly attributed to a "dismal" month for food retailers, particularly supermarkets, with reduced purchases of alcohol and tobacco. Government borrowing also hit the second highest level for May since records began. While sales volumes in the three months to May were up, economists suggest the burst of economic growth in early 2025 may be over, with retailers noting that inflation is prompting consumers to cut back.</p>

The Rent Brigade organization is advocating for more transparency and enforcement, and a motion has been introduced to require monthly reports detailing price-gouging complaints and enforcement actions.
