          <p>A Chinese woman, Zhimin Qian, has been convicted in London for her involvement in a massive cryptocurrency money laundering scheme. Between 2014 and 2017, she orchestrated a scam in China that defrauded over 128,000 victims, converting the stolen funds into bitcoin. Following a seven-year investigation, UK authorities seized 61,000 bitcoins, valued at more than £5 billion, marking the largest crypto seizure in the country's history. Qian, who fled China and used false documents to enter the UK, pleaded guilty and now awaits sentencing for her role in the global operation.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive 20-point peace plan for the Gaza Strip, unveiled by U.S. President Donald Trump alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, has been presented to Hamas. The proposal mandates the release of all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, the disarmament of Hamas, and the establishment of a transitional government in Gaza. Key provisions also include an immediate halt to Israeli military operations, guarantees for unimpeded humanitarian aid, and a pathway toward a demilitarized Palestinian state. The international community, including several Arab nations, has expressed support for the initiative as it awaits a formal response from Hamas.</p>

The official Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registered at 49.8, slightly better than expected but still below the 50-point threshold indicating growth. In other regional news, Australia's central bank held its interest rates steady at 3.6% amid persistent inflation concerns. While Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw gains, Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi experienced minor losses, reflecting broader economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A court in China has sentenced 11 members of the Ming crime family to death for running extensive scam and gambling operations from Laukkaing, a town in Myanmar near the Chinese border. Dozens of other family members received lengthy prison sentences, including life imprisonment, for crimes such as telecommunications fraud, drug trafficking, and murder. The criminal syndicate, which generated over $1.4 billion, was dismantled after an offensive by insurgent groups in Myanmar, leading to the arrest and extradition of its members to China. The harsh sentences signal Beijing's intensified crackdown on cross-border criminal enterprises.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government plans to introduce an online NHS hospital service in England by 2027 to help alleviate extensive waiting lists. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that the digital platform, accessible via the NHS app, will manage assessments, consultant check-ups, and follow-up appointments for specific conditions like ophthalmology and gynaecology. The initiative aims to deliver up to 8.5 million virtual appointments in its first three years, freeing up in-person resources for patients who need them most. While proponents highlight its potential for modernization and efficiency, critics raise concerns about digital exclusion and the sourcing of medical staff.</p>

The move, which follows weeks of connectivity issues in several provinces, has cut off communication for international news agencies and is expected to severely impact banking and commerce. Internet watchdog Netblocks confirmed the shutdown, which a Taliban official stated would last until further notice. The blackout is reportedly linked to the formation of a committee tasked with filtering online content to "prevent immoralities," further isolating the nation and curtailing access to education and business opportunities.</p>

Community leaders echo these concerns, emphasizing that the core issue is the lack of available housing for everyone, with nearly 50,000 households on the social housing waiting list.

He argued that a more balanced "50-50" production split would enhance U.S. national security while still keeping America reliant on Taiwan as a key partner.

          <p>A Black woman who was knocked unconscious during a violent arrest by two Solano County sheriff's deputies in 2020 has secured a $17 million settlement. Nakia Porter had pulled over to switch drivers during a family trip when deputies approached, drew their weapons, and slammed her to the pavement while handcuffing her. The incident, captured on body cameras, led to a federal lawsuit alleging excessive force and civil rights violations. Porter was jailed overnight on suspicion of resisting arrest but was never charged, and her lawsuit accused the deputies of falsifying their reports about the encounter.</p>

          <p>President Trump has presented a 20-point plan aimed at ending the Israel-Hamas war, which has received backing from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The proposal calls for an immediate ceasefire, the release of all Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Governance of the territory would be transferred to an apolitical Palestinian committee overseen by an international stabilization force backed by the U.S. and Arab states. While the plan provides a detailed roadmap, its success hinges on Hamas's response and the resolution of several unanswered questions.</p>

Authorities deployed a heavy security presence in major cities like Rabat and Casablanca to prevent gatherings organized by anonymous online youth networks. Protesters have voiced frustration over government spending on stadiums for the 2030 World Cup while social services are neglected. The demonstrations reflect widespread discontent over high youth unemployment and social inequality, with police actions confirming a restrictive approach to freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>A cultural shift is occurring in Germany as the momentum for diversity and inclusion initiatives, which gained traction following movements like Black Lives Matter, begins to fade. This article argues that the backlash is not simply "diversity fatigue" but a deliberate political strategy, championed by the far-right and quietly accepted by some within cultural institutions. Diversity programs are facing budget cuts, and conversations about structural bias are being pushed aside in favor of a purported "neutrality" that reinforces the status quo. The author contends that this trend threatens not only representation but also the complexity and truthfulness of art.</p>

          <p>Major grocery retailers in China, including Walmart and Alibaba's Freshippo, are revamping their stores to emulate the successful discount models of European chains like Aldi and Lidl. Amid an economic slowdown, these companies are reducing clutter, streamlining operations, and heavily promoting their own private-label brands to appeal to increasingly frugal shoppers. By offering quality comparable to name brands at lower prices, they aim to win back customers and combat flat sales. This strategic shift reflects a broader change in Chinese consumer behavior, with a growing demand for value-for-money products as economic uncertainty persists.</p>

          <p>Thousands of British military veterans are taking legal action against the industrial giant 3M, claiming that combat earplugs supplied to the Ministry of Defence were faulty and caused permanent hearing damage, including deafness and tinnitus. The lawsuit follows a $6 billion settlement 3M paid in 2023 to resolve similar claims from 240,000 U.S. service members. The veterans allege the company knew its reversible earplugs were too short and could loosen, failing to provide adequate protection. 3M maintains that the product is effective when used correctly and has stated it is prepared to defend itself in UK courts.</p>

Despite the significant loss, quarterback Tua Tagovailoa led the team effectively, throwing for two touchdowns.

The cubs underwent months of specialized care at the San Diego Humane Society’s Ramona Wildlife Center, where human interaction was minimized to ensure they did not become habituated. This rehabilitation is crucial for the near-threatened species, whose population in California is estimated to be between 3,200 and 4,500. The goal is for the young predators to thrive in their natural habitat and avoid conflicts with humans.</p>
