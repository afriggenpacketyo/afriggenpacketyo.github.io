          <p>The National Palace Museum in Taipei, a repository of Chinese art and artifacts, is experiencing a decline in visitor numbers due to strained relations between Taiwan and mainland China. The museum, aiming for 3.5 million visitors in its centenary year, saw a significant drop in tourists from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau, with only 50,000 visitors from these regions last year. This downturn is attributed to deteriorating cross-strait relations and shifting tourism policies, prompting the museum to focus on attracting visitors from other countries like South Korea and Japan to meet its goals.</p>

Her comments came shortly after Representative Shri Thanedar introduced articles of impeachment against Trump for various alleged offenses, including eliminating federal programs without authorization.

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst a challenging economic and political landscape, influenced by domestic cost-of-living issues and a volatile relationship with the United States and China.

Prince Harry's interview, where he discusses his relationship with King Charles, also features prominently.

These changes seek to streamline bureaucracy, redirect resources towards economic development, and address dysfunction caused by the anti-corruption campaign.
