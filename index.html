          <p>Following the Alabama Crimson Tide's surprising 31-17 defeat to Florida State, former Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel asserted that the team's long-standing aura of invincibility has vanished. Manziel stated on a podcast that opposing teams no longer fear facing Alabama, a sentiment echoed by sports commentator Stephen A. Smith, who suggested the Nick Saban dynasty era is over. The loss marked the end of Alabama's 23-game season-opener winning streak and raised questions about the program's direction under new head coach Kalen DeBoer. The article notes that Alabama's schedule includes several other powerhouse teams, adding to the pressure on the historically dominant program.</p>

          <p>Clashes between police and demonstrators in Epping, Essex, resulted in three arrests during a protest against the housing of asylum seekers at the Bell Hotel. The protest follows a recent case where an asylum seeker housed at the hotel was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage girl. Essex Police had implemented a dispersal order and set restrictions on the demonstration, arresting one man for inciting racial hatred and two others for breaching protest orders. The unrest highlights ongoing tensions in the community and is part of a series of similar protests and counter-protests occurring across England regarding the government's asylum policies.</p>

The Tivy Antler varsity team's season opener was held at Antler Stadium, the same venue that served as a central hub for volunteers and a memorial site in the aftermath of the natural disaster. The event highlights the cultural significance of Friday night football in Texas as a tradition that can bring people together and provide a sense of normalcy during difficult times. The game against Del Rio represented a step forward for the flood-ravaged town.</p>

          <p>A 6.0 magnitude earthquake occurred in southeastern Afghanistan late Sunday, with its epicenter located near the border with Pakistan. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake had a shallow depth of 6.2 miles, and a smaller 4.5 magnitude tremor followed about 20 minutes later. Local health officials confirmed that at least 15 people were injured and transported to a hospital for treatment.

          <p>A joint operation between Cardiff Council and South Wales Police has resulted in the seizure of 135 illegal e-bikes and scooters, some modified to reach dangerously high speeds. One confiscated vehicle was capable of 86 mph but had no functioning brakes, while another ridden by a teenager could reach 70 mph. The crackdown targeted antisocial behavior and safety violations, as any e-bike exceeding 15.5 mph or with a motor over 250 watts is classified as a motor vehicle requiring legal compliance. The seized bikes are being dismantled and scrapped to prevent their return to the streets.</p>

          <p>Personal finance personality Dave Ramsey advised a 61-year-old mother against taking out a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to pay off a $27,000 car she financed for her daughter. The mother explained that her daughter failed to refinance the loan as promised and has been accumulating traffic tickets, leaving her responsible for the debt. Ramsey stated that the gift had become a burden and recommended selling the car, even at a loss, to resolve the unmanageable debt. He suggested taking a smaller loan to cover any shortfall from the sale and to help her daughter purchase a more affordable vehicle. (not investment advice)</p>

The court found that Trump had overstepped his authority, though the tariffs remain in place pending a potential Supreme Court appeal. The administration claims the tariffs generate trillions, but official data shows far less, and economists note that the costs are largely borne by American consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge issued a temporary restraining order halting the Trump administration's plan to deport hundreds of unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The order came just as planes were reportedly being prepared for departure from Texas. Attorneys for the children argued the deportations would be illegal, depriving them of due process and the right to seek asylum, potentially returning them to dangerous situations. The government contended it was reuniting the children with relatives in Guatemala at their families' request, a claim disputed by the children's advocates.

The move is part of a broader immigration crackdown by the Trump administration, which has been critical of the city's crime rates and its status as a sanctuary city. The announcement has been met with strong opposition from local and state leaders, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who has called the potential deployment of federal troops an "invasion."

          <p>Gordon Ramsay revealed on social media that he was recently diagnosed with skin cancer and has undergone surgery to remove a basal cell carcinoma from his face. The celebrity chef shared photos of a large bandage and stitch marks, using the experience to urge his followers to wear sunscreen. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer and is typically slow-growing with a very high cure rate when detected and treated early. This is not the first time Ramsay has used a personal health scare to offer public advice, having previously advocated for wearing helmets after a serious bicycle accident.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed that the Trump administration is prepared to expand its immigration enforcement operations to other U.S. cities, stating that "we haven't taken anything off the table." While acknowledging plans to add more resources to ongoing ICE operations in Chicago, she indicated that many cities are being evaluated for similar interventions to combat crime and uphold immigration laws. The administration has increasingly targeted so-called "sanctuary" jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal agents. Noem encouraged mayors of major cities to work with the White House on public safety, a suggestion met with resistance from some local leaders.</p>

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, achieved his second recorded hole-in-one during the final round of the Junior Players Championship in Florida. The ace occurred on the par-three third hole at TPC Sawgrass, where he used a single shot to cover the 177-yard distance. His first hole-in-one came less than a year ago at the 2024 PNC Championship while playing alongside his father. The accomplishment highlights the young golfer's developing talent as he continues to follow in the footsteps of his famous father, who has 10 recorded aces in his career.</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that Donald Trump's inconsistent and improvisational approach to the Russia-Ukraine war is creating confusion and undermining U.S. credibility. The author suggests that while Trump portrays himself as a strong mediator, his vacillating statements on U.S. involvement and peace talks play into Vladimir Putin's strategy of prolonging the conflict to induce international fatigue. The piece argues that Putin is patiently exploiting the chaos, aiming to secure a favorable deal once the war fades from headlines. It concludes that Trump risks being outmaneuvered, potentially cementing a Russian victory and the decline of U.S. global influence.</p>

          <p>Bishop Montgomery High School in Torrance has fired its football coach and co-athletic director, Ed Hodgkiss, amid a growing sports scandal. The termination follows a Southern Section ruling that declared five transfer students ineligible due to violations, including providing false information. The school also had to forfeit a game against top-ranked Mater Dei due to a lack of players after several were suspended for leaving the bench during a game in Hawaii. The article suggests the Archdiocese of Los Angeles failed to learn from a similar past scandal at another Catholic school, allowing a rapid influx of transfer students without proper oversight.</p>

          <p>The UK has secured its largest-ever warship export deal, a £10 billion agreement to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence announced that the deal will support thousands of UK jobs, particularly at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be built. This strategic partnership aims to strengthen NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 British and Norwegian anti-submarine frigates operating in the North Atlantic. The agreement is seen as a major success for the UK's defense industry, having been chosen over competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has reported the death of a baby from whooping cough, the first such fatality in the UK this year. The infant's mother had not been vaccinated against the illness during her pregnancy. This tragic event underscores government warnings about declining vaccination rates, with none of the main childhood vaccines in England meeting the 95% uptake target required for herd immunity. Health officials emphasize that vaccination during pregnancy is crucial for protecting newborns in their first weeks of life before they can receive their own jabs. Thirty-three infants have died from the infection since 2013.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has grown to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday night's drawing. This marks the 40th consecutive drawing without a grand prize winner since the last jackpot was won on May 31. While the top prize remains elusive, several smaller prizes were won, including four tickets in Massachusetts that won significant amounts. One ticket sold in Worcester won $1 million, and three other tickets sold across the state each won $50,000. The next drawing for the massive jackpot will be held on Monday night.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore stated he has "no interest in fighting with the president" but will continue to fight for his communities, responding to Donald Trump's criticisms of crime in Baltimore. The feud escalated after Trump called the city a "hellhole" and threatened to send in the National Guard. Moore defended his city's progress in reducing crime and criticized the president's comments as "arrogant criticism and cynicism." He argued that deploying the National Guard, who are not trained for municipal policing, is a "performative" and unserious approach to public safety, suggesting federal funds for local law enforcement would be more effective.</p>

          <p>At an informal meeting in Copenhagen, European Union foreign ministers discussed new ways to support Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia. Among the ideas floated were the potential for secondary sanctions targeting Russia's trading partners and inviting Ukrainian arms companies to begin production within the "safe haven" of EU countries like Denmark. Ministers also revisited the contentious debate over seizing some €200 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv. Additionally, there was broad support for a plan to eventually shift the EU's military training mission for Ukrainian troops onto Ukrainian soil.</p>

          <p>Indonesia's president announced that political parties have agreed to scale back some state-funded perks for politicians in an effort to quell nationwide anti-government protests. The demonstrations, which have turned violent in several cities, were partly fueled by public anger over a new monthly allowance for lawmakers that is nearly ten times the minimum wage in Jakarta. The unrest escalated after a ride-sharing driver was killed during a protest, inflaming tensions over police conduct and workers' rights. President Prabowo Subianto said some allowances will be reduced and a moratorium on overseas trips will be imposed.</p>
