          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has signed an executive order creating the Illinois Accountability Commission to document alleged civil rights abuses by federal immigration enforcement agents, specifically ICE and CBP. The nine-person task force, led by a former chief judge, will create a public record of these incidents, capture their impact on communities, and recommend actions for accountability. Pritzker encourages citizens to record and submit evidence of what he calls "unlawful attacks," which will be preserved for future legal proceedings. A CBP official countered these claims, defending the agency's actions as necessary to combat "absolute chaos" and accusing the governor of spreading "fake news."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent significant drop in the price of gold, questions have arisen about the viability of purchasing the metal from large retailers like Costco. While the price has fallen, it remains historically high, presenting a potentially attractive entry point for new investors. Buying from a trusted retailer offers convenience and transparency compared to other sources, though sales are often final, requiring a firm decision. The article suggests that price dips in gold are typically temporary, and a lower entry point could position buyers for future gains if the price rebounds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Violence between Israel and Hezbollah is intensifying, threatening an eleven-month-old ceasefire with recent Israeli strikes killing a Hezbollah commander and targeting a training camp. Since the ceasefire began, Lebanese authorities report 274 deaths from Israeli attacks, while the UN has documented hundreds of projectiles fired from Israel into Lebanon. Both sides accuse the other of violating the agreement, which stipulated an Israeli withdrawal and Hezbollah's disarmament, creating a dangerous stalemate. This "lessfire" situation is exacerbating Lebanon's political and economic crises and stoking fears of a return to full-scale conflict.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, driven by strong revenue. However, the company has lowered its full-year guidance for 2025 due to the significant impact of a fire at a key aluminum supplier's plant. The disruption is expected to cost between $1.5 billion and $2 billion by affecting the production of its highly profitable large trucks and SUVs. Ford is actively working to mitigate the financial impact and plans to increase production in 2026 to recover the lost volume. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent satellite imagery indicates that the White House East Wing has been completely demolished to accommodate the construction of a new $300 million ballroom project initiated by President Trump. The White House Press Secretary defended the action, stating that the demolition was deemed necessary by architects for the structure to be modern and stable for the future. The project has drawn public backlash over its funding and the apparent change in plans, as it was initially stated the existing structure would not be impacted. The administration maintains the project is privately funded by the president and other donors.</p>

          <p>An extensive FBI investigation has resulted in over 30 arrests, including Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat player Terry Rozier, for alleged involvement in a criminal enterprise connected to Mafia crime families. The probe uncovered two major schemes: one involving rigged, high-tech underground poker games and another centered on an insider sports betting conspiracy. Billups is charged in the poker scheme, while Rozier is implicated in the sports betting case. The NBA has placed both individuals on immediate leave, stating the integrity of the game is its top priority.</p>

While the Federal Reserve is expected to make minor rate cuts, the impact on these loans is likely to be minimal, suggesting that waiting may not yield substantial savings.

Newsom currently holds a positive approval rating as governor, though many voters feel he is more focused on national and state issues than their local concerns.

          <p>Gold prices have experienced sharp fluctuations recently, creating both risks and opportunities for investors. To capitalize on this volatility, experts suggest several approaches beyond simply holding the physical metal. One strategy is trading the stocks of gold mining companies or related ETFs, which can offer leveraged exposure to gold's price movements and are more liquid than bullion. For short-term plays, gold-backed ETFs or futures contracts allow for direct trading on price swings. A more conservative approach involves strategically buying physical gold during price dips as a long-term hedge against inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pediatric psychologists and child development experts are decoding common toddler behaviors like constantly saying "no," claiming everything as "mine," and resisting transitions between activities. These actions, while often frustrating for parents, are described as developmentally appropriate ways for young children to establish their identity and test boundaries. Experts explain that this behavior is a crucial part of social and emotional learning as toddlers begin to understand they are separate individuals with their own sense of agency. The article provides parents with context for this stage and offers practical tips, such as offering choices and modeling desired behaviors.</p>

          <p>The process of appointing a new chair for the UK's national inquiry into grooming gangs has been thrown into disarray and is now expected to take several months. The search was complicated after two leading candidates withdrew from consideration amid a "toxic environment" and intense media scrutiny. The situation was further inflamed when four members of the inquiry's survivor panel resigned, calling for the resignation of Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips. The government has stated it is determined to keep Phillips in her role and will re-engage with survivors to find a suitable new chair.</p>

          <p>California will now permit the hunting of mute swans at any time of year for anyone with a valid hunting license in an effort to control the invasive species. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife classifies the birds as a "destructive, non-native" species, with a statewide population that has grown to nearly 6,900. Officials state that the territorial swans are detrimental to native waterfowl because they compete for limited submerged aquatic vegetation, a crucial food source. Mute swans are not protected under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act as they were introduced to North America in the 1800s.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has granted a full pardon to Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance, who had pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering. The White House framed the pardon as a correction of a political prosecution by the Biden administration, which it accused of waging a "war on cryptocurrency." Zhao had served four months in prison as part of a multi-billion-dollar settlement with the Justice Department. The move drew immediate criticism from figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren, who called it "corruption" and pointed to business ties between Binance and the Trump family's own crypto ventures.</p>

As essential employees, controllers are required to work without pay, creating significant financial pressure that could lead to fatigue in a high-stress job. Duffy stated he does not want controllers working second jobs and warned that the staffing crisis could lead to more flight delays and cancellations.

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is reportedly contemplating a rise in income tax to close a significant fiscal shortfall of around £30 billion. The budget pressure stems from a downward revision of the UK's economic productivity estimates by the Office for Budget Responsibility. To cover the gap, allies are urging the chancellor to consider breaking a key manifesto pledge by not raising taxes. Among the options being discussed are a 1p increase to the basic rate, which would raise over £8 billion, or a more complex plan to shift the tax burden. (not investment advice)</p>

Orban's "peace march" focused on his pro-Russia, anti-EU stance, accusing Brussels of warmongering over Ukraine. In contrast, Magyar's "national rally" called for systemic change, criticizing Orban for centralizing power and fostering corruption, highlighting the deep political divisions within the nation.</p>
