          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a strong first quarter, surpassing analyst expectations for both operating profit and revenue due to robust sales of its Galaxy S25 smartphones and memory chips. The South Korean tech giant saw a 10% increase in revenue compared to the previous year, reaching a record 79.1 trillion Korean won ($55.4 billion), while operating profit rose by 1.5% to 6.7 trillion Korean won. Despite macroeconomic uncertainties stemming from trade tensions and global growth slowdown, Samsung anticipates improved performance in the latter half of the year, assuming these uncertainties diminish.

          <p>Senate Democrats are calling for a Government Accountability Office (GAO) review of FBI Director Kash Patel's use of FBI aircraft for personal travel, following reports questioning the extent of his non-official trips. The review will examine Patel's flight records and compare them to those of previous directors since 2013, assessing whether he reimbursed the government appropriately for personal use, including visits to his girlfriend and attendance at sporting events. While FBI directors are required to use government aircraft for both official and personal travel for security reasons, they must reimburse the government for personal flights at coach fare rates. The inquiry raises concerns about potential misuse of taxpayer dollars and echoes previous criticisms of similar practices by Patel's predecessor.</p>

          <p>On his 100th day in office, President Donald Trump announced measures to ease the impact of his 25% tariffs on the auto industry, aiming to incentivize manufacturers to relocate their supply chains to the United States. The relief allows American and foreign automakers producing vehicles in the U.S. to claim some reimbursements, offsetting 15% of the suggested retail price in the first year and 10% in the second year. This temporary alleviation comes after automakers voiced concerns about the complexity of supply chains and the potential for increased car prices due to the tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also indicated that the U.S. is close to reaching a tariff deal with India, marking the first such agreement since Trump's return to office.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump marked his 100th day in office with a rally in Michigan, where he celebrated his administration's policies, including mass deportations and tariffs, while also attacking his political opponents and the media. He defended his tariff policy as a way to punish countries he believes have been unfair to the U.S., and he also signed executive actions to ease the tariff burden on automakers assembling cars in the U.S. Trump also condemned the news media, dismissing polls showing his approval rating dropping as "fake polls," and criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates. The rally had a campaign-like atmosphere, with some attendees calling for a third term for the two-term president.</p>

          <p>Gilead Sciences has agreed to pay $202 million to the U.S. government and various states to resolve civil claims that the drugmaker used speaker programs to provide kickbacks to doctors, incentivizing them to prescribe Gilead's expensive antiretroviral medications for HIV patients. The payments to doctors, made in the form of honoraria, meals, and travel expenses, allegedly violated the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute and led to false claims being submitted to federal healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The settlement stems from a civil lawsuit filed by Dr. Paul Bellman, and follows a similar case against Janssen Products, highlighting ongoing scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies' marketing practices.</p>

          <p>Australia's first-quarter inflation remained steady at 2.4%, a four-year low, slightly above Reuters' expectations. The most significant price increases were in housing, education, and food and non-alcoholic beverages, offset by falls in recreation, culture, and household equipment. Inflation has been softening since hitting a multi-year high in December 2022, giving the Reserve Bank of Australia room to cut rates to 4.1%. The release comes as Australia prepares for an election on May 3, with the Labor Party currently holding a lead over the Liberal-National opposition.</p>

          <p>As President Trump marks 100 days in his second term, economists are expressing concerns about his proposed reciprocal tariffs, warning they could disrupt global supply chains and push the U.S. economy into a recession. While Trump aims to lower prices and create jobs through tariffs, experts believe they are politically motivated and unlikely to secure the desired benefits from U.S. trading partners. The tariffs have already caused market volatility and uncertainty, with some prices rising in anticipation of higher costs. Experts suggest that these tariffs could disproportionately affect working- and middle-class Americans who purchase imported goods.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly declined in April, falling into contractionary territory for the first time since January, as the escalating trade war with the U.S. takes its toll. The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 49.0, below the 50-level threshold, indicating a slowdown in manufacturing growth after a strong performance in March. This decline follows the imposition of new tariffs by the U.S. on Chinese goods, prompting retaliatory measures from China and disrupting trade flows between the two countries. Despite some reports of tariff relief, economists estimate that a significant portion of China's GDP and manufacturing jobs will be directly impacted by the U.S. tariffs.</p>

This coincides with the administration's campaign against "sanctuary" jurisdictions, potentially putting local law enforcement officials in a difficult position regarding cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

          <p>China has passed the Private Economy Promotion Law, comprising 78 articles, aimed at strengthening the country's private economy amidst trade tensions with the US. The law, effective May 20, seeks to promote fair market competition, enhance the investment environment, encourage private firms' involvement in scientific projects and technological innovation, and safeguard their economic rights. Chinese leaders hope the new law will boost morale and support the non-state sector, which is considered crucial for ensuring economic growth.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive orders modifying tariffs for carmakers, addressing concerns that levies were backfiring on U.S. manufacturing. The changes will exempt carmakers paying a 25% tariff on auto imports from other levies, such as those on steel and aluminum. Carmakers will also qualify for tariff relief for a portion of imported components, phased out over two years. Despite these concessions, the administration's policies will still increase car prices and endanger automakers' financial health, according to analysts. General Motors abandoned a previous forecast for profit growth due to the uncertainty created by Trump's trade policies.</p>

          <p>Paramount Global is entering mediation to resolve President Trump's $20-billion lawsuit over a '60 Minutes' interview, raising questions about how much the company should pay to settle the dispute. The lawsuit alleges CBS deceptively edited an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Paramount's controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, is pushing for a settlement to facilitate the company's sale to Skydance Media, sparking protests within the company. The executive producer of '60 Minutes' resigned, citing corporate pressure over coverage, and veteran CBS newsman Scott Pelley disclosed the show had been facing increased corporate oversight.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has voiced support for legislation that would increase the punishment to a felony for soliciting a 16- or 17-year-old for sex, after Democrats in the state Assembly weakened the bill. Newsom stated that the law should treat all sex predators who solicit minors the same, regardless of the intended victim's age. This stance puts him at odds with some members of his own party, who have resisted increasing penalties for these types of crimes. The bill seeks to criminalize loitering with intent to buy sex and build on existing state law to make it a felony to solicit anyone under 18 for sex.</p>
