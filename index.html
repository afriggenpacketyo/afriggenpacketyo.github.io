          <p>Mark Killick, a 56-year-old builder, has been found guilty of 37 counts of fraud totaling over £1.25 million. Operating under various aliases, he charmed customers across the West of England into paying for building work that was either never completed or left unfinished between 2020 and 2021. Despite claiming business hardships, prosecutors highlighted his spending on luxury goods, including a £25,000 Rolex watch. This marks Killick's fourth fraud conviction since 2008, with a judge indicating that a lengthy custodial sentence is inevitable for the man police described as one of the most prolific rogue traders they have ever dealt with.</p>

          <p>Four survivors have withdrawn from a government panel for an inquiry into grooming gangs, stating they will only rejoin if Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips resigns. They accuse Phillips of dismissing their concerns about the inquiry's direction as "untrue," which they described as a betrayal that destroyed their trust. The turmoil follows the withdrawal of two potential chairs for the inquiry, with one citing a "toxic environment" influenced by political point-scoring. Despite the resignations, the government has confirmed that Phillips will remain in her post, emphasizing her lifelong advocacy for abuse victims.</p>

          <p>The last debate before New York City's mayoral election was marked by venomous exchanges between the three main candidates: Democrat Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani, the frontrunner, faced criticism for his perceived inexperience and pro-Palestinian advocacy, while Cuomo was challenged over the sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation as governor. Sliwa positioned himself as the more serious candidate while also delivering pointed barbs at his rivals. Despite the acrimony, all three candidates found common ground in criticizing recent federal immigration raids in the city.</p>

          <p>Over 1,500 police agencies across the U.S. and Canada are now utilizing virtual reality (VR) technology to train officers for high-stress situations. Tech company Axon's program immerses recruits in realistic scenarios involving de-escalation, mental health crises, and use of force, allowing them to practice split-second decision-making in a controlled environment. The Aurora Police Department in Colorado, which has used the system for three years, notes that the AI-driven scenarios adapt to officer responses, making each session unique. A PwC study suggests VR training can be four times faster and significantly boosts officer confidence compared to traditional classroom methods.</p>

          <p>Despite a persistent and deepening slump in China's real estate sector, analysts believe Beijing is unlikely to introduce significant new support measures. The government appears to be prioritizing technological development as a more urgent national security and growth priority, viewing the property market's drag on the economy as having eased. However, data shows real estate investment continues to fall sharply, with new and secondary home prices declining, weighing on consumer sentiment. Analysts predict the housing market is far from bottoming out, but policy focus will remain on new growth areas rather than reviving the old real estate-driven model. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union has approved a new package of sanctions against Russia, notably including a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports. This move aligns with a major policy shift from the U.S., where President Donald Trump recently announced new sanctions targeting two of Russia's largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. The EU's foreign affairs chief, Kaja Kallas, welcomed the American sanctions as a "signal of strength." She emphasized that these coordinated measures are necessary to deprive Russia of the financial resources it needs to continue its war in Ukraine.</p>

This development, attributed partly to France's current political turmoil, is a setback for the UK government's strategy to curb the crossings. A promised new "maritime doctrine" to turn back boats is now seen by some insiders as a "political stunt." Legal and safety concerns, including the risk of causing deaths at sea and potential prosecutions for security forces, are cited as major obstacles to implementing a more aggressive interception policy.</p>

          <p>Felipe Mora scored two first-half goals to lead the Portland Timbers to a 3-1 victory over Real Salt Lake in the MLS Western Conference wild-card game. Mora's brace ended a personal scoring drought of 23 regular-season games, providing a crucial lift for his team. A late header from Kamal Miller secured the win for eighth-seeded Portland, which had only won once in its previous 11 matches. With the victory, the Timbers advance to a best-of-three first-round series against the top-seeded San Diego FC, while RSL's playoff winless streak continues.</p>

          <p>As China's top leaders conclude a meeting to outline the next five-year plan, a prominent editorial in the Communist Party's official mouthpiece has lauded the country's socialist system. The article presents China's model of governance as a core strength that ensures consistent, long-term strategic planning and economic development. It contrasts this with what it describes as the short-termism and policy reversals common in multiparty systems. The piece asserts that the party's decisive leadership provides an anchor of stability not only for China's economy but for the global economy as well, ensuring the nation's "economic ship sails steadily."</p>

          <p>This article details the difficulties homeowners in Southern California face when seeking compensation for property damage caused by falling city-maintained trees. It highlights the case of a Burbank woman whose car was damaged by a dead tree, but her claim was denied by the city, which cited "an act of Mother Nature." Legal experts advise that cities can be held liable if they were previously notified of a tree's poor condition, but proving this often requires written documentation. Residents are advised to document the state of concerning trees with photos and to submit any complaints to the city in writing to build a stronger case.</p>

          <p>India and South Korea have conducted their first-ever joint bilateral naval exercise, a development viewed by some analysts as part of a broader trend of closer defense ties among Asia-Pacific nations. The Indian naval vessel Sahyadri docked in Busan, South Korea, for the exercise, which India's Ministry of Defence described as part of an ongoing deployment to the South China Sea and Indo-Pacific. According to the article, some observers see these strengthening alliances as a response to concerns over a potential reduction in the U.S. military presence in the region, creating a counterweight in the evolving security landscape.</p>

          <p>Over 100 firefighters responded to a large, hazardous-materials fire at a General Motors design studio in Pasadena on Wednesday night. The four-alarm blaze involved burning lithium-ion batteries and prototype cars, creating a challenging situation for fire crews as water cannot be used on lithium-ion battery fires due to the risk of a chemical reaction. The thick smoke complicated efforts to locate the source of the fire within the 149,000-square-foot campus. At one point, a firefighter became trapped inside the building and issued a mayday call but was safely rescued without injury.</p>

Donations are being managed by the nonprofit Trust for the National Mall.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that on Saturn's moon Titan, incompatible molecules may be forming bizarre co-crystals that challenge a fundamental rule of chemistry. In Titan's extreme cold, polar molecules like hydrogen cyanide and non-polar molecules like methane and ethane, which normally repel each other, appear to combine. Experiments and computer models show that at temperatures around -180°C, methane and ethane can slip into the crystal lattice of hydrogen cyanide, creating stable, previously unseen solid structures. This discovery could reshape our understanding of Titan's geology and the complex chemistry occurring in its hydrocarbon lakes, pending confirmation from future probes.</p>

          <p>The Westminster Mall, a fixture in Orange County for decades, is set to close its doors on October 29 to make way for a major redevelopment project. The 100-acre property will be transformed into a mixed-use site featuring 3,000 housing units, upscale retail space, and over 9 acres of parks. Once a thriving community hub, the mall has seen a long decline, prompting the city to approve the revitalization plan. While anchor stores like Target and Best Buy are expected to remain for a few more years, the closure marks the end of an era for many local residents who grew up with the mall.</p>
