          <p>United Airlines implemented a nationwide ground stop for its mainline flights due to a significant technology issue, causing hundreds of delays across its major hubs. The problem affected airports including Chicago, Denver, and San Francisco, leading to major gate congestion and passenger disruption. While flights already in the air were permitted to continue to their destinations, the airline acknowledged the widespread impact on its evening schedule. United stated that safety was its top priority as it worked to resolve the technical failure and manage the resulting backlog of flights.</p>

This initiative includes the development of new facilities, such as a smart glass production line in Kentucky and a server manufacturing plant in Houston. The move is part of a broader effort to reshore elements of Apple's supply chain and increase American-made components in its products.</p>

          <p>ESPN host Pat McAfee publicly criticized executives at his own network while congratulating ESPN on its new broadcasting deal with WWE. In a social media post, McAfee celebrated the partnership but took a shot at what he called "powerless, bum a-- suits" at the company, predicting they would try to undermine the agreement. This follows his previous on-air accusations against a former ESPN executive for attempting to sabotage his show. The incident underscores McAfee's outspoken nature and his ongoing friction with parts of the network's management, even after signing a lucrative contract.</p>

Patients seeking mental health treatment are 12 times more likely to wait over 18 months compared to those needing physical care. The article highlights the story of a young woman with complex PTSD who has seen a psychiatrist only once in ten years, illustrating the severe impact of the backlog. While physical health waitlists are declining, mental health backlogs remain stubbornly high, prompting calls for urgent reform and better community-based early intervention.</p>

          <p>Following an attempted carjacking and assault on a former government aide in Washington, D.C., President Trump has stated he is considering federalizing the city's police force. Trump called crime in the city "totally out of control" and said his administration's lawyers are studying the possibility of overturning D.C.'s home rule, which grants it limited self-government. While violent crime in D.C. has recently declined from a peak, the incident has provided a political opportunity for Trump to renew his calls for greater federal control over the nation's capital, a move that would require Congressional action.</p>

          <p>New archaeological evidence suggests that survivors of the AD 79 Mount Vesuvius eruption returned to live in the ruins of Pompeii. Researchers believe that some residents, unable to relocate, resettled the site, creating a precarious settlement that lasted until the 5th century. These inhabitants are thought to have lived in the upper floors of buried homes and repurposed lower levels as cellars, scavenging for valuable materials. This discovery challenges the long-held image of Pompeii as a city frozen in time, revealing a forgotten chapter of survival and reoccupation after the cataclysmic event.</p>

          <p>Brian Robbins has stepped down as co-chief executive of Paramount Global and head of its film studio, a move that was anticipated ahead of the company's acquisition by Skydance Media. Robbins, who had led Paramount Pictures since 2021, was part of a three-person leadership team that steered the company through a tumultuous period. The new leadership under Skydance will see its own executives, Dana Goldberg and Josh Greenstein, take over management of the historic studio. The departure marks a significant leadership change as the Redstone era at Paramount comes to a close.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated there is a "good chance" he could soon meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The statement followed what Trump described as "highly productive" talks in Moscow between his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Putin. The meeting comes just days before a Trump-imposed deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire or face new sanctions. While details remain vague, the White House confirmed Trump is open to a meeting, raising the possibility of a major diplomatic push to end the war.</p>

          <p>In the escalating tech and trade rivalry with the United States, China is strategically using its control over the global supply of rare earth minerals. These elements are critical for a vast range of technologies, including semiconductors, electric vehicles, and advanced defense systems. When the U.S. imposed tariffs and export bans to slow China's AI progress, Beijing retaliated with its own export controls on key rare earths. This move highlights China's powerful leverage, as it holds most of the world's refining capacity and is a primary supplier to the U.S., including for Pentagon weapons systems.</p>

          <p>Rocket manufacturer Firefly Aerospace priced its initial public offering at $45 per share, exceeding its revised target range of $41 to $43. The IPO raised $868 million and gives the Texas-based company a valuation of approximately $6.3 billion ahead of its Nasdaq debut. Firefly, which develops rockets and lunar landers, has secured major contracts with NASA and defense contractors. The successful pricing reflects strong investor interest in the space technology sector, contributing to a reopening of the broader IPO market this year. (not investment advice)</p>

The Secret Service confirmed it coordinated with the agency to ensure safe navigation for its security detail's watercraft. While the action was deemed within operational criteria, ethics experts have criticized the move. They argue it creates an appearance of special treatment and is hypocritical at a time when the administration has made significant cuts to public services like the National Park Service.</p>
