          <p>President Trump has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, which includes a 15% tariff on U.S. imports from the country. The agreement also reportedly involves a $550 billion investment from Japan into the United States. This move is part of a broader strategy by the administration to renegotiate trade relationships and impose higher tariffs on multiple countries to encourage new deals. The Japanese government has not yet publicly confirmed the details of the reported agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chloe Kelly and Michelle Agyemang have been hailed as England's new "super subs" following their pivotal roles in the Euro 2025 semi-final victory against Italy. Drawing comparisons to the impactful duo of Russo and Toone from Euro 2022, both Kelly and Agyemang came off the bench to change the game's trajectory. Agyemang scored a crucial late equalizer to force extra time, while Kelly secured the win with a dramatic 119th-minute goal. Their performances have sparked debate on whether they should start in the upcoming final.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece from the Los Angeles Times analyzes recent events, including the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert" and political maneuvering around the Jeffrey Epstein case, as examples of capitulation to President Trump. The article suggests that corporations and political figures are increasingly bending to pressure from the White House to avoid conflict. It frames these actions within a broader context of self-censorship and appeasement in the current political climate, questioning the long-term effectiveness of such strategies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused former President Barack Obama of "treason," alleging a plot to undermine his 2016 election victory by manipulating intelligence regarding Russian interference. The claim stems from a recently declassified report from the Director of National Intelligence, which Trump's allies assert shows a conspiracy. A spokesperson for Obama dismissed the allegations as "ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction." The controversy arises amid pressure on the Trump administration to release more information related to the Jeffrey Epstein case.</p>

          <p>A haunting 1975 photograph by Stanley Forman, which captured a woman and a child falling from a collapsed fire escape in Boston, is being remembered for its profound impact on public safety.

The shocking photo prompted the city of Boston to enact new regulations requiring fire escapes to be inspected and certified every five years.

          <p>A panel of federal judges in New Jersey has ended Alina Habba's tenure as the state's interim U.S. Attorney by declining to make her appointment permanent. The rarely used power was invoked after Habba, a former personal lawyer for President Trump, completed her 120-day interim term without Senate confirmation. The judges appointed her top assistant to the role, though the Justice Department later removed the replacement, accusing the judges of political motives. Habba's time in office was marked by controversy, including opposition from New Jersey's two Democratic senators.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has announced disciplinary actions against dozens of students involved in a pro-Palestinian protest that occupied a campus library in May. The sanctions range from probation and multi-year suspensions to degree revocations and expulsions.

This action comes amid broader tensions between the Trump administration and universities over campus protests, with student groups calling the punishments the most severe for a single political protest in the school's history.</p>

          <p>The House of Representatives abruptly decided to begin its summer recess early, a move analysts attribute to Speaker Mike Johnson's effort to avoid a vote on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein. A new bipartisan bill to disclose more information had gained significant traction, putting Republican leadership in a difficult position between their base and President Trump, who has resisted such calls. The article suggests the ongoing scandal has become a powerful and inescapable political force, effectively paralyzing a branch of Congress and highlighting deep rifts within the Republican coalition.</p>

          <p>Texas Instruments saw its stock fall in after-hours trading despite reporting second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analysts' expectations. The negative market reaction was driven by the company's forecast for the upcoming third quarter, which fell short of consensus estimates. While sales in its core analog chip business showed strong growth, the weaker outlook suggests potential headwinds ahead. As a key supplier of semiconductors for the automotive and industrial sectors, the company's forecast is often seen as an indicator of broader economic trends. (not investment advice)</p>

The project, which aims to deploy over 15,000 satellites for global direct-to-phone internet service, is reportedly falling behind its deployment schedule. According to an engineer involved with the project, the primary obstacle is a severe shortage of rockets, as China's current launch and manufacturing capabilities cannot keep up with the massive demand.
