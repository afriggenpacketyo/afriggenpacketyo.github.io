          <p>Robert De Niro has voiced his unwavering support for his daughter, Airyn, after she came out as transgender. Airyn, 29, shared her journey of transitioning last year, expressing the importance of being seen rather than just visible, citing Laverne Cox as an inspiration. De Niro stated he loves and supports Airyn as his daughter, just as he did when she was his son, emphasizing that it's not a big deal. Airyn also expressed gratitude for her parents' decision to keep her out of the limelight, allowing her to have a normal childhood. </p>

          <p>England is set to hold local elections, offering a significant gauge of the current political landscape following Labour's victory last year. The elections will test the strength of Reform U.K., led by Nigel Farage, as they aim to convert their polling success into actual votes amidst economic stagnation and government disapproval. Both Labour and the Conservatives are facing challenges, creating opportunities for smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. Voters will elect council members and regional mayors across various municipalities, with results expected to roll in throughout Friday. </p>

          <p>The Football Association (FA) has announced that transgender women will be prohibited from participating in women's football in England, effective June 1. This decision follows the UK Supreme Court's ruling that defines 'woman' based on biological sex, leading the FA to amend its regulations. The FA acknowledges the difficulty this poses for transgender women who wish to play in alignment with their gender identity. The Scottish FA is reportedly considering a similar ruling, potentially extending the ban across Scotland as well. </p>

          <p>The arrest of a Wisconsin judge is presented as the latest instance of the Trump administration's efforts to undermine the judiciary, a tactic reminiscent of authoritarian regimes. The article asserts that with Congress and the administration failing to provide checks, the courts remain the primary defense against Trump's actions. The author details instances of Trump attacking judges and Republicans introducing impeachment resolutions against those ruling against his policies. The article argues that these actions, along with demands on law firms and the arrest of a judge, represent an unprecedented challenge to the rule of law in U.S. history. </p>

This situation is described as a high-octane version of Trump's attempts to control the media, with those who could stand up to his bullying instead obeying in advance.

          <p>President Trump's first 100 days in office have been marked by an unprecedented assault on the environment, with numerous actions to weaken regulations and promote fossil fuels.

These efforts face legal challenges, but advocates worry about the long-term consequences for clean air, water, and climate goals.

          <p>President Trump's tariffs are causing price increases on a wide range of products, from clothing to electronics, as retailers pass on increased costs to consumers. While some companies have stockpiled inventory to mitigate the initial impact, the long-term effects could be significant. Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein have already announced price hikes, and some Amazon sellers have followed suit. The article explores why price increases haven't hit uniformly, citing robust supply chains and inventory management.

          <p>Despite Mayor Karen Bass's assurance that Los Angeles animal shelters will not close, rescue groups remain concerned about potential budget cuts. While the mayor's budget includes a $4.8 million cut to Animal Services, it also allocates an additional $5 million for the agency in the 'unappropriated balance.' Animal rescue advocates are demanding that the City Council reject employee layoffs and preserve spay-and-neuter programs. The confusion began with the release of the mayor's proposed budget, leading to alarm among rescue volunteers and prompting calls for the City Council to move the $5 million into Animal Services. </p>

          <p>President Trump's executive order targeting school discipline policies based on 'discriminatory equity ideology' is setting the stage for potential legal battles in California. The order challenges state laws that limit suspensions for 'willful defiance,' arguing they promote racial discrimination. California officials and advocacy groups express concern that the order undermines efforts to address disproportionate discipline rates among Black and Latino students. The debate centers on disparate impact theory, with critics arguing the order could compromise student safety while supporters advocate for local control. </p>

Core consumer prices are projected to rise 2.2 percent, against 2.4 percent forecast in January.

          <p>The US and Ukraine have signed a minerals deal granting Washington access to Ukraine's natural resources in exchange for a reconstruction investment fund. Trump has previously demanded Ukraine pay back aid, but the agreement does not dictate that Ukraine pay back any supposed 'debt'. The language used by the US in announcing the deal is notably harsher towards Russia. Despite the focus on minerals, the agreement also includes provisions for new oil and gas projects. The deal does not hinder Kyiv's EU ambitions, and profits will be reinvested in Ukraine for 10 years. </p>
