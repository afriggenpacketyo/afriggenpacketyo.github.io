          <p>A Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv has resulted in at least 14 deaths and dozens of injuries, marking one of the deadliest assaults on the Ukrainian capital in recent months. Ukrainian officials reported that the strikes, which lasted nearly nine hours, targeted residential buildings, causing significant damage and trapping people under rubble. The attack occurred as world leaders convened at the Group of Seven meeting in Canada, where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was expected to attend, but President Trump left early citing tensions in the Middle East. The international community is watching closely as the conflict intensifies, and rescue efforts continue to recover survivors and assess the full extent of the damage. The city is reeling from the devastation and loss of life. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump left the G7 summit early, citing pressing issues related to the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, after urging Iranians to "immediately evacuate Tehran." G7 leaders affirmed support for Israel's right to defend itself and condemned Iran for regional instability, reiterating that Iran must not acquire nuclear weapons. Trump dismissed French President Emmanuel Macron's comments about a ceasefire offer, stating the situation was "much bigger than that." The conflict continues to intensify, with Israel claiming to have eliminated a top Iranian military commander, while China seeks to mediate and de-escalate the situation. The G7 nations also discussed Trump's tariff policies and support for Ukraine. </p>

          <p>Bullet train services between Tokyo and Sendai on the Tohoku shinkansen line were suspended due to an inspection of an out-of-service train that halted between stations. JR East hopes to resume operations around 7 p.m. after the inspection is completed. The affected train, which debuted last spring on the Yamagata shinkansen line, stopped between Utsunomiya and Nasushiobara stations, causing two other trains to also stop.

Woakes played nine Tests in 2024, his second-most in a calendar year, and his role as a senior bowler has become more prominent following James Anderson's retirement.

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to slow the pace of its monthly government bond purchases beyond April next year, reducing them by 200 billion yen per quarter, down from the current 400 billion yen. The BOJ will maintain its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 0.5 percent, reflecting a cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy amid economic uncertainties. This decision comes as U.S. President Donald Trump's higher tariffs blur the outlook for Japan's export-oriented economy. The central bank aims to trim its bloated balance sheet through March 2026 before potentially raising its key interest rate again. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>Shipping groups are increasingly avoiding the Strait of Hormuz due to escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, according to Bimco, the world's largest shipping association. This has led to a modest drop in the number of ships sailing through the area, a critical gateway for the world's oil industry and container ships. The Strait of Hormuz is vital for global container trade, serving as a transshipment hub for ports in the region. Freight rates have jumped since the Israeli attacks on Iran, reflecting the perceived risk in the area, while shipping insurance rates remain stable for now. </p>
