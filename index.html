          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey has ordered the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from ICE detention while his immigration proceedings continue. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil is not a threat or flight risk and that his detention was "highly unusual." Khalil, a green card holder detained in March, was allegedly held based on omitted details from his green card application and accusations of anti-Israel speech, which Farbiarz deemed insufficient grounds for detention. The Justice Department is likely to appeal the decision, but Farbiarz has denied their request to stay the ruling, meaning it is effective immediately. The judge also stated that there was no evidence of violence or inciting violence on Khalil's part, and therefore he would not order electronic monitoring.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected a request from two toy companies to expedite their challenge to President Donald Trump's tariffs, meaning the Trump administration has 30 days to respond to the challenge. Learning Resources and hand2mind argued that Trump lacked the authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The companies sought to bypass a federal appeals court due to the tariffs' impact on businesses and consumers. The U.S. Court of International Trade previously blocked Trump's tariffs, but a federal appeals court allowed them to remain in effect pending arguments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican tax proposals in both the House and Senate aim to end many clean energy tax credits, potentially using the savings to fund broader tax cuts for households and businesses. The House-passed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" would eliminate tax credits for electric vehicle purchases and energy-efficient home improvements, with most breaks disappearing in 2026, years earlier than under current law. The Senate Republicans are considering a similar timeline for ending these tax breaks. These changes would affect incentives for new and used EVs, as well as credits for installing solar panels and energy-efficient windows. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The King Hussein Cancer Center in Jordan is treating child cancer patients from Gaza, but only a few dozen have arrived due to obstacles. The center offers a stark contrast to conditions in Gaza, where hospitals have been damaged or destroyed. Jordanian officials claim Israel has obstructed exit visas for medical evacuations, leading to deadly delays and diminished chances of survival for some children. King Abdullah pledged to bring 2,000 sick children to Jordan for treatment, but the process has been slow and challenging.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers reportedly blocked federal agents from entering their stadium, amid ongoing protests against immigration enforcement in the city. While ICE denied its agents were at the stadium, the Department of Homeland Security said other personnel were briefly in the parking lot. The Dodgers are expected to announce assistance for immigrants impacted by the raids, following criticism from player Kiké Hernández. Recent ICE activity in Los Angeles is part of President Trump's crackdown on immigration, prompting protests and the deployment of Marines and National Guard troops.</p>

Under the proposed "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), borrowers could face significantly higher payments compared to the Biden administration's SAVE plan.
