          <p>Former President Donald Trump has escalated his criticism of the Federal Reserve, threatening a "major lawsuit" against its chairman, Jerome Powell. The threat, made on social media, centers on the costs of renovating the Fed's headquarters in Washington, D.C. This move is widely seen as an attempt to pressure Powell into lowering interest rates immediately, a long-standing demand from Trump. The White House has not yet clarified if a formal lawsuit is actually being prepared.</p>

          <p>The number of migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats has exceeded 50,000 since the Labour party came to power in July of last year. This figure represents a significant increase compared to the same period under the previous Conservative government. The milestone intensifies the political debate over immigration, with the government vowing to address the issue while opposition parties criticize their plan as ineffective. The crossings have also resulted in tragedies, including a recent death confirmed by French authorities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for July indicated a 2.7% increase over the last 12 months, a figure slightly lower than the 2.8% economists had anticipated. On a monthly basis, the index rose by 0.2%, driven largely by shelter costs while energy prices fell. The data suggests that the inflationary impact of new tariffs has been modest so far, although they are noticeable in categories like household furnishings. This report is being closely watched as it could influence the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swiss sportswear company On announced a significant 32% increase in sales for its second quarter, prompting it to raise its full-year revenue forecast. The popular sneaker brand now anticipates sales of 2.91 billion Swiss francs, despite facing new tariffs on imports from Vietnam. The company has successfully offset these costs by raising prices, particularly on its lifestyle products, without seeing a slowdown in consumer demand. This strong performance highlights On's growing market share in the competitive sportswear industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A sophisticated new malware method, dubbed "CAPTCHAgeddon," is using fake "Are you human?" verification screens to trick users into compromising their systems. The technique, known as ClickFix, avoids traditional file downloads by copying a malicious script to the user's clipboard when they click to verify. The user is then prompted to paste and run this command, which can install malware designed to steal accounts, passwords, and other sensitive data. This stealthy approach is spreading across various platforms, including compromised blogs and social media sites.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has signaled increased enforcement of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act against wind energy projects, citing concerns over bird deaths. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum directed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to ensure eagles are not "sacrificed" for wind power. Critics argue this is a pretext to hinder renewable energy development, which the former president has long opposed. They point out that climate change and other factors like stray cats pose a far greater threat to bird populations than wind turbines.</p>

Despite posting a net loss due to IPO-related charges, the strong top-line growth and positive market sentiment have caused the company's stock to soar. The results reflect growing institutional interest in stablecoins, bolstered by more supportive crypto legislation from the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While mortgage rates have slightly decreased from their peak, experts believe a return to sub-6% rates is unlikely in the near future, possibly not until mid-to-late 2026. Achieving such rates would likely require significant negative economic shifts, such as higher unemployment or a major geopolitical event. For now, the resilient economy, low unemployment, and persistent inflation are expected to keep borrowing costs elevated. Experts suggest that when rates do eventually fall, it will likely spur a flood of new inventory into the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A man identified as Nicholas Rossi, who allegedly faked his own death to flee the U.S. and avoid sexual assault charges, is now on trial in Utah. Rossi was arrested in Scotland in 2021 after being recognized in a hospital and was extradited to face accusations of sexually assaulting two women in 2008. During the trial, one of the alleged victims identified him in court, describing their brief and controlling relationship. The defense claims the case is built on old, incomplete evidence, while prosecutors argue Rossi is an intelligent man who manipulated a vulnerable woman.</p>

          <p>Aimee Betro, a woman from Wisconsin, has been found guilty in a UK court for her role as a hired gun in a violent family feud. In 2019, she attempted to shoot a man at point-blank range in Birmingham, but the gun jammed, saving his life. The plot originated from a 2018 fight, leading two men to hire Betro, whom one had met on a dating app, to carry out the murder. After the failed attempt, Betro fired shots at the family's home before fleeing back to the U.S., but she was eventually captured in Armenia and extradited for trial.</p>

          <p>Team Europe's roster for the 2025 Ryder Cup is solidifying with a strong sense of continuity from its victorious 2023 squad. Key players like Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose, and Tommy Fleetwood have already secured their spots, with others like Tyrrell Hatton and Shane Lowry expected to follow. This stability contrasts sharply with the uncertainty surrounding the U.S. team and provides European captain Luke Donald with a settled and experienced group. The consistency is seen as a major advantage as Europe aims for a rare victory on American soil at Bethpage.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has officially designated the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a separatist group in Pakistan, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. Washington holds the group responsible for numerous deadly attacks in Pakistan's Balochistan province, including a recent train hijacking that killed 31 people. The designation, which Pakistan welcomed, tightens scrutiny on the group's supporters and funding networks. This action coincides with a visit to Washington by Pakistan's army chief and a new trade agreement that could see U.S. firms help develop oil reserves in the resource-rich region.</p>

          <p>After 100 days in office, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's leadership has been characterized by a strong focus on foreign policy and significant domestic challenges. He has actively engaged with leaders in Ukraine, the U.S., and the EU, but has also faced criticism for surprise decisions, such as halting certain weapons shipments to Israel. Domestically, his coalition has tightened border controls to curb irregular immigration and is facing its first major crisis over a failed judicial appointment. His term began on shaky ground after he initially failed to secure enough votes to become chancellor in the first round of voting.</p>
