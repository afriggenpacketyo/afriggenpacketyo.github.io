          <p>Puer, a region in China known for its fermented tea, is increasingly seeing its growers branch out into coffee production as younger generations develop a taste for it. Liao Shihao, who runs a coffee plantation that has been in his family for three generations, notes that customers are now more interested in experiencing the flavors of artisanal coffee. This shift reflects a broader trend of evolving preferences among Chinese consumers, creating new opportunities for local coffee growers. The region hopes to capitalize on the growing demand for specialty coffee and diversify its agricultural offerings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant explosion at Shahid Rajaee, a major Iranian port near Bandar Abbas, has resulted in at least 18 deaths and 800 injuries. The blast caused extensive damage, blowing out windows and roofs of nearby buildings, with residents reporting feeling the impact up to 50km away. Initial reports suggest the fire may have originated from improper handling of solid fuel intended for ballistic missiles, with some sources pointing to a shipment of sodium perchlorate rocket fuel that arrived at the port in March.

          <p>The European pharmaceutical industry is bracing for potential tariffs as President Trump threatens to impose higher taxes on pharmaceuticals. The move could significantly impact the EU, which is the top exporter of pharmaceutical products and chemicals to the US.

The situation remains uncertain as the industry awaits further details on the proposed tariffs.</p>

          <p>Australia is contemplating capping the number of international students to address its growing housing affordability crisis. Politicians believe limiting international students will reduce demand for rentals and starter homes, thereby lowering prices. This shift marks a significant change for Australia, which has long viewed international education as a key economic sector. While some worry about the economic impact, others argue that improving selection criteria for international students is a better solution than blanket restrictions.</p>
