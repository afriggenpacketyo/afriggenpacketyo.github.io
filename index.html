          <h2>False Positive Drug Tests Create Hardship for New Mothers</h2>

          <p>An investigation by CBS News and The Marshall Project reveals that routine drug tests for maternity patients can yield a high rate of false positives, with devastating consequences. The article highlights the story of an Alabama mother who temporarily lost custody of her children after eating a poppy seed bagel, which triggered a positive result for opiates. This practice, rooted in past drug epidemics, continues to affect families despite evidence that many common foods and medications can cause inaccurate results, leading to stressful and unwarranted child welfare probes.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in specific areas of Gaza, including Gaza City, to allow for the secure delivery of humanitarian aid. This move comes amid mounting international pressure and warnings of a severe hunger crisis, with the UN welcoming the step but reiterating the need for a broader ceasefire. Despite the pause, aid agencies and Palestinian health officials stress that the measures are insufficient to address the scale of the catastrophe, as deaths from malnutrition continue to be reported.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer plans to discuss the urgent need for a ceasefire in Gaza during his upcoming meeting with US President Donald Trump in Scotland. The meeting follows the recent halt of ceasefire negotiations and growing international concern over the humanitarian crisis, with aid agencies emphasizing that airdrops are inadequate. Starmer's government is also facing domestic pressure to recognize a Palestinian state, a move the opposition Conservative party currently deems inappropriate as it would "reward" Hamas.</p>

          <p>A travel writer who has visited 70 countries offers advice on phrases American tourists should avoid to be more respectful and culturally aware when abroad. The author suggests refraining from comments like asking for prices in dollars, remarking on how "cheap" things are, or assuming everyone's country is structured like the U.S. By avoiding such ethnocentric language and embracing local customs, such as trying local coffee instead of seeking Starbucks, travelers can have a more transformative and positive experience.</p>

          <p>An essay in The Atlantic argues that Donald Trump's presidency is making socialism appealing again, particularly to a younger generation disillusioned with the current economic system. The author contends that by engaging in "ersatz capitalism" that favors cronies, vilifying free exchange, and using state power for economic control through tariffs, Trump's administration discredits market principles. This behavior, combined with flagrant self-enrichment, validates critiques of capitalism and leaves an opening for socialist ideas to gain traction as an alternative. (not investment advice)</p>

The author recalls how these listings once served as a vital guide to discovering emerging artists and niche subcultures, providing a critical platform that has not been adequately replaced by algorithm-driven social media. This shift, driven by economic pressures and a "poptimist" focus on celebrities, erodes the support structure for adventurous art and leaves a gap in the historical record of a city's cultural life.</p>

          <p>An explainer delves into the origins of tipping in the United States, tracing it back to the post-Civil War era when employers sought to avoid paying wages to formerly enslaved workers in the service industry. This practice led to the creation of the "tipped minimum wage," which under federal law is just $2.13 an hour, with the expectation that customer tips make up the difference to the regular minimum wage. The article notes that this system persists largely due to lobbying from groups like the National Restaurant Association, placing the burden of paying workers' wages directly on the consumer.</p>
