          <p>Conservationists in Wales are using edible glitter to track endangered water voles. The glitter is mixed with apple chunks, a favorite treat for captive-bred voles, and fed to them. Once consumed, the glitter is expected to appear in their droppings, allowing conservationists to track the voles' movements and territories. This innovative approach aims to help protect the species by informing habitat management strategies, such as removing invasive conifers or fencing off riverbanks to prevent grazing, ultimately aiding the water voles' dispersal and survival. </p>

          <p>Palaeontologists in Alberta, Canada, are excavating a mass grave containing thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus bones, hoping to uncover the mystery of their simultaneous deaths. The dinosaurs, relatives of the Triceratops, were part of a massive herd migrating from the south when a flash flood likely overwhelmed them. Researchers believe the site offers a unique opportunity to study a single community of animals from a specific moment in time. This excavation, featured in the BBC series 'Walking With Dinosaurs,' provides insights into dinosaur biology and the ancient ecosystem of the region.</p>

Swim England, the sport's governing body, failed to act on a 2012 investigation that recommended Rudd's suspension.

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed in April, indicating that consumption remains a concern for the economy, while industrial output surprisingly grew despite U.S. tariffs. The National Bureau of Statistics acknowledges external uncertainties and the need to consolidate economic recovery. Fixed-asset investment saw a slight increase, and the urban unemployment rate decreased. Despite a drop in shipments to the U.S. due to tariffs, China's exports surged due to increased trade with Southeast Asian countries. Automobile sales growth was weak, and the real estate sector continues to face challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to Kyle Chan in The New York Times, China may be surpassing the United States in economic and technological dominance due to contrasting approaches. While the U.S., under President Trump, focuses on short-term trade wars and undermines research funding, China is strategically investing in cutting-edge technologies and expanding its global manufacturing leadership. Chan argues that Trump's tariffs and neglect of American innovation pillars are accelerating China's rise, potentially leading to a Chinese-dominated world with a diminished America struggling behind tariff walls. To avoid this, the U.S. must prioritize investments in research, innovation, and global economic ties.</p>

          <p>A downgrade of the United States' credit rating by Moody's, coupled with concerns about rising government debt, is creating turbulence in financial markets. The proposed bill to make Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent has amplified worries about the fiscal deficit and growing debt costs. The downgrade has led to declines in stock futures and weakened the U.S. dollar, with analysts suggesting it could undermine the safe-haven status of Treasury bonds. This situation has heightened scrutiny on fiscal spending and interest rates globally, recalling the market volatility seen after a similar downgrade in 2011.</p>

          <p>Former US President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones. The diagnosis came after he experienced urinary symptoms, and the cancer is characterized by a Gleason score of 9, indicating a high-grade cancer. While treatment options are available, including hormone therapy and chemotherapy, they are not curative. Biden and his family are reviewing these options, and the former president has received support from both sides of the political spectrum.

          <p>A Mexican tall ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in two deaths and multiple injuries. The incident occurred as the ship was departing for Iceland, reportedly due to a technical failure that caused the ship to lose power and drift backward. Federal and local agencies have launched an investigation, and questions are being raised about potential contributing factors, including cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency. A vigil was held for the victims, and the community mourns the tragic event.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill cleared a key hurdle in the House after conservatives initially rebelled over spending cuts. The House Budget Committee advanced the bill, which extends tax cuts and increases military spending, with conservative holdouts voting present. The bill faces further challenges in the Rules Committee and the Senate. Conservatives are seeking stricter Medicaid requirements and an end to clean energy subsidies, while moderates are pushing for higher state and local tax deductions, highlighting divisions within the Republican party.</p>
