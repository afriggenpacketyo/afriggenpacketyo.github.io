          <p>Police are investigating an act of vandalism at Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's campaign office in New York City, where "AOC funds genocide in Gaza" was painted in red. The incident occurred after Ocasio-Cortez voted against a Republican-led amendment to cut funding for Israel's "Iron Dome" defensive system. She explained her vote by stating the bill did not address funding for "the actual bombs killing Palestinians," a position that put her at odds with some progressive colleagues who supported the amendment.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called for a wide-ranging review of the Federal Reserve, suggesting its mission and overall success should be examined beyond recent controversies. His comments come amid tensions between the White House and the central bank, including President Trump's criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell and interest rate policies. Bessent argued that the Fed has been overly cautious about inflation from tariffs, which has not materialized, and questioned the effectiveness of its current mindset and operations.

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has issued a recall for approximately 5 million above-ground pools linked to the drowning deaths of nine children over two decades. The pools, sold by major retailers like Walmart and Amazon, feature an external compression strap that children can use to climb into the water, even when the ladder is removed. The victims were between 22 months and three years old. Manufacturers are offering a free repair kit to secure the strap and prevent access.</p>

          <p>Automotive group Stellantis, owner of brands like Jeep and Peugeot, has issued a warning of an estimated $2.7 billion net loss for the first half of the year.

This preliminary announcement highlights the immense challenges facing the new CEO, Antonio Filosa, as the company's stock has already fallen by about 38% this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study has quantified the immense value of global emergency vaccine stockpiles for diseases like cholera, Ebola, and meningitis, finding they have averted an estimated 300,000 deaths and 6 million cases over two decades. These reserves, funded by organizations like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, allow for rapid deployment of vaccines during outbreaks, which is critical since manufacturing can take months. The research affirms the stockpiles' worth, providing over $32 billion in economic benefits, at a crucial time when global health funding is facing significant cuts.</p>

          <p>The National Hurricane Center is tracking a tropical wave in the Atlantic, giving it a low 20% chance of development over the next week as environmental conditions are expected to become unfavorable. Meanwhile, Florida is contending with a major heat dome that has placed the entire state under a heat advisory, with heat index values expected to reach up to 112 degrees. Forecasters are urging residents to take precautions against the extreme heat, which poses a more immediate threat than the disorganized weather system in the tropics.</p>

In a post on social media, Trump claimed there is a "big clamouring" for the change and that reverting to the original name, which was dropped in 2020 for being offensive to Native Americans, would make the team more valuable. This threat introduces a political obstacle to the planned £3 billion stadium project.</p>
