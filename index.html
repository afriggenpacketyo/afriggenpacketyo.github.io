          <p>Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced that Southeast Asian nations aim to present a united front when discussing U.S. tariffs with President Donald Trump. ASEAN seeks a unified approach to address economic challenges stemming from U.S. tariffs and the ongoing conflict in Myanmar, aiming to preserve regional peace, stability, and prosperity. Anwar emphasized the importance of an open, inclusive, and rules-based international order, which he believes is threatened by arbitrary actions. The region relies heavily on exports to the U.S. and has been negatively impacted by the Trump administration's tariffs, which vary from 10% to 49% across ASEAN member states. Optimism regarding potential future cooperation is expressed with China and the Gulf Cooperation Council, which could potentially help insulate ASEAN's economy.</p>

          <p>Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are expressing deep concern over "unilateral tariff measures" at their meeting in Malaysia, though the draft statement avoids directly naming the United States. Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim noted that the global trading system is under strain due to recent U.S. tariffs, which range from 10% to 49% for ASEAN members. The leaders warn that these tariffs pose complex challenges to ASEAN's economic growth, stability, and integration, while reaffirming their commitment to a multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organization at its core. ASEAN trade ministers previously decided against retaliation, a move characterized as prudent to avoid escalating trade tensions.</p>

          <p>North Korea has arrested a fourth official, Ri Hyong Son, in connection with the recent failed launch of a new navy warship, according to state media. The incident involved damage to the bottom of the 5,000-ton destroyer during the launch. Ri Hyong Son, a vice department director of the Munitions Industry Department of the Party Central Committee, is considered highly responsible for the accident. This follows the detention of three shipyard officials earlier in the week, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has condemned the incident as a criminal act caused by carelessness.

          <p>As South Korea prepares for its upcoming presidential election, many women feel their concerns are being sidelined, despite their active role in ousting the previous president. Issues such as gender-based discrimination, pay inequality, and online sexual abuse are not being adequately addressed by the leading candidates. With a struggling economy, young men often perceive themselves as victims of reverse discrimination, leading politicians to avoid feminist agendas. While candidate Lee Jae-myung acknowledges women's role in past political events, he and his party are cautious not to alienate male voters, leaving many women feeling they have limited positive options in the election.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated direct contract sales of government rice stockpiles to lower soaring prices, aiming for a retail price of approximately 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms by early June. This move follows criticism of the government's prior ineffectiveness in controlling rice prices amid rising inflation and household budget pressures. The government intends to release around 300,000 tons of rice through contracts with major retailers, bypassing the traditional auction system. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi emphasized the urgency to address public concerns and plans for online sales to broaden distribution are also under consideration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has condemned President Vladimir Putin's escalation of attacks on Ukraine, describing it as "absolutely crazy" and indicating he is considering imposing further sanctions on Russia. Trump expressed surprise and displeasure with Putin's actions, particularly the targeting of cities and the killing of civilians. He also criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for his public statements. Trump warned that if Putin attempts to seize all of Ukraine, it could lead to Russia's downfall, while continuing to distance himself from responsibility for ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump will delay his threatened 50% tariffs on all European Union imports into the US following a "very nice call" with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. The tariff delay was extended to July 9 to allow more time for negotiations, reversing Trump's previous warning to impose the tariffs on June 1. Von der Leyen affirmed Europe's readiness to swiftly advance trade talks, while Germany's finance minister emphasized the need for serious negotiations rather than further provocations. Other stories covered in the article include Trump's warning to Russia and the US federal judges considering creating their own armed security force.</p>

          <p>Xu Lin, a former senior economic planner, suggests that China should lower its annual GDP growth target for the next five years to around 4%. This recommendation accounts for potential prolonged rivalry with the United States and the need to address structural problems within China. Xu emphasizes the importance of focusing on employment expansion and debt ratio control. He believes that setting a target higher than the potential growth rate would be inappropriate, considering the complex international environment and domestic challenges such as property issues and weak market confidence.

          <p>A Chinese military magazine, Naval and Merchant Ships, detailed a strategy to subdue Taiwan by targeting key infrastructure nodes. The article suggested that attacking 30 to 40 "super critical" targets could lead to a chain collapse of fundamental systems, including liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities. This "urban collapse warfare" tactic aims to destroy the Taiwanese resistance and create conditions for a "win without fighting." The article emphasized that Taiwan's dependence on imported energy and vulnerability to natural disasters make it a suitable target for this strategy.</p>
