          <p>A new appropriations bill in the U.S. House includes language to revive the 'China Initiative,' a program aimed at countering Chinese economic espionage that was shut down due to criticism of racial bias. The provision, which seeks to “maintain America’s competitive edge,” has sparked significant backlash from the scientific community. Over 1,000 researchers have signed a letter arguing that re-establishing the program would harm America's ability to attract global talent, damage innovation, and ultimately weaken national security.</p>

          <p>Mental health experts highlight the challenges in diagnosing depression in older adults, as symptoms are often mistakenly attributed to the normal aging process. While the core symptoms of depression are consistent across all age groups, older individuals may present with more physical complaints, leading to delayed recognition and chronic conditions. Stigma and a lack of awareness among both patients and doctors can further complicate diagnosis and treatment, which includes both medication and various forms of psychotherapy tailored to the individual.</p>

          <p>This article posits that Nvidia is a premier stock for investing in the future of autonomous vehicles, even though the automotive segment is currently a small fraction of its revenue. The argument centers on Nvidia's development of a full-stack hardware and software ecosystem, which positions it to be a foundational technology provider for numerous car manufacturers. This agnostic approach is presented as a less risky strategy than investing in a single automaker like Tesla to win the autonomous driving race. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a strategic move, President Trump has withdrawn the formal nomination of his former lawyer, Alina Habba, to be the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. This action circumvents a federal law that would have prevented her from serving in an acting capacity while her nomination was pending in the Senate. The decision came after a federal court declined to keep Habba in the role and instead appointed her deputy, sparking a contentious leadership dispute with the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>An extreme heat dome that has been affecting the central United States is now moving eastward, prompting heat alerts for over 100 million Americans from the Midwest to the Northeast. Forecasters predict temperatures 10 to 15 degrees above average, with feels-like temperatures exceeding 100 degrees in many areas. The situation in the Corn Belt is intensified by 'corn sweat,' a phenomenon where millions of acres of corn release thousands of gallons of water vapor, significantly increasing humidity.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while President Trump's approval ratings are declining on key issues like the budget and immigration, this may not fundamentally threaten his hold on power. The author suggests that authoritarian leaders do not depend on public support to govern, but rather on intimidating voters, suppressing dissent, and controlling state institutions. The article points to the administration's actions, such as pressuring election officials and targeting journalists, as evidence of a strategy that operates independently of popular opinion.</p>

In a letter to the DHS secretary, lawmakers argue that this tactic erodes public trust, violates due process, and creates opportunities for criminals to impersonate federal agents.

          <p>The Trump administration's new Arctic strategy, which allocates nearly $9 billion for a new fleet of icebreakers, is intensifying the geopolitical focus on the polar region. This 'historic investment' is designed to reassert American dominance over the 'frozen frontier' as melting ice opens new shipping lanes. The move has spurred debate within China, a self-declared 'Near-Arctic State,' on how to best utilize the increasingly navigable Northern Sea Route to advance its own economic and strategic interests.</p>
