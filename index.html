          <h2>NTSB Report Blames Boeing's Inadequate Training for Alaska Airlines Door Plug Incident</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-24 19:50:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that "multiple system failures" at Boeing, including inadequate training, guidance, and oversight, led to the Alaska Airlines incident where a door plug flew off mid-flight in January 2024, causing minor injuries to eight passengers. The NTSB report also cited the FAA's ineffective compliance enforcement and audit planning as contributing factors. Boeing removed the door panel to make repairs and did not reinstall the bolts, and the team had never opened that type of door panel. The FAA has stated it is taking the NTSB's safety recommendations seriously and will carefully evaluate them and continue aggressive oversight to ensure Boeing fixes its systemic production-quality issues; the agency has not lifted the 737 monthly production cap it has placed on Boeing until the FAA can confidently say Boeing can maintain the safety and quality of its aircraft. The incident has led to lawsuits against Boeing and Alaska Airlines, and the NTSB has issued new safety recommendations to the FAA and Boeing to prevent future accidents.</p>

          <p>Stock futures climbed as investors expressed optimism that Israel and Iran would adhere to a ceasefire announced by President Trump, despite initial reports of potential violations. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testified before Congress, acknowledging a steady labor market but highlighting economic uncertainties and the potential impact of tariffs on prices and economic activity. Oil prices decreased following initial spikes after the conflict began, with U.S. benchmark crude falling 3% to $66.49 per barrel and Brent crude also shedding 3% to $69.38. The central bank said last week it would maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5% and the next Fed meeting is scheduled for July 29-30. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A review on the use of thimerosal in vaccines, slated for presentation to the CDC's outside vaccine committee, cited a study that the listed author claims does not exist. Lyn Redwood, a former leader of the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense, authored the report and referenced a study co-authored by UC Davis professor emeritus Robert Berman, who stated that the report misrepresented his research. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently replaced all 17 members of the expert panel with eight new members, half of whom have advocated against vaccines, sparking further controversy. The CDC staff posted a separate report stating that evidence does not support a link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

The intelligence summary also revealed that Iranian officials had considered storing highly enriched uranium in public parking lots to prevent its destruction. The U.S. airstrikes targeted Iranian uranium enrichment and nuclear research sites, following a days-long Israeli air campaign. The impact of the strikes remains unclear, but Iran insists its uranium enrichment program is for peaceful purposes.</p>

          <p>Democratic socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani, endorsed by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, is gaining traction in the New York City mayoral race with a platform of free programs and services. Mamdani plans to fund these initiatives, including free public transit, universal childcare, and city-owned grocery stores, by raising taxes on corporations and the wealthiest 1% of New Yorkers. He also proposes increasing the city's budget to carry out his housing agenda and aims to strengthen New York City's sanctuary city apparatus.

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs chose not to testify in his sex trafficking trial, which is expected to conclude this week, after prosecutors rested their case following 28 days of testimony from 34 witnesses. Combs' lawyers presented a brief defense, suggesting that the alleged victims consented to the sexual activity, central to the prosecution's case that Combs used his wealth and influence to coerce women into sex and blackmail them into silence. The defense rested its case after asking the judge to issue an immediate acquittal, with closing statements scheduled for Thursday and deliberations potentially beginning on Friday.

          <p>Senate Republicans proposed a bill that would force the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to sell its newly acquired electric vehicle (EV) mail delivery trucks and cancel the contract for the remaining 58,800 vehicles, claiming it would cut costs and refocus the USPS on mail delivery. The bill aims to revoke $1 billion allocated in the Inflation Reduction Act for purchasing the EVs, but USPS officials argue that replacing the revoked vehicles would cost more than $450 million. The USPS has already spent over $540 million on electrical upgrades for infrastructure to support the EVs, and the specialized design of the vehicles makes their potential resale value negligible. The Senate parliamentarian found that disposing of the USPS EVs is one of several of the bill's provisions violating the Byrd Rule. </p>

          <p>The debate over lab-grown meat intensifies as it nears potential UK market entry, sparking discussions about environmental benefits, ethical considerations, and the role of technology in food production. While some advocate for lab-grown meat as a solution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and land use associated with traditional meat production, others question its environmental impact and the ultra-processed nature of the product. The UK's Food and Agriculture Organisation said that meat production has increased fivefold since the 1960s and reached around 364 million tonnes in 2023. Producing 1kg of beef can generate planet-heating greenhouse gases, equivalent to roughly 40kg of carbon dioxide, though estimates can vary depending on the type of production.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer reports that AI stocks are recovering as Wall Street's fears about Chinese startup DeepSeek's potential to dominate the AI sector recede. Investors had panicked earlier in the year when DeepSeek released an AI model that seemed to be as advanced as competitors while requiring far less money and energy to function. Many companies in the sector saw their stocks get crushed, but Cramer believes the recovery of many AI stocks shows that fears about DeepSeek's dominance are short-lived. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Daniel Park, a suspect charged in connection with the bombing outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, died in federal custody at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles. Park was found unresponsive, and his cause of death is currently unclear. He was apprehended in Poland earlier this month after being indicted for alleged malicious destruction of property and accused of shipping ammonium nitrate to the bomber, Guy Bartkus, who died in the blast outside the fertility clinic. The clinic was damaged, but staff said none of the embryos stored there were lost, and the practice reopened in a temporary location.</p>

          <p>A shift in how the public views sex scandals, multiple accusations diluting the impact, and partisan polarization are all factors in the rise of voter tolerance for scandal. Politicians have learned they can weather scandals rather than resign, and the #MeToo movement's impact has waned. Multiple scandals don't necessarily hurt candidates more, and voters are more willing to vote for a candidate they dislike if they believe they are more "electable." The New York Democratic mayoral primary is a prime example, with a candidate facing sexual harrasment allegations potentially winning.</p>

However, the rollout has been marked by chaotic events, including Israeli forces killing people near distribution centers, resignations over politicization, and reports of collaboration with the Israeli government. Critics also raised concerns that private contractors operating in Gaza in collaboration with the Israeli government risk “aiding and abetting or otherwise being complicit in crimes under international law, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide”.</p>

Gang injunctions are civil court orders that can bar a suspected gang member from wearing certain clothes or associating with other alleged members of the same gang set within neighborhoods that are considered gang territory. Spitzer said his office could seek new injunctions, under the revised definition of gang activity under California law, if the need arises.</p>
