          <p>Representative Jasmine Crockett of Texas stated she has no concerns regarding former President Joe Biden's mental acuity, attributing his verbal stumbles to a lifelong stutter rather than cognitive decline. Speaking after a closed-door interview with Biden's former physician, Crockett contrasted Biden's command of policy with what she characterized as former President Trump's lack of knowledge. Her comments come as a House Oversight Committee probe investigates allegations of a cover-up concerning Biden's health. Crockett emphasized that while Biden may fumble words, his understanding of complex issues like foreign policy remains sharp.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions defeated the Brumbies 36-24 in Canberra, but the performance raised questions ahead of the Test series against the Wallabies. While the Lions showcased moments of sharp, effective play, they also conceded four tries and struggled significantly at the breakdown, an ongoing issue throughout their tour. The match highlighted key selection dilemmas for coach Andy Farrell, particularly in the back row, as the team has yet to find a combination that can consistently dominate that area of the game. Despite the win, the mixed performance suggests the Lions must find greater consistency to challenge a full-strength Australian side.</p>

          <p>Germany's federal police commissioner has criticized the government's policy of turning back migrants at the border, citing the strain on police forces and its questionable legality under EU law. Meanwhile, Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government defended its draft budget and increased defense spending during a contentious parliamentary debate, facing accusations of breaking campaign promises. In separate news, German police arrested a man in connection with a suspected Islamist terror plot, and President Steinmeier honored the late Holocaust survivor Margot Friedländer. These events highlight ongoing national debates over immigration, fiscal policy, and security.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security announced it will issue administrative subpoenas to Harvard University to obtain information on its foreign students, intensifying a conflict over the school's visa program compliance. The administration accuses Harvard of allowing foreign students to abuse their visas and has also threatened the university's accreditation, citing alleged failures to address antisemitism on campus. Harvard maintains it is complying with the law and decries the administration's actions as unwarranted retaliation. This move is part of a broader pressure campaign by the Trump administration against the university since returning to office.</p>

          <p>According to a new report based on audio from a donor meeting, former President Donald Trump claimed he had threatened to "bomb the s--- out of Moscow" to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from invading Ukraine. In the same meeting, Trump allegedly said he made similar threats toward Chinese President Xi Jinping regarding a potential invasion of Taiwan. The comments, reportedly made in May 2024, highlight a stark contrast between his private rhetoric and public statements. A White House spokesperson responded by emphasizing that Russia did not invade Ukraine during Trump's first term, attributing this to his strong leadership.</p>

          <p>Amid record numbers of small boat crossings, this article explores the various "pull factors" attracting asylum seekers to the UK. While the French government suggests the UK's informal economy is a major draw, data indicates it is smaller than in France and other European nations. The UK has more restrictive policies on asylum seekers' legal right to work compared to countries like France and Italy. Research suggests that factors like English language proficiency, existing family ties, and the perception of the UK as a good place to live are more significant drivers than economic opportunities or welfare benefits.</p>

This year's exercises include new elements, such as urban resilience drills in supermarkets and responses to harassment from Chinese coast guard vessels. The expanded maneuvers reflect heightened tensions in the region and Taiwan's commitment to bolstering its defensive posture in the face of increasing pressure from Beijing.</p>

          <p>This personal essay explores the phenomenon of delayed or complicated grief among victims of the recent Los Angeles wildfires. The author, who lost her home, describes an initial period of numb, practical focus on survival, which has now given way to a profound sense of loss months after the immediate crisis has passed. Psychologists note that it is common for the full emotional impact of a tragedy to surface later, once the initial shock subsides and a new, difficult reality sets in. The article suggests coping strategies such as connecting with others who share the experience and allowing oneself to fully feel the pain of what was lost.</p>

An analysis comparing a $10,000 deposit in a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) versus a money market account reveals nuanced outcomes. While current money market account rates may yield slightly more interest over various terms, their variable nature poses a risk in a falling rate environment. In contrast, CDs offer a fixed, guaranteed return, which could prove more advantageous for savers seeking stability and predictable earnings over the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, a mother reflects on raising her seven-year-old daughter, Izzy, who has a rare chromosomal anomaly, and the vital role of the special education system. She argues that the Trump administration's efforts to cut funding for the Department of Education and Medicaid threaten the essential support structures that allow millions of students with disabilities to thrive. The author emphasizes that the work of caring for and educating children with disabilities is inherently slow and cannot be measured by efficiency. She describes the teachers and therapists as crucial not only for her daughter's development but also for her own education as a parent.</p>

          <p>Yemen's Houthi rebels have claimed they sank a Greek-operated vessel, the Eternity C, in a missile and unmanned drone attack in the Red Sea. The strike reportedly resulted in four deaths, with six crew members rescued and 15 still missing, marking one of the most serious Houthi assaults on the vital maritime trade route. The rebels stated the attack was in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, claiming the ship was headed for Israel. This incident represents a significant escalation after a period of relative calm and demonstrates the ongoing threat the group poses to international shipping and regional security.</p>

          <p>President Trump is meeting with the leaders of Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, and Senegal to focus on commercial opportunities and security cooperation. The summit reflects the administration's "trade, not aid" policy toward the continent, with discussions likely to cover critical minerals, maritime security, and migration. With a 10% U.S. tariff on their goods and uncertainty over the future of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), the visiting leaders may seek to negotiate more favorable trade terms. The meeting also highlights U.S. strategic interests in a region where rivals like China and Russia are increasing their influence.</p>

          <p>Russia has intensified its military offensive in Ukraine, making its largest territorial gains of the year by focusing on three primary fronts. The push aims to cut Ukrainian supply lines in the east and establish a buffer zone in the north, with concentrated attacks near Sumy, Pokrovsk, and Kostyantynivka. Despite seizing over 500 square kilometers last month, the advance remains slow and costly, with Ukrainian forces offering stiff resistance. Military observers believe Russia is employing a "creeping offensive" with small infantry groups to exhaust Kyiv's resources, but a major strategic breakthrough is not yet considered imminent.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump makes significant changes to the federal student loan system, which could make higher education more expensive and harder to access for many students. The legislation eliminates several repayment programs, including the Biden-era SAVE plan, and consolidates options into two main plans, potentially leading to higher monthly payments for lower-income borrowers. It also imposes new borrowing caps for graduate and professional degrees, which may not cover the full cost of programs like medical or law school, possibly forcing students to seek less favorable private loans.
