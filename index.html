          <p>A Bangladesh Air Force training aircraft crashed into a school campus in Dhaka, resulting in at least 19 fatalities and over 100 injuries. The Chinese-made F-7 BJI aircraft went down shortly after takeoff, causing a significant fire and damaging a building on the Milestone School and College campus. This incident marks the nation's deadliest aviation accident in over four decades, prompting the government to launch a full investigation into the cause. The interim leader has assured that victims' bodies will be identified and returned to their families.</p>

          <p>A Tennessee judge has ruled that a death-row inmate's implanted heart device must be deactivated before his execution to prevent it from delivering painful shocks. The inmate, Byron Black, has a cardioverter-defibrillator that could attempt to restart his heart during the lethal injection process, potentially causing extreme suffering. The state is required to have medical professionals on hand to disable the device moments before the procedure. Black's attorneys are also pursuing appeals based on his intellectual disabilities and multiple health issues, arguing he is not competent for execution.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called for a comprehensive examination of the Federal Reserve, questioning its overall effectiveness and mission success beyond recent controversies. His comments arise amidst escalating tensions between the White House and the central bank, particularly concerning interest rate policies and President Trump's criticism of Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Bessent suggested the Fed should consider easing rates due to moderating inflation, criticizing the institution's mindset and lack of adaptability. This call for review signals a significant push for potential reforms within the central banking system. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As many high-yield certificates of deposit (CDs) from the 2023-2024 rate surge reach maturity, financial experts are advising savers on common pitfalls to avoid. Key mistakes include allowing CDs to auto-renew at potentially lower rates and chasing the highest available interest rate without considering the term length and personal liquidity needs. Experts recommend that savers reevaluate their financial goals before reinvesting and avoid moving funds into low-yield regular savings accounts. Instead, they suggest shopping around for competitive rates and considering options like high-yield savings accounts for greater flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates Pakistan is lagging in its readiness to implement artificial intelligence in public services, ranking behind regional neighbors like India and Bangladesh. Despite drafting a national AI policy in 2021, experts argue it lacks comprehensive strategy and sufficient investment in education and workforce upskilling. This regulatory gap has fostered a rise in AI-generated "slop" content, which often consists of low-quality and deceptive material flooding social media. While some entrepreneurs have found economic opportunities using AI tools, there is a growing concern about the spread of misinformation and the need for stronger governance.</p>

          <p>The China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has set a new national record by discovering a significant uranium deposit at a depth of over 3,000 meters. The discovery was made in a sandstone-type deposit, which is typically larger and more cost-effective to mine compared to other sources. This breakthrough highlights advancements in China's resource exploration technology. The finding is critical for the country's nuclear power and weapons programs, as China currently relies heavily on uranium imports to meet its needs, having produced 1,700 tonnes while importing 13,000 tonnes last year.</p>

          <p>A new company, The Ether Machine, is set to begin trading on the Nasdaq with the goal of becoming the largest public vehicle for institutional investment in ether. Unlike simple proxy strategies, the company plans to actively generate yield by staking its ether holdings, a process that contributes to the Ethereum network's security and operations. The firm's chairman, Andrew Keys, argues this makes ether a more productive asset than bitcoin, as spot ETFs currently do not offer staking yields. The company launch comes as institutional interest in tokenization and ether grows, fueled by recent regulatory clarity.</p>

Experts advise turning chores into a collaborative social activity rather than using bribes or charts, which helps children feel like integral, capable members of the family unit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford has issued a recall for over 694,000 Bronco Sport and Escape vehicles due to a defect that could cause the fuel injector to crack. A cracked injector can leak fuel into the engine compartment, creating a significant risk of fire when exposed to hot engine components. The recall affects certain 2021-2024 Bronco Sport and 2020-2022 Escape models equipped with 1.5L engines. Ford has been investigating the issue since 2022 and has identified eight vehicles with cracked injectors that experienced underhood fires, though no related injuries have been reported.</p>

While national average rates for savings accounts and CDs remain low, online banks are offering significantly more competitive high-yield options, with some APYs exceeding 4%. Experts advise consumers to shop around, particularly with online institutions, and consider their financial goals and credit profile to secure the best possible rates. Meanwhile, the price of gold, often seen as a safe-haven asset, is also being closely watched by investors amid economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An unlicensed driver, Cain Byrne, has been sentenced to 11.5 years in prison for killing an 81-year-old pedestrian in a hit-and-run crash.

The court was shown footage of Byrne continuing to use the gas even after the fatal collision before fleeing the scene.

          <p>The European Union Commission has proposed a policy shift to condition development aid on African countries' cooperation with migration enforcement, including returns and border controls. This move has drawn sharp criticism from humanitarian organizations and African policy experts, who label it as coercive, neocolonial, and a distortion of development goals. Critics argue the policy ignores the root causes of migration, such as poverty and instability, some of which are exacerbated by European trade and foreign policies. They warn that using aid as a political weapon undermines trust and reduces sovereign nations to mere border guards.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that Taiwanese companies are bracing for the economic impact of potential U.S. tariffs, with at least a quarter pausing expansion plans and 5% already cutting staff. The report, conducted by two opposition-aligned think tanks, found that over half of Taiwanese firms with U.S. trade ties expect to be negatively affected. Under a hypothetical 10% tariff, nearly 60% of surveyed companies anticipated minor revenue changes or no significant impact. The findings highlight the growing uncertainty and proactive measures being taken by businesses in Taiwan in anticipation of new trade barriers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson has made a highly ambitious long-term price prediction for Ethereum, suggesting it could reach $1.5 million per coin over time. His reasoning is tied to the belief that global commerce will increasingly move onto blockchain rails, with Ethereum dominating the tokenization and stablecoin sectors. Jackson argues that while Bitcoin receives much of the attention, Ethereum is becoming the essential transaction layer of the crypto economy. He also offered a more immediate bull case of $15,000 for ETH in the current market cycle, contingent on regulatory approvals for staking in ETFs. (not investment advice)</p>

This validation comes at a critical time, as global health funding is dropping to a 15-year low, forcing organizations like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, to make difficult budget decisions.
