          <p>Birmingham City Council has secured a court order to prevent the obstruction of waste vehicles, as refuse workers continue their strike, leading to over 12,000 tonnes of uncollected waste. The council stated that the order was necessary to uphold public health duties, but Unite, representing the workers, argues that their picket lines are lawful and peaceful. The strike, now in its 11th week, centers on proposed pay cuts for bin lorry drivers, with Unite blaming government-appointed commissioners for the lack of progress in negotiations. The union insists that members cannot afford pay cuts of up to £8,000. Relevant context: Birmingham City Council is under financial oversight due to its effective bankruptcy, leading to government intervention in its operations.</p>

          <p>Kyiv was hit by a large Russian drone and missile attack, injuring at least 17 people and damaging buildings across the city. The attack occurred as a prisoner swap between Ukraine and Russia is underway, with 390 people already freed and up to 1000 expected to be released. Russia reportedly fired 14 Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles and 250 Shahed drones, with Ukraine's Air Force claiming to have shot down six missiles and 245 drones. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for stronger sanctions against Russia, while Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov indicated Russia would present a draft settlement agreement after the swap.</p>

The crackdown aims to address growing concerns over financial influencers who disrupt the market.

Critics, like Greenpeace's Martin Kaiser, argue this could lead to new fossil fuel dependencies.

Conservative estimates suggest that over 500,000 of these voters supported Dan, contributing substantially to his victory against a hard-right candidate. This outcome is crucial for maintaining Romania's pro-European stance, as the alternative would have strengthened the autocratic, pro-Russian, anti-EU camp in Europe.

A 29-year-old public sector worker said they prefer to focus on living well now rather than worrying about the future.</p>

A study found that 45% of Japanese workers are doing the bare minimum in their jobs, with employees in their 20s being the most likely to admit it. This shift is driven by a desire for more "me time" and a rejection of the sacrifices made by previous generations.
