          <p>Researchers in Germany have discovered 31 shipwrecks in Lake Constance since beginning a project in 2022. Among the findings are two large metal hulls believed to be from paddle steamers, one of which may be the SD Friedrichshafen II, destroyed in a WWII air raid. The project has also uncovered a remarkably preserved cargo sailing ship and other historical artifacts, which are being studied as "time capsules" of past craftsmanship and events. The exploration is set to continue until 2027, offering more potential insights into the region's maritime history.</p>

          <p>A new working paper from the U.S. Census Bureau reveals that a declining number of young adults are reaching traditional life milestones such as moving out, getting a job, marrying, and having children. The report compares data from 2005 and 2023, showing a significant drop in those achieving all four markers, attributing the trend to economic barriers and changing societal norms. Researchers note that economic stability and educational attainment are now often prioritized over family formation, reshaping the modern definition of adulthood.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can move forward with its plan to fire 1,500 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). In a split decision, the court found that a lower court did not have the jurisdiction to block the mass layoffs. This ruling is a significant development in the administration's efforts to reshape the consumer watchdog agency, though the decision will not take immediate effect to allow for a potential appeal.</p>

          <p>The cost of packing a school lunch is rising, with a new report from Deloitte showing the average price has increased to $6.15, up nearly 3% from last year. This increase is driven by general food inflation, with staples like milk and bananas seeing significant price hikes. Cafeteria lunches are also becoming more expensive, prompting the USDA to increase funding for school meal programs. To cope, many parents plan to switch to store brands and find other ways to cut household expenses.</p>

The book was discovered among the possessions of a deceased man by his child, who mailed it back with an explanatory letter. The sender speculated their grandmother had borrowed it before moving to Mexico for a job at the U.S. Embassy. Fortunately for the family, the library stopped charging late fees in 2021, waiving what would have been an almost $900 fine.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that children experiencing a mental health crisis frequently get stuck in hospital emergency departments for days while waiting for psychiatric care. The research, which analyzed Medicaid data, found that about one in ten such ER visits result in a child "boarding" for three days or more. This issue is attributed to a nationwide shortage of pediatric inpatient psychiatric beds and outpatient services, which can cause children's conditions to worsen in the stressful, non-therapeutic environment of an ER.</p>

The agency stated the task force will aim to improve the safety and oversight of vaccines for children, a decision lauded by vaccine skeptics but likely to be controversial among public health experts.</p>
