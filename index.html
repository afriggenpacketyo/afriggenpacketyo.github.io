          <p>Ken Dryden, the celebrated Hall of Fame goaltender who led the Montreal Canadiens to six Stanley Cup championships in the 1970s, has passed away at age 78 after a battle with cancer. Remembered for his iconic pose leaning on his stick, Dryden's brief but dominant NHL career was marked by numerous accolades, including five Vezina Trophies. Beyond hockey, he was a respected author, broadcaster, lawyer, and politician, serving as a Member of Parliament and a cabinet minister in Canada, leaving a profound legacy both on and off the ice.</p>

          <p>A large-scale immigration raid at a Hyundai construction site in Georgia resulted in the detention of 475 workers, primarily South Korean nationals, suspected of working in the U.S. illegally. The operation, described as the largest of its kind by Homeland Security Investigations, is part of an ongoing probe into unlawful employment practices. Hyundai stated that none of the detained individuals were its direct employees and emphasized its commitment to legal compliance for itself and its contractors. The raid has prompted a response from the South Korean government, which is seeking to ensure the rights of its citizens are protected.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has adjusted his promise to stop migrant boats within two weeks of taking power, clarifying the timeline depends on passing new legislation first. Speaking to the BBC, he stated the two-week goal would begin once his proposed Illegal Migration (Mass Deportation) Bill is enacted, which could take months. This bill would legally mandate the removal of illegal migrants and disapply international treaties like the Refugee Convention. The clarification follows his initial, more definitive pledge made at the party's conference, raising questions about the feasibility of his proposed immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Following Daniel Levy's sudden departure, Vinai Venkatesham, the former CEO of rival club Arsenal, is set to take the helm at Tottenham Hotspur. Venkatesham's tenure at Arsenal was marked by the key appointment of manager Mikel Arteta, a strong commitment to the women's team, and empathetic leadership through the COVID-19 pandemic. Known as an inclusive and understated leader, he is expected to rely on football experts for on-pitch decisions while leveraging his administrative and commercial acumen. His more collaborative style may signal a significant shift from Levy's notoriously tough negotiation tactics.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Kiko, a powerful Category 4 storm with 140 mph winds, is moving across the Pacific Ocean on a path toward Hawaii. While no coastal warnings are currently in effect, forecasters anticipate that swells from the hurricane will reach the islands by Sunday, creating life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents through midweek. In response to the potential threat, Hawaii's acting governor has declared a state of emergency. Residents and visitors are urged to prepare for possible impacts, including heavy rainfall and potential flooding, beginning early next week.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that the climate crisis is set to increase the frequency of lightning-sparked wildfires across the western United States for decades to come. A study using machine learning found that 98% of the region will face a higher risk due to more lightning, drier conditions, or a combination of both. These fires, often in remote areas, tend to grow larger and produce more smoke, worsening air quality and public health crises. Experts warn this trend will further strain already thin firefighting resources and could lead to catastrophic events, especially when combined with urban expansion into fire-prone areas.</p>

          <p>Following the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner over a tax controversy, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a significant cabinet reshuffle to reset his government's agenda. The turmoil provides an opening for Nigel Farage's Reform UK party, which argues that both major parties are fundamentally flawed. Key changes in Starmer's cabinet include promoting Shabana Mahmood to Home Secretary, a move seen by some as an effort to take a tougher stance on immigration. The reshuffle aims to project a sense of control and renewed focus, but critics within the party question if it addresses a deeper lack of clear political direction.</p>

While this has resolved the immediate drug shortage, the shutdown of U.S.-funded programs has created new challenges, as patients and laid-off clinic workers now struggle with food insecurity and unemployment without the holistic support the programs once provided.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a stern warning that Venezuelan military aircraft will be shot down if they endanger U.S. naval vessels, following reports of Venezuelan jets flying near a U.S. ship for the second time in two days. The tensions escalate after a recent U.S. strike killed 11 people on what officials called a drug-carrying vessel from Venezuela. Trump has intensified anti-drug trafficking operations in the region, while Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro denies the allegations and has accused the U.S. of seeking regime change through military threats.</p>

A Brighton & Hove City Council spokesperson confirmed that the offensive graffiti was removed and that the cost was covered by a local resident. A spokesperson for Ms. Rayner condemned the vandalism as unjustifiable harassment, and Sussex Police are treating the incident as criminal damage.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that sexual assault is a crime against democracy because it relies on systemic power imbalances that silence victims. The author contends that the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case exemplifies this, alleging a massive cover-up by powerful figures like House Speaker Mike Johnson and Attorney General Pam Bondi to protect Donald Trump. This effort to suppress the truth and protect abusers over their victims is presented as an attack on the core democratic principles of equality and justice, consistent with a broader right-wing agenda to diminish the rights of women and other groups.</p>

          <p>Recent rumors and social media speculation about President Donald Trump's death, sparked by a brief absence from his public schedule, reveal insights into the current political environment. The frenzy highlights a culture of misinformation, an intense desire among opponents for his removal, and the public's expectation of constant communication from a president who has cultivated an omnipresent media profile. Although the White House dismissed the rumors as "fake news," the episode underscores the public's focus on the 79-year-old president's health and the way online discourse can rapidly amplify unfounded theories.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its fight against drug trafficking by deploying advanced military hardware, including F-35 fighter jets to Puerto Rico, and conducting lethal strikes. This strategy follows the designation of some Venezuelan gangs as foreign terrorist organizations, providing greater legal justification for military force. A recent strike targeted a vessel in the Caribbean, killing 11 alleged gang members. Critics question this militarized approach, arguing it blurs the line between law enforcement and warfare and may prove ineffective, as similar strategies have failed in the past.</p>

          <p>New Trump administration policies are creating confusion and barriers for COVID-19 vaccinations, with even eligible seniors reporting being denied shots. The FDA has limited its formal approval of the fall vaccine to those 65 and older or with underlying health conditions, meaning many now require a prescription or must attest to their eligibility at pharmacies. This has led to frustration and difficulty for people trying to get vaccinated, including seniors who were turned away without a doctor's note.

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the removal of the White House Peace Vigil, a continuous anti-war demonstration that has been present in Lafayette Park since 1981. After a reporter from a conservative outlet described the vigil's tent as an "eyesore," Trump responded by saying, "Take it down, today, right now." The 44-year-old vigil, which calls for global disarmament, is one of the longest-running protests in the world. Its potential removal represents the end of a historic fixture of political expression directly opposite the president's residence.</p>
