            <p>China has retaliated against the U.S.'s increased tariffs by raising its own levies on U.S. goods to 125%, effective April 12th. The Chinese government stated that further tariff increases by the U.S. would be ignored, as the current rates have already eliminated the market for U.S. goods in China. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent criticized China's trade practices and Goldman Sachs lowered China's GDP forecast to 4% due to the trade tensions. China reiterated its commitment to defending its interests and upholding the multilateral trading system. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A grassroots movement in Slovakia, Not in Our Town (Niot), played a crucial role in ousting a neo-Nazi regional governor through public discussions, educational programs, and protests. The movement increased voter participation and facilitated dialogue among democratic groups. Niot continues to organize protests against the pro-Russia stance of Prime Minister Robert Fico, advocating for Slovakia's alignment with Europe. Despite threats, the movement remains committed to defending democracy and promoting tolerance.</p>

            <p>A new drug, capivasertib, is now available on the NHS in England for certain types of advanced breast cancer. Clinical trials showed that the drug can slow the progression of the disease and shrink tumors in a quarter of patients. The drug works by blocking the activity of a protein molecule that drives cancer growth. This new drug offers an additional treatment option for individuals whose cancer has progressed despite prior hormone therapy.</p>

            <p>The US-China trade war may undermine overseas demand for Chinese goods and impact corporate earnings, according to Morgan Stanley. Tariffs could lead Chinese companies to rely on reluctant domestic buyers. Earnings from members of the MSCI China Index met market expectations in the fourth quarter, but the tariff tensions create uncertainty for future earnings. The analysts see downward risk to their base case earnings growth outlook for 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Economists suggest that China is unlikely to aggressively devalue the yuan to offset the impact of U.S. tariffs due to concerns about financial market instability. A significant weakening of the yuan could trigger capital outflows, which policymakers want to avoid. Analysts expect the central bank to engineer an orderly and gradual depreciation. Devaluation is no longer considered an effective trade weapon and could invite a financial crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Fossilized genetic evidence reveals that the Denisovans, an ancient human relative, ventured far beyond Siberia, reaching the Taiwan Strait. The discovery of a male Denisovan jawbone marks the first direct proof of their presence in the region, challenging assumptions about their geographic limits. The fossil underscores the Denisovans' adaptability to diverse climates and strengthens the genetic link between them and modern Asian populations. The fossil challenges classical migration narratives and shows how these ancient cousins shaped humanity’s evolutionary story.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's trade policies raise fears that climate action could be a casualty of the trade war. Tariffs on China, the largest manufacturer of clean energy technologies, threaten green investment in the US. The US is expected to lag behind in developing clean power technologies due to limited access to cheap, clean energy tech. While global clean energy projects will continue, the US green retreat could negatively impact climate progress due to it being a huge emitter.</p>
