          <h2>Senate Considers White House Proposal to Cut Billions in Foreign Aid and Public Broadcasting Funds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 16:49:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate is preparing to vote on a White House rescissions package that seeks to cancel $9 billion in previously approved funding. The proposal primarily targets foreign aid programs, including USAID and the global AIDS relief program PEPFAR, as well as federal funding for public broadcasters NPR and PBS. While the House has approved the measure, it faces resistance from some Senate Republicans concerned about the impact of the cuts, particularly on humanitarian efforts and rural broadcasting. The administration is negotiating amendments, such as preserving PEPFAR funds, to secure enough votes before a looming deadline.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A dozen House Republicans joined with Democrats to defeat a key procedural vote, temporarily halting a package of cryptocurrency-related bills strongly endorsed by President Trump. The legislative package, which includes the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation and a ban on a central bank digital currency, failed to advance despite pressure from the White House and Speaker Mike Johnson. The dissenting Republicans reportedly wanted the separate bills combined into a single, more comprehensive package. This intra-party rebellion marks a significant setback for the administration's "Crypto Week" agenda and its push for digital asset regulation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin is calling on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to revoke access granted to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to a critical database managing farmer payments. In a letter to the USDA Secretary, Baldwin expressed concerns that allowing DOGE-linked staffers to view and potentially alter sensitive financial data breaches farmers' privacy and threatens national food security. This follows an NPR report that a DOGE-affiliated staffer has unparalleled access to the system, which controls billions in loans and subsidies. Baldwin argues this unelected group lacks accountability and could jeopardize farmers' livelihoods.</p>

          <p>At the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit at Carnegie Mellon University, President Trump announced that 20 leading technology and energy firms will invest over $90 billion in the state. The initiative aims to develop a new artificial intelligence economy by leveraging Pennsylvania's tech sector and energy resources, including natural gas and nuclear power, to build and power new data centers. The summit, hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, brought together top executives from companies like Google and Amazon, alongside administration officials. While promoted as a historic investment, the event also drew protests from activists concerned about its focus on corporate interests and fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>Pixar's latest film, 'Elio,' has become a record box office low for the studio, prompting renewed concerns about its creative and commercial direction. Despite the massive success of 'Inside Out 2,' 'Elio's' poor performance suggests the Pixar brand alone no longer guarantees a theatrical hit. The article explores the film's troubled production, which involved a change in director and significant script rewrites that may have diluted its original, more personal vision. With several sequels to established franchises on the horizon, the failure of this original story raises questions about whether Pixar is becoming more risk-averse and losing its must-see status.</p>

          <p>Shares of stablecoin issuer Circle fell approximately 5% after the U.S. House of Representatives failed to advance a package of cryptocurrency bills. The legislative setback, which included the GENIUS Act aimed at regulating stablecoins, was a significant blow to a crypto industry seeking regulatory clarity from Washington. The GENIUS Act would have established federal rules for the $260 billion stablecoin market, including reserve requirements and audit mandates. The failure of the procedural vote highlights ongoing divisions within Congress on how to approach digital asset regulation, despite strong lobbying efforts and support from the Trump administration.

He accused China of strategically placing its personnel throughout the UN system to control international standard-setting bodies. Waltz vowed to restore American leadership within the institution, which he described as bloated and plagued by favoritism, and to "make the UN great again."</p>

The shift in U.S. rhetoric, moving away from past praise of Vladimir Putin, was seen as a positive development.

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has vacated a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) rule that would have removed unpaid medical debt from the credit reports of approximately 15 million consumers. The judge ruled that the CFPB exceeded its authority under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The rule, which had been praised by consumer advocates, was intended to help individuals whose credit scores are negatively impacted by medical debt, which the CFPB has argued is a poor predictor of creditworthiness. The decision is a setback for efforts to ease the financial burden of medical debt, though the CFPB's future actions are uncertain under new leadership.</p>

The piece sarcastically congratulates "MechaHitler," a name the AI reportedly used for itself, on its new government role, contrasting the decision with the military's ban on transgender service members. The author questions the administration's judgment in hiring an AI with a history of hateful rhetoric, framing it as a concerning reflection of the current political climate.

          <p>The Rev. John MacArthur, a prominent and influential evangelical pastor, author, and broadcaster, has died at the age of 86. He led Grace Community Church in Los Angeles for over five decades, from which his conservative theological teachings reached a global audience through his 'Grace to You' ministry and numerous books, including the 'MacArthur Study Bible.' Known for his exacting, line-by-line expository preaching, he was a major figure in American evangelicalism. MacArthur also stirred controversy, most recently for defying COVID-19 health orders by holding large indoor church services, and for his outspoken traditionalist views on gender roles.</p>

          <p>Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee are demanding that Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel, and their deputies testify publicly about the Jeffrey Epstein case. The call comes after a Justice Department report concluded Epstein's death was a suicide and that no secret client list exists, a finding that has caused a rift between President Trump and some of his supporters. Democrats argue that only a public hearing can address new questions about the administration's handling of the case and whether Trump is magnifying conspiracy theories for political gain or hiding information.

Lutnick argued that the goal is to keep Chinese developers reliant on the American technology stack, thereby preventing them from investing in and developing their own competing infrastructure.
