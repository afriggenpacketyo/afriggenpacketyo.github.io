          <p>Iowa has become the first state to remove gender identity from its civil rights code, eliminating legal protections for transgender and nonbinary individuals in areas like employment and housing. The new law, which took effect Tuesday, also defines sex based on reproductive organs at birth and prevents changes to birth certificates. This legislative reversal has sparked protests and raised concerns among LGBTQ+ advocates about increased discrimination and vulnerability for the transgender community. The move aligns with a broader trend of restrictions on transgender rights being advanced in other Republican-led states.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is conducting a marathon voting session, known as a "vote-a-rama," on a comprehensive budget bill central to former President Donald Trump's agenda. The nearly 1,000-page legislation faces a precarious future due to divisions among Republicans over welfare program cuts and tax break extensions. The bill has drawn sharp criticism from figures like Elon Musk and is opposed by Democrats for its proposed cuts to health insurance for millions. If the bill passes the Senate, it must return to the House of Representatives for another vote, with a tight deadline of July 4.</p>

The bill, a cornerstone of his domestic agenda, also faces criticism from figures like Elon Musk over its potential impact on the national debt.

Beyond rugby, Itoje leads a "portfolio existence," including founding an art gallery focused on African art, running a charity for disadvantaged children, and holding a master's degree in business.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit a new, isolated immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" by the White House. The administration is highlighting the site's remote and inhospitable location, surrounded by swampland and alligators, as a deterrent to illegal immigration. The facility, which can hold 5,000 detainees, has drawn protests from environmental and immigrant activists over its potential ecosystem impact and what they call its cruel messaging.

Authorities discovered four decapitated bodies hanging from a highway bridge and another 16 victims with gunshot wounds inside a van. The extreme violence is attributed to an ongoing, bloody power struggle between two rival factions of the powerful Sinaloa Cartel, known as Los Chapitos and La Mayiza. The conflict, which erupted last year, has plunged the city into a state of constant fear, with daily violence becoming the new norm for its residents.</p>

In a series of posts, Musk condemned the bill for increasing government spending and threatened that supporters would "lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth." This reignites a feud between the billionaire and the former president, who responded by questioning the federal subsidies Musk's companies have received.

          <p>California is experiencing a severe start to its fire season, with over a dozen wildfires igniting in just 72 hours, primarily in Riverside and San Bernardino counties. The largest blaze, the Wolf fire near Banning, has grown to over 2,400 acres, forcing evacuations, while the Juniper fire in Perris has also prompted evacuation orders. Officials are warning that these events are a prelude to a challenging summer and fall, following an unusually dry winter. Crews are battling the fires across the state and are on high alert, with a red flag warning in effect for several Northern California counties.</p>

          <p>This article explores the complex question of how much money is needed for retirement, noting that the answer varies significantly based on individual lifestyle goals. It discusses the challenge for governments in setting pension policy, as targets that are too high can discourage saving, while those too low can lead to shortfalls. The piece examines different adequacy measures, such as the Living Pension benchmark for basic needs and the PLSA's tiered living standards. It concludes that while cash-based targets can be useful, they may not accurately reflect the needs of all earners, highlighting the difficulty in creating a one-size-fits-all retirement savings strategy.</p>

This action cuts off funding for prominent research institutions like the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Resolution Foundation.

While the event's official theme is not Taiwan, analysts believe its underlying message will be directed at the self-ruled island. The parade will likely feature new fifth-generation fighter jets, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and carrier-based aircraft, many of which were developed with a potential Taiwan conflict in mind.

          <p>China's onshore yuan is projected to continue its appreciation against the U.S. dollar, with Goldman Sachs forecasting it will surpass the 7 per dollar mark within six months. This strengthening trend is attributed to a more resilient Chinese economic outlook than previously anticipated, despite a divergence between strong exports and weaker domestic demand. Concurrently, growing investor concerns about the sustainability of U.S. government debt and expectations of dollar depreciation are also contributing to the yuan's gains. The People's Bank of China has recently set its daily reference rate at its strongest level since November. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Turkish authorities have arrested four employees of the satirical magazine LeMan for publishing a cartoon that officials claim depicts the Prophet Muhammad. The editor-in-chief, cartoonist, and other staff were detained after the interior minister condemned the drawing as "shameless." LeMan magazine has denied the accusation, stating the cartoon does not refer to the Prophet and was misinterpreted, apologizing only to readers who felt hurt. The incident has sparked protests and drawn comparisons to the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack, raising serious concerns about freedom of expression in Turkey.</p>

          <p>Panelists at CNBC's East Tech West conference emphasized the importance for emerging economies to develop "sovereign AI"â€”the ability to control their own AI technologies and data. They argued that current prominent AI models are predominantly English-based, failing to capture linguistic and cultural nuances. To counter this, experts suggest that nations, particularly in regions like Southeast Asia, should leverage open-source AI models and cloud computing services. This approach would democratize access to AI, foster local talent, and allow countries to build systems tailored to their specific languages, cultures, and strategic priorities.</p>

          <p>China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers unexpectedly returned to growth in June, according to the private Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI. The index registered 50.4, surpassing expectations and rebounding from a contraction in May, indicating improving market conditions supported by a rise in production. This result diverges from the official government PMI, which showed a third consecutive month of contraction, a difference attributed to survey timing and company coverage. Despite the positive production figures, new export orders declined and employment in the sector remained weak amid cautious hiring.</p>

They are among 600,000 people in the state who could lose access to healthcare if the federal funding is reduced.

          <p>The UK's Labour government is facing a significant internal rebellion over its proposed changes to the welfare system, particularly the tightening of eligibility for the Personal Independence Payment (Pip). Despite holding a large majority, the government is engaged in a major persuasion effort to win over dozens of its own MPs who are concerned about the impact on disabled people. Critics within the party argue that a planned review of the benefit will conclude too late to influence the new criteria. The leadership maintains that the changes are necessary to control the spiraling benefits bill and ensure the long-term stability of the welfare state.</p>

          <p>A detention officer in Cherokee County, North Carolina, was fatally shot after an inmate he was escorting for a medical appointment managed to seize his weapon during a scuffle. The officer was identified as 56-year-old Francisco Flattes. The suspect, a 48-year-old federal inmate facing bank robbery charges, then allegedly stole a vehicle to escape but was later apprehended. The local sheriff described the incident as one of the worst days of his career, and the inmate is now expected to face a first-degree murder charge for the officer's death.</p>
