          <p>Thames Water has been hit with a Â£122.7 million fine, the largest ever issued by Ofwat, for violations related to sewage operations and shareholder payouts. The penalty includes Â£104.5 million for sewage breaches and Â£18.2 million for undeserved dividends, marking the first time Ofwat has fined a water company for this reason. The company, serving a quarter of the UK's population, is under scrutiny for sewage discharges and faces a Â£20 billion debt, though it recently secured Â£3 billion in emergency funding to avoid collapse. The fines will be paid by the company and its investors, not customers, as Thames Water addresses criticism and environmental responsibilities.</p>

          <p>Tesco has introduced AI-powered cameras at some self-checkouts to combat shoplifting, which has seen a record increase in the UK. The cameras identify unscanned items and display a replay for customers, prompting mixed reactions, with some mocking the technology's resemblance to VAR in football and others expressing privacy concerns. The move follows a similar implementation by Sainsbury's, as retailers grapple with rising theft, costing them billions annually. A Tesco worker expressed relief at the new tech, citing the difficulty of monitoring multiple self-checkouts alone.</p>

          <p>The State Department has paused scheduling new interviews for student and exchange visas as it expands its review of applicants' social media activity. Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued the order to embassies and consulates, stating that the department uses all available information in visa screening. This decision comes as President Trump pressures universities to restrict anti-Israel speech and follows Rubio's recent actions to revoke visas and scrutinize the social media of foreign visitors. Critics argue that the administration is suppressing free speech and promoting ideological conformity, with the pause potentially impacting many universities that rely on international students for tuition revenue and research contributions.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of energy customers are set to receive payouts, potentially up to Â£1,000 each, and could have debts written off following a scandal involving forced prepayment meter installations. Energy companies are allocating over Â£70 million in compensation and support after Ofgem's review found suppliers switched vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without consent. Payments range from Â£40 to Â£1,000, depending on the circumstances, with additional debt write-offs for those affected. A new code of practice is now in place with stricter conditions for installing prepayment meters without customer consent, as investigations continue for British Gas, Utilita, and Ovo.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Concerns are growing in the global financial markets as Japan's bond market sees long-dated yields hovering near record highs, potentially triggering capital flight from the U.S. and an unwinding of carry trades. Higher yields on Japanese government bonds could incentivize Japanese investors to repatriate funds, impacting U.S. tech stocks and global markets due to increased borrowing costs. While some analysts predict a gradual decline in the carry trade, others warn of a more severe unwinding than seen last year, with a strengthening yen posing challenges for Japan's economy. Despite these concerns, some analysts believe Japan's large holdings of U.S. Treasuries are anchored in a broader strategic alliance and see little risk of divestment. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the loss, the flight marked progress in fixing issues from previous tests, though several planned tests, including Starlink satellite deployment, were not completed.

          <h2>Japan to Distribute Reserve Rice to Rural Areas Amid Price Surge</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has pledged to supply lower-priced stockpiled rice to consumers in rural areas in response to soaring rice prices. This move comes after the government suspended orders from major retailers to allocate rice to smaller shops, ensuring wider access to affordable rice. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi indicated the government would impose purchase limits for big retailers, with transport costs to be covered by the government. The government aims to ease the financial strain on households caused by retail rice prices doubling in the past year, hoping to stabilize supply and lower costs for consumers.</p>

          <p>David McBride, an Australian whistleblower who leaked classified documents exposing alleged Australian war crimes in Afghanistan, has lost his appeal to reduce his prison term. The Australian Capital Territory Court of Appeal rejected McBride's appeal to reduce his five-year and eight-month sentence, prompting his legal team to announce plans to challenge the decision in the High Court. McBride's lawyers argued that he leaked the documents in the public interest, fulfilling his duty to act in accordance with his conscience and oath to the Australian people. Rights groups have criticized the prosecution, noting that McBride remains the only person imprisoned over the alleged war crimes.</p>

          <p>Senior police and security leaders, including the head of the Met Police and an MI5 boss, have voiced concerns about the government's plans to release some prisoners early. In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, they stated that the proposals "could be of net detriment to public safety," raising concerns about electronic tagging costs and repeat offenders avoiding jail. The letter argues against early releases for high-risk offenders and those jailed under national security legislation, while the government maintains that its proposals address many of these concerns. The government argues that the sentencing changes still allow for short sentences for repeat offenders, and terrorists will not be eligible for earlier release.</p>

The new alloy turbine blade is designed to withstand temperatures up to 15% higher than existing versions, leading to greater engine thrust, improved fuel efficiency, and longer service life. Developed by the Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials under Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC), this innovation reinforces China's position in high-performance propulsion technologies. The high-temperature alloy turbine blades are a critical component in modern jet engines, directly influencing thrust output, fuel efficiency, and reliability.</p>

Despite curbing investments, some European businesses are increasing their reliance on Chinese components due to lower prices, creating a contradictory trend that could complicate efforts to shield manufacturing from Chinese exports.

          <p>SpaceX's Starship rocket successfully reached orbit during its ninth test flight, but experienced a propellant leak that led to a loss of attitude control and an uncontrolled re-entry, ultimately resulting in a "rapid unscheduled disassembly." The company said it lost contact with the upper stage of Starship as it spun out of control and disintegrated over the Indian Ocean, but the Super Heavy booster appears to have exploded while splashing down in the Gulf. This flight demonstrated that the vehicle could reach orbit, but an apparent propellant leak after the craft entered its suborbital trajectory caused a loss of attitude control, leaving the spacecraft spinning and mission control unable to control the craft.</p>
