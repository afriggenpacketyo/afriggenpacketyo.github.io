          <p>Parents in the West Midlands are demanding answers after a teaching assistant, Daniel Clarke, was jailed for abusing six vulnerable young people, with detectives believing he may have targeted over 81 children over a decade. Concerns were allegedly raised by staff and parents at Forest Oak school months before Clarke's arrest, but the local authority has refused to reveal when these concerns were first raised. Saj Golby, who runs the North Solihull Additional Needs Support Group, stated that families are angry and hurt, feeling their concerns were ignored, leading to calls for accountability and an investigation into systemic failures. Clarke is serving a seven-and-a-half-year prison sentence, which is under review for being too lenient, and faces potential further charges, with the investigation expected to continue for at least a year. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has ordered the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to ongoing immigration protests and clashes between demonstrators and federal agents. The White House cited "violent mobs" attacking ICE officers as justification for the deployment, while Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the move as "purposefully inflammatory" and requested the troops be returned to his command. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass expressed concern that the deployment is a "chaotic escalation" that puts neighborhoods at risk.

          <p>During Indira Gandhi's Emergency in the mid-1970s, India explored shifting from a parliamentary democracy to a presidential system, according to historian Srinath Raghavan. Inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France, Gandhi's aides proposed a strong presidency to bypass parliamentary constraints and an "obstructionist" judiciary. While the shift never fully materialized, the Forty-second Amendment Act in 1976 expanded Parliament's powers and limited judicial review, reflecting a move towards a powerful executive. After Gandhi's defeat in 1977, subsequent amendments reversed some of these changes, but the idea resurfaced in 1982, highlighting the ongoing debate about India's governance structure.</p>

Rogoff has warned of a crisis of legitimacy for the US dollar, while Yu advocates for a free-floating yuan and reduced holdings of US Treasuries by China. Yu suggests that foreign investors' demand for US assets will decline, making it harder for the US to sustain its balance of payments and maintain a strong dollar. The economists' perspectives offer insights into the evolving global financial landscape and the potential challenges to the US dollar's dominance. (not investment advice)</p>
