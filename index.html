          <p>The government is considering introducing stricter online safety measures to limit the amount of time children spend on social media, including a potential two-hour cap on individual app usage and a 10 PM curfew. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle cited concerns about the addictive nature of some apps and smartphones, noting the need to define a healthy online life for children and remove barriers to achieving it. Online safety campaigner Ian Russell, whose daughter took her own life after seeing harmful content online, criticized the government's delays in enacting tougher online safety laws, emphasizing the need for legislation that prioritizes safety over engagement.</p>

          <p>Pomona College is seeing a growing movement among students and faculty to reduce the pervasiveness of technology on campus, with initiatives like tech-free classes, a Luddite Club, and students opting for flip phones. This pushback is driven by concerns that ubiquitous technology detracts from the close-knit community and learning environment that small residential liberal-arts colleges aim to foster. While acknowledging the need for technological literacy, proponents argue that limiting technology can enhance critical thinking and in-person interactions, differentiating Pomona from other institutions that emphasize tech access. The article explores the challenges and potential benefits of creating tech-free spaces within a modern college setting.</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll reveals that the Trump administration's deportation program has net positive approval, driven by strong Republican support, but opinions are divided based on the perceived targets of deportation. The program receives strong support when seen as prioritizing dangerous criminals, but approval drops significantly if it's perceived as targeting a broader population. Concerns about due process and the potential economic impact of the program also influence public opinion, with more Americans believing it will weaken the economy. Support for new tariffs remains net negative, with most believing they will lead to higher prices, though some appreciate Trump's stated goals of helping U.S. manufacturing.

It examines the romanticized origin stories of tech entrepreneurs like Adam Neumann and Mark Zuckerberg, as well as the sympathetic portrayal of flawed geniuses in films like "The Social Network" and biopics like "Steve Jobs." The author contends that this narrative impulse extends to American history, with the deification of the Founding Fathers hindering further progress and perpetuating harmful power structures.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom denounced as "deranged" the possibility of deploying US marines in his state, following a threat from the secretary of defense amid protests against immigration raids. The protests erupted after law enforcement officials used tear gas on demonstrators, leading Trump to promise deployment of the National Guard. Newsom confirmed the federal government was moving to take over the state's National Guard, calling the mobilization purposefully inflammatory and warning against giving the government a spectacle.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that under Trump, the US threat of a "peaceful evolution" aimed at subverting the Communist Party in China has receded. The author, reflecting on their upbringing during Mao Zedong's era, notes that the US has shifted away from nation-building efforts and lecturing on governance. This shift, coupled with China's rise as a global power, has diminished the perceived dangers of American conspiracies aimed at overthrowing the Communist Party through peaceful means.</p>

          <p>The poem, "Under a Supermoon," explores themes of perseverance, appreciation for the minute details of life, and the acceptance of life's exploding and birthing stars. The speaker contrasts a lack of desire for space exploration or deep-sea diving with a recognition of someone always driving farther and faster on the highway. The speaker slows down and rejoices in the small things, recalling Blake's wisdom that a fool who persists in their folly becomes wise, suggesting a journey of endurance and finding meaning in the present moment.</p>
