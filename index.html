          <p>Rising volcanic activity is causing concern in the area around Naples, Italy, a region home to half a million people living within a volcanic "red zone." The Campi Flegrei, a massive volcanic caldera west of Mount Vesuvius, has experienced thousands of earthquakes recently, prompting close monitoring by scientists. This report explores the lives of residents in this high-risk area and details the efforts of geophysicists from Italy's National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology who are tracking the escalating seismic events. The situation highlights the precarious balance between daily life and the constant threat of a major natural disaster.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly close to securing a loan move to FC Barcelona, with an agreement in principle said to be in place. The transfer, which includes an option to buy, would fulfill Rashford's stated preference for the Spanish club following a challenging period at United where he was training separately from the first team. For Manchester United, the move would provide significant salary relief, aiding their efforts to fund new signings under coach Ruben Amorim. Barcelona's sporting director has previously expressed admiration for the 27-year-old English player, who has been with his hometown club since 2016.</p>

          <p>A brief, awkward on-camera interaction between Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark and her boyfriend, Connor McCaffery, during the WNBA All-Star weekend has generated significant discussion and mockery online. Video footage captured McCaffery leaning in for a kiss as Clark turned away, resulting in a fleeting peck on her hair before she walked off. This incident follows previous social media attention where McCaffery, a Butler University basketball coach, was humorously identified on a broadcast in relation to his famous girlfriend. The couple, who met at the University of Iowa, have been dating since April 2023, and their public moments continue to attract widespread fan commentary.</p>

          <p>An early morning incident in East Hollywood left 30 people injured, seven critically, after a driver intentionally rammed his car into a crowd outside a nightclub. According to the Los Angeles Police Department, the driver made a U-turn before accelerating into people waiting to enter the Vermont Hollywood venue, also hitting a taco truck and valet stand. Following the crash, bystanders reportedly pulled the driver from the vehicle and assaulted him, during which he was shot by an unknown assailant who then fled the scene. The driver was hospitalized for surgery, and police are investigating the crash as an assault with a deadly weapon.</p>

Sheriff Robert Luna described the event as the department's largest single loss of life since 1857 and confirmed there is no ongoing threat to the public. While the official cause is under investigation, sources suggest an explosive device, believed to be inert after being recovered from a callout the previous day, unexpectedly detonated.

          <p>After days of criticizing the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, prominent MAGA figures have rallied behind the president following a Wall Street Journal story alleging a 2003 letter from Trump to Epstein. Trump has denied writing the letter and filed a defamation lawsuit, a move that shifted his base's focus from internal dissent to a familiar media adversary. This unification was further bolstered by Trump's subsequent call to release Epstein-related grand jury testimony, which was praised by supporters who had previously demanded more transparency. The episode demonstrates a significant, if potentially temporary, consolidation of support within the MAGA movement around the president.</p>

          <p>The defense team for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of murdering United HealthCare CEO Brian Thompson, has filed a motion claiming prosecutors illegally obtained his confidential medical records. His attorneys allege the Manhattan District Attorney's office used a fraudulent subpoena to compel Aetna to release information protected by HIPAA and doctor-patient privilege. The DA's office sources contend they requested limited information and that Aetna sent the additional protected materials in error, which they then deleted. Mangione's lawyers are requesting an evidentiary hearing and have suggested that sanctions, potentially including dismissal of the charges, should be considered for the alleged misconduct.</p>

Public Works Minister Dean Macpherson stated the collapse resulted from multiple failures, including the use of substandard materials and ignoring structural cracks that were detected a year prior. According to the report, workers had reported feeling vibrations and were told to cover up defects, and a health and safety officer had resigned in protest before the incident. The minister has called for criminal accountability for the negligence while a police investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>A pregnant stay-at-home mom called into "The Ramsey Show" stating her family couldn't afford groceries despite her husband's $156,000 annual income, attributing the shortfall to his spending on tobacco and marijuana. The caller noted his spending on these vices reached $700 last month and that she feared paying off a car loan would only free up more money for his habits. Host Dave Ramsey questioned the narrative, pointing out that while the spending was significant, it shouldn't prevent them from buying food on their income. He and co-host Jade Warshaw pressed the caller to address the core issue of potential addiction and financial control rather than just the budget.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a left knee bone bruise more quickly than initially expected, providing a potential boost for the team's struggling offense. Muncy, who was injured in a slide on July 2, has already resumed running, agility drills, and taking swings without significant discomfort. Manager Dave Roberts expressed optimism that Muncy will return "a lot sooner than anticipated" from the injury, which was originally projected to sideline him for six weeks. Muncy's absence has been keenly felt, as the Dodgers' offensive production has dropped significantly since the slugger was placed on the injured list.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has reportedly revoked the American visas of eight of Brazil's eleven supreme court justices, escalating a campaign to support former president Jair Bolsonaro. The move, announced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, targets judges involved in the case against Bolsonaro, who faces trial for an alleged coup attempt. Brazilian President Lula da Silva condemned the action as unacceptable interference in his country's justice system and an affront to its sovereignty. The sanctions follow a U.S. threat of 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, a move that has generated a nationalist backlash in Brazil and appears to have backfired on Bolsonaro's supporters.</p>

A Neuralink spokesperson stated the box on the form was checked erroneously and has been corrected, and that the company has never applied for or received any federal benefits.

          <p>An attempt by President Donald Trump to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell would likely trigger a significant legal battle and create major uncertainty for the economy and financial markets. Legal experts note that removing a Fed chair requires proving "cause," a high legal bar that would almost certainly be litigated up to the Supreme Court. The unprecedented move could undermine the central bank's independence, which is crucial for controlling inflation and maintaining market stability. Such an action could lead to higher long-term interest rates and damage the Fed's reputation, regardless of the legal outcome or its immediate effect on monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

Instead, Galloway suggests that individuals should focus on finding something they are good at that also has the potential to be financially lucrative. His own journey involved abandoning a passion for athletics to pursue business, ultimately leading to his success.

The article notes the prevalence of tans among the MAGA youth and political figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who align with an alternative-health movement skeptical of mainstream guidance on sun avoidance. This new sun worship often involves questioning the dangers of UV exposure and the benefits of sunscreen, framing sun exposure as a natural good suppressed by the establishment. This defiance of scientific consensus mirrors a broader mistrust of institutions, making the modern tan a symbol of both health and rebellion.</p>
