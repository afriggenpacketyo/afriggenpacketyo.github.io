            <p>Congress is again considering whether to make Daylight Saving Time permanent, with arguments focusing on maximizing sunlight and reducing the inconvenience of switching clocks twice a year. While some advocate for the economic benefits of evening recreation, health experts warn that permanent Daylight Saving Time could lead to chronic diseases due to later sunrises and sunsets. The debate highlights the tension between economic interests and health considerations, with lawmakers struggling to find a solution that satisfies everyone. Past attempts to make Daylight Saving Time permanent have failed due to unpopularity and health concerns.</p>

            <p>Harvey Weinstein is facing a retrial in Manhattan on charges of criminal sex act and third-degree rape, after his initial conviction was overturned due to judicial errors. The retrial involves allegations from two women from the original trial, as well as a new allegation from a woman who wasn't involved in the first case. This legal redo occurs in a changed social climate, with the #MeToo movement having evolved since Weinstein's first trial. The outcome of this retrial will be closely watched as a reflection of the justice system's handling of sexual assault cases in the post-#MeToo era.</p>

            <p>Harvard University has rejected a series of demands from the Trump administration, including screening foreign applicants and allowing external audits for viewpoint diversity, potentially jeopardizing billions in federal funding. The university argues that the demands infringe on its independence and constitutional rights, setting a precedent against federal overreach in private education.

            <p>President Trump condemned the arson attack on Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's residence, but his response is being viewed skeptically due to his past rhetoric and actions that have been perceived as encouraging political violence.

The incident underscores the growing concern about political violence in the United States and the role of political leaders in either mitigating or exacerbating it.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has initiated investigations into pharmaceutical and semiconductor imports, signaling a potential imposition of tariffs on these sectors based on national security concerns. These inquiries, conducted under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, could lead to tariffs aimed at reducing reliance on foreign suppliers. Drugmakers have expressed concerns about potential shortages and reduced patient access due to tariffs, while the administration argues for increased domestic manufacturing of essential goods. The investigations reflect the administration's broader trade policies focused on bolstering domestic industries and reducing dependence on foreign supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's decision to pause reciprocal tariffs for most countries, while raising levies on China, highlights shifting power dynamics within the White House. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent played a key role in swaying Trump, reportedly due to his experience in the bond market and ability to gain the president's ear over trade hawks Howard Lutnick and Pete Navarro. This shift suggests a nuanced approach to trade policy, balancing the administration's protectionist agenda with concerns about market stability and economic impact. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>American technology companies face uncertainty regarding exemptions from President Trump's trade war with China. The White House vacillated over providing assistance to U.S. companies, leading to market turbulence and confusion within the industry. While some technology products were initially exempted from tariff hikes, the administration hinted at future tariffs through a different mechanism. This uncertainty makes it difficult for tech companies to plan product launches and manufacturing strategies, and it has raised concerns about price increases for popular American products.

            <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for allegedly misrepresenting a Supreme Court decision regarding the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. Despite a unanimous Supreme Court order to "facilitate" his release, administration officials have claimed the US lacks the power to return Abrego Garcia. Critics argue that the administration is manufacturing uncertainty to avoid complying with court orders, particularly given the US's financial support for El Salvador's prison system where Abrego Garcia is detained.</p>

The White House has suggested that it will now cut off funding for Harvard because of the university's refusal to comply with the demands.</p>
