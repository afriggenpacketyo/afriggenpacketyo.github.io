          <p>A judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's plan to prevent Harvard University from enrolling foreign students, responding to Harvard's lawsuit which claimed the move was retaliatory and unlawful. Harvard argued that the revocation of its access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program would erase a quarter of its student body and undermine its mission. The White House responded that Harvard should focus on creating a safe campus environment instead of filing lawsuits, referencing concerns about anti-American and anti-Semitic agitators. Harvard relies heavily on international student tuition, and the ruling pauses a move that could have forced thousands of students to return home.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple products made outside the United States if the company does not shift some of its iPhone production to the U.S. In a Truth Social post, Trump also suggested a 50% tariff on the European Union. Apple's supplier, Foxconn, recently announced plans to invest $1.5 billion in its Indian operations, signaling a shift away from China. Analysts believe that producing iPhones in the U.S. is not feasible due to higher manufacturing costs, estimating that it could raise the cost of high-end models to $3,500 each. Apple shares fell in early trading following the tariff threat.</p>

          <p>Wage garnishment by the IRS can be a stressful financial consequence for unpaid tax debt. Tax relief strategies, such as installment agreements, Offers in Compromise, Currently Not Collectible status, and innocent spouse relief, can potentially stop wage garnishment. Immediate action is crucial, including verifying the debt and contacting the IRS or a tax relief specialist to negotiate a resolution. The IRS typically wants to help taxpayers who are proactive and cooperative find a solution, especially those who show a genuine intent to pay. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The House Republican tax bill, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," does not include an extension of the premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which are set to expire at the end of the year.

For example, a family of four making $85,000 would have to pay an additional $313 in premiums for coverage in 2026.

          <p>House Republicans' campaign arm is launching an advertising campaign targeting Democrats from politically risky districts who voted against the GOP's effort to cut taxes and pass Medicaid work requirements. The campaign will focus on the tax portion of the Trump agenda bill, arguing that Democrats voted "for the largest U.S. tax hike in generations." Democrats view the House as their best chance at quickly winning back power in Washington, given the perils an incumbent president's party routinely faces in a midterm election. It remains to be seen what kind of bill can eventually make it to Mr. Trump's desk, given the changes the GOP-led Senate may make once it gets its hands on the legislation.</p>

          <p>International students at Harvard University expressed fear and confusion after the Trump administration announced it would bar them from attending the university. The decision has thrown the futures of thousands of students and an integral part of the university's identity into uncertainty. Students worried about their visas being invalidated and the possibility of having to transfer to other universities. The university has faced rapid-fire aggressions since its president refused to comply with demands to change hiring, admissions, and curriculum practices.</p>

          <p>Steven Pinker, a Harvard professor, argues that the intense criticism aimed at Harvard has become unhinged, labeling it "Harvard Derangement Syndrome." He acknowledges Harvard's ailments, including the erosion of academic freedom and viewpoint diversity, but contends that the institution is not a "woke madrasa." Pinker calls for a balanced approach, diagnosing specific issues and applying appropriate remedies rather than resorting to punitive measures that could cripple the university's ability to discover and transmit knowledge.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that contrast-enhanced mammography, which uses iodine-based dye, can detect three times as many invasive cancers in dense breast tissue as ultrasound. The study also found that contrast-enhanced mammography can detect tumors that are much smaller than those found by regular mammography. While M.R.I.s are better at detecting more tumors, they are considerably more expensive. The scans were given to women with dense breast tissue who had already undergone mammograms that hadn’t turned up any abnormalities.</p>

Andrew Kenningham from Capital Economics believes economic pressures will prevent Trump from pushing Brussels too far.

          <p>A tax and policy bill passed by House Republicans would deal a serious blow to electric vehicles by repealing many of the subsidies that have been critical to the growth of the technology. The measure would gut subsidies for battery manufacturing, incentives for purchases of electric vehicles by individuals and businesses, and money for charging stations that Congress passed during the Biden administration. It would also impose a new annual fee on owners of electric cars and trucks. Republican leaders have said the subsidies they want to repeal were ill conceived and largely benefited affluent car buyers.</p>

          <p>A sprawling legislative package passed by House Republicans would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans, while low-income households would be worse off, according to experts. The bill, called the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," includes tax cuts for business owners, investors, and homeowners in high-tax areas. Reductions to social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP would offset these tax cuts, negatively impacting low earners. The Congressional Budget Office estimates income for the bottom tenth of households would fall by 2% in 2027 and by 4% in 2033 as a result of the bill's changes.</p>
