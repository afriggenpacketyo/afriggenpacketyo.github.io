          <p>China is intensifying its efforts to bolster its domestic market to reduce its vulnerability to external economic shocks, particularly those stemming from trade tensions with the United States. Premier Li Qiang emphasized the importance of strengthening "domestic circulation" to enhance the country's economic self-reliance and create a unified internal market. This strategy aims to leverage China's internal stability and long-term growth potential to counteract global uncertainties. Analysts suggest that the focus on domestic demand reflects a realization that China can no longer depend primarily on exports for economic growth, given the increasing trend of deglobalization.</p>

          <p>Richemont, the owner of Cartier, reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter sales, indicating that affluent consumers are continuing to spend despite global economic uncertainties. The Swiss luxury group's revenue increased by 7% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in its Jewellery Maisons division, which includes Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. While the specialist watchmakers segment experienced a sales decline, overall annual sales rose by 4%, slightly ahead of analyst expectations. Richemont's chairman noted that ongoing global uncertainties would require continued agility and discipline, while BofA Global Research highlighted potential headwinds such as gold prices and currency fluctuations, but noted that the company's pricing power could offset some of these challenges.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament is revisiting the assisted dying bill, considering significant revisions after its initial passage in the Commons last November. The bill, which would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults in England and Wales, has undergone intense scrutiny and numerous amendments, including the removal of the requirement for High Court judge approval. Recent government changes to its impact assessment have sparked criticism, with some MPs describing the process as "chaotic." Despite the controversy, supporters of the bill argue that it is coming back to the Commons "even stronger" and represents a crucial opportunity to address the needs of dying individuals and their families.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Patrick McGee's "Apple in China" argues that Apple's extensive manufacturing operations in China have created a significant vulnerability for the world. The article highlights how Apple's decision to manufacture approximately 90% of its products in China has fostered conditions that allow Chinese technology to potentially surpass American innovation. Apple has trained over 28 million workers in China since 2008, an investment that exceeds the Biden administration's efforts to boost American computer chip production. McGee suggests this rapid consolidation of technology and know-how in China represents a geopolitical event, akin to the fall of the Berlin Wall, with troubling consequences for global power dynamics.</p>

Robinson's attorney denies the allegations, claiming the accusers filed the police report to publicize their case. The accusers allege repeated incidents of sexual assault, with one woman claiming Robinson forced her to have sex with him multiple times after showering. </p>

Uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariff policies is casting a shadow over the global economy, further impacting Japan's economic outlook.

          <p>An extensive genetic analysis has traced the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas, shedding light on the prehistoric human expansion that shaped the genetic landscape of the Western Hemisphere. The study indicates that Native Americans are descendants of Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region. Early migrants to South America formed distinct groups that remained isolated due to environmental conditions. This research, led by the GenomeAsia 100K consortium, could provide new insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations, who have faced significant population declines.</p>

She also took legal action against an AI image-generating app for using her voice and likeness in an ad.

          <p>New economic data reveals that Japan's economy contracted more than expected in the first quarter of 2025, primarily due to stagnant consumption and falling exports. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contracted by 0.2% compared to the previous quarter, and by 0.7% compared to the same quarter in the previous year, surpassing the forecast contraction of 0.2%. The decline is attributed to sluggish exports, which were impacted by U.S. President Donald Trump's tough trade policies, including tariffs imposed on Japanese goods. Experts warn that the economic slowdown trend may become clearer in subsequent quarters due to heightened uncertainty caused by the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Trump administration for a social media post that officials claim amounted to a call for President Trump's assassination. The post, which Comey later removed, showed seashells forming the numbers “86 47,” a phrase used by critics of the president. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asserted that Comey had "called for the assassination" of Mr. Trump, prompting an investigation by DHS and the Secret Service. Comey stated that he did not realize the numbers' association with violence and opposes violence of any kind.</p>

          <p>Romania is on the brink of a potential disaster as a far-right candidate, George Simion, is likely to become the country's next president. Simion, a self-described Trumpist, won the first round of elections and is poised to gain power to appoint a prime minister, direct foreign policy, and command the armed forces. The rise of the far-right in Romania is attributed to decades of economic failure, widespread insecurity, and mass emigration, generating deep anti-establishment anger. Despite respectable growth numbers, Romania consistently performs poorly on key social indicators, with a significant portion of the population at risk of poverty.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors shifted away from U.S. markets, influenced by President Donald Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion) worth of equities and long-term bonds, marking the largest net inflows for a calendar month since Japan's finance ministry began collecting data in 1996. However, as the U.S. softens its trade stance and strikes deals, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, which may impact the future appeal of Japanese assets. Japanese assets are generally considered a haven, whose appeal rose as the "sell-U.S." narrative gained ground in April, said Rashmi Garg, senior portfolio manager at Al Dhabi Capital.

          <p>A brain-dead pregnant woman in Georgia is being kept on life support to allow the fetus to grow, due to the state's strict anti-abortion law. The hospital claims that Georgia's law restricting abortion after cardiac activity is detected does not allow relatives to have a say in whether the woman is kept on life support. The family is upset and says the fetus has fluid on the brain, raising concerns about his health. This situation highlights the complex legal and ethical questions surrounding abortion bans and the rights of pregnant women, particularly in cases of medical emergencies.</p>

The outbreak has prompted the WHO to urge maximum effort to achieve 100% vaccination coverage, emphasizing that "Polio knows no borders."

Tice acknowledged that Dubai is not "perfect" but argued that politicians are ignoring lessons from countries "getting it right," particularly as crime rates in the UK are rising.</p>

          <p>The Japanese parliament has enacted a law to allow preemptive acts of cyberdefense, granting the government the ability to monitor communications data during peacetime and neutralize hostile servers in the event of an attack. The "active cyberdefense" law will require operators of key infrastructure, such as those in the electricity and railway sectors, to report cyber breaches to the government. The move reflects the country's ambition to enhance its cybersecurity capacity to levels on par with the United States and major European nations. A new independent panel will be set up to give prior approval for data acquisition and analysis.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction for the first time in a year, with a 0.2% decrease in the March quarter due to a sharp decline in exports. This figure was poorer than the 0.1% contraction expected by economists. The annualized GDP also contracted by 0.7% in the first quarter, exceeding the anticipated 0.2% fall. The decrease in exports was attributed to uncertainties caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies. However, domestic demand showed strength, growing by 0.6% and contributing positively to the GDP.</p>
