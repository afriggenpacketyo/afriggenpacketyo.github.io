          <p>During his address to West Point graduates, Trump lauded the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. A West Point professor, Graham Parsons, who resigned in protest, criticized Trump for wearing a MAGA hat and perceived interference in academic affairs. Parsons stated that the administration's actions were indoctrinating rather than educating, effectively banning his research agenda. He viewed the orders as a dangerous removal of boundaries between politics and education, causing him to sacrifice his career to stand against the administration's ideological taste. Optimism is tempered by concerns over academic freedom and political influence.</p>

The race was marred by numerous incidents, including Scott McLaughlin's crash during warm-up laps and Kyle Larson's collision ending his attempt at "the double." Josef Newgarden's bid for a third consecutive win was thwarted by a fuel pump issue, while other drivers experienced brake failures and pit road collisions. Palou held off Marcus Ericsson in the closing laps, securing a Honda 1-2 finish, with David Malukas placing third as the highest-finishing Chevrolet.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is facing scrutiny for allegedly monetizing the presidency to an unprecedented degree, with the Trump family and business partners reportedly collecting millions through various ventures, including a new cryptocurrency and overseas real estate deals. This includes Qatar donating a luxury jet for Trump's use, valued at $200 million. Critics argue that these activities represent a blatant disregard for ethical standards, with some experts suggesting it surpasses even historical scandals like Teapot Dome. While the White House defends Trump by stating he abides by applicable conflict of interest laws, critics point out that these laws do not apply to the president, and that the president is still profiting from private business interests run by his sons.

          <p>Allies of President Trump are requesting that elite law firms fulfill their pro bono commitments made in exchange for being spared from executive orders that could have harmed their businesses. Greta Van Susteren publicly criticized Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom for not fully assisting a veteran, highlighting the growing pressure on these firms. Veterans and conservative groups are among those seeking free legal work, leading firms like Kirkland & Ellis and Paul Weiss to manage an influx of requests. The firms are navigating how to satisfy these commitments while maintaining autonomy and addressing concerns from staff who want to focus on broader public interest issues. The situation has created uncharted territory for these law firms as they attempt to balance their agreements with the Trump administration and their traditional pro bono practices.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa has lodged a formal complaint with the PGMOL, the referees' governing body, citing a significant error by referee Thomas Bramall during their 2-0 loss against Manchester United. The controversial decision involved Bramall incorrectly calling a foul on Villa's Morgan Rogers, disallowing a potential goal that could have changed the game's trajectory. The club's director of football operations, Damian Vidagany, expressed dissatisfaction with Bramall's selection for such a critical match, questioning why more experienced international referees were not assigned. The complaint emphasizes the impact of the referee's mistake on Villa's chances of qualifying for the Champions League.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson defended the Medicaid work requirements in President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," asserting they have a "moral component" because those who refuse to work are "defrauding the system." He claims the bill does not cut Medicaid but addresses fraud, waste, and abuse, despite analyses indicating that many could lose coverage. Johnson argues these requirements will incentivize able-bodied individuals to work, benefiting both themselves and the community. Critics, however, argue that the bill's Medicaid cuts are morally wrong and will harm the working poor, while some claim it may disproportionately affect undocumented immigrants, though they are not eligible for Medicaid. Johnson said the Medicaid work requirements are "not some onerous, burdensome thing," requiring recipients to work a minimum of 20 hours a week.</p>

          <p>U.S. federal judges are considering establishing their own armed security force, shifting control from the Department of Justice, due to increasing concerns that the Trump administration is failing to protect them. This proposal arose from a meeting where judges expressed fears that Trump might order the U.S. Marshals Service to withdraw protection from judges ruling against him. The idea involves transferring the Marshals Service under the judiciary's direct control, led by Chief Justice John Roberts, instead of Attorney General Pam Bondi, a Trump appointee. The move reflects growing anxieties about judicial independence and safety amidst heightened political tensions and personal attacks on judges.</p>

          <p>A recent Supreme Court order has granted President Trump underspecified but considerable new authority by blessing some or all of his firings of high-level officials. This decision has been criticized for effectively overruling a nearly century-old precedent without full briefing or argument. The order enables the consolidation of additional power in the presidency and risks assimilating a "move fast and break things" ethos into constitutional law. This is part of a trend where the Supreme Court's decisions involving the presidency have enabled the president to declare himself above the law, undermining lower courts seeking to protect the rule of law and emboldening an administration eager to trample it.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Ron Johnson has indicated that there is enough resistance among GOP senators to potentially halt President Trump's "big, beautiful bill" in the Senate unless significant changes are made. Johnson argues that the bill increases the deficit and urges deeper spending cuts. Another Republican senator, Rand Paul, stated he would not vote for the legislation unless the debt ceiling increase is removed. Speaker Johnson defended the bill, stating it would stimulate the economy, reduce taxes and regulations, and boost American manufacturing, although the CBO estimates the bill would increase the deficit.</p>

          <p>Six months after President Trump's election victory, the Democratic Party is struggling to find a path forward, facing low approval ratings and a sense of cultural rejection. Key voting blocs, including young people, Black voters, and Latinos, shifted toward the right in the 2024 election. The party is grappling with a perception of being out of touch with working-class voters and increasingly seen as representing college-educated elites. Internal divisions and concerns about the speed with which Trump is undermining institutions are adding to the challenges. The party is reassessing its messaging and strategies to reconnect with voters and address the structural challenges it faces.</p>

          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, resigned after wrongfully arresting an undocumented teenager, Ximena Arias-Cristobal, leading to her detention in a federal immigration jail. The officer, Leslie O'Neal, initially accused her of an improper turn, but the charges were later dropped. Arias-Cristobal, who was brought to the U.S. from Mexico at age four, was turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) due to her undocumented status. The arrest sparked national attention and criticism, with some calling for her release while others, like Marjorie Taylor Greene, advocated for her deportation. Arias-Cristobal has since been released on bond, and her attorney is working to secure her permanent residency.</p>

          <p>Despite pledging to halt fossil fuel funding at the G7 summit, Japan remains a major public financier of oil and gas projects, particularly LNG. This investment contradicts its role as a leader in promoting a fossil fuel phase-out through the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC). While AZEC aims to foster cooperation on net-zero emissions, many projects focus on natural gas, ammonia, and carbon capture storage, with LNG deemed a "transitional fuel." Critics argue that LNG is not a clean alternative, and Japan's investments are a form of greenwashing, hindering the transition to renewable energy in partner countries like Indonesia.</p>
