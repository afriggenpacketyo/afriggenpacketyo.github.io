            <p>United Airlines provided two different profit outlooks for 2025, citing the unpredictable nature of the U.S. economy. The airline maintained its initial full-year forecast of $11.50 to $13.50 earnings per share but also offered a second, lower forecast of $7 to $9 per share in the event of a recession. While domestic travel demand is slowing, international bookings remain strong, particularly for premium cabins. For the first quarter, United reported a profit of $387 million, surpassing Wall Street expectations, though revenue slightly missed estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A federal judge has ordered expedited discovery in the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Despite a Supreme Court ruling that the government should facilitate his return, Abrego Garcia remains imprisoned in El Salvador. The judge expressed impatience with the Justice Department's handling of the case, emphasizing the irreparable harm Abrego Garcia faces each day he remains detained. The Trump administration stated it would facilitate Abrego Garcia's return if he presents himself at a port of entry, but would then detain him due to alleged gang affiliation.</p>

            <p>Legal experts are raising concerns about the constitutionality of President Trump's suggestion to send U.S. citizens convicted of violent crimes to foreign prisons. Trump made the comments during a meeting with the president of El Salvador, suggesting he should build more prisons to house "homegrowns" from the U.S. Experts argue that such a move would violate several constitutional provisions, including the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. The comments come amid ongoing legal battles regarding the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador.</p>

            <p>President Trump's recent actions, such as his handling of the Kilmar Abrego Garcia case and attempts to control universities, are being described as authoritarian. Analysts suggest his approach blends elements of both El Salvador's strongman tactics and Hungary's subtle manipulation of law. This inconsistent approach, combining overt displays of power with covert legal maneuvers, risks inflaming resistance and undermining his policies. Trump's strategic sloppiness may inadvertently strengthen American democracy by provoking backlash.</p>

            <p>A senior Army official ordered Army libraries to remove books with the explicit purpose of promoting DEI, gender ideology, and critical race theory. The memo, sent to several Army commands, instructed them to provide a list of documents for removal. After the memo, all Army libraries were told to only "flag" rather than remove any books. The move follows similar actions at the U.S. Naval Academy.</p>

            <p>Republican Senator Chuck Grassley faced tough questions from constituents at a town hall meeting in Iowa. Constituents raised concerns about the Trump administration's deportation policies, tariff policies, and defiance of court orders.

            <p>This Atlantic article discusses how Trump and DOGE are changing the IRS. The article claims that DOGE intends to cut the number of IRS employees by half and has halted the modernization program. The new code may or may not work well, but it won’t replace the auditing functions performed by human experts who generate much more revenue than they cost. As a result, the very rich, in particular, will benefit.</p>
