          <p>Quaker, one of the five army horses that bolted and ran through London after being spooked by construction noise in April 2024, has been retired. The horse sustained serious injuries during the incident, which also saw several soldiers and civilians hurt as the animals collided with vehicles. After extensive veterinary care, it was determined that Quaker could not return to ceremonial duties. He has been moved to The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire to live out his retirement, ensuring his long-term welfare after the traumatic event.</p>

          <p>Authorities have confirmed there are no survivors following a catastrophic explosion at the Accurate Energetic Systems plant in McEwen, Tennessee. The blast, which occurred Friday morning, completely destroyed the building where workers were present. Humphreys County Sheriff Chris Davis described the scene as one of the most devastating in his career, stating that the operation has now shifted from a search to a recovery effort for remains. The facility manufactures explosives for military and industrial use, and the cause of the explosion is under a slow, methodical investigation due to the volatility of the site.</p>

Sources indicate that around 130 employees in the director's office for the National Center for Immunizations and Respiratory Diseases were terminated, including senior leadership. These layoffs affect teams responsible for responding to infectious disease outbreaks like measles and influenza, raising concerns about public health preparedness. The terminations are part of a broader layoff of over 4,000 federal workers across multiple agencies, which the president described as "Democrat-oriented."</p>

This new phase of treatment follows his diagnosis in May with an aggressive, metastatic form of the disease. The statement noted that the cancer is hormone-sensitive, which may allow for effective management. This health update comes after Biden, who is 82, also had cancerous skin cells removed via Mohs surgery in September, continuing his public health battles after his presidency.</p>

          <p>England has maintained its undefeated record in the Women's World Cup with a decisive 89-run victory against Sri Lanka in Colombo. Captain Nat Sciver-Brunt delivered a masterful performance, scoring an unbeaten 117 runs, while bowler Sophie Ecclestone dismantled the Sri Lankan batting lineup with an exceptional spell of 4 wickets for 17 runs. Despite a promising start from Sri Lanka's openers, their chase faltered against Ecclestone's precise bowling, and they were all out for 164. The win places England at the top of the tournament table ahead of their next match against Pakistan.</p>

          <p>A large-scale pro-Palestinian demonstration took place in central London, drawing tens of thousands of participants just a day after a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was initiated in Gaza. The march, organized by the Palestine Coalition, proceeded from Victoria Embankment to Whitehall. Speakers at the rally described the US-brokered ceasefire as a positive but fragile development, vowing to continue protesting for Palestinian rights. The Metropolitan Police reported 14 arrests for various offenses, including a scuffle that occurred when a small group of counter-protesters breached police conditions and confronted the main march.</p>

The plan hinges on the party winning a majority of seats in the 2026 Holyrood election. Swinney argued at the party conference in Aberdeen that this approach is the most realistic path forward, citing the precedent that led to the 2014 referendum. An alternative proposal to treat the election as a de-facto vote on independence was rejected in favor of Swinney's more traditional route, though securing UK government approval for another vote remains a significant hurdle.</p>

          <p>Despite being the world's youngest continent by median age, Africa is home to numerous gerontocracies, exemplified by Cameroon's 92-year-old President Paul Biya, who is seeking an eighth term after 43 years in power. This phenomenon is not isolated, with leaders in their 80s also governing Malawi, Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, and Zimbabwe. This dynamic creates a stark contrast with the aspirations of the continent's youth, who are increasingly protesting against corruption and lack of opportunity. While some younger leaders are emerging, the trend of long-serving, elderly rulers clinging to power remains a significant political issue.</p>

          <p>A drone strike attributed to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has killed dozens of people at a displacement camp in the besieged Sudanese city of el-Fasher. Local activists reported that the Dar al-Arqam camp, located within a university, was hit by two drones and multiple artillery shells, killing and burning children, women, and the elderly. The attack has overwhelmed the city's struggling hospitals and intensified the humanitarian crisis in the Sudanese army's last stronghold in the Darfur region. The UN has warned that continued strikes on civilian areas may constitute war crimes.</p>

          <p>A panel on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" discussed the recent peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, highlighting President Donald Trump's role as a crucial catalyst. ABC News' Jonathan Karl argued that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has built his career on understanding American politics, recognized the shifting US sentiment and his fundamental need for American support. This reliance made him susceptible to pressure from Trump, ultimately leading to the breakthrough deal to end the war in Gaza. The discussion framed the agreement as a significant turning point potentially brokered by direct presidential influence.</p>

          <p>Jack Wilshere, the 33-year-old former Arsenal and England midfielder, is reportedly the leading choice to become the new manager of Luton Town. He has held discussions with the club's board and is now considered the frontrunner for the position, which became vacant after the dismissal of Matt Bloomfield. Wilshere's most recent coaching experience was as an interim coach at Norwich City at the end of last season. While a deal has not yet been finalized, he appears to be in a strong position to land his first permanent managerial role at the Kenilworth Road club.</p>

The trend extends beyond players to coaching staff, with Australians finding professional opportunities in MLS that are scarcer back home, as the league shifts its model to develop and sell on young talent.</p>

Similarly, enthusiasm around the potential of blockchain technology, particularly Ethereum, is driving interest in specialized funds.

          <p>In a recent television appearance, former President Donald Trump made a series of mathematically impossible claims regarding future drug price reductions. While recounting his pride in lowering drug prices by "one-eighth of 1 percent" during his first term, he went on to promise that prices would soon be going down by "100 percent, 400 percent, 600 percent, a thousand percent in some cases." A price reduction of 100 percent would make a product free, and any reduction greater than that is not possible. The statement was part of his argument that his policies would have a massive impact on lowering costs.</p>

Both men are serving life sentences for their roles in deadly attacks against Israelis. It remains unclear if this disagreement will delay the scheduled release of 20 Israeli hostages, which is a key component of the first phase of the US-brokered agreement.</p>

The new solid-fuel missile, described as the country's "most powerful nuclear strategic weapon," is believed to be designed to carry multiple warheads, enhancing its ability to penetrate missile defense systems.

          <p>Chinese airlines may face significant financial and operational challenges if the United States implements a proposed ban on using Russian airspace for flights to and from the U.S. The U.S. Department of Transportation has suggested the rule, arguing that the shorter flight paths give Chinese carriers an unfair competitive advantage over American airlines. According to analysts, such a ban would force Chinese airlines to either cancel pre-sold flights, leading to compensation costs, or reroute at a much higher operational expense. This could disrupt trans-Pacific travel and escalate economic tensions between the two countries.</p>
