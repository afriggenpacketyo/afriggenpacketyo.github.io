          <p>Despite an overall cooling of inflation following President Trump's "Liberation Day" levies, certain everyday items like coffee and beef are experiencing significant price increases. Coffee prices have surged due to droughts in Vietnam and Brazil, restricting global output, while beef prices have risen due to a reduced national beef herd following a drought in 2022. Car repair costs are also up due to the increasing complexity of car technology and a shortage of skilled technicians, while prices for men's and women's outerwear have climbed due to shifting consumer tastes.

          <p>Alibaba shares experienced a decline following the Chinese e-commerce giant's failure to meet earnings expectations for its fiscal fourth quarter.

The company is facing challenges from macroeconomic volatility in China, including the trade war with Washington, and is also navigating intense price competition within the Chinese e-commerce market.

          <p>Shares of Ubisoft experienced a significant drop after the video game company reported lower-than-expected net bookings for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025.

          <p>A report by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (Fire) reveals that over 1,000 students or student groups have been targeted for punishment by their universities for expressing their views between 2020 and 2024. The report highlights an increasing willingness among institutions of higher learning to discipline students over constitutionally protected speech, particularly during politically charged events. The data indicates that both the "racial reckoning" following George Floyd's death and the recent Israel-Hamas war have led to increased disciplinary actions. Advocates warn that new restrictions on student speech set a dangerous precedent and could be used to suppress critical viewpoints.</p>

          <p>President Trump's current approach to Israel differs significantly from his first term and his predecessor's policies, as he focuses less on restraining Israel's actions in Gaza and more on pursuing independent diplomatic engagements in the Middle East. Trump has engaged in direct talks with Israel's adversaries, such as Hamas and Iran, without coordinating with the Israeli government. This shift in strategy reflects a growing skepticism towards allies and a desire to reduce America's military footprint in the region, potentially reshaping the US-Israel relationship.</p>

The scene emerged in the 1970s, influenced by British bands like the Sex Pistols and the Damned, and was characterized by a preciseness and lack of pretension, with bands like T.S.O.L., Adolescents, and Social Distortion gaining prominence.</p>

          <p>Robert Macfarlane's "Is a River Alive?" explores the question of whether rivers are living beings with memory, intention, and rights. Macfarlane visits three threatened rivers in Ecuador, India, and Canada, examining the exchange between humans and these waterways, which often involves nurturing for poison. He considers how Ecuador and New Zealand have granted certain rivers legal rights and discusses the efforts of activists to achieve similar protections. The book challenges anthropocentric views of nature and emphasizes the interconnectedness between sick rivers and the communities that depend on them.</p>

          <p>Roger Q. Mason's "Califas Trilogy" explores the erosion of dreams and the possibility of repair among ruins in Los Angeles. The trilogy, consisting of "California Story," "Hide and Hide," and "Juana Maria," delves into the cost of ambition, the challenges faced by marginalized communities, and the search for meaning in a city built on fleeting political eras and personal aspirations. The plays showcase taboos through poetry and creative casting, blurring boundaries between oppressed and oppressors and revealing the complicity of the American Dream. Mason emphasizes the importance of imagining a future in the theater as proof of manifesting the future in the world.</p>

          <p>Multiple airstrikes targeted the city of Khan Younis, southern Gaza, resulting in the deaths of dozens of people, including a journalist and members of his family. The strikes occurred as President Trump visits the Middle East, but not Israel, raising concerns about humanitarian aid and a ceasefire. The Israeli military had no immediate comment on the strikes, which followed a previous night of heavy bombing in northern and southern Gaza. Israel has vowed to escalate the war and pursue its aim of destroying the Hamas militant group.</p>
