          <p>The J.M.

This initiative extends to foods supplied to K-12 schools, which will be free of synthetic dyes by the 2026-2027 school year. While many of its products, like Uncrustables, are already compliant, the change will affect items such as sugar-free jams and certain Hostess snacks. This move follows similar pledges from other major food corporations like Nestle and Kraft Heinz amid increasing regulatory scrutiny of synthetic food additives.</p>

          <p>South Africa's coalition government is facing a significant crisis after the Democratic Alliance (DA), the second-largest party, withdrew from President Cyril Ramaphosa's "National Dialogue" initiative. The move was prompted by Ramaphosa's dismissal of a DA deputy minister, which DA leader John Steenhuisen labeled an act of "double standards" amid unresolved corruption allegations against ANC ministers. While the DA has threatened to withhold support for certain budgets and issued an ultimatum for the removal of corrupt officials, it has confirmed it will remain in the government for now, though the political tensions threaten to destabilize the fragile ruling coalition.</p>

However, the victory was tempered by an injury concern for scrum-half Tomos Williams, who left the field with a tight hamstring.

          <p>Senate Republicans are working to pass a sweeping budget bill, central to President Trump's agenda, before a self-imposed July 4th deadline. The legislation, which extends Trump-era tax cuts and introduces new ones, faces opposition from some rank-and-file Republicans over its proposed cuts to welfare programs and changes to state and local tax deductions. Despite leadership's efforts to unify the party and last-minute adjustments to appease moderates, the bill's passage remains uncertain. The pressure to vote quickly on the nearly 1,000-page document has drawn criticism, highlighting the deep divisions within the party on key fiscal policies.</p>

He advises investors to temper their enthusiasm for the tech giant's future prospects, even as it continues to be a leader in AI and computing technologies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has officially confirmed it will cease funding for Gavi, the global vaccine alliance. In a speech, Kennedy accused the organization of ignoring vaccine safety and stifling dissent, formalizing a policy shift that blends anti-vaccine sentiment with foreign policy. This decision jeopardizes a previous U.S. pledge of $1.2 billion and could, by Gavi's estimates, lead to over a million preventable child deaths. Public health experts have condemned the move as a dangerous globalization of the anti-vaccine agenda that will have devastating consequences for childhood immunization programs worldwide.</p>

          <p>British authorities have successfully intercepted a massive drug shipment, seizing 2.4 metric tons of cocaine at the London Gateway port. The drugs, with an estimated street value of Â£96 million ($132 million), were discovered hidden beneath shipping containers on a vessel that had arrived from Panama. The Home Office has classified this as the sixth-largest cocaine seizure on record in the U.K. Officials stated the operation was intelligence-led and demonstrates their commitment to disrupting international criminal networks that use container ships as a primary method for smuggling narcotics into the country.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has executed a highly effective drone operation, dubbed "Operation Spider Web," striking airbases deep within Russian territory and inflicting significant damage on Russia's strategic bomber fleet. The coordinated attack reportedly involved 117 drones smuggled into Russia, which destroyed or damaged over 40 long-range bombers and an early-warning jet. This operation demonstrates a new and cost-effective strategy for smaller nations to counter the airpower of larger adversaries by targeting valuable assets at their supposedly safe rear bases. The strike not only imposes major financial and logistical costs on Moscow but also delivers a significant psychological blow.</p>

He argued that this plan would mean canceling the ongoing construction of a new electric arc furnace, which is set to create thousands of jobs. The speech also addressed internal party dynamics and positioned Labour as the protector of Welsh industry against what he termed Reform's divisive agenda.</p>

The event is remembered as a turning point that shattered illusions about Biden's political strength and contributed to a period of internal turmoil, culminating in Trump's 2024 election victory. The article suggests the party remains fractured, as seen in reactions to recent primary results, and is struggling to find a new, forward-looking identity. To move past the circular relitigation of the past, Democrats are encouraged to focus on cultivating their next generation of national leadership.</p>

Scientists warn this move could severely hamper hurricane forecasting, setting it back decades, just as an active season begins. The DMSP satellites provided unique, high-resolution data essential for seeing inside developing storms and monitoring polar sea ice.
