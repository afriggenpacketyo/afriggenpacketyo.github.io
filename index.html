          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos was sentenced to more than seven years in prison after being convicted of federal fraud charges. Santos, who had previously admitted to engaging in a multi-pronged campaign finance scheme, also stole unemployment benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic and lied on House financial disclosure forms. The New York Republican was ordered to pay restitution of $373,750. As part of his agreement with prosecutors, Santos pleaded guilty to one count each of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, agreeing to restitution and forfeiture totaling nearly $580,000.</p>

          <p>Online scammers are increasingly using "wrong number" text messages, often aided by AI, to trick phone users into providing personal information and financial account access. These seemingly harmless messages are used to validate active phone numbers, build relationships, and ultimately defraud individuals through tactics like "pig butchering scams." Consumers lost $470 million to scams originating from text messages in 2024, a five-fold increase from 2020, according to the FTC.

          <p>The Trump administration initially sought to bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. after his wrongful deportation to El Salvador, but later hardened its stance, depicting him as a dangerous criminal. Internal discussions among government attorneys revealed concerns about his safety and doubts about his alleged gang ties. The White House then took over the response, turning the case into a political opportunity to assert executive authority. Abrego Garcia remains detained in El Salvador, while legal proceedings continue, challenging the administration's actions.</p>

The attack, which targeted Hindu tourists, has prompted India to suspend a water treaty with Pakistan, close a border crossing, and expel Pakistani military advisors, while Pakistan has responded with similar measures, raising concerns about further military action.</p>

          <p>'On Swift Horses,' directed by Daniel Minahan, delves into the apprehensions and opportunities of boom-time America, focusing on a love triangle involving a stifled housewife, Muriel, her husband Lee, and his brother Julius. The film explores themes of lust, longing, and the need to break free from societal constraints in 1950s America. While the movie initially promises a deeper exploration of repressed desires, it ultimately falls into episodic management, relying on constructs and gestures over nuanced character development. Despite this, the acting, particularly by Daisy Edgar-Jones and Will Poulter, is a saving grace.</p>

Gellar also advises couples to maintain separate credit cards for specific purchases. In a previous interview, she attributed America's high divorce rate to a disposable society where people don't put in the necessary effort to make relationships work.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, economists suggest that such a move may not translate into lower borrowing costs for consumers. Trump's ongoing attacks on Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his tariff policies could keep longer-term interest rates higher. A less independent Fed could lead to increased borrowing costs as investors worry about future inflation spikes. Economists emphasize that market forces largely determine long-term rates on mortgages and auto loans, and the Fed's influence may be limited.</p>

The Hollywood Reporter deemed its price tag “relatively hefty for a genre movie.” A New York Times article noted that Sinners’ box-office success came with a “big asterisk,” and that “to make money, Sinners will need to attract substantial crowds in the weeks ahead.” The undercurrent to this kind of coverage is troubling: that Sinners was somehow not worthy of a large budget, or that Coogler didn’t deserve a creatively enriching deal. Perhaps these beliefs stem from the fact that the movie isn’t attached to a franchise.</p>
