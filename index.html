          <p>The Trump administration has accused Columbia University of violating federal civil rights law by allegedly showing deliberate indifference towards harassment of Jewish students since October 7, 2023. The Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights claims Columbia failed to establish effective reporting mechanisms for antisemitism until the summer of 2024 and did not properly investigate or punish vandalism targeting Jewish students. The government alleges that Columbia failed to abide by its own policies and procedures when responding to Jewish studentsâ€™ complaints. In March, Columbia agreed to demands from the Trump administration after facing the cancellation of $400 million in grants and contracts. The university has not yet responded to the current allegations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering a 5% tax on remittance transfers from the U.S., primarily impacting Latin American countries that rely heavily on these funds. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum criticized the plan, arguing that it amounts to double taxation. The proposal, included in Trump's 'One, Big, Beautiful Bill,' aims to curb illegal migration by taxing remittances sent by undocumented migrants. Experts warn that this tax could push transfers into informal channels and disproportionately affect countries with high remittance-to-GDP ratios. Ron DeSantis is reportedly considering requiring identity verification for money transfers, a measure criticized as discriminatory. (not investment advice)</p>

Clinical trials have shown its effectiveness in reducing post-surgical reliance on opioids. The drug is intended to mitigate the U.S. overdose epidemic fueled by addictive opioids like fentanyl.

          <p>The Chinese government has criticized the Trump administration's decision to ban international students from Harvard University, asserting that it will damage America's international standing.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry has stated that China will protect the rights and interests of its students abroad.

          <p>The UK's energy regulator, Ofgem, has confirmed that the energy price cap will fall in July, reducing the typical gas and electricity bill by Â£11 a month. Despite this decrease, Ofgem is encouraging households to shop around for cheaper fixed-rate energy deals, potentially saving up to Â£200 annually. The price cap affects 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales. While the price cap is decreasing, fixed deals may offer better value and certainty over monthly payments. Dame Clare Moriarty of Citizens Advice emphasizes that many households are still struggling with energy debt, and targeted support is needed for those hardest hit.</p>

          <p>Five years after the murder of George Floyd, which sparked widespread protests and calls for police reform, a New York Times article indicates that surprisingly little has changed nationwide. Despite states and cities enacting new policies aimed at improving policing, data suggests minimal impact on accountability or the number of killings by police officers. Killings by police have actually risen, and racial disparities persist, with Black Americans killed at nearly three times the rate of white Americans. The article suggests that deeper systemic issues, such as higher crime rates in poorer minority communities, require more than just tweaking department guidelines.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has issued a preliminary injunction, pausing President Trump's sweeping overhaul of the federal government. The judge agreed with a coalition of labor unions, nonprofits, and local governments that Trump lacks the authority to carry out such a transformation without congressional approval. The order prevents agencies from issuing new reorganization plans and layoff notices. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the decision. The judge stopped short of requiring agencies to bring back those already laid off, but indicated that agencies were making changes that flout duties given to them by Congress.</p>

Meanwhile, the National Education Union (NEU) is likely to dispute the government if it doesn't fully fund the 4% pay rise for teachers.

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated that upcoming talks with U.S. President Donald Trump in June will be a significant milestone in bilateral tariff negotiations. Ishiba aims to secure the complete removal of higher U.S. tariffs, rejecting any partial reductions. Japan's chief negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, will continue ministerial talks in Washington, urging the U.S. to reconsider its tariff policy. Trump has put part of a 24 percent 'reciprocal' tariff on Japanese products on hold, but a baseline of 10 percent remains. Ishiba also addressed plans to tackle surging rice prices, aiming for a price target that satisfies both producers and consumers.</p>

          <p>Satellite images have revealed the extent of damage to a new warship in North Korea following a shipyard accident attended by Kim Jong Un. The images show the vessel lying on its side, covered by tarpaulins, with part of it on land. North Korea's official news agency downplayed the damage, saying it was 'not serious' and that there were no holes on the ship's bottom. An investigation into the accident, which Kim described as a 'criminal act,' has begun. The shipyard manager has been summoned by law enforcers.</p>

          <p>The author discusses the lack of media attention to Joe Biden's decline in office and that the media was more interested in the drama surrounding Donald Trump. The author states that while mistakes were made during Biden's presidency, the government mostly worked and that those within Biden's circle were complicit in covering up Biden's state, not because they're villains, but because even proximity to power is addictive. The author believes that the scandal isnâ€™t that the media and Democratic partisans conspired to keep us in the dark about Joe Bidenâ€™s fitness for office, but that the truth was hidden in plain sight, yet a lot of elites chose not to see it.</p>

          <p>The House Republican reconciliation bill includes a national school voucher program, a first of its kind, which is now heading to the Senate. This proposal would use the federal tax code to offer vouchers for students to attend private secular or religious schools. The bill rewards charitable donations to Scholarship Granting Organizations (SGOs) with a dollar-for-dollar tax credit, capped at $5 billion annually. The vouchers would be available to households earning at or below 300% of a given area's median gross income. The complex plan uses the tax code and SGOs because most voucher students attend religious schools, for which federal law prohibits direct government funding.</p>
