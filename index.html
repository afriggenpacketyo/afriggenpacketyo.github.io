          <p>Russell Brand appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court in London for the first hearing regarding charges of sexual assault, oral sexual assault, and indecent assault, all of which he denies. The charges relate to alleged offenses between 1999 and 2005 involving four women. Brand, surrounded by bodyguards and photographers, did not speak to reporters as he entered the courthouse, and the hearing was a largely procedural step, with the case being referred to a higher court. The New York Times article notes that Brand became famous in the UK and later in the US, and in recent years has become known for his YouTube videos.</p>

          <p>A new jobs report will provide insight into the US economy's performance following President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement. Economists expect the US to have added 133,000 jobs in April, a slowdown from the previous month. The data arrives after a government report showed the US economy shrank in the first quarter of 2025, coinciding with Trump's tariff proposals. Despite a robust labor market, recession fears are mounting on Wall Street as tariffs threaten to disrupt global trade, and Goldman Sachs has increased its recession odds to 45%.</p>

          <p>Euro zone inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in April, missing expectations for a decrease, according to flash data from Eurostat. Core inflation, excluding volatile prices, accelerated to 2.7%, and services inflation also increased to 3.9%. ECB President Christine Lagarde warned that the medium-term inflation picture is less clear due to potential retaliation against US tariffs and fiscal shifts. The CNBC article notes that the ECB will be "data dependent to the extreme" when making interest rate decisions, and that while the euro zone economy showed growth in the first quarter of 2025, growth is expected to slow due to the tariff fallout.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Eig, author of "King: A Life," reflects on the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter From Birmingham Jail" and its relevance to current events. The letter, written during a time of cruelty and injustice, emphasized the power of love to overcome hate and reform unjust systems. Eig suggests that King's example of peaceful protest and confrontation can guide those who disapprove of current tactics and wish to fight back. King believed that most government leaders and ordinary Americans would choose mercy over meanness if they saw the meanness for themselves.</p>

The BBC article reports that the UN's World Food Programme and Unrwa have already used up their food aid stocks.
