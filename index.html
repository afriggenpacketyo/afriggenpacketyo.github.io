          <p>Star wide receiver Terry McLaurin has been activated from the physically unable to perform list by the Washington Commanders, effectively ending his "hold-in" at training camp. While the move is reportedly due to his recovery from an ankle injury and not directly tied to contract negotiations, it allows him to resume practice. McLaurin has previously expressed disappointment with the lack of progress on a contract extension, and he has one year remaining on his current deal. This development comes after he skipped the first four days of camp, resulting in significant fines.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has stepped in to halt a strike by over 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants, ordering binding arbitration just hours after the labor action began. The strike, initiated by the Canadian Union of Public Employees over disputes concerning wages and unpaid work, had caused the cancellation of hundreds of flights, affecting an estimated 130,000 passengers daily. Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu cited the need to preserve stability and supply chains as the reason for the intervention, a move the union criticized as a violation of their rights. The airline anticipates it could take several days to return to normal operations.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of 96 British Members of Parliament has formally requested that the UK government expedite the evacuation of sick and injured children from Gaza for urgent medical care. In a letter to senior ministers, they highlighted the collapse of Gaza's healthcare system and called for any bureaucratic barriers to be removed, advocating for a process based solely on clinical need. The MPs are also asking that the children and their families be given the option to seek asylum or resettle in the UK after treatment is complete. The government has stated that plans are being accelerated, though no specific timeline has been provided.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced an immediate halt to the issuance of "medical-humanitarian" visitor visas for people from Gaza, pending a full review of its procedures. This decision directly impacts efforts by humanitarian groups to evacuate critically injured individuals, particularly children, for medical treatment in the United States. The move followed social media campaigns by far-right activists who claimed the program was being used to "mass import" Gazans. Human rights organizations have condemned the policy suspension as cruel, stating it will put the lives of vulnerable children at further risk.</p>

The victory provided a moment of joy for fans who have endured a long period in lower divisions, including a drop to League One. Goals from Eliezer Mayenda, Dan Ballard, and Wilson Isidor secured the win, showcasing the potential of a team bolstered by significant summer spending.

While the storm's center is forecast to pass north of these islands, it is expected to bring up to six inches of rain, posing a risk of life-threatening surf, flash flooding, and mudslides. Current forecast models show the hurricane curving northward into the Atlantic, keeping it away from the U.S. mainland.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old Gazan woman, Marah Abu Zuhri, who was medically evacuated to Italy, has died in a hospital in Pisa less than 48 hours after her arrival. Doctors stated she suffered a cardiac arrest as a result of severe emaciation and muscle loss, a direct consequence of the widespread malnutrition in Gaza. Her death highlights the extreme humanitarian crisis in the region, where the UN has warned of famine conditions and the local health ministry reports over 250 hunger-related deaths. Italy is one of several countries that has established schemes to evacuate and treat seriously ill or injured residents from the besieged territory.</p>

This follows a recent heatwave that fueled several large blazes, including the 132,000-acre Gifford fire.

          <p>Six prominent Senate Democrats, including Chuck Schumer and Mark Warner, have formally requested that President Trump reconsider a deal allowing Nvidia and AMD to sell advanced AI chips to China. The arrangement requires the companies to pay the U.S. government 15% of the revenue from these sales in exchange for export licenses. In an open letter, the senators expressed serious alarm that the policy trades away America's competitive technological edge for a "commission," potentially strengthening China's military capabilities. The White House dismissed these concerns, while reports indicate China is already urging its tech firms to avoid U.S. chips.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is reportedly prepared to support a peace agreement that would require Ukraine to cede the unoccupied parts of its Donbas region to Russia. Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, details emerged that Trump communicated this potential framework to European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This stance represents a significant shift and a potential break with Ukraine and European allies, who have consistently opposed changing international borders by force.

          <p>The summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin has been met with widespread disappointment and anxiety in Ukraine. Analysts suggest the meeting yielded no concrete benefits for Kyiv and instead served as a major propaganda success for Russia, legitimizing Putin on the world stage without achieving any meaningful progress toward peace. Many Ukrainians fear that President Zelenskyy will now face increased pressure from the U.S. to accept unfavorable terms, such as territorial concessions. The primary sentiment is that the summit only created more uncertainty and chaos rather than bringing a resolution to the conflict any closer.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin's transformation from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in just over 24 hours is a stark example of "rapid intensification." Meteorologists explain this phenomenon, where wind speeds increase significantly in a day, was fueled by perfect conditions, including low wind shear and exceptionally warm sea surface temperatures. This process, which complicates forecasting and emergency planning, is becoming more common due to climate change-induced ocean warming. While Erin is not projected to make landfall in the U.S., its rapid strengthening highlights the growing volatility and danger of Atlantic storms.</p>

If a significant downturn occurs, quality dividend stocks and large-cap technology companies are often suggested as potential areas for investment. This planned strategy can help investors take advantage of lower entry points without succumbing to panic-selling or inaction during periods of high market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An architecture-driven startup in Phoenix, Arizona, is converting old shipping containers into innovative, rapidly deployable shelters for the city's unhoused population. The "X-WING" shelters, developed by Steel + Spark, are constructed from four containers arranged in an 'X' shape, creating five individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyard spaces. The design emphasizes sustainability and cost-effectiveness by using existing materials, and a full unit can be built in just one week. The project aims to provide a scalable solution to the affordable housing crisis, with plans to build a larger apartment complex for low-income seniors next.</p>

          <p>Millions of current and former AT&T customers are now eligible to file for compensation from a $177 million class-action settlement related to two major data breaches. The breaches, announced in March and July 2024, exposed the personal information of nearly all of the company's cellular customers, including Social Security numbers. Affected individuals can file a claim for up to $7,500 in documented losses that are traceable to the security incidents. The deadline to submit a claim is November 18, 2025, though payments are contingent on the court's final approval of the settlement in December.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data shows that immigration arrests nationwide saw a 13% decrease in July compared to the previous month. This slowdown comes after a sharp increase in June and amidst President Trump's promise of mass deportations. While ICE has cited the need for more resources to meet its goals, activists and immigrant rights groups believe their efforts may be contributing to the decline. In places like Oregon, a "rapid-response" hotline and legal aid system, combined with the state's sanctuary laws, create significant logistical hurdles for federal immigration agents, potentially slowing the pace of arrests.</p>

          <p>Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson claimed victory over Olympic champion Noah Lyles in their first 100-meter showdown since the Paris Olympics, where Lyles won gold by a razor-thin margin. At the Silesia Diamond League meet in Poland, Thompson clocked a time of 9.87 seconds, matching the meet record. Lyles finished second with a time of 9.90 seconds, followed by fellow American Kenny Bednarek. Thompson's dominant, gun-to-tape performance solidifies his position as a top contender for the upcoming world championships in Tokyo, while Lyles viewed his own sub-10-second run as a positive step in his preparations.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, has publicly denied any ambition to run for president in 2028, calling such claims a "flat-out lie." His statement came in response to pressure from conservative influencer Laura Loomer, who raised concerns that a top aide was laying the groundwork for a future campaign. In a social media post, Kennedy affirmed his loyalty to President Trump and their shared mission, suggesting that D.C. lobbyists were attempting to create a rift between them. Kennedy, who ran as an independent in 2024 before joining the Trump administration, stated his sole focus is on his current role.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued by helicopter after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, leaving him stranded. A search was initiated after he failed to return to his car, and a dive and rescue team eventually located him using a drone. The California Highway Patrol then conducted a hoist rescue, lifting him to safety where he was treated for minor injuries and dehydration.</p>

          <p>President Trump's shift in focus from securing an immediate ceasefire to pursuing a direct peace agreement with Russia has likely caused significant dismay in Kyiv and among European allies. This new stance appears to endorse Russia's long-held position that a ceasefire can only occur as part of a comprehensive settlement, which many fear implies Ukrainian capitulation. Reports that the proposed deal involves major territorial concessions from Ukraine in exchange for freezing front lines elsewhere only deepen these concerns. This diplomatic pivot buys time for Russia on the battlefield and undermines the united front Ukraine and its European partners had sought to present.</p>

          <p>A leading academic from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has called for China to accelerate its development of space-based solar power to compete with the United States in the new energy and space sectors. This technology involves building orbital facilities that collect solar energy and transmit it to Earth as electricity via microwaves or lasers, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather. The academic, Ge Changchun, argued that China's current research efforts are too fragmented and lack the top-down strategic support needed for such a complex systems project, urging a more focused national approach to close the technological gap.</p>
