          <p>A public inquiry is investigating the murder of three girls at a Southport dance studio by Axel Rudakubana, who had a history of violence and concerning behavior. The inquiry focuses on whether agencies like Prevent, MI5, and social services adequately addressed the risks posed by the teenager. A teacher's email expressing frustration with "frightening red tape" that hindered intervention efforts was highlighted, revealing challenges in coordinating support for Rudakubana. The inquiry will assess agency responsibility, risk assessment, and necessary systemic changes, also examining the killer's internet activity and weapons purchases. Optimism is understandably low given the tragic circumstances.</p>

          <p>Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has been removed from prosecuting Donald Trump's election interference case in Georgia after the Georgia Supreme Court declined to hear her appeal. The disqualification stems from an "appearance of impropriety" due to her romantic relationship with special prosecutor Nathan Wade. Trump's attorney welcomed the decision, criticizing Willis's conduct during the investigation, while a former DOJ official noted the case now goes to the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia to appoint a replacement. The new prosecutor could pursue the case, drop charges, or take a different approach, but the timeline for prosecution is now uncertain.</p>

          <p>Oracle and Silver Lake are reportedly part of a consortium involved in a deal to allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S., pending finalization of an agreement between the U.S. and China. The structure of the deal is still unclear, including the level of involvement of Chinese firms like ByteDance and control over TikTok's recommendation algorithm. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that commercial terms have been agreed upon, while China has stated it will defend its companies' rights. The agreement follows legislation requiring ByteDance to divest from TikTok or face a ban in the U.S. due to national security concerns.</p>

          <p>A U.N. Human Rights Council-commissioned inquiry concluded that Israel has committed acts of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. The report cites the killing of members of the group, causing serious harm, deliberately inflicting conditions to bring about physical destruction, and imposing measures to prevent births. Israeli officials have rejected the report, calling it biased and based on misinformation, while the commission urges an immediate end to the alleged genocide and a ceasefire. The commission's chair, Navi Pillay, called the situation a moral outrage and legal emergency, urging member states to ensure accountability for any crimes committed.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that President Trump's willingness to potentially ban TikTok in the U.S. was a key factor in reaching a deal framework with China. The deal, which includes new investors, aims to address national security concerns while allowing TikTok to continue operating in the U.S.. Bessent noted that commercial terms were agreed upon earlier, but the Chinese government put the deal on hold after Trump's tariff announcement. Despite Trump's openness to a ban, the White House has also launched its own TikTok account, indicating the app's continued relevance.</p>

          <p>Thousands of informal miners, driven by the hope for a better life, are flocking to Mozambique's gold-rich Revue River region and employing toxic chemicals to extract gold. Substances like mercury, cyanide, and arsenic are seeping into the soil and water, devastating ecosystems and local communities, particularly the Chicamba Dam. The Manica provincial government has announced plans to crack down on illegal mining and implement stricter oversight, seeking support from traditional and religious leaders.

          <p>Israel has initiated a major ground offensive on Gaza City, conducting heavy air strikes and prompting thousands of Palestinians to flee southward. Prime Minister Netanyahu described the operation as targeting Hamas's "last major stronghold," amidst international criticism. The offensive comes as a UN commission accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, which Israel rejects. The UN warns of deeper catastrophe for civilians as the conflict intensifies, drawing widespread condemnation from international bodies and governments.</p>

          <p>Colombia's peace tribunal has issued its first sentence on war crimes, finding seven former FARC leaders guilty of implementing policies that led to the kidnapping of 21,000 people. The court mandated that the former rebels work on projects to find missing persons and remove landmines for eight years, monitored with electronic devices. The sentence aims to recognize the suffering of victims and ensure reparations, though some criticize the lack of harsher punishments. The tribunal was created as part of the 2016 peace deal between the Colombian government and the FARC rebels.</p>

Bessent noted that talks have become increasingly productive, and China senses a trade deal is possible.

          <p>The assassination of Charlie Kirk has sparked debate about political violence and the repercussions for employees who publicly comment on the event. Several individuals have been fired or placed on leave for their remarks, highlighting the legal latitude private employers have in addressing employee speech. Employers often have a basis to terminate employees whose comments cause reputational damage, and First Amendment protections are limited for private sector workers. This situation underscores the delicate balance between free speech and workplace policies.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks stated that the U.K. has become a "laggard" in biopharma due to unattractive market conditions and policy mistakes. Lilly recently paused plans to create a biotech incubator in the U.K., citing concerns about drug pricing and regulation. Ricks noted that capital goes where it is wanted and that the U.K. currently rates poorly despite its strong academic base.

          <p>India and the European Union are on track to finalize free trade agreement negotiations by the end of the year, driven by the pressure of U.S. tariffs and a desire for stable partnerships. For India, this means tariff-free entry for key exports and reduced reliance on volatile U.S. markets, while for the EU, it diversifies supply chains and secures trade in agriculture and technology. Sticking points include the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and market access for specific products, but a breakthrough is expected in the auto sector.</p>
