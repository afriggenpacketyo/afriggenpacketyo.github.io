          <p>President Donald Trump publicly declared his intention to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud and questioning her competence as a financial regulator. Cook, the first Black woman on the Fed's board, immediately challenged the dismissal, asserting that Trump lacks the legal authority to remove a Fed governor without proper cause, as stipulated by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. Her legal team is preparing a federal court challenge, highlighting the significant implications for the central bank's independence and potential political interference in monetary policy. This action follows months of Trump's complaints about the Fed's refusal to cut interest rates, amplifying market uncertainty over future policy direction.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor's shares experienced a significant decline of over 6% following Mercedes-Benz's announcement to divest its 3.8% stake in the Japanese automaker. Mercedes-Benz cited the non-strategic nature of the holding, which was transferred to pension assets in 2016, and framed the sale as part of a broader portfolio cleanup. This divestment exacerbates existing pressures on Nissan, which is grappling with the impact of U.S. tariffs, a downturn in sales, and fierce global competition, particularly from Chinese manufacturers, amidst the transition to electric vehicles. The article highlights that Nissan's stock has already depreciated by more than 29% this year, reflecting persistent market challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

The committee has demanded extensive internal documents dating back to September 2021, citing reports of hostility experienced by Jewish individuals and questioning the institutions' compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. This expansion follows previous federal actions, including the suspension of over $500 million in grants to UCLA. The article also highlights a UCLA task force report detailing harassment faced by those expressing support for Palestinian human rights, indicating a deeply polarized environment on campus.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has once again postponed the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, first due to an oxygen leak in a ground system and then because of an electrically charged anvil cloud. This milestone mission is critical for validating numerous fixes and upgrades implemented after three consecutive catastrophic failures earlier this year. Elon Musk acknowledged the formidable engineering challenges ahead, particularly the unprecedented task of large-scale cryogenic propellant transfer in orbit, essential for NASA's Artemis moon landing program and future Mars colonization efforts. Despite these setbacks and expert skepticism regarding the 2027 moon landing timeline, NASA officials maintain confidence in SpaceX's ability to rapidly innovate and meet its ambitious goals.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued a warning to China, threatening to impose 200% tariffs if the country curbs its exports of rare-earth magnets to the U.S., potentially jeopardizing an existing trade truce. Trump also highlighted airplane parts as a key leverage point, claiming that a lack of Boeing parts had grounded Chinese planes. This comes as China, which controls 90% of global rare-earth magnet production, has seen its exports to the U.S. rebound after earlier curbs. The article suggests these remarks are a negotiating tactic, with a temporary truce set to expire in November, and ongoing high-level trade discussions aim to ease tensions.

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung employed a strategy of flattery during his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, successfully deflecting potential criticism despite Trump's earlier social media post about a "purge or revolution" in South Korea. Lee praised Trump's rapport with Kim Jong Un, urging him to act as a "peacemaker" on the Korean peninsula, even joking about a "Trump Tower in North Korea." While the meeting eased immediate tensions, it yielded no concrete agreements on contentious trade and defense issues, including the cost of U.S. troops. Lee's primary objective was seemingly to ensure a positive personal dynamic with Trump.</p>

The measure, signed into law last week, aims to redraw congressional maps to favor Democrats in five GOP-held districts, a move Democrats frame as a response to similar actions in Texas. Opponents argue the plan violates the state constitution by circumventing an independent redistricting commission, skipping a public review period, and redrawing maps mid-decade. If approved, the new map could help Democrats gain control of the U.S. House in 2026, intensifying the legal and political battle.</p>

Marking the 20th anniversary of the disaster, the "Katrina Declaration" alleges that unqualified leaders, staff reductions, and the termination of grants like the BRIC program hinder FEMA's mission.

          <p>Tech billionaire Elon Musk, through his AI startup xAI, has filed a lawsuit against Apple and ChatGPT creator OpenAI, alleging monopolistic collaboration. The Texas lawsuit claims Apple's integration of ChatGPT into its operating system unfairly disadvantages rival chatbots like xAI's Grok by preventing them from ranking prominently in the App Store. Musk argues this "locks up markets" and stifles competition, while Apple insists its App Store is fair. Legal experts are closely watching the case as it will be a first opportunity for U.S. courts to define and assess the AI market from an antitrust perspective, potentially shaping the future of AI development and distribution.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are urging the Legislature to approve a $1-billion-per-year investment from cap-and-trade revenue to secure the future of the state's high-speed rail project. State Senator Dave Cortese emphasized the need for consistent funding, linking the project to significant job creation and economic growth, with projections of over 1 million jobs upon completion. The project, billions over budget and decades behind schedule, faces hurdles including the Trump administration's decision to pull $4 billion in funding. High-Speed Rail Authority CEO Ian Choudri stressed that long-term financial commitments are crucial to avoid a funding gap and ensure the project's viability. (not investment advice)</p>

While the Home Secretary is committed, significant logistical hurdles remain, including Israel's approval for each student's exit and the need for biometric checks in a third country.

          <p>Mexican drug lord Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, co-founder of the powerful Sinaloa Cartel, has pleaded guilty to two drug smuggling and conspiracy charges in a New York court, marking an end to his notorious criminal career. Zambada, 77 and reportedly in poor health, apologized for the harm caused by illegal drugs in the U.S. and Mexico, admitting his organization fueled corruption by paying police, military, and politicians. His plea comes after U.S. prosecutors decided not to seek the death penalty. Arrested last year following an alleged double-cross by 'El Chapo' Guzmán's sons, Zambada is expected to receive a more lenient sentence, though he will likely spend his remaining life in prison.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance is facing backlash over allegations that his team had the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers adjust water levels at Caesar Creek Lake in Ohio for his 41st birthday party. The alleged reason was to create "ideal kayaking conditions," though official explanations cited supporting Secret Service navigation. Ethics specialists, including former White House counsels, deemed the requests "pretty outrageous" and creating the "appearance that the vice president... is getting special treatment." This controversy is amplified by the Trump administration's cuts to organizations like the National Park Service, raising concerns about the ethical use of government resources.</p>

          <p>A victim of child sexual assault, identified as "Zora," has made a heartfelt plea to Elon Musk to remove links offering images of her abuse from his social media platform X. Zora, first abused over two decades ago, expressed outrage that her abuse is still being circulated and commodified, fueling the original trauma. The BBC's investigation uncovered thousands of such images for sale on an X account, leading to an Indonesian trader. Despite X's "zero tolerance" policy for child sexual assault material, the article highlights the enormous scale of the problem and the challenges social media platforms face in preventing criminals from repeatedly posting such content.</p>
