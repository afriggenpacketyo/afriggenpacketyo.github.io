            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-16 07:48:55 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The UK Supreme Court ruled that doctors involved in two end-of-life cases can be named publicly, overturning previous court orders that protected their anonymity. This decision followed appeals by the parents of Isaiah Haastrup and Zainab Abbasi, who sought to share their stories regarding the care their children received. The court emphasized that restrictions on freedom of speech must be convincingly justified, a threshold not met by the NHS trusts involved. This ruling has significant implications for transparency and accountability within the healthcare system, potentially influencing future legal proceedings and public discourse surrounding medical care.

            <p>Mortgage rates have increased to their highest level since February, leading homebuyers to seek adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) with lower initial rates.

The shift towards ARMs reflects borrowers' attempts to lower monthly payments amid economic uncertainty and higher home prices. This trend indicates a willingness to take on more risk in the housing market, as ARMs can adjust higher after a fixed term. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Experts warn that the Trump administration's promotion of white Christian nationalists and prosperity gospel preachers to key government roles could lead to the dismantling of government institutions and the chilling of free speech. The administration's creation of an "anti-Christian bias" taskforce and a White House Faith Office, dominated by right-wing Christian loyalists, raises concerns about the prioritization of a specific brand of Christianity over other faiths. This could result in policies that are anti-LGBTQ+, anti-immigration, and against efforts to ensure racial equality.</p>

            <p>Claims made by Elon Musk and his "department of government efficiency" regarding unemployment benefit fraud have been refuted by experts. Musk's team cited examples of deceased or underage claimants, alleging a lack of oversight in the system. However, these claims are based on old data and processes already addressed by the Department of Labor, including under the Biden administration. Experts suggest Musk's assertions are a distraction from the real issues facing the unemployment insurance system, such as wrongly denied claims and inadequate preparation for future recessions.</p>

            <p>The supply of new and used vehicles in the U.S. is rapidly declining as consumers rush to purchase cars and trucks ahead of potential price increases due to tariffs. Days' supply of new vehicles has dropped significantly, and used vehicle supply is also low. Increased sales are benefiting the automotive industry, but there's concern that sales could halt once tariff-free inventories are depleted. Analysts expect higher production costs to result in fewer vehicles sold annually due to price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

This ruling follows a previous defeat in a challenge to his segregation in jail, underscoring the legal consequences of his actions and the court's stance on contempt.</p>
