          <h2>Demand for Workers with AI Skills Surges in US Job Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 17:37:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Brookings Institution report reveals a significant increase in U.S. job postings requiring artificial intelligence skills, with a more than 100% rise in the last year alone. While overall AI job growth has been accelerating, it still constitutes a small portion of the total labor market, with peak adoption expected in the early 2030s. These positions, spanning tech hubs and expanding into other sectors like finance and marketing, offer an average salary premium of 28% compared to similar roles without AI requirements. This trend reflects growing corporate integration of AI and is creating new roles in AI consulting and ethics.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the former leader of the UK's Labour Party, is launching a new political party aimed at challenging the established political order and advocating for wealth redistribution. Alongside independent MP Zarah Sultana, Corbyn stated the yet-unnamed party will offer a community-led alternative to what he describes as Labour's centralized control and the divisive politics of Reform UK. The initiative seeks to capitalize on left-wing political energy, focusing on issues like child poverty and corporate profits. While the party's platform will be determined at a future conference, it is positioned to the left of Labour on key policies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has initiated a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary city laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The legal action follows a recent incident where a Customs and Border Patrol officer was shot by an undocumented immigrant. Federal officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and border czar Tom Homan, argue these policies release dangerous criminals onto the streets. Mayor Eric Adams has expressed that while he supports the principle of sanctuary laws, he believes they may go too far in cases involving violent criminals and has urged the City Council to reconsider its stance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a rare presidential visit to the Federal Reserve, President Donald Trump and Chairman Jerome Powell publicly disputed the cost of ongoing renovations at the central bank's headquarters. Trump claimed the project's cost had inflated to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell immediately contested, stating it included a separate, previously completed building. Despite the tense exchange over fiscal management and his continued calls for lower interest rates, Trump suggested he is no longer considering firing the Fed chair. The visit is seen as part of the president's ongoing pressure campaign on the central bank's monetary policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed a rescissions package into law, canceling approximately $9 billion in previously approved federal spending. The legislation primarily targets foreign aid, revoking nearly $8 billion from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and also cuts over $1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS. The measure, which passed Congress on a narrow party-line vote in the Senate, has been praised by Republicans as a step toward fiscal responsibility. Democrats, however, have criticized the cuts, arguing they weaken U.S. influence abroad and set a dangerous precedent for future program funding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from BatchData reveals that investors own 19% of all homes in California, highlighting the state's severe and ongoing housing affordability crisis. While this rate is just below the national average, it signifies a major challenge in a state with a profound housing shortage and some of the country's highest home prices. The data shows higher concentrations of investor ownership in mountain regions, while urban centers have slightly lower rates. Critics argue that large-scale investor purchasing puts upward pressure on prices, while the report suggests investors are providing necessary market liquidity as traditional buyers are sidelined by high costs.</p>

          <p>Representatives from Germany, France, the UK, and Iran are set to meet in Istanbul for critical negotiations regarding Iran's nuclear program. The talks come ahead of an end-of-August deadline, after which European powers have threatened to reinstate UN sanctions if no agreement is reached. Experts are uncertain about the current technical status of Iran's enrichment capabilities following recent attacks on its facilities. While Iranian officials have expressed openness to diplomacy, analysts suggest Tehran may be trying to buy time, making the outcome of these high-stakes negotiations difficult to predict and crucial for avoiding further escalation.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at regulating the compensation of college athletes, specifically prohibiting "third-party, pay-for-play" payments. The White House stated the move is intended to curb the chaotic environment created by booster-funded bidding wars for athletes through Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals. The order directs schools to eliminate NIL payments used as recruiting inducements while preserving fair-market compensation for legitimate endorsements. It also calls for protecting non-revenue and women's sports by requiring larger athletic departments to maintain or increase their investment in those programs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The iconic heavy metal touring festival Ozzfest was created in 1996 as a direct result of Lollapalooza rejecting Ozzy Osbourne as an artist. According to his wife and manager, Sharon Osbourne, she was told Ozzy was "not relevant," which prompted her to launch their own festival. The first Ozzfest was a two-date event but quickly grew into a juggernaut that provided a major platform for both established and emerging metal bands like System of a Down and Disturbed. The festival became a defining cultural force in heavy music, celebrated for its commitment to a subculture often overlooked by the mainstream.</p>

BT, which owns EE, apologized for the inconvenience and stated that the issue was caused by a technical fault that has now been fixed, with all services returning to normal operation.</p>

          <p>San Francisco's public transit agency, Muni, has wrapped three of its vehicles in tie-dye and paisley designs to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Grateful Dead. The themed buses and train will help transport fans to a series of Dead & Company concerts in Golden Gate Park. City officials, including Mayor Daniel Lurie, hope the celebration will provide a significant economic boost, citing a previous Dead & Company show that generated $31 million for the local economy. The initiative is also seen as a way to promote public transit at a time when Muni is facing a substantial budget deficit despite ridership recovering.</p>

          <p>Intel's second-quarter revenue surpassed Wall Street expectations, but the company also announced significant spending cuts in its chip manufacturing division. New CEO Lip-Bu Tan stated there would be "no more blank checks," canceling planned factory projects in Europe and slowing construction of a new facility in Ohio. This strategic shift aims to address a period of excessive investment without sufficient demand. The company's client computing and data center groups saw mixed results, and Intel plans to reduce its workforce by 15% as part of a broader effort to cut operating expenses and regain market competitiveness.

          <p>The ride-sharing company Lyft is rolling out a new feature that allows riders to designate specific drivers as a "favorite." After a positive ride experience, a user can favorite the driver in the app, and Lyft's system will then prioritize matching them with that driver for future scheduled rides. The company says this function is designed to foster better connections between riders and drivers and give users more control over their experience. For drivers, the feature offers priority access to ride requests from customers who have favorited them, potentially leading to more consistent earnings and relationships.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent surveys indicate that many Americans believe they need around $4 million to retire comfortably, a figure far beyond the actual savings of the vast majority of the population. Federal Reserve data shows that having a net worth of $4 million would place a household in the top 1.5% in the U.S., while the median retirement savings is just $86,900. Financial experts suggest this discrepancy is fueled by anxiety over inflation and longevity, as well as retirement calculators that may overestimate needs. A more realistic target for most people is likely between $1 million and $2 million, supplemented by other income sources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An American woman, Christina Chapman, has been sentenced to over eight years in prison for her part in a sophisticated scheme that provided stolen U.S. identities to North Korean IT workers. Chapman admitted to running "laptop farms" from her home, allowing foreign workers to pose as Americans and secure remote jobs at over 300 U.S. companies. The conspiracy generated an estimated $17 million, which investigators say was funneled back to support North Korea's weapons programs. U.S. officials warned that the plot victimized major corporations and represents a direct threat from an adversary operating from within the country.</p>

In the Midwest's Corn Belt, the heat has been exacerbated by "corn sweat," a process where corn crops release large amounts of water vapor, significantly increasing humidity.

          <p>American Airlines' stock fell sharply after the carrier issued a third-quarter profit forecast that missed expectations and significantly lowered its financial outlook for 2025. The airline now anticipates an adjusted per-share result for 2025 ranging from a 20-cent loss to an 80-cent profit, a steep drop from its initial forecast. CEO Robert Isom attributed the downgrade to a combination of domestic consumer weakness, flat corporate travel demand, and operational disruptions from storms. This follows similar guidance adjustments from other major carriers, indicating a stabilizing but weaker-than-expected travel market. (not investment advice)</p>
