          <p>A severe heatwave across Europe has resulted in at least six deaths in Spain, Italy, and France, with temperatures exceeding 40Â°C (104Â°F). The victims include two farmers caught in a wildfire in Spain and an American child who collapsed at the Palace of Versailles. The UN's climate agency attributes the increasing frequency of such extreme weather to human-induced climate change, noting that both Spain and England recorded their hottest June on record. Authorities in Greece are also battling wildfires, forcing evacuations as the continent grapples with the dangerous and widespread high temperatures.</p>

          <p>House Republican leaders are struggling to gather enough votes to pass the final version of a massive domestic policy bill central to President Trump's agenda. The legislation, which narrowly passed the Senate, faces opposition from both conservative and moderate members of the GOP, who are concerned about changes made in the upper chamber. The White House is actively pressuring holdouts to approve the bill, which includes significant spending on border security and defense, funded by cuts to social programs. A failure to pass the procedural vote would stall the bill and jeopardize its passage before the July 4th deadline.</p>

          <p>A small preliminary study suggests that GLP-1 drugs, widely known for treating diabetes and promoting weight loss, may also be effective in reducing migraines. In the trial, participants receiving daily injections of liraglutide, an earlier GLP-1 medication, experienced a nearly 50% reduction in the number of migraine days per month. The positive effects appeared independent of weight loss, as participants' weight remained stable throughout the 12-week study. While the findings are promising, researchers emphasize the need for larger, controlled trials to confirm the drug's efficacy and explore its mechanism.</p>

This move follows several other rounds of layoffs at the company over the past year, even as Microsoft continues to report strong profits and revenue growth.

          <p>Constellation Brands, the owner of popular beer brands like Modelo and Corona, reported a 2% drop in beer sales, attributing the decline to consumer economic concerns. The company's CEO acknowledged that both Hispanic and non-Hispanic consumers are worried about inflation and their financial stability. Previously, the company had more directly linked sales declines to the concerns of Hispanic consumers, a core demographic, over the Trump administration's hard-line immigration policies and potential job losses. The earnings report highlights how broader economic and political anxieties can directly impact consumer spending habits and corporate revenues.</p>

The government cited the group's increasingly aggressive methods and property damage, including an incident at an RAF base, as meeting the criteria for terrorism.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade deal with Vietnam, which will set a 20% tariff on all Vietnamese imports into the United States. The agreement also imposes a steeper 40% tariff on goods that are transshipped through Vietnam from other countries, a measure aimed at curbing the circumvention of duties, particularly from China. In exchange, the deal grants U.S. products tariff-free access to Vietnamese markets, which Trump highlighted in his announcement. This agreement comes ahead of a looming deadline for the expiration of a temporary pause on broader "reciprocal" tariffs.</p>

          <p>This article, written in Spanish, details the significant impact President Trump's proposed "Big Beautiful Bill" would have on immigrant communities in the U.S. It outlines provisions that would massively expand funding for immigration detention and enforcement, codify the "Remain in Mexico" policy, and increase fees for asylum and residency applications. The legislation also aims to restrict legally present immigrants from accessing Medicaid and other social benefits, while accelerating deportation processes. Immigrant rights organizations have condemned the bill, warning it would destabilize millions of families and eliminate due process protections for vulnerable populations.</p>

The Department of Education informed Congress that the funds, which were scheduled for release on July 1, are under review to ensure they align with the president's priorities. This sudden halt has created uncertainty for school districts, which rely on this money for their annual budgets and are now just weeks away from the new school year.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked a key Trump administration immigration policy that aimed to severely limit access to the U.S. asylum system for migrants crossing the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president's proclamation, issued on his first day in office, overstepped executive authority and that immigration law does not grant the president power to unilaterally supplant the existing asylum process. The ruling is a significant legal setback for the administration's hardline immigration agenda. The judge has delayed the order's effective date for 14 days to allow the government time to appeal the decision.</p>

The lawsuit, widely seen by legal experts as lacking merit, alleged that CBS's editing constituted election interference. The settlement is viewed by critics as a corporate concession to political pressure, potentially to smooth the regulatory approval process for Paramount's sale to a company bankrolled by a Trump ally. This event is part of a broader trend of major media companies settling or altering editorial stances in the face of pressure from the Trump administration.</p>

The project uses the toad's struggle for survival as an allegory for the challenges facing Puerto Rico, such as gentrification, displacement, and cultural erosion. The film depicts a surreal, quieted version of the island where local culture is fading, resonating with audiences facing similar issues globally. By championing the toad and traditional music, the project suggests that cultural pride and expression are powerful forms of resistance against displacement.</p>

          <p>Economists are watching for the potential impact of federal government layoffs on the national labor market, as the June jobs report approaches. Recent data from payroll processor ADP showed an unexpected contraction in private sector hiring, raising concerns about a broader slowdown. This comes as hundreds of thousands of federal workers, laid off as part of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative, are seeking new employment. Analysts note a particular challenge for these job seekers is the weaker demand for white-collar and knowledge-based roles compared to in-person skilled labor positions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The CEO of Planned Parenthood has stated that the organization could lose around $700 million in federal funding if the Republican "Big Beautiful Bill" becomes law. This loss would result from a provision imposing a one-year Medicaid ban on healthcare providers that also offer abortions, a move described by supporters and opponents as a "backdoor abortion ban." The organization warns that this could force the closure of nearly 200 health centers, primarily in states where abortion remains legal, and jeopardize care for over a million patients. The potential cuts would disproportionately affect low-income individuals who rely on Medicaid for their healthcare services.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, a former criminology doctoral student, has pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary in the 2022 stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students. The plea is part of a deal with prosecutors to avoid the death penalty, and he now faces up to four consecutive life sentences without parole. In court, Kohberger admitted his guilt and waived his right to appeal, bringing a conclusion to the case that had garnered intense national interest. The decision was met with mixed reactions from the victims' families, with some expressing relief and others anger over the deal.</p>
