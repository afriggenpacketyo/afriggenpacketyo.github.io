          <p>The Israeli military reported shelling targets in southern Syria after two projectiles were launched from Syrian territory into the Israel-controlled Golan Heights. A group called the Mohammed Deif Brigades, named after a Hamas military leader, claimed responsibility for the attack. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that Syria's leader is directly responsible for the launches, while Syria's foreign ministry has not yet verified the reports. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported explosions in southern Syria, and Israel claims its strikes aim to prevent weapons from reaching Syrian authorities.

          <p>Japanese police have arrested four individuals, including an executive from Daigo Ivory Co., for allegedly selling elephant tusks online as mammoth tusks to circumvent trade restrictions. The company is suspected of annually selling around 100 million yen worth of elephant tusks and ivory products under false pretenses. The suspects have admitted to the allegations, and the case was brought to light following a tip from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.

          <p>Shares of Toyota Industries experienced a significant drop as investors reacted negatively to the Toyota Group's $33 billion deal to take the company private.

The transaction involves a tender offer for shares of Toyota Industries at a price lower than the previous day's closing value. Analysts suggest that this move could signal further unwinding of cross-shareholdings within the Toyota Group, which could have implications for corporate governance and market dynamics in Japan.

Some veterans of the steel industry distrust Trump's rhetoric, citing his inconsistent trade policies and the cyclical nature of the industry.

However, critics contend that this decision reflects the government's own failures in addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

          <p>Karen Read's defense team's choice not to have her testify in her second murder trial is a high-stakes gamble.

The absence of her testimony could be felt when the jury delivers its verdict, potentially influencing the outcome.</p>
