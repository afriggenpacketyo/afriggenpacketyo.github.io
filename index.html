        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Marine Le Pen, leader of France's far-right National Rally party, was found guilty of embezzling EU funds and banned from elections for five years.  The court cited the risk of reoffending and potential public disorder if she were to run for president in 2027.  This ruling significantly impacts her political future, given her recent poll numbers suggesting strong support.  The judge's emphasis on maintaining public order hints at a potential bias against Le Pen and her far-right movement.</p>

          <p>Global markets experienced significant selloffs in anticipation of President Trump's new tariffs, impacting Asian and European indices.  Gold prices surged, reflecting investor concern. The tariffs, set to affect all countries, are expected to raise prices for imported cars and potentially trigger further economic instability.  Trump's dismissal of concerns about the impact on automakers shows a clear bias toward his own narrative and a disregard for potential negative consequences.</p>

          <p>A CNBC survey forecasts weak first-quarter GDP growth (0.3%) due to policy uncertainty and new tariffs. Core PCE inflation is expected to remain high.  Economists express concern that the slow growth could easily lead to a recession, particularly if Trump doesn't backtrack on his tariffs.
