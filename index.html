          <h2>Mike Tyson Advocates for Federal Legalization of Cannabis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 10:36:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boxing legend Mike Tyson has voiced his frustration with the negative discourse surrounding legal cannabis, arguing for its federal legalization. He stated on social media that current laws benefit cartels and human traffickers, and that regulating cannabis like alcohol or cigarettes is a matter of personal freedom for adults. Tyson, a prominent advocate for cannabis reform, has previously written to the White House, urging for the reclassification of marijuana and clemency for nonviolent offenders. He believes federal legalization is essential for both social justice and economic reasons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, announced a significant policy shift, stating that agents will arrest anyone found in the country illegally, not just those with criminal records. This reverses a previous policy and is expected to increase "collateral" arrests during operations. Lyons also affirmed a commitment to cracking down on companies that hire unauthorized workers, framing it as an effort to stop the exploitation of labor. With a major funding increase, the agency is aiming to carry out one million deportations within a year.</p>

          <h2>Former Obama Speechwriter Advocates for 'Neutral Ground' to Bridge Political Divides</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 10:29:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a commentary, former Obama speechwriter David Litt suggests that finding "common ground" in a politically polarized America is increasingly difficult. Instead, he proposes seeking "neutral ground"—shared activities or spaces where people with differing views can connect without focusing on their disagreements. Drawing from his experience learning to surf with his politically opposite brother-in-law, Litt argues that these neutral spaces foster friendships and can lead to more genuine discussions. He believes this approach is more effective at bridging divides than directly debating contentious issues.</p>

          <p>During a curtain call for the opera 'Il trovatore' at London's Royal Opera House, a cast member unfurled a large Palestinian flag, prompting a brief scuffle with a stage official who tried to remove it. The unauthorized protest occurred on the closing night of the performance, drawing a mixed reaction of cheers and boos from the audience. The Royal Opera House issued a statement condemning the act as "completely inappropriate" and contrary to its commitment to political impartiality.

          <p>Exit polls from Japan's upper house election indicate that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition is set to lose its majority, a significant political blow. Public frustration over rising prices, political scandals, and trade negotiations with the United States fueled the electoral setback. Despite the projected loss, which historically leads to a prime minister's resignation, Ishiba has vowed to remain in office to manage critical tariff negotiations with the U.S. The result introduces a period of political instability as the government will now lack control of both houses of parliament.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has shifted his political strategy, abandoning a more diplomatic approach for a combative and aggressive one, particularly on social media. This change involves using confrontational language and memes to directly challenge President Trump and his administration's policies, a tactic his advisors say is necessary to fight back against perceived bullying and misinformation. While the approach has boosted Newsom's online engagement and national profile, it has also drawn criticism for mirroring the divisive tactics of his opponents. The strategy marks a significant pivot for the potential 2028 presidential candidate.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill to teach a child for lifelong success is self-connection—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. Raouda argues that common parenting phrases like "you're okay" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings, leading to anxiety and insecurity. To foster self-connection, she advises parents to validate emotions, welcome all aspects of a child's personality, and model their own emotional regulation. This approach helps build emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence.</p>

With the rise of the "over-employed" holding multiple jobs, the gig economy, and remote work, focusing on "jobs" is misleading. The author proposes shifting the focus to measuring income, suggesting a new metric that tracks the percentage of the working-age population earning above a certain inflation-adjusted threshold from all sources. This approach would provide a more relevant picture of economic well-being in a rapidly changing work landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new CBS News poll reveals that public support for President Trump's mass deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the policy. This shift corresponds with a growing perception that the program is not prioritizing dangerous criminals and is deporting more people than expected. Approval has become concentrated within the Republican and MAGA base, while Hispanic Americans' approval has dropped significantly. The poll suggests that despite views that border crossings have been reduced, the administration's hardline deportation tactics are becoming a political liability. (not investment advice)</p>

A primary driver appears to be the high cost of living, as many of the cities with the highest departures are in states like California and New York, where over $1 million is needed for a comfortable retirement.

          <p>This article explores the growing fear among the 25 million naturalized U.S. citizens following the Department of Justice's prioritization of denaturalization cases. The author, a naturalized citizen, reflects on how the distinction between natural-born and naturalized citizens is being exploited, creating uncertainty about the permanence of their rights. The administration's rhetoric and policies, which could target individuals for their political views, are seen as a threat to constitutional protections. This creates a chilling effect on free speech and political participation for millions of Americans who were not born in the country.</p>

The wreck was discovered near the island of Nosy Boraha off Madagascar, a known pirate hideout.

This trend of "permanent capital" is distinct from speculative retail trading and could create a significant supply shock.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that recent U.S. trade deals with Southeast Asian nations signal a strategic shift away from partnership and towards a "rent-seeking" or "fee for access" model. Instead of fostering mutual growth and integration, Washington is allegedly monetizing access to its market by imposing higher tariffs and mandatory purchases on ASEAN members. The author contends that this transactional approach undermines the region's sovereignty and competitiveness. It scores short-term political points for the U.S. but harms the long-term strategic relationship with a key economic bloc. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new workplace term, "quiet cracking," has been coined to describe a state of persistent burnout, stagnation, and disengagement that differs from "quiet quitting." This phenomenon affects employees who may still like their work but feel unappreciated and see no path for career advancement, leading to a gradual decline in performance. Research indicates that one in five employees experiences this frequently, costing the global economy trillions in lost productivity. Experts suggest that employers can combat this by providing recognition, managing workloads, and offering clear opportunities for learning and growth.</p>

The released documents reveal the APF's efforts to lobby city council members to block a public referendum on the project.

          <p>Critics and scientists are warning that the Trump administration's aggressive push for fossil fuels is setting back environmental progress by decades. In just six months, the administration has used a declared national energy emergency to expand oil, gas, and coal production while cutting support for green energy and shuttering climate research labs. These actions, which include gutting tax credits for wind and solar, are occurring alongside an increase in climate-related disasters. Scholars argue the policies are not economically sound but serve to benefit fossil-fuel industry allies and deny the reality of climate change.</p>
