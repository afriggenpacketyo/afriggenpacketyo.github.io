          <p>Former President Donald Trump has strongly criticized the trade relationship between the United States and India, labeling it a "totally one sided disaster." In a social media post, he claimed that India's high tariffs prevent American businesses from selling their goods in the country, while India exports massive quantities to the U.S. This statement followed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. Trump's comments highlight ongoing trade tensions and his administration's previous actions, including imposing significant tariffs on Indian exports in response to failed trade deal negotiations.

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a long-serving Democrat from New York, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, emphasizing the need for "generational change" within the party. In an interview, the 78-year-old congressman stated that his decision was influenced by observing the political landscape and believing a younger successor could better address current challenges, particularly the rise of what he termed "incipient fascism." Nadler, who was first elected in 1992, has had a prominent career, including chairing the House Judiciary Committee and serving as an impeachment manager during Donald Trump's first impeachment trial.</p>

          <p>Chinese state media has suggested that new, improved versions of its hypersonic missiles, the YJ-21 and DF-17, may be featured in the upcoming Victory Day parade in Beijing. A military commentator on the state broadcaster CCTV discussed the potential debut of an air-launched variant of the YJ-21, highlighting its capability to strike targets from outside enemy air defense zones. This development points toward China's strategy of creating a versatile family of hypersonic weapons that can be launched from land, sea, and air platforms. While satellite imagery has suggested ongoing development, China has not officially confirmed the missile is in service.</p>

          <p>Most stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region posted gains as investors evaluated the outcomes of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Tianjin. Market sentiment remains cautious due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariff policies, particularly after a federal appeals court ruled many of President Trump's tariffs illegal. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi both saw increases, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined slightly.

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has arrived in China by train to attend a military parade commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. He will be joined by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, marking the first time the three leaders, often viewed as adversaries by the U.S., will gather at the same event. The visit is Kim's first to China since 2019 and comes amid deepening ties between North Korea and Russia, including Pyongyang's support for Russia's war in Ukraine. The summit provides a potential opportunity for bilateral or trilateral meetings to discuss their strategic alignment.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered new evidence that may solve the nearly 50-year-old mystery of the disappearance of revered Lebanese Shia cleric Musa al-Sadr. Using advanced facial recognition technology, researchers at Bradford University analyzed a photo of a corpse found in a secret Libyan mortuary in 2011. The algorithm determined a high probability that the body is Sadr, who vanished in Libya in 1978 after being invited to meet with then-leader Muammar Gaddafi. The body showed signs of execution, supporting theories that he was murdered, possibly to prevent his moderate influence on the impending Iranian revolution.</p>

          <p>An opinion article raises concerns among some Anglo-American intellectuals that their own countries are beginning to resemble the Soviet Union in its final years. The analysis points to a perceived political rigidity, fear of questioning established dogma, and a managerial class that seems to ignore impending change, drawing direct parallels to the USSR in the early 1980s. The piece suggests that while a full collapse is not necessarily imminent, the mere decline of Western influence and stability could have significant global consequences. This analogy serves as a warning about institutional stagnation and the potential for historical patterns to repeat in unexpected ways.</p>

In a tour of the estate, she demonstrated numerous obstacles, from hard-to-use doorknobs to a lack of accessible toilets near committee rooms and the inaccessible design of the Commons Chamber itself. Tidball argues that these physical and procedural barriers make it difficult for disabled individuals to work in or even visit Parliament, undermining the principle that the institution should reflect the 22% of the voting-age population with disabilities.

For over a century, the lodge has hosted millions of visitors, including presidents and royalty, and has survived natural disasters like earthquakes and wildfires.

This success has afforded him new creative freedom, which he channeled into his latest album, "A Wonderful Life."

The change follows a recent controversy where the government blocked council guidance that would have advised judges to consider the background of offenders from certain minority groups.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced his intention to award Rudy Giuliani the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. The announcement came two days after Giuliani, a longtime political ally and former New York City mayor, was seriously injured in a car crash. Trump praised Giuliani as a "great American Patriot" and the greatest mayor in New York's history. This decision places the prestigious award on a figure who, after being celebrated for his leadership following 9/11, faced disbarment and criminal charges for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.</p>

          <p>A new study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, to at least 286,000 years old. Using advanced uranium-series dating techniques, an international team of researchers placed the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era, resolving decades of conflicting age estimates. The fossil, often attributed to the species Homo heidelbergensis, displays features distinct from both Neanderthals and modern humans. This new, reliable dating strengthens the theory that this more primitive human population coexisted with early Neanderthals, adding complexity to our understanding of Europe's prehistoric human landscape.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" for the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, to be visible across much of the United Kingdom in the coming days. The increased visibility is due to a fast-moving coronal mass ejection from the sun, which could push the celestial display further south than is typical. While cloud cover and light pollution will affect viewing conditions, those in areas with clear, dark skies, particularly in the Midlands and northern regions, might witness the rare phenomenon. The best opportunity for a sighting is expected on Monday night, with possibilities continuing into Tuesday.</p>

          <p>In a rare joint statement, nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have publicly criticized Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., accusing him of undermining the nation's health security. The op-ed, published in The New York Times, claims Kennedy's actions—including firing the new CDC director, canceling mRNA vaccine research, and replacing expert advisory committees—are dismantling the U.S. vaccine system and leaving the country vulnerable. The bipartisan group of former leaders, whose tenures span from the Carter to the Trump administrations, called on Congress to exercise its oversight authority.</p>

          <p>The recent high-profile transfers of Alexander Isak and Yoane Wissa, both of whom publicly pushed for moves and refused to train, have ignited a debate about player power in modern football. While some pundits have condemned the players' actions as disrespectful, others argue that clubs often act with similar self-interest, making their criticism hypocritical. The article contrasts their successful transfers with the case of Marc Guehi, who remained professional but saw his desired move to Liverpool collapse. This raises questions about whether forcing a move has become a necessary, albeit controversial, tactic for players seeking to control their careers.</p>

          <p>Despite a year of unprecedented achievements for a player his age, questions remain about Novak Djokovic's physical durability as he advances in the US Open. At 38, he has become the oldest man in the Open Era to reach the quarterfinals of all four Grand Slams in a single year. However, his journey has been marked by various physical issues, requiring trainer attention for his neck, shoulder, and back. This analysis explores whether his aging body can withstand the grueling demands of best-of-five-set matches against top-tier opponents, a challenge that has hampered him in previous majors this season.</p>

          <p>Thousands of union members participated in Labor Day rallies and marches across the country, with many speakers directing sharp criticism at the Trump administration. At a large event in Wilmington, California, organizers and politicians argued that the administration's actions, including immigration raids and policies weakening collective bargaining rights for federal workers, are actively harming American workers. They framed the fight for workers' rights as being inseparable from the fight for immigrant rights. In contrast, a White House proclamation for the holiday stated that President Trump's policies are reversing decades of neglect and putting American workers first.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite repeated threats to punish Russia for its ongoing war in Ukraine, President Donald Trump has held back on imposing severe new sanctions, a strategy analysts believe is linked to China. According to experts, Trump is hesitant for two main reasons: he still hopes to broker a peace deal and is concerned that further isolating Russia would push it into a deeper strategic alliance with China. A stronger Sino-Russian partnership could grant Beijing greater access to energy resources, military technology, and Arctic territories, which Washington officials want to avoid. This strategic calculation has led to a standstill, frustrating Ukrainian hopes for increased pressure on Moscow. (not investment advice)</p>

The deal for the 22-year-old Elliott includes a £35 million obligation to buy, with Liverpool retaining a buy-back clause. Meanwhile, Villa will cover at least 80% of Sancho's significant wages, providing the 25-year-old forward a chance to revitalize his Premier League career under manager Unai Emery.
