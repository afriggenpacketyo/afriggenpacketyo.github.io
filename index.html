        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party has pledged to fully reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and abolish the two-child benefit cap if they gain power, aiming to distinguish themselves from Labour. These commitments, set to be revealed at a press conference, follow pressure on Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to alter his stance on these policies. Reform UK intends to fund these initiatives by reducing net-zero projects and eliminating hotels for asylum seekers. The move seeks to capitalize on divisions within the Labour party regarding these social welfare measures.</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges are causing distress at the World Exposition in Osaka, Japan, with visitors cringing and expressing concerns about potential health issues. The small flies have been found on walls and pillars of the Grand Ring, forcing people to swat them away to avoid swallowing them. While the midges don't bite, dead ones can cause allergic reactions if inhaled, prompting health advisories. Expo organizers are spraying insecticide, treating rainwater accumulation areas, and installing insect repellent lights to combat the problem, while Osaka Gov.

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author, journalist, and activist whose book ‚ÄúAgainst Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault‚Äù reshaped the modern understanding of sexual assault, has died at 90. Published in 1975, the book argued that sexual assault was a crime of power and violence, not passion, influencing legal reforms and the establishment of rape-crisis centers. Brownmiller's work faced criticism for its sweeping generalizations and perceived anti-male bias. Despite the controversies, her book remains a landmark contribution to feminist thought and legal reform.</p>

NPH occurs when cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain, causing walking difficulties, cognitive symptoms, and urinary incontinence. The condition is treatable with surgery, which involves inserting a shunt to drain excess fluid, and early diagnosis is crucial for better outcomes.</p>

          <p>Aspiring drivers are finding it increasingly difficult to afford driving lessons as prices rise alongside the cost of living. Driving instructors cite increased expenses like car costs, fuel, and insurance as reasons for higher rates. A survey shows that most instructors now charge between ¬£36 and ¬£40 per hour, with some exceeding ¬£40. The practical test backlog also forces learners to take more lessons to maintain their skills, adding to the financial burden. Some learners are delaying or avoiding lessons altogether due to the high costs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government's decision to prioritize white South African refugees, or Afrikaners, has drawn criticism for perceived unfairness compared to other refugees in limbo. President Trump signed an executive order opening refugee pathways exclusively to Afrikaners, claiming they are victims of racial discrimination, a claim echoed by Elon Musk. This move contrasts sharply with the stricter policies impacting other refugees, including those from the Democratic Republic of Congo, who have waited years for resettlement. Refugee advocacy groups argue that protection should be based on credible evidence of persecution, ensuring equal treatment under the law.</p>

Le Scouarnec has admitted to raping or sexually assaulting 299 people, mostly children, between 1998 and 2014. Victims are forming campaign groups to pressure authorities, accusing the government of ignoring a "landmark" case that exposed institutional failures. The trial is drawing comparisons to the Pelicot case, but without a single recognizable figure, it has failed to capture the public's imagination, prompting questions about France's attitude toward child abuse.</p>
