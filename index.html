          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite experienced significant declines on Friday, reacting to a weaker-than-expected July jobs report and the Trump administration's unveiling of new tariffs. Employers added only 73,000 jobs, with previous months' figures also revised downward by a combined 258,000, signaling a clear slowdown in hiring. These economic indicators, coupled with new tariffs reaching up to 40% on imports from over 60 countries, have intensified investor concerns. The market's reaction suggests increased expectations for the Federal Reserve to consider an interest rate cut in September, with the likelihood estimated around 80%. (not investment advice)</p>

This successful public offering marks a significant moment for the tech sector after an extended IPO drought, following other recent debuts like CoreWeave and Hinge Health. Figma, founded in 2012, almost had a very different story when a $20 billion acquisition by Adobe fell through in 2023 due to concerns from UK regulators about competition.

          <p>The English Football League (EFL) is increasingly concerned about Sheffield Wednesday's financial stability, raising doubts about their ability to fulfill Championship fixtures. The club, under owner Dejphon Chansiri, faces a deepening crisis marked by late payments to HMRC, players, and staff, alongside rising debts. This instability has led to the departure of multiple first-team players and manager Danny Rohl, leaving the squad with only 14 players ahead of the August 10 season kick-off. Additionally, the club faces a transfer embargo and has closed part of its stadium due to safety concerns, highlighting the severe operational challenges.</p>

          <p>Florida emergency officials released a heavily redacted 33-page draft plan for evacuating the "Alligator Alcatraz" migrant detention center during a hurricane, sparking demands for transparency from lawmakers and advocates. Significant portions, including alternate evacuation facilities and vendor procedures, were blacked out, leaving critical questions unanswered. While Governor Ron DeSantis stated the facility can withstand Category 2 hurricane winds, critics, including Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, expressed distrust and called for a clear, confirmed plan from the Florida Division of Emergency Management and ICE. The ongoing lack of transparency raises significant concerns for the safety and well-being of detainees during extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>Eight children and an adult attending a summer camp at Stathern Lodge in Leicestershire, UK, fell ill from suspected poisoning, leading to the arrest of a 76-year-old man. All patients have since been discharged from the hospital, thankfully. Residents described "crazy" and "stressed" scenes at a nearby village hall that was used as a makeshift triage center, with parents reportedly frustrated about not being able to see their children. Police are actively investigating how the incident occurred and have referred themselves to the Independent Office for Police Conduct regarding their initial handling of the report. The arrested man is being questioned on suspicion of administering poison with intent to injure.</p>

          <p>Sudan is facing heightened fears of fragmentation after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) announced a "Transitional Peace Government" in Darfur, claiming jurisdiction over the entire country. This move has been swiftly rejected by the internationally recognized government and condemned by the African Union and the United Nations, who warn it will complicate efforts to end the ongoing war. Analysts suggest the RSF aims to gain political legitimacy and force its way into international discussions, even as fighting intensifies and the country grapples with the world's largest humanitarian crisis, with 12 million displaced and over 150,000 deaths. Both warring parties continue to face accusations of war crimes and human rights violations, with the RSF specifically accused of genocide and widespread sexual assault.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has named Storm Floris, the sixth named storm of the season and the first since January, forecasting strong winds and heavy rain for the UK on Monday. Current predictions indicate wind gusts of 60-70mph in some areas, potentially reaching 85mph on exposed Scottish coasts, with inland areas seeing 40-50mph. Such wind speeds during summer, when trees are in full leaf, are likely to cause travel disruption, damage temporary structures, and lead to power cuts. Heavy rain and potential flooding pose additional hazards, though named August storms are not unprecedented, with several notable examples in recent years.</p>

Meanwhile, Islamist parties, emboldened by the lifting of a ban, are increasing their visibility and pushing demands against progressive reforms.

          <p>Moderna announced a reduction in the high end of its 2025 revenue outlook, now expecting between $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion, primarily due to a delay in vaccine shipments to the United Kingdom. Despite this adjustment, the biotech company exceeded Wall Street's expectations for its second-quarter earnings, reporting a smaller loss per share and higher revenue than anticipated. This positive financial performance was attributed to significant cost-cutting measures, including a recent decision to slash 10% of its workforce, as Moderna navigates declining Covid vaccine sales and seeks to diversify its product portfolio. The shift in vaccine delivery dates affects the timing of revenue recognition rather than the overall contract value.</p>

          <p>A recent investigation has revealed that the self-proclaimed millionaire CEO of the Calexit campaign, Mitchell, is a convicted fraudster with a history of financial deceit and dubious claims. Marcus Evans, the campaign's founder, announced Mitchell's leadership as a major boost for the California independence movement, which seeks a ballot initiative for secession. However, Mitchell's companies reportedly have minimal assets, his titles are questionable, and he has a record of personal and company bankruptcies, along with criminal convictions for identity theft and forgery. Despite knowing his background, Evans maintains confidence in Mitchell, who appears to be using the campaign to inflate his own business ventures.</p>

          <p>An eight-year-old boy was sexually assaulted while sleeping in his tent at the Loch Ness Bay campsite in Drumnadrochit, Scotland. Police Scotland confirmed that one of the boy's parents, who were in a nearby tent, became aware of the incident and saw the suspect leaving the area, providing a description. The suspect is described as a white male, aged 35 to 50, approximately 5ft 10ins tall, and bald on top. Authorities describe the incident as "hugely traumatizing" for the child and his family, who were tourists, and "naturally worrying" for the local community. A dedicated team of officers is actively investigating this unusual occurrence.</p>

          <p>Qatar is threatening to halt liquefied natural gas (LNG) deliveries to Europe, including a key deal with Germany, in response to the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD). Qatar argues the directive's requirements for scrutinizing supply chains for human rights and environmental issues, along with its climate protection rules and potential high fines, conflict with its national energy strategy and pose a risk to state-owned QatarEnergy. Analysts suggest Qatar is leveraging a tight global LNG market and Europe's post-Ukraine energy vulnerability to push for an exemption, potentially redirecting its substantial gas exports to less regulated Asian markets.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates, despite a significant 23% decline in net income compared to the previous year, primarily due to lower global oil prices. The oil major achieved its highest production output for a second quarter in over 25 years, driven by record production in the Permian Basin and Guyana, which helped soften the impact of reduced prices. Exxon's refining business also saw a substantial increase in earnings. The company continues to return significant capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, remaining on track to buy back $20 billion in shares this year.</p>

          <p>Hasan Piker, a prominent progressive political commentator online, discussed his appeal to young men, being dubbed a "himbo gateway drug to leftist thought," and the dynamics of "bro culture." Piker challenged the notion that masculinity or certain hobbies are inherently conservative, arguing that right-wing actors often brand apolitical spaces as such. He asserted that the Democratic Party's problems stem from a lack of effective policy, not the absence of a "Joe Rogan of the left," citing New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's success through clear policy platforms. Piker also observed a growing ideological investment in far-right and fascist ideas among young conservatives.</p>

While Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the cloud market leader, its 18% growth trailed rivals, prompting CEO Andy Jassy to defend AWS's position and security.
