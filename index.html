          <p>Anutin Charnvirakul has officially taken office as Thailand's new prime minister, following a royal endorsement from King Maha Vajiralongkorn. His rise to power marks a shift from the long-dominant Shinawatra political dynasty, whose most recent leader, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, was dismissed by a court order. Anutin, previously known for championing cannabis decriminalization, secured the position after forming a new coalition government with support from the main opposition party. His term begins ahead of elections planned for early next year, signaling a significant change in the country's political landscape.</p>

          <p>Russia has launched its largest aerial assault on Ukraine since the war began, utilizing over 800 drones, decoys, and missiles. The attack targeted multiple cities, including Kyiv, where the main cabinet of ministers building was damaged for the first time, signaling a potential escalation in targeting strategy. Ukrainian officials reported at least two fatalities, including a one-year-old child, and numerous injuries across the country. Ukraine's air force successfully intercepted a majority of the munitions, but the scale of the strike has prompted renewed calls for stronger international sanctions against Russia.</p>

          <p>Quarterback Aaron Rodgers is scheduled to make his debut for the Pittsburgh Steelers in a highly anticipated game against the New York Jets, the team that recently released him. This matchup is laden with narrative, as it takes place at the same stadium where Rodgers suffered a season-ending Achilles injury just four plays into his Jets career two years ago. That moment is remembered as one of the most devastating in the franchise's history, derailing a season filled with high expectations. The game offers a chance for closure for both Rodgers and the significantly overhauled Jets team, now led by new quarterback Justin Fields.</p>

          <p>The US Open has evolved from a traditional tennis tournament into a major cultural and commercial event, drawing comparisons to festivals like Coachella. The article argues that the experience is now heavily defined by consumption, with high-priced novelty cocktails, celebrity appearances, and influencer marketing becoming central to its identity. This transformation is driven by a strategy to capture the attention economy, expanding the event's duration and investing heavily in luxury infrastructure and celebrity management. While this "Coachella-fication" has made the tournament a massive commercial success, it also raises questions about its accessibility for traditional fans.</p>

          <p>London is experiencing its first major Tube strike since March 2023, as members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union begin a five-day walkout. The rolling industrial action is expected to cause significant disruption, with little to no service on most lines from Monday to Thursday. The union is demanding a pay increase and a reduction of the work week to 32 hours, citing concerns over fatigue management. Transport for London has offered a 3.4% pay rise but rejected the proposed reduction in hours, stating it is not affordable or practical.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected bomber who was on the FBI's most wanted list, is facing an extradition hearing in London after being a fugitive for 21 years. He is the prime suspect in two bombings in California in 2003, which were claimed by an animal rights extremist group. San Diego, who had a $250,000 bounty on his head, disappeared after a high-speed chase in 2003 and was discovered living under an alias in a cottage in Wales last year. Former FBI agents involved in the original case have suggested there were "missed opportunities" to arrest him before he vanished.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is accelerating the development of a new fleet of low-cost, long-range attack drones as part of a "high-low" strategy to counter mainland China's military arsenal. This initiative, in collaboration with US firm Kratos, aims to create affordable alternatives to expensive cruise missiles. The new "suicide drones" are reported to have a range of at least 1,000 km, enabling them to strike deep into mainland China, including major cities. This move reflects a strategic shift towards asymmetric warfare capabilities and deepening technological cooperation between Taipei and Washington to enhance Taiwan's defensive posture.</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse is set to occur, creating a "Blood Moon" effect as the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow. Sky-watchers in the UK will be able to witness the event as the Moon rises, with the best views in the eastern parts of the country. The reddish hue is caused by sunlight refracting through the Earth's atmosphere, a phenomenon known as Rayleigh scattering. Unlike a solar eclipse, this celestial event is safe to view directly without special equipment, and astronomers encourage people to find a clear view of the horizon to observe the spectacle.</p>

The author points to examples like France's Emmanuel Macron and India's Narendra Modi, whose efforts to build personal relationships with Trump yielded few long-term benefits. The piece criticizes Starmer's "Trump-whisperer" strategy ahead of an upcoming state visit, suggesting it has produced little for the UK while damaging its reputation. The author contends that resistance and firmness, as shown by leaders like Brazil's Lula da Silva, are more effective tactics for dealing with Trump's approach to foreign policy.</p>

The process, known as cavitation, is triggered by using a laser to rapidly heat light-absorbing materials on a wet surface, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles. When these bubbles collapse, they release a powerful burst of energy capable of launching the tiny jumpers up to 1.5 meters high. This technique provides a new, controllable mechanism for powering micro-robots, potentially enabling them to jump or even swim.</p>
