          <p>Hamas announced it will release Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander as a goodwill gesture to facilitate a ceasefire agreement and humanitarian aid entry into Gaza, ahead of President Trump's visit to the Middle East. Alexander, captured during the October 2023 attack, is believed to be the last living US citizen hostage. Negotiations between Hamas and US officials in Qatar are ongoing, with a temporary halt to Israeli military activity required for the handover. The Families and Missing Families Forum campaign group expressed hope that Alexander's release would lead to a comprehensive agreement securing freedom for all remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>Negotiating teams from the US and China concluded two days of trade talks in Switzerland, both sides expressing optimism amid ongoing tensions between the two economic giants. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted "substantial progress," while Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng emphasized the importance of dialogue in resolving differences and a new consultation mechanism involving senior officials. While investors are likely to react positively, businesses are awaiting more detailed information before making decisions, as significant friction points remain and the situation is far from resolved. Dmitry Grozoubinski cautions against over-optimism, suggesting the agreement may only cover the scope of future discussions.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Hamas would release Edan Alexander, the last living American hostage held since October 2023. Trump expressed gratitude to mediators Qatar and Egypt, hoping this marks a step towards ending the conflict and returning all hostages. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum Headquarters emphasized that Alexander's release should initiate a comprehensive agreement for all remaining hostages' freedom.

          <p>CVS Caremark's decision to stop covering Zepbound in favor of Wegovy, despite research showing Zepbound's superior weight loss results, has sparked controversy. The move, driven by secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), will force many Americans to switch to a less effective medication. This decision has upset patients and doctors, raising concerns about the ability to tailor prescriptions to individual needs. While Caremark claims the change will lower drug prices, critics argue that it prioritizes profits over patient well-being, echoing previous instances where PBM exclusions disrupted treatments and sparked patient outrage.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration offered refugee status to 49 white South Africans, marking the first relocation under a new program accusing South Africa's government of racial discrimination. The South African government denies these claims, asserting that Afrikaners are not persecuted. Refugee groups question prioritizing this group over those from war-torn countries. The Trump administration cites affirmative action laws and land expropriation as racist policies, while South Africa insists Afrikaners are economically privileged and no land has been expropriated. This move has drawn criticism and raised questions about the administration's approach to refugee resettlement.</p>

          <p>A direct comparison of weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Wegovy, shows Mounjaro to be more effective. The trial showed a 20% weight reduction with Mounjaro compared to 14% with Wegovy after 72 weeks. Researchers indicate both drugs have their place, but Mounjaro might better serve those needing to lose more weight. Both drugs work by tricking the brain into feeling full, but Mounjaro flips two appetite switches compared to Wegovy's single switch. The drugs are available through specialist services and privately, with UK sales of tirzepatide (Mounjaro) now exceeding semaglutide (Wegovy).</p>

          <p>Jeanine Pirro's nomination as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia has triggered varied responses, following the collapse of Edward Martin's nomination. While Democrats criticize Pirro's past promotion of election conspiracy theories, some find her less concerning than Martin, a "Stop the Steal" advocate. Martin's nomination was seen as an attempt to rewrite January 6 history, and his replacement by Pirro is viewed as a step forward by some. Pirro, a former judge and prosecutor, will face the challenge of shifting from her provocative TV persona to upholding Justice Department traditions in a role overseeing a wide range of federal and local cases.</p>

The screwworm, a parasite fatal to warm-blooded animals, has shown an "unacceptable northward advancement," prompting the action.

          <p>Hamas announced it would release Edan Alexander, the last living American citizen held captive in Gaza, before President Trump's visit to the Middle East. The announcement comes after talks with the United States, but the timing and mechanism of the release remain unclear. Alexander, an Israeli American dual citizen, was abducted during the October 7, 2023, attack. The move is seen as a goodwill gesture amid ongoing war in Gaza. Mr. Alexander’s family has urged the Israeli government to negotiate the release of the remaining captives.</p>

The technology sends wireless signals from the brain to the healthy part of the spinal cord, bypassing the injury.

Spinal cord stimulation may also show promise in helping people with Parkinson's Disease regain mobility.
