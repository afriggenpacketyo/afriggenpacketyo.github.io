          <p>Counting has begun in the Republic of Ireland's presidential election to choose a successor for President Michael D. Higgins. The main contenders are independent politician Catherine Connolly, supported by several left-wing parties, and Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys. A third candidate, Jim Gavin, remains on the ballot despite withdrawing, with votes for him being transferred. Early indications suggest a potentially low voter turnout, and the final result is expected to be announced later in the evening from Dublin Castle.</p>

          <p>Public and political pressure is mounting on the US Justice Department to release all unredacted files related to Jeffrey Epstein, reigniting scrutiny of President Donald Trump's past friendship with the convicted sex offender. Survivors of Epstein's abuse are demanding full transparency and accountability for all involved in his sex trafficking network. Despite bipartisan support for the Epstein Files Transparency Act, progress is stalled by the government shutdown. The recent posthumous publication of a memoir by survivor Virginia Roberts Giuffre has further fueled speculation about who was on Epstein's client list.</p>

          <p>A large-scale police operation is in progress to locate Hadush Kebatu, an asylum seeker who was mistakenly released from HMP Chelmsford. Kebatu had been jailed for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl and a woman and was scheduled for deportation. The erroneous release has drawn sharp criticism from political figures, with Justice Secretary David Lammy expressing his outrage and confirming Kebatu is believed to be in London. The incident has highlighted systemic issues within the UK's prison system, prompting calls for a public inquiry into how such a serious error could occur.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has accused the United States of "fabricating a new war" after the Pentagon deployed the USS Gerald R Ford, the world's largest warship, to the Caribbean. The move significantly increases US military presence in the region, ostensibly as part of an anti-drug trafficking operation. However, given that the US does not recognize Maduro's legitimacy and President Trump has previously mentioned potential "land action," there are widespread fears in Venezuela that the build-up is a precursor to a regime-change effort. The deployment follows several US air strikes on vessels in the area, which have drawn regional condemnation.</p>

          <p>Angel investor Carles Reina has revealed he decided to back AI voice startup ElevenLabs after just a 30-minute meeting with co-founder Mati Staniszewski in 2022, long before the company achieved its multi-billion dollar valuation. Reina, who now works for the company, specializes in pre-seed investments, focusing on industries overlooked by others and founders with deep technical expertise. He was impressed by Staniszewski's vision to solve the problem of robotic-sounding AI voices, a key issue that had limited the technology's adoption. ElevenLabs has since grown significantly and is now planning a global expansion and a potential IPO.</p>

          <p>As he began a five-day tour of Asia, President Donald Trump stated he would be open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for the first time since 2019. The trip includes stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, where he is scheduled to attend the APEC summit and hold crucial trade talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The primary goal of the meeting with Xi is to de-escalate the ongoing trade war between the two economic superpowers. While US officials have downplayed the likelihood of a meeting with Kim, Trump's remarks have fueled speculation about a potential diplomatic development on the Korean peninsula.</p>

          <p>Following the Los Angeles Dodgers' 11-4 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 1 of the World Series, analysts and players are debating whether a seven-day layoff was a factor. The extended break, which came after sweeping the NLCS, may have disrupted the team's rhythm, a historical trend that has seen rested teams struggle in the championship series. Pitchers Blake Snell and Emmet Sheehan, who both had long breaks between appearances, struggled significantly on the mound.

While his "shock therapy" has curbed hyperinflation and achieved a budget surplus, it has also led to widespread business closures, a significant drop in purchasing power, and rising unemployment. Defections from his own party and plummeting approval ratings signal growing disillusionment, even as he seeks a $20 billion financial package from the US.

The ad, which features former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs, prompted Trump to halt trade negotiations with Canada. Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced the ad would be paused on Monday to allow talks to resume but confirmed it would air over the weekend.

The discussions aim to de-escalate the trade war that has intensified in recent months, rattling global financial markets and disrupting supply chains. This meeting marks the fifth face-to-face engagement between the lead negotiators as both sides seek a path to resolve their deep-seated economic disputes.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Pew Research Center reveals that the Latino population in the United States has grown to 68 million, nearly doubling since the year 2000. This demographic now constitutes one in five Americans and has accounted for more than half of the country's total population growth in the last 25 years. The report highlights that Latinos are the youngest major ethnic group, with a median age of 31, and that a large majority (79%) are U.S. citizens. California and Texas are home to the largest Latino populations, with people of Mexican origin representing the largest subgroup nationwide.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement officers discharged their weapons at a U-Haul truck that was reversing toward them outside the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, California. The incident occurred during a day-long protest against a planned immigration enforcement surge in the Bay Area, which was later canceled. According to the Coast Guard, the driver failed to comply with verbal commands to stop, posing a direct threat to personnel. The driver was wounded, and two individuals sustained non-life-threatening injuries in the confrontation. The protest had earlier seen clashes where flash bangs and smoke grenades were used to disperse demonstrators.</p>

          <p>The Royal Household Bureau of Thailand has announced the death of Queen Mother Sirikit at the age of 93. The former queen, who was the wife of the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej and mother of the current King Vajiralongkorn, passed away in a Bangkok hospital following a blood infection. She had been a prominent public figure for much of her nearly seven-decade marriage but had withdrawn from public life in recent years due to poor health. Revered as the "Mother of the Thai Nation," her birthday, August 12, is celebrated annually as National Mother's Day in Thailand.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines and Aeromexico have asked a U.S. appeals court to block a Trump administration order that would force them to dissolve their joint venture by January 1. The U.S. Department of Transportation mandated the termination of the nine-year-old partnership, citing anti-competitive effects in the U.S.-Mexico flight market. The airlines argue the order is "arbitrary and capricious," warning that it will cause severe operational disruptions, lead to the cancellation of up to two dozen routes, and eliminate significant consumer benefits. They contend their market share is competitive and that the DOT is holding their venture to an unfairly strict standard.</p>
