          <p>Circle's stock experienced a significant increase after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Coinbase shares also saw a rise, as the company earns revenue from interest on Circle's USDC reserves. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, are gaining traction due to potential for faster and cheaper payments, with companies like Amazon and Walmart exploring their use. The GENIUS Act aims to enhance consumer protections and promote the use of blockchains for dollar transactions, which could lead to broader adoption of cryptocurrencies. Optimism is building around the potential for regulatory clarity and innovation in the stablecoin market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed a new national priority voucher plan aimed at significantly reducing drug review times, potentially to as little as one to two months, for companies supporting U.S. national interests. This initiative is designed to accelerate the availability of cures and treatments to the American public by allowing companies to submit drug applications before final clinical trial results are available. The FDA plans to grant a limited number of vouchers to companies addressing health crises, delivering innovative cures, meeting public health needs, and increasing domestic drug manufacturing. While analysts see the plan as positive for the pharmaceutical industry, concerns remain about the potential risks of expedited reviews and political influence. The new program aims to address inefficiencies and encourage domestic drug manufacturing.</p>

The capital increase, along with a debt refinancing plan, will support Eutelsat's investment in its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities for business-to-business and business-to-government operations. Following the move, the French state will become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, followed by India's Bharti Space Limited.

          <p>Authorities in southern Mexico are assessing the damage from Hurricane Erick, which made landfall as a Category 3 storm, resulting in at least two deaths and widespread disruption. The storm caused landslides, blocked highways, and downed power lines, affecting coastal residents, particularly in Acapulco. Despite the damage, residents are gradually returning to normalcy as restaurants, shops, and supermarkets reopen, while schools remain closed for assessment. Erick, the first major hurricane of the Eastern Pacific season, served as a reminder of the devastating impact of such storms, particularly in light of the recent Hurricane Otis.</p>

Supporters argue for the right to choose, while opponents express concerns about potential manipulation of vulnerable individuals.

Silver has risen from $28.92 per ounce to $37.12 per ounce since January, marking a 28% increase in just over six months, driven by industrial demand. While silver may not necessarily be a "better" investment than gold, it can be more attractive for certain investors due to its lower entry price point and its ability to hedge against inflation and diversify portfolios. The article suggests that silver is worth a second look as an affordable alternative to gold for investors seeking to protect their investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The conflict between Iran and Israel has prompted questions about the stability of the Iranian regime, which has been using the conflict to rally support. Experts suggest that the regime's ability to survive depends largely on the presence of a viable political alternative, with the exiled Iran expert Majid Golpour noting the lack of concrete plans and functioning coalitions within the opposition. Despite the suppression of dissenting voices, some believe a political vacuum could emerge if the regime weakens, potentially leading to protests and change. The sense of patriotism and the West's strategy will also play a crucial role in determining the outcome.</p>

          <p>The draft law legalizing assisted dying in some circumstances in England and Wales has cleared its initial stages in the House of Commons. The bill must now go through all the stages it went through in the Commons in the House of Lords, and then MPs will get a final say when they have looked at any changes suggested by peers. One of the biggest worries, for supporters of assisted dying, is that the Bill could run out of time, and it is also possible that too much disagreement could stop it. If all goes well, the first legal assisted deaths could be in 2029 or 2030.</p>

The Terminally Ill (End of Life) Bill will now go to the Lords, where it is likely to spend several months undergoing the same line-by-line scrutiny that it did before MPs. The government has said it could take up to four years to set up an assisted dying service, meaning it could be 2029 or even 2030 before the first medically-assisted death happens. Under the proposals, mentally competent, terminally ill adults in England and Wales with a life expectancy of less than six months would be eligible for an assisted death.</p>

Since May 5, the price of crude oil has spiked by nearly $20 per barrel, dragging gasoline prices along with it. A protracted war with Iran raises the specter of a 1970s re-run in more ways than one.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers say they blocked federal agents from entering their stadium on Thursday, as protests against immigration enforcement continue in the city. ICE denied that its agents were at the stadium. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees ICE and other agencies, said other personnel were in the stadium parking lot "very briefly". Recent intensified ICE activity in Los Angeles is part of President Donald Trump's wider crackdown on immigration.</p>
