            <p>Following the toppling of Bashar al-Assad's regime, Syrians are experiencing unprecedented freedoms, including open political discourse and a flourishing arts scene. Intellectuals and artists who once fled the country are returning, and censorship has been lifted. However, concerns are growing about the potential for a new form of repression, this time by religious clerics, and the concentration of power in the hands of the new leadership. The long-term prospects for democracy remain uncertain, with some fearing a return to authoritarianism and a loss of faith in political modernity given the nation's turbulent history.</p>

            <p>The NHL's playoff format, implemented in 2014, is facing criticism for creating predictable and repetitive matchups, diminishing excitement for fans. The current system, which prioritizes divisional standings over overall points, often leads to top teams facing each other early in the playoffs. While Commissioner Gary Bettman defends the format, some suggest changes to the regular-season points system could create more dynamic and engaging postseason brackets.</p>
