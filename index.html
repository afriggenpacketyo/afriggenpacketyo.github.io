          <p>Habibur Masum has been found guilty of murdering his wife, Kulsuma Akter, in a brutal knife attack in Bradford, UK. He stabbed her over 25 times in public as she was pushing their infant son in a pram, following a period where she had sought safety in a women's refuge. The court heard that Masum had tracked her location after she believed he was out of the country. Despite pleading guilty to manslaughter, the jury convicted him of murder, along with charges of stalking and making threats to kill.</p>

          <p>Leicester City has confirmed the departure of manager Ruud van Nistelrooy by mutual agreement, over two months after the club's relegation from the Premier League. The Dutchman's tenure saw just five wins in 27 matches, culminating in a record-setting nine consecutive home losses without scoring a goal. The protracted nature of his exit has drawn criticism, adding to the club's challenges as it faces a potential points deduction for breaching financial rules. The team is now searching for its fourth manager in a year as it prepares for the upcoming Championship season.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon 2025 draw has created an intriguing all-British first-round match, pitting Emma Raducanu against teenage wildcard Mimi Xu. Raducanu, who narrowly missed being seeded, faces a challenging path that could see her play the 2023 champion Marketa Vondrousova in the second round and world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the third. The tournament features 23 British players in the singles draws, the highest number since 1984. Men's number one Jack Draper also faces a difficult route, with a potential quarter-final matchup against seven-time champion Novak Djokovic.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Jalisco, Mexico, have uncovered a mass grave containing the remains of 34 individuals during construction work in the municipality of Zapopan. The region is a known stronghold for the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which has been linked to numerous disappearances and acts of violence. This discovery adds to Mexico's severe missing persons crisis, with over 127,000 people officially vanished nationwide. Criminal organizations frequently use clandestine graves to dispose of their victims, and this find is one of many in a country grappling with pervasive cartel-related violence.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the recent conflict with Israel, life in Tehran is slowly returning to a semblance of normality, but its residents are deeply unsettled and fearful of future attacks. A ceasefire is in place, but the 12-day war, which included Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear and military sites, has left a lasting psychological impact and significant casualties. Many citizens express exhaustion and hopelessness about their future, caught between international conflict and domestic restrictions.

          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement on a framework for a trade deal, signaling a potential de-escalation of their prolonged economic conflict. While President Trump initially announced a signed deal, both sides later clarified it as a foundational framework. The accord appears to center on the U.S. gaining better access to vital rare earth minerals, which China largely controls, and China committing to curb the flow of fentanyl precursors. This development follows high-level talks aimed at stabilizing the relationship and rolling back some of the punitive tariffs imposed by both nations. (not investment advice)</p>

Pollock has had a remarkable season, earning the Premiership's breakthrough player award and a senior England debut after previously having minimal top-flight experience.

His stance places him in opposition to figures like Republican Senator Mike Lee of Utah, who has advocated for the land-sale measure as a way to address issues like housing prices.

          <p>The recent Iran-Israel conflict and subsequent ceasefire have highlighted the delicate balancing act of nations across the Middle East, many of whom are trying to maintain stability by navigating complex relationships with Iran, Israel, and the United States. Countries like Jordan and Saudi Arabia publicly condemned Israeli actions but privately took steps to intercept Iranian projectiles, reflecting their reliance on U.S. security cooperation. Analysts suggest that Gulf states, seeing a weakened Iran, may seek rapprochement to ensure regional stability rather than risk the chaos of a regime collapse. The situation underscores a regional desire to avoid escalation while managing deep-seated dependencies and rivalries.</p>

The unemployment rate for this group rose to 5.8% in early 2025, and companies have significantly scaled back their hiring projections for new grads. This challenging environment is attributed to economic uncertainty driven by new tariffs and the increasing integration of artificial intelligence, which may be automating tasks previously handled by entry-level employees.

The facility is intended to support the Trump administration's aggressive detention goals but faces criticism for its inhumane conditions, placing up to 5,000 detainees in tents during the sweltering summer heat in a remote area with alligators and pythons. Opponents argue the project is a cruel political spectacle that also poses a devastating environmental threat to the protected wetlands and undermines billions invested in Everglades restoration.</p>

          <p>Two recent federal court rulings have created a murky legal landscape for copyright infringement lawsuits against AI companies. In one case, a judge ruled that training AI models on copyrighted works constitutes "fair use," a win for AI firm Anthropic, but also found the company liable for using pirated book copies. In a separate case against Meta, another judge suggested training models on copyrighted works is likely illegal but ruled for Meta because the plaintiffs' lawyers failed to argue that AI-generated content harms the market for their original works. These conflicting decisions indicate that the legal battle over AI and copyright is far from settled.</p>

The piece suggests that voters on both the left and right are craving authenticity and economic populism, which many establishment Democrats are failing to provide.

          <p>Two more high-profile figures, PLA Navy Chief of Staff Vice Admiral Li Hanjun and nuclear scientist Liu Shipeng, have been expelled from China's National People's Congress (NPC). The removal of their legislative membership was announced by the NPC Standing Committee and indicates they are under serious disciplinary investigation. This action is the latest in a sweeping anti-corruption crackdown within China's military and defense-industrial complex, which has already ensnared a number of top generals and executives. Their expulsion from the NPC is a formal step that often precedes further legal or party punishment.</p>
