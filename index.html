          <h2>Tsunami Warnings Issued Across Pacific After Powerful 8.8 Magnitude Earthquake Strikes Off Russian Coast</h2>

          <p>A massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered widespread tsunami alerts across the Pacific. Waves reached Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and Japan, causing some localized flooding and evacuations but no major reported damage or severe injuries so far. Officials in Hawaii initially issued a tsunami warning, which was later downgraded to an advisory as the first waves proved smaller than feared, though strong currents remain a concern. The event prompted transportation disruptions and emergency responses in multiple countries, highlighting the interconnected risk from major seismic events in the region.</p>

          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake near Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula prompted evacuation orders for millions in Japan, Russia, and Hawaii. While initial fears were high, many tsunami warnings were later downgraded to advisories as the first waves were less destructive than anticipated, though still dangerous. Russian authorities reported some flooding and damage to a port, while Japan and Hawaii experienced smaller waves. Experts note that the impact can vary significantly by location and that dangerous currents may persist for hours across the Pacific.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Demand for mortgages in the U.S. fell to its lowest level since May, with total application volume dropping by 3.8% last week. The decline was driven by a 6% decrease in purchase applications, as economic uncertainty and job market concerns appear to be outweighing the stability of interest rates. Refinance applications also saw a slight dip. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, prospective homebuyers are remaining cautious, leading to reduced activity despite slowing home-price growth and more inventory in some areas.

          <p>The recent trade agreement between the European Union and the United States extends far beyond economic tariffs, incorporating major geopolitical considerations. EU officials emphasize that the deal is also about security, addressing the war in Ukraine, and countering current global volatility. The agreement reportedly includes EU commitments to purchase strategic US goods like energy and AI chips, and to invest heavily in the US, raising concerns about Europe's strategic autonomy. Analysts suggest the deal reflects the EU's reliance on US security guarantees and aligns the two powers more closely on issues concerning China.</p>

          <p>On the 60th anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid, a new Republican budget signed by President Trump is set to enact the largest cuts in the programs' history. The law will cut $1 trillion from Medicaid starting in 2026, which is expected to cause nearly 12 million people to lose coverage. This move culminates decades of conservative efforts to shrink the public health insurance programs, which were originally passed as landmark civil rights-era legislation. Critics call the cuts "unconscionable," warning they will disproportionately harm the nation's most vulnerable citizens and could lead to rural hospital closures.</p>

          <p>Germany's cabinet has approved a draft budget for 2026 that signals a significant shift from its history of fiscal conservatism. The budget outlines €520.5 billion in spending, including major investments in infrastructure and defense, and will require approximately €174 billion in new borrowing. This move aims to stimulate economic growth in Europe's largest economy, which recently contracted slightly. However, the finance minister warned that significant austerity measures will likely be necessary starting in 2027 to balance the books after this period of increased expenditure.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has announced it will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes significant steps to end the war in Gaza and halt West Bank annexation. This follows a similar announcement from France, adding to the global pressure on Israel. At a recent UN conference, 15 countries, including several that have not yet recognized Palestine, issued a joint statement affirming their commitment to a two-state solution. The Israeli government and the U.S. have rejected the UK's move, calling it a "reward for Hamas."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gary Neville, the former Manchester United star and a vocal Labour supporter, has criticized Chancellor Rachel Reeves over the recent national insurance hike. He argued the increase has hampered employment by adding a significant burden on businesses and suggested it could have been delayed given the tough economic climate. While Neville supported the government's minimum wage increase, he identified the national insurance rise as a specific challenge for employers. His comments add to a growing chorus of criticism from business leaders regarding the new government's early economic policies.</p>

          <h2>The Arguments of a 1930s Black Fascist Offer Lessons on Contemporary Anti-Liberalism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 06:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the ideas of Lawrence Dennis, a Black intellectual who passed as white and became a prominent American fascist in the 1930s. Dennis argued that the Great Depression proved liberalism's inevitable failure and that a planned, authoritarian state was necessary. The author draws parallels between Dennis's flawed reasoning and that of today's right-wing critics of liberalism, identifying two "anti-liberal traps." These include misinterpreting a temporary crisis as a permanent structural failure of liberalism and idealizing illiberal alternatives while downplaying their dangers, a lesson relevant to current political discourse.</p>

          <p>The dating safety app Tea, which allows women to share information about men, has suspended its direct messaging feature following a significant hack. The company confirmed that private messages were accessed in the breach, which had already exposed thousands of user images, including verification photos with IDs. The app, with 1.6 million users, was created as a safe space but is now facing a major security crisis. Cybersecurity experts warn the leaked data, which reportedly includes sensitive conversations, could expose users to blackmail or emotional harm.</p>

          <h2>Elon Musk's Political Alignment Is Negatively Impacting Liberal Perceptions of All Electric Vehicles</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that Elon Musk's rightward political shift and alliance with Donald Trump have soured U.S. liberals not only on Tesla but on the entire electric vehicle category. A study found that as liberals' opinions of Tesla plummeted, their general intention to purchase any EV also eroded, slipping into negative territory. Researchers suggest Musk became so synonymous with EVs that his personal brand has damaged the appeal of the entire product class for this demographic. Conversely, the shift has not made conservatives significantly more likely to purchase an EV, despite their more favorable view of Tesla.</p>

          <p>In their debut season, MLS expansion team San Diego FC is making waves with an exceptionally risky and record-setting style of play. The team, coached by Mike Varas, is deeply committed to building possession from the back, attempting more short passes in their defensive half than any team on record. This high-risk, high-reward strategy is designed to attract pressure before breaking through to attack, a philosophy central to their Right to Dream ownership group. Despite relying on a very young and inexpensive defensive line, the innovative approach has been successful, placing them at the top of the Western Conference.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the recent data breach of the women's dating safety app, Tea, framing it as a particularly nasty and vengeful incident. The author notes that the hack appears to have been instigated by misogynistic trolls on 4chan who were upset by the app's existence. The breach, which exposed private messages and verification photos, underscores the failure of companies to protect user data and the illusion of safe spaces online. The column argues that while digital whisper networks like Tea exist because dating platforms fail to protect women, they also carry immense risks.</p>
