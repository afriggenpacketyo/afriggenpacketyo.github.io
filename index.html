          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to impose 100% tariffs on movies produced outside the United States, claiming it's a national security issue due to incentives offered by other countries to attract filmmakers. This move is aimed at boosting the American film industry, which Trump says is declining. However, the details remain unclear, such as whether the tariffs would apply to American production companies filming abroad or to streaming services. The Motion Picture Association has not yet responded to the announcement, while governments of Australia and New Zealand have voiced support for their film industries, and Trump has appointed film ambassadors to help promote business opportunities in Hollywood.</p>

          <p>In Peru's Pataz province, authorities discovered the bodies of thirteen miners and security guards who had been abducted from a gold mine. The victims were found tied up in a pit, according to the mayor of Pataz, and the mining company Poderosa stated that illegal miners in collusion with criminal elements were responsible for the kidnapping. The area has been under a state of emergency for over two years due to ongoing violence and unrest. The interior ministry has deployed organized crime investigators to probe the deaths and has authorized agents to use firearms if necessary.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Bureau of Prisons to reopen and expand Alcatraz, the infamous former prison on an island near San Francisco, to house America's most ruthless and violent offenders. Trump stated that this move would serve as a symbol of law, order, and justice. However, leading Democrats have dismissed the proposal as unserious, noting that the prison closed in 1963 due to high operating costs. Experts also point out that the federal prison system has plenty of empty beds, making the need for a new prison questionable.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a potential 100 percent tariff on movies produced outside the United States has stirred uncertainty in Hollywood. The article questions whether this tariff would apply broadly to all foreign films, including independent and streaming content, or specifically target productions benefiting from foreign tax incentives. Concerns are raised about the impact on American film workers who have already seen jobs decline due to overseas production. While some support increased incentives for California-based film production, the industry grapples with shifting economics, including the decline of traditional revenue streams.</p>

          <p>Amid rising tensions between Pakistan and India following a deadly attack in Kashmir, Pakistan's army chief, General Syed Asim Munir, has adopted a more assertive stance. He has emphasized Pakistan's commitment to Kashmir, describing it as the country's "jugular vein," and warned against any military misadventure by India. Analysts suggest that General Munir's hard-line approach reflects his need to project strength amid domestic political and economic challenges, as well as his long-held views on the conflict with India. The United States and the United Nations have urged de-escalation between the two nuclear-armed nations.</p>

The United States remained the top donor, followed by Germany. The decline in Japan's donations was primarily attributed to the yen's depreciation. Despite the decrease, Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool in pursuing a "free and open" Indo-Pacific amid China's growing influence. Overall ODA by Development Assistance Committee members also fell, mainly due to reduced contributions to international organizations and decreased aid for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard announced that the offshore well blowout off the coast of Louisiana, which began on April 26, has been controlled. The well had been leaking oil and natural gas, contaminating nearby marshland and protected Gulf Coast habitats. Cleanup and mitigation efforts are ongoing, involving multiple agencies and private contractors. The incident has raised concerns about the broader issue of orphaned and aging oil wells and the capacity of federal agencies to respond to such emergencies.</p>

          <p>A change in U.S. tax policy, ending a loophole for inexpensive imports, is putting pressure on garment factories in Guangzhou, China, that rely on platforms like Amazon and Shein. The combination of tariffs and the new tax on cheap imports has cut into their businesses, forcing some to consider relocating to cheaper locations or alternative markets. As trade tensions between the U.S. and China rise, these factories face declining orders and suspended production lines, highlighting the challenges of navigating the changing global economic landscape.</p>

          <p>A recent government survey in Japan has revealed that foreign visitors are most frustrated by the lack of trash bins in public areas, including train stations. This issue was cited by 21.9 percent of over 4,000 respondents as their top concern. While the figure has improved slightly from the previous year, many visitors reported having to carry their trash back to their accommodations. The removal of trash bins in public spaces is partly due to safety concerns following terror attacks.</p>

          <p>As tariffs impact U.S. orders for Chinese goods, China is encouraging exporters to divert sales to the domestic market, which could lead to deeper deflation. Local governments and major businesses are supporting this effort, with e-commerce giants offering discounts on goods originally intended for U.S. buyers. However, this influx of discounted goods could erode companies' profitability and weigh on employment, contributing to weak consumer demand and negative inflation rates.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to extend his tariff war to the film industry, targeting foreign-made films with a 100 percent tariff. He claims that Hollywood is being "devastated" by the number of filmmakers and studios working overseas. If implemented, this would mark the first time a Trump tariff is imposed on services rather than manufactured goods. Trump has justified the move by claiming that the US is facing national emergencies in immigration as well as terrorism and energy.</p>
