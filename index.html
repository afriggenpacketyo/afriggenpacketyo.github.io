          <p>Boeing has reached an agreement with the Justice Department to avoid criminal prosecution for allegedly misleading US regulators about the 737 Max jetliner before two fatal crashes. Under the deal, Boeing will pay and invest over $1.1 billion, including $445 million for the crash victims' families. In return, the Justice Department will dismiss the fraud charge against the company.

The ship reportedly damaged a heating pipe in Helberg's cabin, but the homeowner considers himself lucky that it didn't hit the rocky cliff next to it.

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has detected multiple cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, which has been linked to a surge of the virus in China.

          <p>Investing in gold can be a smart move, especially during economic uncertainty, as it serves as a tangible asset that preserves value. Gold prices have recently seen impressive gains, making it an attractive option for investors.

It's crucial to view gold as a long-term hedge rather than a quick profit opportunity and to be wary of scams and high premiums. (not investment advice)</p>
