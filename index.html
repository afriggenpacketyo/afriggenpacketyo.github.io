          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has settled its defamation lawsuit against the conservative media outlet Newsmax for $67 million, resolving claims that the network broadcasted false information about election fraud in 2020. The payment is scheduled in three installments through early 2027. This settlement follows Dominion's landmark $787 million agreement with Fox News for similar claims. While Dominion expressed satisfaction with the resolution, Newsmax defended its coverage as fair but stated its decision to settle was influenced by a belief that it would not receive a fair trial.</p>

The meeting aims to secure a "reliable and dignified peace" amid the ongoing conflict with Russia, which currently controls about 20% of Ukrainian territory. As these diplomatic efforts unfold, Russian President Vladimir Putin is reportedly demanding Ukraine cede the remainder of the Donetsk region in exchange for halting Moscow's offensive, according to sources.</p>

          <p>After a two-week standoff, Texas House Democrats have returned to Austin, providing the Republican majority with the necessary quorum to proceed with business. Their return ends a protest against a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps in a way that could net the GOP up to five additional seats in the 2026 midterms. Democratic leaders stated their return allows them to build a legal record to challenge the proposed maps in court. The move in Texas has prompted a response from California Democrats, who are now pursuing their own redistricting plan, potentially sparking a nationwide partisan battle.</p>

          <p>Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, a long-time leader of Mexico's powerful Sinaloa cartel, is scheduled to plead guilty in a U.S. federal court to extensive drug trafficking charges. The 77-year-old kingpin was arrested in Texas last year and is accused of overseeing a violent global operation involving murder, torture, and smuggling vast quantities of illicit drugs. This development follows prosecutors' decision not to seek the death penalty and occurs amid brutal infighting between cartel factions loyal to Zambada and the sons of his former partner, "El Chapo" Guzmán.</p>

          <p>With rising retirement costs, many seniors are considering reverse mortgages to tap into their home equity without selling their property. Financial experts suggest that the best age to take out such a loan is often in the late 60s to early 70s, as older borrowers typically qualify for larger amounts. Key factors to consider include immediate income needs, long-term financial goals, health status, and plans to age in place, as the loan becomes due upon moving out or death.

          <p>New research indicates that the availability of over-the-counter birth control pills is significantly impacting contraceptive use in the U.S. A study published in JAMA Network Open found that 31.8% of people who obtained the OTC pill, Opill, had previously used no method of contraception at all. The findings suggest the prescription-free option is successfully reducing barriers to access, particularly for younger, uninsured, and rural individuals who cited the convenience of not needing a doctor's appointment as a primary reason for their choice.</p>

          <p>The Canada Industrial Relations Board has declared the ongoing strike by 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants illegal and ordered them to return to work immediately. The strike, which began three days ago during the peak summer travel season, has disrupted travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily. The union has so far defied an earlier back-to-work order as negotiations over pay and other issues with Canada's largest airline remain at an impasse, creating uncertainty over when flight operations will fully resume.</p>

          <p>In response to political pressure to lower drug costs, Novo Nordisk has announced it will offer its popular diabetes drug, Ozempic, to cash-paying U.S. patients for $499 a month. This price is less than half of the medication's monthly list price of nearly $1,350. The discount will be available through various platforms, including the company's direct-to-consumer pharmacy, aiming to increase access for uninsured patients and compete with cheaper, unapproved compounded versions of the drug, thereby making the treatment more accessible.</p>

This innovative model aims to overcome the high costs of nuclear construction by having Google and Kairos assume the financial risk, while TVA provides a revenue stream through a power purchase agreement, accelerating clean energy deployment.</p>
