          <p>Denmark's largest airport in Copenhagen has suspended all take-offs and landings following the sighting of two to three large, unidentified drones in the vicinity. The closure, which began around 8:30 PM local time, has resulted in the diversion of at least 35 flights to other airports. Police are actively investigating the incident, but authorities have not provided a timeline for when normal flight operations will resume. This disruption highlights the growing security challenges that critical infrastructure like airports face from unauthorized drone usage.</p>

          <p>Spanish and Barcelona midfielder Aitana Bonmati has made history by winning the women's Ballon d'Or for an unprecedented third time, solidifying her status as a dominant force in world football. The 27-year-old secured the prestigious award ahead of her international teammate Mariona Caldentey. Bonmati's win continues a five-year streak of Barcelona players receiving the honor, following Alexia Putellas's wins in 2021 and 2022. Despite a season where her club and country missed the biggest prizes, her individual brilliance, including being named UEFA's Champions League player of the season, was recognized by the jury of journalists.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted President Trump to proceed with the removal of Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Slaughter, at least for the time being. The court's 6-3 decision temporarily blocks lower court rulings that had reinstated her, while also agreeing to hear the larger case in December. This sets the stage for a potential reversal of the 90-year-old 'Humphrey's Executor' precedent, which protects members of independent federal agencies from being fired by the president without cause. The court's liberal justices dissented, warning that this move could extinguish the independence and bipartisanship of such agencies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced plans to issue a physician's notice and launch a public information campaign regarding a potential, unproven link between prenatal use of acetaminophen and autism. This move, which clashes with a significant body of scientific research, advises pregnant women to limit the use of drugs like Tylenol unless medically necessary for conditions such as high fever. Drug manufacturer Kenvue and medical organizations have pushed back, emphasizing that acetaminophen is considered the safest pain and fever treatment during pregnancy and that untreated fever poses its own risks to both mother and infant.</p>

          <p>Ousmane Dembélé, once the world's second most expensive player, has fulfilled long-held predictions by winning the men's Ballon d'Or, capping a remarkable career transformation. After years of battling injuries and inconsistency at Barcelona, the 28-year-old flourished at Paris St-Germain, scoring 35 goals in a treble-winning season. His success was catalyzed by a tactical shift to a more central, goal-scoring role following Kylian Mbappé's departure, as well as personal maturation after his marriage and the birth of his child. This achievement marks a significant turnaround from a career previously defined by unfulfilled potential.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to reconsider a landmark 1935 precedent, 'Humphrey's Executor,' which has historically shielded officials at independent federal agencies from being fired at will by the president. The decision to hear the case follows several recent orders where the court's conservative majority sided with President Trump's removal of Democratic appointees from various boards. This move signals a potential major shift in the separation of powers, possibly granting the president more direct control over agencies like the Federal Trade Commission, which were designed to operate with a degree of political independence. The court's liberal justices have strongly dissented against these developments.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the air on Tuesday, nearly a week after being indefinitely suspended. The show was pulled following comments Kimmel made about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which prompted criticism from FCC Chairman Brendan Carr and led major station owners like Nexstar and Sinclair to drop the program. In its statement, Disney explained the suspension was intended "to avoid further inflaming a tense situation," calling some of the host's comments "ill-timed and thus insensitive." The company stated the decision to resume the show came after thoughtful conversations with Kimmel.</p>

Under the diversion agreement, 19-year-old Edan On must complete community service, undergo anti-bias training, and stay away from the UCLA campus.

According to the arrest affidavit, the woman admitted to investigators that one child died a year ago after she held it until it stopped breathing. She faces multiple charges, including involuntary manslaughter for another death six years ago, and is being held without bail.</p>

          <p>The White House has outlined a new ownership structure for TikTok's U.S. operations, which it claims will satisfy national security concerns and prevent a ban of the app. The plan involves creating a U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American investors and board members, with software company Oracle providing comprehensive security oversight, including for the app's powerful algorithm. A senior White House official expressed confidence that China has approved the deal, although Beijing has not publicly confirmed an agreement. The move aims to resolve the long-standing dispute over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance.</p>

He noted that the company trades at a significantly lower sales multiple compared to newly public blockchain lender Figure Technology Solutions, despite what he claims is a faster growth rate.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, homeowners looking to borrow $50,000 against their home equity face a choice between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Currently, a $50,000 HELOC is slightly cheaper on a monthly basis, with estimated payments about $7 to $10 less than a comparable home equity loan. However, homeowners must consider that HELOCs have variable interest rates that can change over time, whereas home equity loans offer the stability of a fixed rate for the entire term of the loan.

          <p>AquaStar Corp. is recalling over 85,000 bags of frozen shrimp sold at major retailers like Kroger across 31 states due to potential contamination with the radioactive element cesium-137.

Cesium-137 is a byproduct of nuclear fission, and long-term consumption of contaminated food can elevate cancer risk.

An Estonian official suggested that future violations could be met with a response similar to Turkey shooting down a Russian bomber in 2015. The incident is part of a pattern of Russian provocations against NATO members, prompting Estonia to invoke Article 4, which triggers consultations when a member's security is threatened.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's stop-work order against Orsted's Revolution Wind project, allowing the Danish renewable energy company to resume construction. The Interior Department had ordered a halt to the nearly completed project off the New England coast, which is set to power over 350,000 homes. Judge Royce Lamberth granted a temporary injunction, stating that Orsted was likely to succeed in its lawsuit and would suffer irreparable harm if the order remained. The ruling is a significant setback for the administration's stated goal of shutting down the U.S. offshore wind industry.</p>

He argued that Farage aims to reshape the UK in the mold of "Trump's America," which he described as harsh and contrary to British values.

While Horner led the team to numerous championships, his final months were marked by controversy and accusations that were ultimately dismissed.
