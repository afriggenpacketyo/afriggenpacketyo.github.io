          <p>During a contentious Senate Finance Committee hearing, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced sharp questioning from both Democrats and Republicans regarding his views and policies on vaccines. The session highlighted significant political divisions, with senators referencing data from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which requires context as it contains unverified reports. The hearing also touched upon broader health topics, including polling data that shows strong public support for mandatory school vaccinations and a separate heated exchange over proposed cuts to Medicaid.</p>

          <p>Irish comedy writer Graham Linehan, known for creating shows like "Father Ted" and "The IT Crowd," is on trial in London, accused of relentlessly harassing a transgender activist online. Prosecutors allege that Linehan used social media to publish a series of offensive posts targeting 18-year-old campaigner Sophia Brooks, calling her a "domestic terrorist" and a "sociopath." The court also heard allegations that Linehan damaged Brooks's phone during a confrontation. Linehan has pleaded not guilty, claiming his posts were in the public interest to expose the tactics of trans activists.</p>

          <p>Danish renewable energy firm Orsted has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block an order halting construction of its Revolution Wind farm off the New England coast. The Interior Department cited national security concerns for the stop-work order on the nearly completed project, which is designed to power over 350,000 homes. Orsted alleges the justification is a pretext, pointing to President Trump's long-standing public hostility towards wind power. The company argues the project has already passed extensive environmental and safety reviews and the sudden halt is unlawful.</p>

          <p>The government of Nepal has ordered its telecommunications authority to block access to major social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, X, and LinkedIn. The move comes after these companies failed to meet a deadline to register with the government and appoint local representatives for grievance handling. Officials state the crackdown is aimed at curbing the spread of misinformation and cybercrime, but digital rights advocates have criticized the decision as a controlling measure that infringes on the public's fundamental rights. Only a few platforms, most notably TikTok, have complied with the new regulations.</p>

          <p>In testimony before the Senate Finance Committee, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. explicitly denied accusations that he pressured former CDC Director Susan Monarez to approve vaccine recommendations against her scientific judgment. Kennedy stated he never had a private meeting with Monarez and defended his decision to fire her and overhaul the CDC's vaccine advisory panel as necessary steps to restore the agency's credibility. He argued that new leadership is essential to reform the CDC following its performance during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

This move comes after years of declining competitiveness, culminating in a widely criticized 211-186 score in the 2024 game.

The court heard that Hopper, 49, used ice and dry ice to inflict catastrophic injuries on his legs, leading to their medical removal, and then falsely claimed over £466,000 from insurers by attributing the condition to sepsis. The case revealed Hopper had a long-standing sexual interest in amputation and body dysphoria.

          <p>As the new NFL season begins, several major storylines are set to unfold, including the impact of the blockbuster trade sending star defensive end Micah Parsons from the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers. The move immediately elevates the Packers into Super Bowl contention and leaves Cowboys fans reeling. Another key question surrounds the development of the six quarterbacks taken early in last year's draft, as they enter a critical second year where progress is not guaranteed. Finally, the league watches to see if any AFC contender can finally overcome the conference dominance of the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>

          <p>The financial dominance of the National Football League continues to grow, with the average team's valuation increasing by 18% to $7.65 billion in the past year. The Dallas Cowboys remain the league's most valuable franchise, now worth a record $12.5 billion and generating over $1.2 billion in annual revenue. This surge in value is driven by massive national media rights deals and lucrative stadium revenues, with eleven different teams now valued at over $8 billion. The league's financial health is also attracting significant interest from private equity firms, further boosting franchise valuations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The District of Columbia's attorney general has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the legality of deploying National Guard troops for domestic law enforcement within the city. The suit alleges the action constitutes an unconstitutional "involuntary military occupation" and infringes upon the city's right to self-governance. This legal challenge follows President Trump's praise of the troop presence as a success in reducing crime and his expressed interest in expanding such deployments to other major U.S. cities. The lawsuit argues that using the military for local policing is dangerous and violates long-standing legal principles.</p>

The incident occurred when a carriage derailed and crashed into a building on a steep hill near the city's Avenida da Liberdade.

The transport company, Carris, stated that all maintenance protocols had been scrupulously followed, and authorities have declared a national day of mourning.</p>

          <p>Scientists studying two tiny grains from the asteroid Ryugu have discovered a rare phosphide mineral that does not naturally occur on Earth. The samples, delivered by Japan's Hayabusa2 mission, are pristine relics from the early solar system, offering insights into the chemical reactions that formed our planets. Using non-damaging X-ray analysis, researchers identified a diversity of elements and compounds within the grains. The discovery of this unique mineral, similar to biologically-linked struvite found on Earth, continues to fuel theories about the role of extraterrestrial matter in the origin of life.</p>

          <p>A political analysis suggests that while devotion to Donald Trump unifies the Republican Party, it masks significant ideological divisions among its voters. The article identifies five distinct "tribes" within the party, including anti-establishment populists, traditional conservatives, and MAGA nationalists, who often hold conflicting views on core issues like taxes, welfare, and trade tariffs. President Trump's political success is attributed to his ability to bind these disparate factions together. This coalition, however, may prove difficult for any future successor to maintain, posing a long-term challenge for the party's cohesion.</p>

The lower court ruled that the IEEPA does not explicitly grant tariff-setting power, avoiding a ruling on the legitimacy of the emergency itself.
