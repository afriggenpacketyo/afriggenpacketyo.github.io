          <p>The White House has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and local leaders over their "sanctuary" policies. The suit claims these policies interfere with federal immigration enforcement efforts. The lawsuit specifically mentions the apartment complex in Aurora, CO, which President Trump claimed had been taken over by a Venezuelan gang. The suit seeks to invalidate the laws that block local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration authorities.</p>

          <p>Germany's Foreign Office has defended its decision to classify the Alternative f√ºr Deutschland (AfD) party as right-wing extremist, following sharp criticism from the White House. The intelligence agency that made the classification found AfD's "prevailing understanding of people based on ethnicity and descent" goes against Germany's "free democratic order". The new classification gives authorities greater powers to monitor the AfD using tactics like phone interception and undercover agents.</p>

Party members are trading blame and discussing the future of leader Pierre Poilievre. Poilievre will need to heal divisions within the movement and ensure the party can function effectively as the Official Opposition, despite his own loss in his own seat.</p>
