          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held meetings with U.S. congressional leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, to discuss Israel's security and a potential ceasefire in Gaza. The discussions occurred amidst some U.S. lawmakers' concerns about being drawn into a wider conflict following recent strikes against Iran. Netanyahu emphasized the strong U.S.-Israel partnership in confronting regional threats and expressed his commitment to eliminating Hamas's capabilities and securing the release of all hostages. The visit highlights the ongoing diplomatic coordination between the two nations on critical Middle East security issues.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump voiced strong criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating he was "not happy" with the ongoing war in Ukraine and accusing the Russian leader of disingenuousness. Trump remarked that Putin is "killing a lot of people" and that his seemingly pleasant demeanor has proven to be "meaningless." Following a pause in a weapons shipment, Trump announced the U.S. would now send additional defensive weapons to help Ukraine defend itself. The comments reflect a growing frustration in the administration regarding the lack of progress toward ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has drawn sharp criticism after she personally intervened in an ICE operation at MacArthur Park, demanding the agents leave the area. Bass described the federal raid as "outrageous" and "un-American," claiming it disrupted a space where children were playing. Critics, including Republican lawmakers and Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino, condemned her actions as interference with federal law enforcement. Bovino stated that such operations would become normal in the city, highlighting the ongoing conflict between local and federal authorities over immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament have voted to pass the Football Governance Bill, which will establish an independent regulator for the top five divisions of men's football in England. The new body, independent of government and football authorities, is designed to ensure the financial sustainability and protection of football clubs. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy stated the legislation puts fans "back at the heart of the game." While the bill passed with a significant majority, a proposal to mandate that some Premier League games be shown on free-to-air television was defeated.</p>

          <p>Amid market uncertainty, savers with significant cash reserves are considering safer options like Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts. This article provides a comparative analysis of which account type would earn more interest on a $20,000 deposit over various time frames, from three months to two years. The calculations show that short-term CDs currently tend to offer slightly higher returns, while high-yield savings accounts may earn more over longer periods, assuming their variable rates remain stable. The choice depends on an individual's need for liquidity versus the desire for a locked-in, fixed interest rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced his administration will impose a 50% tariff on copper imports, a move aimed at bolstering domestic production of the metal. The announcement, made during a Cabinet meeting, caused copper prices to surge to a record high and boosted the stock value of U.S. copper miners like Freeport-McMoRan. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that a national security investigation into copper imports was complete and that the tariff would likely be in place by the end of July. This sector-specific duty follows a similar doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports earlier in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

Economists have warned these policies risk exacerbating inflation, though global stock markets have shown a muted reaction to the latest threats.

          <p>No-closing-cost home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are attracting homeowners, but it's crucial to understand the underlying trade-offs before borrowing. While these products eliminate upfront fees, lenders often recoup these costs by charging a higher interest rate or imposing penalties if the line of credit is closed early. The article advises borrowers to calculate the break-even point to see if paying closing costs upfront would be cheaper in the long run. It also notes that these HELOCs may have stricter credit requirements and that reading the fine print on repayment penalties is essential to avoid unexpected charges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Essence Festival have taken public responsibility for a performance by Lauryn Hill that began at 2:30 a.m., long after the scheduled time. In an Instagram post, the festival stated the delay was not Hill's fault and that she arrived on schedule, urging people to "put some respect on her name." The incident was part of a festival plagued by production issues, which prompted fellow performer Stephanie Mills to issue an open letter. Mills criticized the event's poor time management and technical difficulties, calling for a "vastly improved experience" in the future.</p>

          <p>Real estate investors are acquiring a larger portion of the U.S. housing market, accounting for nearly 27% of homes sold in the first quarter of the year, the highest share in at least five years. This trend reflects a sluggish market where high home prices and mortgage rates are preventing many traditional buyers from making purchases. With properties taking longer to sell, investors with cash or financing advantages are stepping in. The report notes that the majority of these are "mom-and-pop" investors owning five or fewer properties, while large institutional investors account for a small fraction of the market.

The plot involved recruiting North Korean IT workers to pose as American freelancers, using stolen U.S. identities to secure remote jobs at companies worldwide. The income generated from this fraudulent employment was then funneled back to North Korea to help fund its weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs.

Travelers and airport officials at several U.S. airports, including in Washington D.C. and Philadelphia, have confirmed that standard passengers are now being allowed through security with their shoes on.

The author argues that the massive show of force, complete with tactical gear and a helicopter, was a taxpayer-funded photo opportunity designed to intimidate rather than address real crime. The article contends that instead of targeting serious criminals, the operation has instilled fear in the community and united residents in resistance.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the swarm is larger than what is typically observed at the volcano, though the strongest quake was only a magnitude 1.7. Scientists have not detected any signs of ground deformation or other indicators of volcanic unrest. They attribute the seismic activity to the circulation of hydrothermal fluids interacting with pre-existing faults deep below the volcano's summit, similar to a large swarm that occurred in 2009.</p>

Montgomery, who has a scouting and analytics background, appears to favor a more data-driven strategy compared to his predecessor, Ron Washington, who is known for a more "old-school" approach. This difference is seen in decisions like pulling a starting pitcher earlier in a game based on matchups, a move that has had mixed results.

          <p>For Americans struggling with high-interest credit card debt, consolidation can be an effective strategy, but it requires careful consideration. This article outlines three key things to know before proceeding, starting with the fact that personal loans are not the only option; balance transfer cards and debt consolidation programs are also viable alternatives. It also highlights that significant savings are possible even in the current rate environment by moving high-rate debt to a lower-rate product. Finally, borrowers should be aware that there are limits on the amount and type of debt that can be consolidated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article presents a case for why individuals burdened by high-rate credit card debt might consider pursuing debt forgiveness programs this July. It argues that waiting for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates is likely futile, as any potential cuts will be minimal and offer little relief from compounding interest. The piece emphasizes that high debt loads negatively impact overall financial health, including credit scores and the ability to qualify for other loans. Pursuing debt forgiveness is framed as a proactive step toward stopping the debt spiral and improving one's long-term financial standing. (not investment advice)</p>
