            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador, where he is held in a notorious prison. While stopping short of explicitly ordering his return, the court directed a lower court to clarify its order, emphasizing deference to the Executive Branch in foreign affairs. The administration had opposed his return, despite acknowledging the illegal nature of his deportation, accusing Garcia of gang membership. This decision marks a rebuke to the administration's aggressive deportation policies targeting alleged gang members.</p>

            <p>The UK government has pledged an additional £450 million in military support to Ukraine, including funding for drones, anti-tank mines, and vehicle repairs. This package, co-chaired with Germany, aims to bolster Ukraine's defenses against Russian aggression and is part of a series of military pledges from the UK. Defence Secretary John Healey emphasized the critical importance of this support in 2025, stating that it will provide Ukrainian forces with the necessary resources. However, the Liberal Democrats criticized the package as insufficient, calling for the seizure of Russian assets to provide more funding.</p>

            <p>A Los Angeles court has ruled in favor of Sony, granting them distribution rights to the popular game shows "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" after a dispute with CBS.

            <p>President Trump is facing scrutiny and accusations of manipulating the stock markets following a series of social media posts regarding tariffs. After prices had been plummeting for days, Trump posted that it was a 'great time to buy,' and shortly after, he announced that he would pause the harshest of his tariffs on most countries. This led to the Dow closing up almost 3,000 points, and some Democratic lawmakers and ethics experts are now calling for investigations into whether Trump was attempting to deliberately manipulate the markets or enable others to trade on insider information.</p>

            <p>In a deportation case against Columbia activist Mahmoud Khalil, the government filed a memorandum from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, arguing that Khalil's protests conflict with American foreign policy objectives. Rubio stated that Khalil's presence undermines U.S. policy to combat anti-Semitism and protect Jewish students. Khalil, a legal permanent resident, was detained for alleged support of Hamas, a claim his attorneys deny. A judge demanded evidence supporting the removal, leading to the submission of Rubio's memo.</p>

            <p>President Trump paused his administration's "reciprocal tariffs" after the bond market reacted negatively, signaling concerns about the economic impact.

Economists warned that the tariffs could strain the nation's finances and complicate efforts to extend the 2017 tax cuts. This episode underscores the power of bond investors to influence government policy.</p>

While he suggested the U.S. could potentially find alternative sources for some products, it's not realistic in a short amount of time, and would result in a far more expensive America with lots of unemployment and reliance on other countries outside of China.
