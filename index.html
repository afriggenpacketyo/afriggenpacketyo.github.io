          <p>The United Nations Security Council is holding an emergency meeting to address intense border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia. The fighting, which involves rockets and fighter jets, has escalated a long-running dispute over the Emerald Triangle border region, resulting in numerous casualties and the displacement of over 100,000 Thai civilians. Both nations blame each other for initiating the recent violence, which follows years of tension over the contested territory. International bodies, including the US, EU, and China, have called for an immediate end to the conflict and a return to dialogue.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at regulating college athletics, specifically targeting name, image, and likeness (NIL) compensation and scholarship distributions. The order seeks to rein in what it calls improper "pay-for-play" deals and requires large athletic departments to maintain scholarship levels for non-revenue sports, including many women's and Olympic teams. Citing a threat to the future of college sports, the directive has raised questions about its legality and enforceability. The NCAA and major conferences have expressed support, hoping it leads to federal legislation to stabilize the changing landscape of collegiate athletics.</p>

          <p>An investigation is underway in China after six university engineering students died during a field trip at a copper-molybdenum mine in Inner Mongolia. The students fell into an industrial flotation tank after a grating panel reportedly gave way, an incident which also injured a teacher. The tragic event has prompted calls from state media and the public for a thorough investigation and stricter safety measures at industrial sites. The regional government has assembled a team to determine the cause of the accident and propose corrective actions.</p>

          <p>The Federal Communications Commission has approved the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, a deal shadowed by political controversy. The approval followed Paramount's $16 million settlement of a lawsuit with President Trump and the recent cancellation of Stephen Colbert's late-night show. As part of the deal, Skydance has pledged to install an ombudsman to address editorial bias at CBS News. The timing of the approval has drawn sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers, who suggest a connection between the settlement and the regulatory green light.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against New York City, challenging its sanctuary laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The legal action follows the recent shooting of an off-duty Customs and Border Patrol officer, allegedly by undocumented immigrants. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the city's policies release criminals onto the streets, while immigrant advocates argue the laws are crucial for public safety by ensuring all residents feel safe reporting crimes. The lawsuit escalates the Trump administration's ongoing conflict with cities that have adopted sanctuary policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had a public disagreement over the cost of the Fed's extensive headquarters renovation during a joint site visit. The president claimed the project's cost had risen to $3.1 billion, a figure Powell immediately disputed, explaining the number included a separate building completed years ago. The exchange highlights ongoing tensions, with Trump having previously suggested the project's cost overruns could be grounds for firing Powell. Despite the friction, Trump later said firing the Fed chair was not necessary at this time.</p>

This novel effect was traced to changes in electron movement within the bent material. The findings, published in Nature Communications, could pave the way for designing ultra-efficient, low-power nanodevices with significantly reduced wear and tear.</p>

          <p>The UN's agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) has issued a dire warning that one in five children in Gaza City is now suffering from malnourishment, with cases increasing daily. The agency's commissioner-general described the situation as catastrophic, stating that people are like "walking corpses" and that over 100 individuals, mostly children, have reportedly died from hunger. This report adds to the growing international alarm over mass starvation in the territory as the conflict and aid restrictions continue, with the humanitarian system on the verge of collapse.</p>

          <p>The D.C. city council and the Washington Commanders have reached an agreement on a new stadium at the RFK Stadium site, moving the team closer to returning to the district. The deal was announced despite President Trump's recent threat to block it unless the team changes its name back to the "Redskins." The D.C. Council chairman characterized the president's comments as a distraction and expressed confidence that the deal, which includes significant revenue benefits for the city, will receive the necessary votes for approval in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>A 41-year-old employee at a Chuck E. Cheese in Tallahassee, Florida, was arrested for larceny while dressed in the mouse mascot costume.

The victim reportedly conducted her own investigation, obtaining security footage that identified the suspect and led to his arrest.

          <p>Three former federal immigration judges are publicly denouncing their recent firings by the Trump administration, describing the dismissals as an "arbitrary" and politically motivated "attack on the rule of law." The judges, who collectively handled thousands of cases, said they received no explanation for their terminations and alleged they had been pressured on how to rule in certain cases. Their ouster comes as the U.S. immigration court system faces a historic backlog of nearly four million cases with a diminishing number of judges.</p>
