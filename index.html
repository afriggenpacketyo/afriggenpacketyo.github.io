          <p>A Los Angeles judge has agreed to resentence Erik and Lyle Menendez, who are serving life sentences for the 1989 murders of their parents. The brothers admitted to killing Kitty and Jose Menendez, claiming self-defense after years of abuse, and argue they have been rehabilitated. Prosecutors contend the brothers meticulously planned the killings to inherit their parents' fortune and have not taken responsibility. The case, subject of numerous books and documentaries, remains divisive, with the resentencing hearing determining if the brothers could be freed after three decades in prison.</p>

          <p>Federal judges across the nation are experiencing a disturbing trend of "pizza doxxing," where unsolicited pizza deliveries are sent to their homes, often with the recipient listed as Daniel Anderl, the son of Judge Esther Salas, who was killed in 2020. These incidents, considered attempts at "psychological warfare," are under investigation by the U.S. Marshals Service. Security analysts warn that such tactics could be used to confirm judges' addresses for potential attacks, highlighting a rise in threats against public officials and judges in recent years, underscoring concerns about inflammatory rhetoric from leaders and individuals in positions of power.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the US has "no stronger partner" than Saudi Arabia during his first major foreign trip, pledging to lift sanctions against Syria and announcing a $142 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia. The trip, focused on shoring up investment, included meetings with business leaders like Elon Musk and Sam Altman. Trump lauded the US-Saudi relationship as "more powerful than ever before" and expressed his "dream" for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, while only briefly addressing the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has made it clear that will not happen until there is a permanent end to the war in Gaza and a clear path to Palestinian statehood.</p>

          <p>José Mujica, the former president of Uruguay, has died at the age of 89; he was known as the world's "poorest president" due to his modest lifestyle. Mujica, a former guerrilla, governed Uruguay from 2010 to 2015, becoming a well-known political figure in Latin America and beyond for his simple way of living, his criticism of consumerism, and the social reforms he promoted, including the legalization of recreational marijuana. During his administration, the Uruguayan economy grew, poverty was reduced, and unemployment remained low. He will be remembered for his simple lifestyle he adopted in and out of politics.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams reportedly used at least seven different cellphone numbers during a federal corruption investigation, explaining that he needed separate phones for office, personal, and campaign use. Federal authorities obtained warrants to track Mr. Adams' location using cellphone data, finding that he had used seven different phone numbers since the investigation began in August 2021, according to released documents. The charges against Mr. Adams were ultimately dismissed after the Trump administration asked to drop the case, a request that prompted the interim U.S. attorney to resign. Mr. Adams bristled at the tactics used by federal authorities, citing his dyslexia as the reason he couldn't remember his primary phone's password.</p>

Democrats criticize the bill, asserting it will cause millions to lose health insurance, while Republicans insist they are targeting waste and protecting benefits for eligible recipients.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's office claims President Trump’s tariff policies will reduce state revenues by $16 billion through next year. Despite higher-than-expected tax receipts through April, the Newsom administration predicts lower overall revenues due to the economic impact of Trump’s tariffs. Newsom is expected to project a deficit for California in the year ahead, citing rising Medi-Cal costs and his policy to provide free healthcare coverage to low-income undocumented immigrants. California has filed a lawsuit arguing that Trump lacks the authority to impose tariffs unilaterally.</p>
