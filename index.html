          <p>President Trump revealed the initial framework of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first such deal since implementing new tariffs. The agreement aims to boost American exports and reduce trade barriers, with final details expected soon. While specifics remain unclear, the deal includes maintaining a 10% tariff on UK imports and adjusting tariffs on UK autos, alongside commitments to enhance market access for American farmers and streamline customs procedures. The UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer joined the announcement remotely, expressing optimism about the future impact of the deal on both nations. Optimism regarding the deal has been reflected in the stock market, which has made gains since the announcement.</p>

Analysts suggest that recent market uncertainty has benefited Bitcoin, as investors question the U.S.'s safe-haven status. The article notes that Bitcoin's performance is supported by a pro-crypto Trump administration and growing investment from spot-ETF investors, highlighting its resilience in a volatile global environment.</p>

While the details of the agreement are still emerging, the deal is a significant political victory for Starmer and validates his strategy of engaging with Trump. Britain has avoided the harsh criticism directed at the European Union and China by the Trump administration, partly due to balanced trade flows and Starmer's diplomatic outreach. The agreement could help boost Britain's economic confidence, though challenges remain in balancing relations with both the U.S. and the European Union.</p>

          <p>Disbarred lawyer Tom Girardi, convicted of defrauding clients, was hospitalized and unable to attend a hearing to determine his prison placement. Girardi was taken to the hospital due to liver dysfunction, prompting his attorneys to request a delay. The judge had ordered a medical evaluation to confirm Girardi's condition after his lawyers argued he should remain in a nursing home due to dementia. Prosecutors seek a 14-year prison term, while Girardi's legal team pushes for a medical facility sentence.</p>

The article suggests questioning conventional wisdom that prioritizes self and adopting strategies to acquire the four constituent virtues of quiet ego. It recommends asking what others need that only you can provide, identifying areas for improvement around you, and affirming that you might be wrong and that you are not your emotions.</p>

The Fed voted to keep its benchmark interest rate steady due to economic uncertainty created by tariffs. Powell addressed Trump's criticisms, stating that it would not impact the Fed's job, and that the central bank will only consider economic data, the outlook, and the balance of risks.</p>

          <p>Filing for bankruptcy may be a good option to consider, but there are limitations to this debt relief solution. While bankruptcy can be a smart solution to consider in certain cases, it's important to understand that filing bankruptcy won't necessarily result in wiping out your debt, which is what allows you to start over from square one. Chapter 7 bankruptcy comes the closest to offering a full financial reset, but it won't discharge things like child support, most tax debts and student loans. Debt consolidation, debt management and debt settlement are all possible alternatives to bankruptcy.</p>

          <p>A Standard Chartered analyst has apologized for his earlier prediction that Bitcoin would reach $120,000 by the second quarter, stating that the target "may be too low." The analyst, Geoffrey Kendrick, cited significant inflows into U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds as a factor driving the price increase. He noted that the "dominant story for Bitcoin has changed again" and that it is now "all about flows." His comments come as Bitcoin once again topped the $100,000 level.</p>
