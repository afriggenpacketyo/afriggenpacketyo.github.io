          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs, who was acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering charges three months prior, appeared in court to be sentenced after being found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution involving his ex-girlfriends. Judge Arun Subramanian sentenced Combs to over four years in prison, noting his abuse of his ex-girlfriends and the use of his fame and power to "subjugate" his victims. Combs pleaded with the judge for mercy, stating he had nobody to blame but himself, and turned to his family to apologize for failing them. The court considered Combs' family ties but emphasized the harm caused to his victims. Optimism is relatively low considering the circumstances.</p>

          <p>Hamas responded to President Donald Trump's Gaza peace proposal, agreeing to release all remaining hostages if Israel withdraws from Gaza and specific field conditions are met, while also agreeing to hand over administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body. President Trump stated on social media that he believes Hamas is ready for a lasting peace and urged Israel to immediately stop bombing Gaza to ensure the safe release of hostages. Qatar has begun working with its partners in mediation with Egypt and the United States to complete discussions on the plan to end the war.

Despite the Arkansas State Crime Lab confirming the substance was perfume, Raghu was detained by Ice for a month due to an administrative error regarding his visa status. Raghu is appealing to Ice, explaining his case and the financial hardship his family faces due to his revoked work visa. This incident highlights potential issues within immigration enforcement and the impact of administrative errors on individuals seeking citizenship.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, determining that the Trump administration's effort to end birthright citizenship is likely unconstitutional. The First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the Trump administration, citing historical efforts to restrict birthright citizenship that were ultimately rejected. The court emphasized the importance of recognizing birthright citizenship based on the simple fact of being born in the United States, rather than on the actions of one's parents. The Trump administration has requested Supreme Court review of the constitutionality of the executive order.</p>

Roske, who now uses female pronouns, apologized to Kavanaugh and his family for the distress caused, while prosecutors had sought a longer sentence, citing the planned nature of the crime. The judge acknowledged Roske's remorse and mental health issues but emphasized the reprehensible nature of the crime. The sentencing comes amid concerns about rising political violence in the United States.</p>

          <p>Cerebras Systems, an artificial intelligence chipmaker, has withdrawn its plans for an IPO shortly after announcing that it had raised over $1 billion in a fundraising round. The company cited that it does not intend to conduct a proposed offering at this time, but a spokesperson said that Cerebras still hopes to go public as soon as possible. Cerebras has shifted its focus away from selling systems to providing a cloud service for accepting incoming queries to models that use its chips underneath.

          <p>A CBS News poll indicates that Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of political violence but anticipate an increase in it in the coming years. The poll highlights a concern that people of different political views cannot come together, contrasting with a generally positive view of interpersonal relationships outside of politics. Fewer than half of Americans feel comfortable publicly expressing political views, and most report infrequent political discussions with those holding differing opinions. The poll also reveals that majorities across the political spectrum believe the tone and civility of politics have worsened.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is considering offering migrant teenagers a $2,500 stipend if they agree to voluntarily return to their home countries, according to an internal federal notice. This initiative aims to encourage self-deportations, offering financial support for reintegration efforts following departure, though children from Mexico will not qualify. Critics argue that this approach distorts the process and could endanger vulnerable children, who need meaningful legal guidance instead of government cash payouts. The stipend is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to increase the number of unauthorized immigrants leaving the country.</p>

          <p>Sophie Roske, who pleaded guilty to attempting to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2022, was sentenced to eight years and one month in jail. The judge cited Roske's history of mental health issues and remorse, but also noted the seriousness of the crime. Roske apologized to Justice Kavanaugh for the distress caused and for contributing to the fear judges feel while doing their job. Prosecutors had requested a longer sentence of at least 30 years.</p>
