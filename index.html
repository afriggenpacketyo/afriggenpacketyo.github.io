          <p>Senne Lammens, Manchester United's 23-year-old goalkeeper, had a memorable debut, securing a clean sheet and earning humorous praise from fans who chanted "are you Schmeichel in disguise?". This reaction highlighted the supporters' eagerness for a dependable goalkeeping option amidst recent team struggles. Despite an ill-advised dash from his goal that nearly ended disastrously, Lammens demonstrated agility with a low save and confidence by repelling a one-on-one chance. Head coach Ruben Amorim, under significant pressure, acknowledged Lammens' strong performance, suggesting it was a good sign for the team's future as they seek consistent positive results.</p>

          <p>Louisiana State Police are defending their investigation into a fatal December crash that led to the death of 78-year-old Herman Hall and the subsequent suicide of LSU star Kyren Lacy. Lacy's attorney, Matthew Ory, presented new video evidence and data to HTV10, asserting that Lacy's vehicle was over 70 yards behind the impact point, contradicting police claims of his direct involvement. Ory also highlighted data showing another vehicle tailgating, potentially causing the crash, and questioned police directives during witness statements. State Police maintain that Lacy's reckless driving, specifically passing cars and swerving, initiated the chain of events leading to the tragic accident.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Turkey faces escalating pressure from the US and G7 nations to reduce its substantial energy dependence on Russia, which currently accounts for over 60% of its oil and 40% of its natural gas imports. This reliance has grown due to Russia offering discounted energy following EU sanctions, creating a complex geopolitical challenge for Ankara. In response, Turkey is actively pursuing a diversification strategy, evidenced by recent long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) contracts with US and Australian companies. These efforts, alongside promoting domestic and renewable energy sources, aim to bolster Turkey's energy security and improve strained relations with Western allies, necessitating a delicate balancing act.</p>

          <p>Traditional acoustic piano sales have dramatically declined since 1925, with only 17,294 units sold in 2024, reflecting significant shifts in cultural habits and economic realities for modern households. Piano technician Hannah Beckett notes that millennials, struggling with housing affordability, are less likely to purchase expensive instruments. However, the instrument's appeal endures through the growing popularity of more affordable and compact digital and hybrid pianos. Experts like Chris Syllaba of Jordan Kitt's Music believe this trend is positive, as digital instruments offer accurate sounds and functional keys, making them ideal for beginners. There's a hopeful outlook for a resurgence in piano playing as people seek engaging activities away from digital screens.</p>

          <p>Greater Manchester Police have significantly increased their presence, deploying hundreds of extra officers to reassure communities following Thursday's deadly synagogue attack that killed two Jewish men. The incident involved Jihad Al-Shamie, who drove a car into people and attempted to force entry into the synagogue before being fatally shot by armed police. Six individuals have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism offenses, with four granted extended detention warrants. Assistant Chief Constable Chris Sykes publicly questioned the appropriateness of a pro-Palestine march scheduled for Saturday, emphasizing the need for sensitivity to the city's grief. The attack and subsequent security measures underscore heightened tensions and ongoing investigations.</p>

          <p>Explosions and heavy gunfire erupted near Somalia's presidential palace as the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab militant group launched an attack on a major prison in Mogadishu.

Al-Shabab claimed responsibility, asserting that it had released prisoners, while Somali state media reported that security forces successfully repelled the attackers, killing several militants. The incident has unfortunately reignited widespread anxiety among residents, undermining the relative calm that Mogadishu had experienced in recent months due to government forces pushing back against the group.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police made over 400 arrests in central London during protests organized by Defend Our Juries in support of the proscribed group Palestine Action. These demonstrations proceeded despite urgent calls from ministers and police to postpone them out of respect for the victims of Thursday's deadly synagogue attack in Manchester. Organizers, representing approximately 1,000 participants, maintained their right to protest, arguing that cancelling would allow "terror to win" and expressing compassion for victims of multiple atrocities. The Met deployed 1,500 officers, with many arrests requiring physical removal due to non-compliance. Human rights groups criticized the arrests as breaches of international human rights obligations, while Jewish community leaders condemned the protests as "phenomenally tone deaf."</p>

The company had already shuttered over 520 pharmacies since its initial bankruptcy filing, representing a quarter of its stores. The Justice Department had previously accused Rite Aid of violating federal acts by filling unlawful prescriptions and ignoring internal warnings.

          <p>Billionaire Andrej Babiš's ANO movement secured a significant victory in the Czech parliamentary election, capturing 34.7% of the vote and marking a notable political comeback. This outcome could steer the country's foreign policy away from its current staunch support for Ukraine, potentially aligning it more closely with the pro-Russian stances adopted by Hungary and Slovakia. Babiš, who celebrated his "historic" result, aims to form a one-party government, which may necessitate seeking tacit support from anti-migrant and EU-skeptic groups.

While a 2020 law permits such commemorative coins, legal provisions typically prohibit the depiction of living persons on US currency.

          <p>Anti-government protesters in Georgia clashed violently with police while attempting to storm the presidential palace in the capital, Tbilisi, where security forces deployed water cannons and pepper spray to disperse the crowd. This intense unrest stems from last year's parliamentary election, which the pro-European Union opposition alleges was stolen, leading to a subsequent halt in EU accession talks. The demonstration coincided with local elections, largely boycotted by the opposition. One organizer, opera singer Paata Burchuladze, explicitly called for the arrest of six senior figures from the ruling Georgian Dream party, underscoring a profound political crisis exacerbated by a government crackdown on activists and independent media.</p>

Instead, their funding patch aims to reverse recent cuts to Medicaid that impact lawfully present noncitizens, such as refugees and asylum seekers. Republicans, however, continue to frame the debate around illegal immigration, a strategy identified by experts as a deliberate shift to politically "friendlier" ground, away from discussing the broader healthcare provisions.</p>

          <p>A senior Ukrainian intelligence official, Oleh Alexandrov, has publicly accused China of providing crucial satellite intelligence to Russia, enabling Moscow to more effectively launch missile strikes inside Ukraine. Alexandrov, from Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Agency, stated that there is evidence of extensive cooperation, with China allegedly identifying strategic targets, including those benefiting from foreign investment, for Russian forces. This serious accusation follows earlier claims by President Volodymyr Zelensky that China was supplying weapons and gunpowder to Russia. The alleged intelligence sharing deepens international concerns about China's role in the ongoing conflict and its potential to exacerbate the war.</p>

          <p>Panelists on "Washington Week With The Atlantic" engaged in a detailed discussion about the current government shutdown, exploring its unique characteristics and the broader political implications. Ashley Parker of The Atlantic highlighted that while President Donald Trump may not have initiated this shutdown, he perceives it as politically advantageous and an opportunity to advance his goal of "deconstruction of the administrative state." However, there's an acknowledgment within his inner circle that such an aggressive strategy could trigger significant public backlash. The discussion underscored the ongoing partisan leverage Democrats are attempting to exert, with the looming threat of layoffs for many government workers adding to the instability.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone strike on a railway station in Shostka, north-east Ukraine, has caused at least 30 injuries, including three children aged 8, 11, and 14, according to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Preliminary reports indicate that train staff and passengers were present at the site, with two passenger trains directly hit. Zelensky vehemently condemned the attack as an act of terrorism targeting civilians and urgently called for decisive action from Western allies, specifically requesting more advanced air defense weaponry. This incident highlights Russia's intensified aerial assaults on Ukrainian railway infrastructure, which Ukrainian officials believe are designed to sow panic and disrupt vital communication lines to frontline communities.</p>

          <p>Families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza are experiencing a complex mix of hope and profound fear following Hamas's conditional response to the Trump administration's peace plan. While Hamas agreed to release all remaining hostages, both living and deceased, it also requested further negotiations on several key points outlined in the proposal. Vicky Cohen, whose son Nimrod is among the captives, articulated this sentiment, expressing "hope and expectation" while also fearing that "something will go wrong." Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that Israel is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan, with negotiations expected to resume in Egypt, but the families remain cautious given previous disappointments and the fragile nature of the situation.</p>

          <p>Veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been officially added to the Los Angeles Dodgers' National League Division Series roster, marking his anticipated return after being notably absent from the wild-card round. This strategic move is intended to provide crucial left-handed pitching depth, particularly against the formidable left-handed hitters in the Philadelphia Phillies' lineup. Kershaw, a future Hall of Famer, is expected to pitch from the bullpen, offering a steady and experienced presence that the team visibly lacked during their previous series struggles. Additionally, catcher Will Smith remains active on the roster as he continues to recover from a fractured hand, though his starting status for Game 1 remains uncertain.</p>

The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) prosecuted GWR, highlighting the company's prior awareness of the risks associated with droplight windows and its failure to implement identified safety measures from a risk assessment conducted two months before the incident. This preventable tragedy, which echoed a similar death in 2016, has prompted industry-wide changes.

While the Bank of England aims to position the UK at the forefront of digital innovation, focusing on facilitating competing stablecoins under a robust regulatory framework, it has not entirely ruled out a central bank digital currency (CBDC). In stark contrast, the US, under Donald Trump, advocates for a private, dollar-backed stablecoin regime that explicitly excludes the Federal Reserve. Critics, including Nobel laureate Simon Johnson, warn that this approach could transform the US into a "wild west" for digital currencies, potentially leading to future financial crises.
