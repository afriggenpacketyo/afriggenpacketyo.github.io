          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators is urging the U.S. government to suspend funding for the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), an Israeli-backed private organization. Citing "grave" concerns over safety and effectiveness, the senators point to reports of over 700 Palestinians being killed while trying to access GHF's militarized distribution sites. They advocate for resuming support for established UN aid mechanisms to address the severe and worsening starvation crisis in Gaza, where a UNICEF spokesperson warns that therapeutic food supplies for malnourished children are nearly depleted.</p>

          <p>Preparations are moving forward to convert a Boeing 747-8, a gift from the Qatari royal family, for use as Air Force One. Senior U.S. officials have reportedly seen the schematics for the jumbo jet, which is valued at $400 million and will be donated to the presidential library after President Trump's term. The arrangement has raised concerns about potential violations of the Constitution's emoluments clause, which restricts presidents from accepting gifts from foreign states. The aircraft will require extensive and costly security checks and renovations before it is ready for presidential use.</p>

          <p>An analysis by the BBC's international editor suggests Israel's recent announcements of "tactical pauses" and aid airdrops in Gaza are primarily a gesture to appease allied nations horrified by the starvation crisis. The article argues these measures are insufficient and critiques the existing U.S.-Israeli-backed GHF aid system as an inhumane "death trap" that has led to over 1,000 Palestinian deaths. It emphasizes that only a full ceasefire and unrestricted land-based aid operations can truly address the catastrophic humanitarian situation, which a UN official describes as "weaponized hunger."</p>

          <p>A joint investigation by CBS News and The Marshall Project reveals how routine drug screenings in hospitals are wrongly implicating new mothers, with devastating consequences. Common foods like poppy seeds can trigger false positive results for opiates, leading to immediate child welfare investigations that can separate mothers from their newborns. The report details cases where mothers, including one who was given morphine by the hospital during labor, were forced into "safety plans" and faced intense scrutiny for months. Critics and medical groups argue that these tests are unreliable parenting assessments and call for reforms to prevent such traumatic experiences.</p>

          <p>Actress Kristin Scott Thomas is making her directorial debut with the film "My Mother's Wedding," a project deeply rooted in her own childhood experiences with loss. The film, starring Scarlett Johansson and Sienna Miller, explores the story of three daughters grappling with their past as their mother prepares for her third marriage. Thomas, whose father and stepfather were both Royal Navy pilots killed in accidents, used her personal history of growing up with a missing piece of her family puzzle to shape the screenplay. The acclaimed actress reflects on how this creative endeavor has been an intensely personal and fulfilling experience.</p>

          <h2>Research Reveals 4-Day Workweek Boosts Happiness by Increasing On-the-Job Effectiveness</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent global trials of a four-day, 32-hour workweek have shown a significant boost in employee happiness, and it's not just due to having more free time. Lead researcher Juliet Schor explains that a major factor is that employees feel more effective and productive at work. By compressing their tasks into fewer hours, teams are forced to eliminate busywork and streamline processes, leading to a greater sense of accomplishment and control. This feeling of being better at their jobs has a strong positive impact on their overall well-being and work-life balance.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative Party, has announced that her party would seek to ban all NHS doctors from taking strike action if it returns to power. The proposal would place doctors under the same legal restrictions as police and military personnel, preventing widespread industrial action. The announcement comes as resident doctors began a new five-day strike over pay, with the British Medical Association (BMA) arguing that wages have fallen by a fifth in real terms since 2008. Badenoch accused the BMA of becoming increasingly militant and argued the policy is necessary to protect patients.</p>

          <p>Charities are warning that almost £275 million in government-allocated Child Trust Funds (CTFs) intended for disadvantaged young people in the UK have not been claimed. These tax-free savings accounts were set up for children born between 2002 and 2011, with the government providing an initial deposit. The Share Foundation, a charity that helps locate the funds, reports that over £400 million is unclaimed in total, with a majority belonging to low-income individuals. The charity is calling for an automatic release mechanism to ensure the funds reach the account holders when they turn 21.</p>

          <p>French companies are being forced to adapt their strategies in Africa as France's long-standing political and economic influence, known as "Francafrique," collapses, particularly in the Sahel region. Amid growing anti-French sentiment and competition from nations like China and Turkey, French firms are losing preferential treatment and market share. Some, like nuclear corporation Orano in Niger, have had operations suspended or licenses revoked. In response, businesses are shifting focus to non-French-speaking African countries and adopting more indirect strategies, such as forming local partnerships to maintain a presence without provoking rejection.</p>

His story personalizes the mass starvation crisis affecting nearly one million children in the enclave, where food and medical supplies are scarce due to Israeli restrictions. Doctors warn that the chronic malnutrition is causing irreversible damage to a generation of children, leading to stunting and long-term neurological impairments. Despite a recent "tactical pause" in fighting to allow some aid, the situation remains catastrophic, with families struggling daily to find any food or water.</p>

          <p>This analytical essay posits that Donald Trump's actions are best understood not through a desire for power or prestige, but through an insatiable avarice rooted in a worldview of adversarial dealmaking. The author argues that for Trump, deals are a way to subvert impersonal markets, polish his brand, and amass wealth, regardless of whether the deals succeed or fail. His approach to tariffs is framed as a "kula system" of exchange, designed to make him the apex player in a global prestige game, which ultimately serves his primary goal of monetary gain. Cryptocurrency is presented as the ultimate vehicle for this egocentric economic strategy.</p>

The manufacturer's aircraft production and delivery numbers have improved, and investors have responded positively, with the company's stock up over 30% this year. Despite ongoing challenges, including a production cap from the FAA following a January door-plug incident, major airline customers have noted improvements in quality and delivery predictability. Analysts now expect the company to post its first annual profit since 2018 next year. (not investment advice)</p>
