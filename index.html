          <p>A 40-year-old New York man faces federal cyberstalking charges for allegedly making threatening calls to a family member of the recently murdered UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson. Prosecutors state the man left voicemails expressing approval of the killing and wishing a similar fate upon the family member and Thompson's children. The calls began just hours after the fatal shooting in Manhattan. If convicted, the suspect could face up to five years in prison for his actions, which authorities described as an attempt to increase the family's pain and suffering during their time of grief.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Rossi, an American man who faked his own death and fled to Scotland to evade prosecution, has been found guilty of a 2008 sexual assault charge in a Utah court. The case involved an ex-fiancée who testified that Rossi held her down and sexually assaulted her. Rossi was apprehended in Glasgow after being recognized in a hospital while being treated for COVID, thanks to an Interpol notice. This conviction is for one of two separate sexual assault cases he faces in Utah, marking a significant step in a long and unusual international legal saga.</p>

          <h2>Gallup Poll Finds American Alcohol Consumption at a Record Low</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has dropped to 54%, a record low not seen since 1958. This decline coincides with a growing belief, especially among young people, that even moderate drinking is harmful to one's health. Researchers suggest that increased public knowledge about alcohol's risks, such as cancer and depression, is a primary driver of this trend. The shift is also supported by the rising popularity of non-alcoholic alternatives and social trends like 'Dry January,' indicating a potential long-term change in societal drinking habits.</p>

          <p>The NBA's board of governors has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to an ownership group led by private equity co-founder Bill Chisholm. The deal values the franchise at a reported $6.1 billion, making it the second-largest sale price for a US sports team. Chisholm, a Massachusetts native, will acquire a controlling stake of at least 51%, with plans to buy out minority shareholders by 2028 at a higher valuation. The outgoing owner, Wyc Grousbeck, is expected to remain as CEO during the transition period.</p>

          <p>A study from Virginia Tech has demonstrated for the first time that ordinary pet dogs can be effectively trained to locate the egg masses of the invasive spotted lanternfly. This destructive pest threatens agriculture, and finding its well-camouflaged egg masses is crucial to controlling its spread. In the study, volunteer dog-and-handler teams showed high accuracy rates in sniffing out the eggs in both indoor and outdoor settings. This research suggests a promising and accessible new method for communities to engage in citizen science and help manage a significant environmental problem.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is warning consumers that popular mousse-form sunscreens, including products from brands like Supergoop!, may not be effective. The agency issued warning letters to five companies, stating the products are unapproved drugs that have not been proven to protect against harmful UV rays. Furthermore, the FDA raised safety concerns about the products' packaging, which resembles whipped cream canisters and could lead to accidental ingestion. The companies have been instructed to address the violations, which include misbranding and lack of required approval.</p>

          <p>China's Xiluodu dam, one of the world's largest hydropower stations, has stopped using Western-made industrial chips in its control systems due to national security concerns. The move reflects growing alarm over the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyberattacks, highlighted by past events like the Stuxnet virus. This shift away from components made by companies such as Siemens and Schneider is part of a broader Chinese strategy to achieve technological self-sufficiency. The action underscores the deepening technological divide and mistrust between China and Western nations in key industrial sectors.</p>

          <p>As summer temperatures rise, many low-income Americans are struggling to afford the high cost of electricity needed for air conditioning. The article highlights the financial strain on individuals who rely on federal assistance programs like LIHEAP to pay their utility bills. This challenge is compounded by a White House budget proposal that would eliminate the LIHEAP program, which the administration has called 'failed' and 'mired in fraud.' Climate scientists note that rising global temperatures are directly increasing electricity demand and costs, further burdening vulnerable households. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following an $8 billion takeover, new Paramount chief David Ellison has unveiled an ambitious plan to revitalize the historic studio. The strategy involves nearly doubling the annual feature film output to 15-20 movies and heavily investing in key intellectual property like 'Top Gun,' 'Star Trek,' and 'Transformers.' Ellison aims to restore Paramount as a premier destination for top filmmakers and talent, moving the company's center of gravity to Hollywood.

          <h2>UK Scientists Warn of 'Firewave' Risk in Cities Amid Hot, Dry Summers</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Imperial College London are warning that UK cities face a growing threat from 'firewaves,' a term they coined to describe multiple, simultaneous urban wildfires triggered by prolonged hot, dry weather. As climate change leads to more extreme heat, vegetation in urban green spaces becomes dangerously flammable, increasing the risk of widespread fires that could overwhelm emergency services. Recent blazes in London and Edinburgh underscore this emerging vulnerability, prompting calls for new public safety strategies to address a risk once considered primarily rural.</p>

          <p>Juneau, Alaska, experienced record-breaking flooding after an 'outburst flood' from a basin dammed by the Mendenhall Glacier, but a potential catastrophe was largely averted. Water levels in the Mendenhall River surpassed the previous record, threatening nearly 1,000 structures. However, newly installed temporary 'Hesco' barriers held, resulting in minimal flooding and damage to property. The annual event, a consequence of a retreating glacier due to climate change, has prompted officials to seek a more permanent solution to protect the capital city.</p>

          <p>A new survey by travel tech company TravelPerk found that over half of all business travelers have had loved ones join them on work-related trips. This trend, often called 'bleisure,' allows professionals to blend business with personal vacation time, reclaim family time, and save money on travel. The practice is even more common among C-suite executives, with 73% reporting they have brought partners, children, or friends along. While many companies quietly accept this, employees often navigate a policy 'grey zone' regarding expenses and transparency.</p>

          <p>A large study published in the British Medical Journal suggests that drug treatment for ADHD provides significant benefits beyond managing core symptoms. Based on data from over 148,000 people in Sweden, researchers found that taking ADHD medication was associated with notable reductions in the risk of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminal behavior. These findings provide strong evidence that medication, by helping to reduce impulsivity and inattention, can have a positive, long-term impact on major life outcomes for individuals with the disorder.</p>
