          <p>Iran and Israel have exchanged attacks, escalating tensions in the Middle East. Israel initiated airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, scientists, and military leaders, claiming it was a preemptive measure to neutralize Iran's nuclear capabilities.

          <p>Gulf states are increasingly concerned about being drawn into the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Saudi Arabia has voiced strong condemnation of Israel's attacks on Iran, highlighting the delicate balancing act it faces between improving relations with Israel and maintaining solidarity with the Palestinian cause. The Gulf states are wary of potential attacks on their own territory, especially given the presence of U.S. troops and the possibility of renewed attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.

          <p>As Iran retaliates against Israel following Israeli strikes on Tehran, concerns are mounting in the U.S. regarding potential involvement in the escalating conflict. While Secretary of State Marco Rubio initially stated the U.S. was not involved in the strikes, President Trump's comments suggest a degree of support. Analysts suggest Iran may target U.S. interests in the region through missile attacks or sleeper cell operations within the U.S. The U.S. is closely monitoring the situation, balancing its support for Israel with the need to avoid direct conflict with Iran.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Debt settlement involves negotiating with creditors to pay less than the full amount owed, typically for unsecured debts like credit cards and personal loans. The process usually entails halting payments to creditors and instead saving money in a dedicated account, while a debt relief company negotiates with creditors to reduce the balances. While it can offer relief by reducing debt and avoiding bankruptcy, it also comes with risks such as credit damage, fees, and potential tax consequences. Debt settlement is best suited for individuals with significant unsecured debt who are already behind on payments and willing to accept a hit to their credit score.</p>

          <p>Kim Sajet, the director of the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, has resigned two weeks after President Trump publicly stated he was firing her. Trump had accused Sajet of being partisan and a supporter of DEI initiatives. The Smithsonian Board of Regents affirmed its independence in personnel decisions and directed Secretary Lonnie Bunch to ensure unbiased content in museums. Sajet stated that stepping aside was in the best interest of the institution. The resignation comes amid concerns about political interference in the Smithsonian's operations.</p>

          <p>The increasing popularity of 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) services raises questions about their role in consumer spending and potential risks. BNPL services, like Klarna and Affirm, allow consumers to split payments into installments, making larger purchases more manageable. However, concerns arise as BNPL is used for everyday expenses like groceries and the prospect of financing conveniences like food delivery. As regulations evolve and BNPL companies face financial challenges, consumers must consider the long-term implications of relying on these services.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's military parade is estimated to produce over 2 million kilograms of planet-heating pollution, equivalent to the emissions from producing 67 million plastic bags. The analysis by the Institute for Policy Studies and the Guardian considers emissions from the parade route, vehicle transport, and fuel production. The parade, celebrating the U.S. Army's 250th anniversary, will feature numerous military vehicles and aircraft. Critics argue that the parade's environmental impact is wasteful and misplaced, especially considering cuts to critical services and climate programs.</p>
