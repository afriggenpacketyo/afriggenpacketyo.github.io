          <p>A man in Bradford, UK, has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 28 years for murdering his wife. Habibur Masum fatally stabbed Kulsuma Akter 26 times as she was pushing their infant son in a pram in April of last year. The court heard that Masum, who had a history of threatening his wife, had stalked her and attacked her in a premeditated act of violence. The judge described the attack as "vicious and merciless," highlighting the public nature of the brutal crime.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street expectations, driven by strong performance in its Europe, Middle East, and Africa segment. However, the company experienced a 1% decline in global unit case volume, with North America, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific markets all seeing a drop in demand. Despite the mixed volume results, Coke's organic revenue grew by 5%, and the company narrowed its full-year earnings forecast to the upper end of its previous guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has announced it will end its long-standing open seating policy, with assigned seats becoming available for flights beginning January 27, 2026. Customers will be able to book these flights starting July 29, choosing from various fare bundles that include options like extra legroom. This change is part of a broader strategic shift for the discount carrier, which also recently eliminated its "bags fly free" policy and is overhauling its boarding process to group passengers by seat location.</p>

          <p>Following a fatal military jet crash into a school in Dhaka that killed at least 31 people, a national debate has emerged over the safety of conducting air force training exercises over densely populated cities. The incident, which involved a Chinese-made F-7 BGI aircraft, has led to public outcry and renewed calls to relocate military bases away from urban centers. Critics and safety advocates argue that such training poses an unnecessary risk to civilians, questioning the urban planning and risk assessments that allowed for a school to operate so close to a military flight path.</p>

          <p>A detailed report reveals the intense internal negotiations and divisions within the House Republican conference to pass President Trump's major legislative package. The process required GOP leadership to manage holdouts from fiscal conservatives and hard-liners, who ultimately negotiated directly with the White House to secure concessions in exchange for their votes. The saga, which involved all-night sessions and dramatic last-minute vote changes, exposed fractures within the party and a dynamic where some members now prefer to bypass congressional leadership to deal directly with the president.</p>

          <p>The European Union is reportedly considering its "Anti-Coercion Instrument" (ACI), a powerful set of trade defense measures, as a potential response if the U.S. imposes a threatened 30% tariff on EU imports.

The move is being contemplated as a last resort to deter what the EU would see as economic coercion, highlighting the escalating trade tensions between the two major economic partners.

This influence was highlighted by Nvidia's recent announcement that it expects to resume sales of its H20 AI chips to China, a reversal of previous restrictions that Huang had lobbied against. Huang's arguments, aligning with some White House officials, suggest that limiting U.S. tech exports ultimately aids Chinese competitors, positioning him as a key figure in navigating U.S.-China tech policy.

          <p>A new report indicates that over half of the Pentagon's budget from 2020-2024 went to private contractors, a trend set to continue with a proposed budget exceeding $1 trillion. An opinion piece argues this massive spending on advanced weapons systems enriches military companies but does not necessarily improve national security, often subsidizing underperforming technology while neglecting military personnel and veterans. The author advocates for a strategic shift towards diplomacy and better support for troops, rather than allowing corporate interests to drive an accelerated and costly arms race.</p>

          <p>In response to the Attorney General issuing subpoenas for the medical records of transgender youth, legal experts are advocating for courts to recognize a formal patient-physician privilege. This legal shield, similar to attorney-client privilege, would protect sensitive medical information from government probes aimed at chilling the provision of gender-affirming care. The article argues that since federal law like HIPAA does not prevent disclosure under subpoena, a court-created privilege is necessary to protect patient privacy and ensure access to care amid political attacks on transgender and reproductive health.</p>
