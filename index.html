          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 19:24:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration's request to lift a lower court's injunction, allowing the termination of the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program for approximately 350,000 Venezuelan migrants. This decision means these individuals could lose their work permits and deportation protections while legal proceedings continue. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented. The Trump administration argues the program is "contrary to the national interest," while TPS beneficiaries contend ending the protections would cause significant harm, forcing them to return to a dangerous country. The case highlights ongoing legal battles over immigration policy and the executive branch's authority.</p>

          <p>Linda Stermer, a Michigan woman, has been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of her husband, Todd Stermer, nearly 20 years after his death.

A previous conviction was overturned due to a violation of her rights during the initial trial.

          <p>Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S. debt rating, citing congressional gridlock and potential enactment of a Republican fiscal plan that would increase the federal deficit, has intensified debate over the GOP's tax and spending cut package. Fiscally conservative Republicans are leveraging the downgrade to demand deeper cuts to federal programs, including Medicaid and food assistance. The Republican plan would add roughly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. As Speaker Mike Johnson aims for a vote by Friday, the downgrade bolsters arguments for fiscal responsibility but faces opposition from moderate Republicans wary of cutting social programs.</p>

The current theory of the Universe's origin cannot explain the existence of planets, stars, and galaxies. The US-led Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) and the Japanese-led Hyper-K aim to identify differences between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos, which could explain why matter prevailed over antimatter.

          <p>Taxpayers in Maricopa County, Arizona, continue to pay for legal and compliance bills stemming from former Sheriff Joe Arpaio's immigration crackdowns, with costs projected to reach $352 million by midsummer 2026. The crackdowns, which led to a 2013 racial profiling verdict, resulted in court-ordered overhauls of the sheriff's office. Despite progress in some areas, the agency has not yet been deemed fully compliant, and faces a significant backlog of internal affairs cases. Critics question the ongoing expenses and whether the court supervision should continue.</p>

          <p>Kim Kardashian, known for her mastery of image and attention, recently testified in court wearing millions of dollars worth of diamonds, signaling a reclamation of her freedom and identity. The outfit choice, seen by some as unconventional, comes after a period of scaling back her displays of wealth following a traumatic robbery in 2016. Kardashian's decision to wear such extravagant jewelry is a message that she is reclaiming her right to engage in conspicuous consumption. In a world where every moment is a photo opportunity, Kardashian continues to shape her narrative through her appearance.</p>

          <p>Following former President Joe Biden's announcement of an "aggressive" prostate cancer diagnosis, experts explain that it's not uncommon for older patients to receive such diagnoses at later stages. Several factors could contribute, including a decision to forgo PSA-based screening, rapid cancer growth between screenings, borderline screening results, or absence of symptoms. Experts emphasize that recent advances have greatly improved treatment outcomes, even for advanced cases. While prostate cancer diagnoses like Biden's are serious, they are increasingly manageable with modern medical advancements.</p>

          <p>During a sex-trafficking trial, Diddy is alleged to have used a hammer to try to break into his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura's apartment after assaulting her. Ms Ventura's former best friend Kerry Morgan recounted how Mr Combs allegedly tried to smash his way into Ventura's apartment in the aftermath, and described the incident as terrifying. Ms Morgan also said that during a vacation in Jamaica, she saw him drag Ms Ventura down a 50-yard hallway by her hair because she was "taking too long in the bathroom".</p>
