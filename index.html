          <p>Madame Gandhi's latest album, "Let Me Be Water," was inspired by the musician's experience with excessive waste during the pandemic in Los Angeles, prompting her to reflect on unsustainable urban lifestyles. Gandhi, whose real name is Kiran Gandhi, realized the impact of her New York City upbringing, where convenience often overshadowed environmental consciousness. The album serves as a message to raise awareness about climate change and sustainability, urging listeners to reconsider their consumption habits and environmental impact. Gandhi hopes to inspire a shift towards more sustainable practices and a greater appreciation for the planet through her music.</p>

          <p>A 38-year-old judge, Ehsum Bagheri, was stabbed to death in Shiraz, Iran, while en route to work, prompting an investigation by authorities. The Iranian state media identified the judge as having over 12 years of experience in the city's judicial department. The two assailants involved in the attack remain at large, and no group has claimed responsibility, though the news agency labeled the killing a "terrorist act." This incident follows a similar event in January when two hardline judges were fatally shot in Tehran, judges who allegedly participated in mass executions in the 1980s.</p>

          <p>King Charles III made his first trip to Canada since his coronation to deliver the Speech from the Throne, opening the 45th session of the Canadian Parliament in Ottawa. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited the King, a move viewed as strategic amid strained relations with the United States, to underscore Canada's sovereignty. This marks the first time a king has opened a new session of parliament, with the last monarch to deliver the address being Elizabeth II in 1977. The King's visit included meetings with Canadian leaders and participation in a tree-planting ceremony, symbolizing the enduring relationship between Canada and the Crown.</p>

          <p>Following an incident in Liverpool where a car rammed into a crowd, injuring dozens, the Merseyside Police promptly released details about the driver being a 53-year-old white British man. This quick disclosure aimed to prevent the spread of false anti-Muslim speculation online, as had occurred after a previous violent episode in Southport where a false name circulated for a day before authorities clarified the suspect's identity. The police's proactive approach reflects a lesson learned from past incidents where delayed information led to the spread of misinformation and subsequent social unrest. The police are still investigating the motive, but it is not being treated as terrorism.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering abolishing the two-child benefit cap, a policy that restricts means-tested benefits for families with more than two children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledged the policy has contributed to poverty but cautioned that reversing it would be costly. The decision is expected in the autumn, coinciding with the publication of the government's child poverty strategy, spearheaded by Phillipson and Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall. The Child Poverty Taskforce is assessing the cap, with Phillipson emphasizing that "nothing is off the table."</p>

          <p>Sherron Watkins and Cynthia Cooper, who exposed accounting fraud at Enron and WorldCom, argue against Republican lawmakers' proposal to eliminate the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (P.C.A.O.B.). They emphasize the board's critical role in preventing accounting fraud and restoring trust in financial reporting after the Enron and WorldCom scandals. The authors stress that the P.C.A.O.B.'s independence from the Securities and Exchange Commission (S.E.C.) is vital for its effectiveness, particularly in overseeing audits of overseas companies listed on U.S. exchanges. Eliminating the board would increase the risk of corporate disasters and undermine investor confidence, they contend.</p>

          <p>Emily Keegin critiques President Trump's redecoration of the Oval Office, describing it as a "gilded rococo hellscape" and questioning if this reflects the country's values. The author highlights the abundance of golden objects, Rococo wall appliqués, and gold-framed presidential portraits, drawing comparisons to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. Keegin explores the historical context of Rococo design, noting its association with European Baroque and its later embrace by the bourgeoisie in America. She argues that Trump's aesthetic is not French but deeply American, reflecting a desire for opulence and conspicuous consumption, and how it has become a symbol of wealth.</p>

          <p>A shift away from Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives in corporate America has led to the elimination of over 2,600 DEI-related jobs since early 2023. This decline follows a surge in DEI hiring after George Floyd's murder in 2020, as companies now face backlash from conservative critics who view DEI as discriminatory. Companies like Verizon, Walmart, and Meta are either ending DEI policies or rebranding them with more generic terms. This trend has significantly impacted DEI professionals, particularly women and people of color, who are struggling to find new employment as their profession is publicly vilified.</p>

          <p>North Korea has criticized the United States' plan for a "Golden Dome" missile shield, stating that it could "turn outer space into a potential nuclear war field." Pyongyang considers Washington an adversary and routinely condemns joint military drills between the US and South Korea. The North Korean foreign ministry slammed the plan as "the height of self-righteousness [and] arrogance." The plan, which President Donald Trump intends to unveil by the end of his term, is aimed at countering "next-generation" aerial threats to the US, including ballistic and cruise missiles.</p>

Both countries are currently in a 90-day tariff pause and are seeking a deal with Washington to avoid further duty increases.
