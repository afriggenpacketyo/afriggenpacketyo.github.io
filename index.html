          <p>England's captain, Harry Kane, will not participate in the upcoming friendly match against Wales because of a minor ankle injury sustained during a recent Bayern Munich game. The team's management expressed hope that their record goalscorer will recover in time for the World Cup qualifier against Latvia next week. In his absence, the captaincy for the Wembley match will be assigned to either Jordan Henderson, John Stones, or Declan Rice.</p>

          <p>In a major policy announcement, Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch declared plans to eliminate stamp duty on the purchase of main homes in England and Northern Ireland. The proposal aims to boost home ownership and social mobility, with the party estimating the cost at £9 billion annually after 2029, funded by planned savings. This move sets a clear policy distinction from the Labour government and is part of a broader platform of new policies intended to regain political momentum.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Commerce Department has added twelve China-based companies to its "entity list," a trade blacklist, for their involvement in supplying American components for drones used by Hamas and Houthi militants. Ten of the firms allegedly facilitated the purchase of these parts, while another was linked to a network supplying Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. This action effectively bars the companies from receiving U.S. exports, as obtaining the required licenses will be highly unlikely, reflecting an effort to curb threats to American national security.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is warning that a shortage of air traffic controllers, exacerbated by the ongoing government shutdown, could lead to more flight delays across the United States. Staffing shortfalls have already caused slowdowns at several airports, and the controllers' union highlighted that its members are working long hours without pay. This situation echoes a previous shutdown in 2018-2019, which ended after similar air travel disruptions created widespread pressure for a resolution.</p>

          <p>The New Jersey gubernatorial race between Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli is narrowing, with the state's Latino electorate identified as a potentially decisive factor. While polls show Sherrill with a slight lead, Republicans have made significant inroads with Latino voters in the state, as seen in the 2024 presidential election results. Democrats are now focusing on mobilizing this demographic by addressing key issues like the economy and inflation, hoping to reverse recent trends and secure a victory.</p>

          <p>A shootout between rival factions within South Sudan's unified protection force has left at least 14 soldiers dead, with the army attributing the violence to a "love triangle." The conflict reportedly began as a personal dispute between two officers, one loyal to the president and the other to his rival, over a woman at a local market. The altercation quickly escalated, with bodyguards opening fire and the violence spreading to nearby checkpoints, highlighting the fragile security situation in a nation already on the brink of renewed civil war.</p>

          <p>A Guardian editorial argues that it is a "moral and diplomatic imperative" for UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to attend the upcoming Cop30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil. The article contends that with global emissions pledges falling short of the 1.5C target, the presence of world leaders is crucial for securing a more ambitious agreement. It urges Starmer not to shy away due to domestic political fears, but to reaffirm the UK's commitment to climate action and leverage its influence in the multilateral talks.</p>

Key moments include him listening to a specific rap song, making multiple failed 911 calls, and asking ChatGPT about liability for a fire started by a cigarette.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has secured a multi-billion dollar deal to supply OpenAI with its graphics processing units (GPUs), establishing itself as a serious challenger in the AI chip market dominated by Nvidia. This move is seen as significant for creating competition, as Nvidia currently holds over 90% of the market share for AI data center silicon. The partnership not only provides a major revenue stream for AMD but also allows OpenAI to diversify its suppliers, potentially easing concerns about Nvidia's near-monopoly.</p>

The repeal was a key campaign promise of Chancellor Friedrich Merz's center-right party and passed with support from the anti-immigration AfD party. Critics, including the Green Party, argue that reversing the more liberalized law sends the wrong signal to highly skilled immigrants at a time when Germany faces significant demographic and labor shortages.</p>
