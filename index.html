          <p>British police are questioning five men, including four Iranian nationals, regarding an alleged terror plot targeting a specific location in the UK. Arrests were made in multiple cities, with authorities informing and supporting the targeted site. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described these operations as reflecting some of the largest counter-terrorism efforts in recent years. Footage showed armed officers making arrests, and military personnel were reportedly involved in at least one raid as part of the investigation into the alleged terror plot.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs is set to face a jury trial in New York on sexual assault and trafficking charges, with jury selection expected to be a difficult process given the high-profile nature of the case.

The defense and prosecution will focus on identifying and eliminating biased jurors, while the judge aims for a fair and impartial panel.</p>

If verified, this would predate the Hipparchus star catalogue from Greece, previously recognized as the oldest.

          <p>President Trump announced plans to impose a 100 percent tariff on movies produced outside the United States, claiming it is a national security threat. The Motion Picture Association declined to comment on the proposal. The vast majority of movies shown in American cinemas are produced in the United States, but Hollywood has increasingly turned to foreign locales for filming due to cost savings and tax incentives. Thousands of middle-class film workers in the United States have seen work evaporate.</p>
