          <p>Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, has been found to repeatedly generate false information regarding the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. In multiple instances reviewed by DW Fact Check, Grok incorrectly identified recent photos of malnourished children in Gaza as being from different conflicts in Iraq and Yemen years ago. This misinformation was then amplified by users on X (formerly Twitter) to downplay the severity of the situation. The incidents highlight the significant risks of relying on AI for rapid fact-checking, as the tool has been shown to produce inaccurate and misleading claims about sensitive global events.</p>

The company's annual recurring revenue has surged to $13 billion, with projections to exceed $20 billion by the end of the year. This growth is fueled by a significant increase in paid business users for ChatGPT, which has climbed to five million. The funding round, which was five times oversubscribed, includes major contributions from Dragoneer Investment Group and underscores intense investor interest in the competitive AI sector.</p>

          <p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced a significant drop of over 700 points as investors reacted to a combination of negative economic news. A weaker-than-expected jobs report for July, which showed the addition of only 73,000 jobs, signaled a potential slowdown in the labor market. Compounding these concerns, the Trump administration announced new tariffs on over 60 countries, increasing uncertainty and raising fears of higher inflation and stagnating economic growth. The poor employment data has increased market expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities in Tennessee are searching for 28-year-old Austin Robert Drummond, the primary suspect in a quadruple murder in Tiptonville. The victims, who were family members of Drummond's girlfriend, were discovered after an infant was found abandoned on a lawn, which led police to the crime scene. Officials have described the killings as a "targeted attack" and are reassuring the public that it was not a random act of violence. Drummond, who has a prior criminal record, is considered armed and dangerous, and the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is actively pursuing several leads.</p>

The club is experiencing a severe crisis under owner Dejphon Chansiri, marked by late wage payments to players and staff, unpaid tax bills, and mounting debts. Several first-team players have already terminated their contracts over the payment issues, leaving the team with a skeleton squad. The club is also under a transfer embargo, further complicating its ability to compete in the Championship season.</p>

          <p>Florida's Division of Emergency Management has released a heavily redacted hurricane evacuation plan for the Alligator Alcatraz migrant detention center, prompting criticism from lawmakers and advocates. The 33-page document blacks out crucial details, including the locations of alternate facilities where detainees would be moved during a major storm. While state officials assert the facility can withstand a Category 2 hurricane, critics like Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz argue that the lack of transparency is unacceptable. They are demanding a clear, confirmed plan to ensure the safety of detainees in the event of a powerful hurricane.</p>

          <p>Sudan is facing a deeper crisis of fragmentation after a paramilitary-led coalition announced a rival government based in the Darfur region. The new "Transitional Peace Government," led by RSF General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, claims authority over the entire country, a move swiftly rejected by the internationally recognized government in Khartoum, the African Union, and the UN. This development complicates efforts to end the brutal civil war that began in April 2023, which has already created the world's largest displacement crisis.

          <p>The UK Met Office has named Storm Floris, which is forecast to hit the country on Monday with strong winds and heavy rain. It is the sixth named storm of the season and the first since January, with wind gusts potentially reaching 60-70 mph in northern regions and up to 85 mph in exposed coastal areas of Scotland. The storm's impact is expected to be greater than a typical winter storm because trees are in full leaf, increasing the risk of falling branches and power disruptions.

If Utah and Miami cannot secure financial backing, the professional rugby union competition could shrink to just seven teams. League commissioner Nic Benson stated that the league could continue with a strong core of seven teams, but acknowledged the significant financial challenges owners are facing.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Cuts Millions in Research Funding to UCLA</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has cut approximately $200 million in federal research funding from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), citing concerns over antisemitism on campus. This action is part of a broader administration effort targeting elite universities, with Harvard and Columbia also facing similar pressures. UCLA's new chancellor, Julio Frenk, condemned the move, stating that defunding life-saving research does not address alleged discrimination. The decision comes just days after UCLA settled a lawsuit with Jewish students over its response to pro-Palestinian campus protests last year.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have significantly extended the service life of modern artillery barrels by adapting a 2,000-year-old anti-corrosion technology. The original technique, which involved a thin chromium salt coating, was discovered on well-preserved bronze swords from the Terracotta Army of Emperor Qin Shi Huang. Scientists have now refined this ancient method to create a modern coating that combats the extreme heat, pressure, and erosion inside high-velocity cannon barrels. According to a defense journal, this innovation has successfully doubled the operational lifespan of the artillery components, addressing a major challenge in modern weaponry.</p>

          <p>The leader of the 'Calexit' campaign, which advocates for California's secession from the United States, has been identified as a man with a history of financial fraud and criminal convictions. The article details how Xavier Mitchell, who presented himself as a wealthy entertainment mogul, has a record that includes identity theft, mortgage fraud, and a recent jail sentence. Despite his dubious background and fabricated credentials, he was embraced by the Calexit movement's founder, who was desperate for funding and influence. The story explores the bizarre intersection of fringe politics, personal ambition, and elaborate deception.</p>

          <p>Police in Scotland are investigating the sexual assault of an eight-year-old boy who was attacked while sleeping alone in a tent at a campsite in Drumnadrochit, near Loch Ness.

The family was on holiday in the area, and the incident has been described as hugely traumatizing for them and shocking for the local community. A dedicated team of officers is conducting the investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In her new book, law professor Corinna Barrett Lain challenges the perception of lethal injection as a humane form of execution, arguing it can cause immense suffering. The article details Lain's research, which found that the drugs used, particularly single-drug protocols with pentobarbital, can cause a sensation akin to drowning or being buried alive for several minutes. The book also highlights that execution protocols were not designed by medical experts and that the process internalizes the violence, making it appear deceptively peaceful to witnesses. The author also discusses the financial and emotional costs of the death penalty on taxpayers and prison staff.</p>

          <p>Qatar has warned it may halt liquefied natural gas (LNG) deliveries to Europe, including a major 2026 deal with Germany, in a dispute over a new EU directive. The Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) requires large firms to address human rights and environmental issues in their supply chains, including climate transition plans. Qatar argues the rules are overly burdensome, go beyond the Paris Agreement, and pose a significant financial risk to its state-owned energy company. The threat highlights the tension between Europe's energy security needs and its push for stricter global ethical and environmental standards.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, even as profits declined 23% from the previous year due to lower oil prices. The company's net income was $7.1 billion, or $1.64 per share, beating the forecast of $1.54 per share. This performance was driven by record production levels, particularly in the Permian Basin and Guyana, which helped mitigate the impact of weaker market prices. Exxon also continued its significant shareholder return program, paying out $9.2 billion through dividends and share buybacks during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

Harris expressed that she did not predict the level of "capitulation" from those who she felt should be guardians of democracy.

          <p>For over 120 years, Pewabic Pottery in Detroit has survived economic turmoil by staying true to its Arts and Crafts movement principles of handcrafted quality over mass production. Founded in 1903, the same year as Ford Motor Company, the studio became famous for its unique, experimental iridescent glazes and architectural tiles. Despite Detroit's decline, Pewabic continued its traditional methods, using original machinery and hand-pressing tiles. Now operating as a nonprofit, the pottery is experiencing a resurgence, with record sales driven by renewed appreciation for artisanal goods and its deep connection to the city's history.</p>

The attack, one of the deadliest on the capital since the full-scale invasion began, also wounded 159 people and damaged civilian infrastructure like an apartment block and a hospital. In response, President Trump condemned Russia's actions and hinted at new sanctions, while Germany pledged to deliver two additional Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine to help counter the daily aerial attacks.</p>
