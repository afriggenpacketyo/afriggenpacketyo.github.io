          <p>President Trump's 20-point peace plan for the Israel-Hamas conflict outlines a phased approach, including Hamas releasing all hostages within 72 hours and Israel withdrawing troops to an agreed line. The plan proposes Gaza be governed by a "technocratic" committee and an international stabilization force, sidelining both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. It also calls for significant aid and economic development, while offering a vague pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which Netanyahu has opposed.</p>

          <p>Police revealed that Jihad Al-Shamie, the suspect in a deadly car and knife attack outside a Manchester synagogue, allegedly pledged allegiance to the Islamic State during an emergency call. The attack, which occurred on Yom Kippur, killed two congregants, one possibly by accidental police fire. Al-Shamie, previously on bail for sexual assault, was not known to counter-terrorism programs, but investigators now believe he was influenced by extreme Islamist ideology. Three people remain hospitalized, and six others have been arrested in connection with the terror plot.</p>

          <p>Global internet monitor NetBlocks reported that major social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat are now restricted on multiple providers in Afghanistan.

A tropical storm watch is in effect for several Caribbean islands, with two-to-four inches of rain and life-threatening surf and rip current conditions expected, although it poses no immediate threat to southern Florida.</p>

          <p>Portland, Oregon, is experiencing growing anxiety and economic hardship as President Trump's rhetoric and attempts to deploy National Guard troops to quell protests against an ICE facility create a perception of an unsafe, "war-ravaged" city. Local businesses, like Mother's Bistro, report significant declines in customers, while a federal judge has temporarily blocked the federalization and deployment of troops. Business owners have submitted legal declarations, arguing the president's statements are damaging the city's image and recovery efforts.</p>

          <p>This article criticizes the growing trend of American politicians, including figures like Kamala Harris, Chuck Schumer, and Donald Trump, using profanity in public discourse. It argues that this frequent use diminishes the impact of swearing and undermines the decorum expected of elected officials, suggesting it's an inauthentic attempt to appear "cool" or relatable. The author contends that politicians should model better behavior and maintain standards for public life, rather than contributing to the vulgarization of political culture.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Trump reportedly discussed the possible revival of the Keystone XL oil pipeline project during a meeting in Washington. Carney raised the pipeline in the context of broader trade discussions, and Trump was reportedly receptive, despite the project being previously blocked by both Obama and Biden administrations. The project, which faced significant environmental and indigenous opposition, was abandoned by its owner, though industry interest in its revival remains unclear.</p>

          <p>Arizona's Democratic senators urged House Speaker Mike Johnson to swear in Adelita Grijalva, their state's newest representative, but Johnson refused until government funding was restored. Democrats suspect the delay is intentional, aiming to prevent Grijalva from providing the crucial final signature needed to force a vote on releasing Jeffrey Epstein-related files. Johnson dismissed these claims as "absurd" and a "publicity stunt," highlighting the intense political maneuvering and gridlock over both government funding and controversial legislative initiatives.</p>
