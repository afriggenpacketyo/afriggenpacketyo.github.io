          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey has been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of making false statements and obstruction related to his 2020 congressional testimony. The indictment follows public pressure from President Donald Trump, who appointed a new interim U.S. Attorney that pursued the charges despite internal concerns from prosecutors about a lack of probable cause. Comey maintains his innocence, stating he is not afraid and looks forward to vindicating himself in court, framing the indictment as a politically motivated attack. The charges have deepened political divisions, with Trump's allies celebrating the move while critics condemn it as a dangerous abuse of power and an erosion of the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Roksana Lecka, a 22-year-old nursery worker from west London, has been sentenced to eight years in prison for multiple counts of child cruelty against 21 babies at two different nurseries. The judge described her actions, which included pinching, slapping, punching, and kicking the infants, as "gratuitous" and "sadistic." Lecka's abuse was discovered after she was sent home from one nursery for pinching children, leading to a police investigation that uncovered the extent of her crimes between October 2023 and June 2024. In victim impact statements, parents expressed feelings of heartbreak and guilt over the abuse their children endured.</p>

The Wilson Phillips singer, 57, experienced high blood pressure and significant leg swelling, which she described as a "very scary" situation. Doctors also discovered an ulcer and an obstruction with food inside the removed lap-band, which Wilson attributed to the stress she has experienced this year. Now recovering at home, Wilson expressed gratitude for her medical team and stated the ordeal has given her a new perspective on her health, reinforcing her decision to avoid weight-loss drugs like Ozempic.</p>

          <p>Indian police have arrested prominent activist Sonam Wangchuk in the Himalayan region of Ladakh, following protests demanding statehood that resulted in at least four deaths. Authorities, who have suspended mobile internet and restricted public gatherings, have blamed Wangchuk for instigating the demonstrations. Wangchuk was reportedly arrested just before he was scheduled to hold a press conference, although the specific charges against him have not been disclosed. The arrest highlights the growing political tensions in Ladakh since it was split from Indian-controlled Kashmir in 2019, as residents continue to campaign for constitutional protections for their land and environment.</p>

          <p>John Bolton, a former national security adviser, has offered strategic advice for foreign leaders, like Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, on how to manage relations with President Donald Trump. Citing former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's successful approach, Bolton emphasized the importance of building a personal rapport without making direct requests, thereby fostering a friendship that can be leveraged when necessary. Bolton warned that Trump views alliances through a transactional lens and could easily abandon agreements like the AUKUS security pact if he doesn't see a direct benefit for himself. The article suggests that leaders of middle-power countries must navigate Trump's "curated chaos" by demonstrating the mutual self-interest in maintaining international partnerships.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new round of significant tariffs effective October 1, targeting a range of imported goods. The new measures include a 100% tariff on branded pharmaceutical drugs, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture, and a 30% tariff on heavy trucks. President Trump stated the tariffs are necessary for national security and to protect U.S. manufacturers from what he described as unfair foreign competition flooding the American market. The tariff on pharmaceuticals includes an exemption for companies that are building or have broken ground on manufacturing plants within the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new digital reconstruction of a crushed, million-year-old skull discovered in China suggests a significant revision to the timeline of human evolution. The study, published in the journal Science, indicates that the common ancestor of modern humans may have emerged 400,000 years earlier than previously believed and potentially in Asia, not Africa. The skull, known as Yunxian 2, displays a mix of features from the early human ancestor Homo erectus and later species like Homo sapiens, challenging long-held assumptions. While some experts are cautious and call for more evidence, the findings could resolve the "Muddle in the Middle" period of human evolution and point to a more complex and geographically diverse origin story for humanity.</p>

CEO Marc Benioff argues the AI agents enhance the company's unified platform, but the company's stock has underperformed this year amid these concerns.

          <p>Microsoft has suspended some of its Azure cloud and AI services to Israel's Ministry of Defense following an investigation into their use for mass surveillance of Palestinians. The action came after a report alleged that Israel's military intelligence, Unit 8200, used the platform to store and analyze millions of intercepted Palestinian phone calls to inform military operations, including identifying targets for airstrikes in Gaza. Microsoft stated it found evidence supporting the report's claims and has taken steps to ensure its services are not used for mass surveillance of civilians, in compliance with its terms of service. The move represents a significant action by a major tech company against a state actor over the use of its technology.</p>

          <h2>Auto Dealers Report IRS Delays in Processing EV Tax Credits Ahead of Program's Expiration</h2>

          <p>U.S. auto dealers are reporting significant delays from the IRS in approving and reimbursing federal electric vehicle tax credits, creating financial strain and hindering sales just before the program is set to expire on September 30. Dealers typically front the rebate of up to $7,500 to customers at the point of sale and are then repaid by the IRS, a process that has recently slowed from days to weeks. This has left some dealerships out of pocket by tens of thousands of dollars, forcing them to either carry the cost or stop offering the instant rebate, which has been a major incentive for buyers. The White House has assured that all valid credits will be paid, but has not explained the cause of the delays.</p>

          <p>Marathon Petroleum Corporation (MPC) has seen its stock rise over 6% in the past week, continuing a strong performance that benefits its majority institutional shareholders. With institutions owning 77% of the company, their trading decisions hold significant influence over the stock's price and stability. The concentration of ownership is notable, with the top 19 shareholders controlling 51% of the company, led by The Vanguard Group. While insider ownership by board members is relatively low in value, it indicates some alignment with shareholder interests. The high level of institutional investment suggests credibility in the market, but also carries the risk of volatility if a "crowded trade" unwinds quickly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service, a constitutionally mandated service designed to "bind the nation together," faces an uncertain future amid financial losses and political hostility. The Trump administration has previously called the USPS "a joke" and explored plans to restructure it for potential privatization, a move that analysts believe would dismantle its universal service obligation. If privatized, only profitable routes would likely be maintained, abandoning rural and remote communities that rely on the USPS for mail, prescriptions, and ballots. While modernization plans are underway to cut costs, they are also slowing service, particularly in rural areas, further eroding the agency's fundamental role as a public service and civic institution.</p>

          <p>The new 100% U.S. tariff on branded and patented drugs is not expected to directly impact India's pharmaceutical industry, which primarily exports generic drugs. Despite this, stocks of major Indian drugmakers fell as investors grow increasingly jittery about the escalating trade tensions between the two countries. Analysts suggest the market reaction is not about this specific tariff but reflects a broader pattern of recent U.S. actions, including previous tariff hikes and increased H-1B visa fees. This succession of moves from Washington has created fear of further escalations, overshadowing the fact that India's competitive generic drug industry would likely be resilient even if targeted directly.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill advancing in Congress, the Claiming Age Clarity Act, aims to change the terminology used by the Social Security Administration to help Americans better understand their retirement benefit options. The proposal would rename "early eligibility age" (62) to "minimum benefit age," "full retirement age" (67) to "standard benefit age," and "delayed retirement age" (70) to "maximum benefit age." Proponents argue that the current language is confusing and that these changes would more clearly communicate the financial consequences of claiming benefits at different ages, potentially improving long-term financial security for retirees. The legislative effort comes amid broader debates about the program's solvency, though officials have stated that raising the retirement age is not currently under consideration.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially launched its "Gold Card" residency program, cutting the price from a previously floated $5 million to $1 million, a move that immigration attorneys say has generated a surge in demand from the global wealthy. The program promises residency in "record time" for a $1 million "unrestricted gift" to the government, positioning it as a highly competitive option in the global investment visa market. While the program is expected to raise significant revenue, it faces potential legal challenges as it was created via executive order using workarounds of existing immigration law. The high demand reflects a growing trend of affluent individuals seeking "Plan B" residencies amid rising global instability.</p>

          <p>A year after the devastating floods from Hurricane Helene ravaged Asheville, North Carolina, the city's hospitality industry is anxiously hoping for a strong fall tourist season to aid its slow economic recovery. The storm destroyed businesses, wiped out infrastructure, and brought tourism to a standstill, causing average losses of $322,000 for small businesses. Many establishments have reopened after taking on significant debt, but with demand for vacation rentals still down 20% from pre-storm levels, they are heavily dependent on the influx of autumn visitors. The community remains resilient, but the coming months will be critical in determining whether the local economy can get back on its feet after a year of immense hardship.</p>

          <p>Hezbollah's recent public appeal for Saudi Arabia to "turn a new page" was reportedly instigated by its main backer, Iran, according to multiple sources. The move is seen as a sign of both Hezbollah's and Iran's anxiety over growing international pressure to disarm the Lebanese group. The back-channel diplomacy was allegedly conducted by a senior adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader during a recent visit to Riyadh. This Iranian intervention highlights Tehran's concern that its most important regional ally could be further weakened following significant setbacks in last year's war with Israel. However, Saudi Arabia has shown no indication of changing its long-standing policy that the Lebanese state must have the exclusive right to possess arms.</p>

          <p>A Chinese tech start-up has successfully tested the world's most powerful flying wind turbine, an airship-like device that generated one megawatt of power while airborne in a desert in Xinjiang. The S1500 turbine, roughly the size of a basketball court, floats on helium and lifts generators high into the atmosphere to capture stronger, more consistent winds, sending electricity down via cables. The successful trial, which included launch and retrieval in strong winds, is a critical step toward commercial use. The company aims for mass production by 2026, with the first units connecting to the grid that same year, marking a potential breakthrough in renewable energy technology.</p>
