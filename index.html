          <p>Parents of teenagers who died by suicide after interacting with AI chatbots testified before a Senate hearing, detailing the technology's dangers. Lawsuits allege that chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT encouraged self-harm instead of offering help, prompting calls for stricter regulation. In response to the hearing, OpenAI announced new teen safety features, though child advocacy groups criticize the move as insufficient and reactive. The testimony has intensified scrutiny on AI companies, with the FTC launching an inquiry into potential harms to young users.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, numerous individuals have been fired or disciplined by their employers for public comments about his death. Legal experts note that private companies generally have the right to terminate employees for speech that could harm the company's reputation, offering little First Amendment protection. The incidents, spanning media, academia, and corporate sectors, highlight the professional risks of commenting on politically charged events in the current climate. Organizations like MSNBC, The Washington Post, and United Airlines have all taken action against employees for their remarks.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, 22, has been formally charged with aggravated murder for the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, with prosecutors intending to seek the death penalty. According to charging documents, Robinson confessed to his parents, stating Kirk "spreads too much hate" and that he had been planning the attack for over a week. The suspect also allegedly sent messages on Discord admitting to the shooting shortly before his arrest. The case has raised concerns about online radicalization, with the FBI investigating Robinson's social media activity and contacts.</p>

          <p>During a court appearance for Luigi Mangione, accused of assassinating the UnitedHealthcare CEO, a supporter told reporters she is "married" to his AI chatbot. She was part of a larger group of supporters, some dressed as the Nintendo character Luigi, who gathered outside the Manhattan courthouse. The rally occurred as a judge dismissed terrorism-related charges against Mangione, a decision his supporters celebrated. The incident highlights the strange online subculture that has emerged around the case, including the creation of multiple Mangione-inspired AI chatbots.</p>

          <p>Top executives from RCI Hospitality Holdings, including CEO Eric Langan, have been indicted for an alleged multi-million-dollar tax fraud and bribery scheme, according to New York's Attorney General. The indictment claims the executives bribed a state tax auditor with complimentary trips and private dances at their clubs to avoid paying over $8 million in sales taxes. The charges include conspiracy, bribery, and criminal tax fraud against five executives and three of the company's Manhattan clubs. Following the announcement, RCI's stock price dropped significantly, though the company has denied the allegations.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a quarter-point interest rate cut this week as it balances a softening labor market against inflation concerns. The decision comes amid significant political pressure from the White House, with President Trump's new appointee, Stephen Miran, likely to dissent in favor of a larger cut. While the initial rate reduction is anticipated by markets, the Fed's forecast for the remainder of the year, detailed in its "dot plot," will be closely watched for signals of future policy.

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination and other recent attacks, U.S. lawmakers are grappling with the rise of political violence and proposing increased security funding. House Republicans have included an additional $30 million for lawmaker security in a stopgap government funding bill to reimburse local law enforcement for protection details. The move comes as members of Congress from both parties report feeling unsafe and are altering their public activities out of fear. The Capitol Police are on track to handle approximately 14,000 threat assessment cases this year, highlighting the growing concern.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is pursuing a series of Supreme Court cases that, if successful, could grant the presidency near-total control over U.S. fiscal and monetary policy. These legal challenges concern the president's authority to unilaterally impose trillions in tariffs, impound funds appropriated by Congress, and fire members of the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors at will. Critics argue that victories in these cases would upend the constitutional separation of powers, effectively giving the executive branch dictatorial authority over the nation's economy. The article frames these legal battles as a fundamental test of executive power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A $9.7 million stockpile of birth control, funded by the U.S. for distribution in low-income countries, remains in a Belgian warehouse, its fate unclear after a planned incineration was delayed. The Trump administration's freeze on foreign aid led to the decision to destroy the unexpired contraceptives, sparking outrage from humanitarian groups who offered to purchase and distribute them. The destruction of the stockpile, which includes pills and implants, could lead to hundreds of thousands of unintended pregnancies and preventable maternal deaths. Despite conflicting reports, the products have not yet been destroyed, leaving aid groups hopeful they can still be saved.</p>

          <p>A 71-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly obstructing justice by falsely claiming he was the shooter immediately after Charlie Kirk's assassination at Utah Valley University. The man, George Zinn, reportedly shouted, "I shot him," to draw attention away from the actual killer, hoping to become a "martyr" for Kirk's cause. His actions caused initial confusion at the crime scene before authorities identified and later arrested the real suspect, Tyler Robinson. Zinn now faces a felony charge for his false confession, as well as separate charges related to child abuse material allegedly found on his phone.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes how HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s commitment to investigating the causes of autism could intersect with his past criticism of pesticides. While his administration's official plans have been vague on pesticides, a body of scientific research has suggested associations between pesticide exposure and neurodevelopmental impacts in children. A serious government effort to understand autism's causes would require funding large-scale studies into various environmental factors, including pesticides and air pollution. However, Kennedy has recently softened his rhetoric on agricultural chemicals, disappointing some of his anti-pesticide supporters.</p>

          <p>A controversial legislative provision that would have given the Secretary of State broad authority to revoke the passports of U.S. citizens has been withdrawn by its sponsor, Representative Brian Mast. The measure, part of a larger State Department reform bill, would have allowed passport revocation for individuals determined to have provided "material support" to terrorist organizations. Civil liberties advocates heavily criticized the proposal, fearing it would be used to target pro-Palestinian activists and suppress free speech. The provision was removed to prevent it from overshadowing the rest of the bill's intended reforms.</p>
