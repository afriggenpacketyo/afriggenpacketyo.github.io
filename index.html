          <p>The UK government is actively working to reverse a decision that prohibits Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending a Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham. The ban was implemented by the city's Safety Advisory Group due to safety concerns, citing previous violent incidents involving the Israeli club's supporters. Government officials and political leaders have criticized the decision as wrong, asserting that fans should not be barred based on their identity, and are exploring the allocation of additional resources to ensure the match can proceed safely with all fans present.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa should drop out of the New York City mayoral race to prevent splitting the vote and inadvertently helping Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani win. The author critiques the recent debate, describing Mamdani as slick but evasive on key issues like his stance on Israel and Hamas. The article posits that former Governor Andrew Cuomo is the only viable alternative to Mamdani, despite his flaws, and that Sliwa's presence in the race only harms Cuomo's chances of defeating the progressive candidate.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged Mahmoud Amin Ya'qub al-Muhtadi, a 33-year-old Louisiana resident, for his alleged involvement in the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel. According to court documents, al-Muhtadi was part of a paramilitary group allied with Hamas and coordinated armed fighters to cross into Israel during the attack. He is accused of later entering the United States on a fraudulent visa, where he falsely denied any affiliation with terrorist organizations or having any specialized firearms training.</p>

          <p>The United States military has taken survivors into custody after conducting a deadly airstrike on a suspected drug-smuggling vessel in the Caribbean. This is reportedly the first instance of survivors being detained since the Trump administration authorized such lethal attacks in the region last month, bringing the total death toll from these operations to at least 28. The use of military force against cartels, based on a "war on terror" legal authority, has raised concerns among legal scholars and human rights groups about potential extrajudicial executions and violations of international law.</p>

          <p>A Guardian editorial expresses concern that the U.S. is shifting from a "rule of law" to "rule by law," where the justice system is used as a political weapon by the executive branch. The article points to the recent indictments of high-profile Trump critics like John Bolton, Letitia James, and James Comey as evidence of this trend. It argues that President Trump is systematically undermining the judiciary's role as a check on power, emboldened by a Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity and promoting a narrative of political retribution against his opponents.</p>

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener, a prominent Democrat known for his pro-housing legislation, is reportedly planning to run for the congressional seat currently held by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. While Wiener had previously indicated he would wait for the 85-year-old Pelosi to retire, the entry of a progressive challenger into the race appears to have accelerated his timeline. Pelosi has not yet announced if she will seek another term, but a challenge from a well-known figure like Wiener could intensify the focus on her age and the party's future leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses the common question of whether a debt collector can legally sue a person who is already making payments on a delinquent debt. In most cases, unless a formal written agreement explicitly prohibits legal action, a collector retains the right to file a lawsuit to secure a judgment, which provides stronger collection tools like wage garnishment. To protect themselves, individuals are advised to get all payment arrangements in writing, adhere strictly to the plan, and understand their rights under both state and federal law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small businesses across the U.S. are facing severe financial pressure due to President Trump's tariffs, forcing them to take out high-interest loans, raise prices, and halt hiring. Unlike larger corporations, small companies have less capacity to absorb the increased costs, making them a "canary in the coal mine" for the wider economy, according to some economists. Many owners report that the financial strain from the trade war is significantly worse than the challenges they faced during the COVID-19 pandemic, threatening their long-term viability.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing government shutdown persists with no resolution, as Democrats cite a fundamental lack of trust in President Trump as a primary obstacle to forming bipartisan negotiating groups, or "gangs." In past stalemates, such coalitions have been instrumental in breaking legislative deadlocks, but lawmakers say they are absent now due to fears that the president would disregard any agreement reached. This deep-seated wariness has prevented momentum from building around a compromise, leaving Capitol Hill locked in a stalemate as the funding lapse continues into its third week.</p>

          <p>A cultural shift is underway in the bodybuilding community, as many enthusiasts move away from the traditional "dirty bulking" method of consuming massive amounts of processed food to gain muscle. Instead, they are embracing "lean bulking," which involves a smaller, healthier caloric surplus from whole foods, reflecting both modern wellness trends and scientific findings that extreme calorie intake primarily generates fat. While this approach is slower and more sustainable, health experts caution that any form of extreme dieting can still pose risks, including nutritional deficiencies and eating disorders.</p>

          <p>European and Asian stock markets experienced significant declines, led by banking shares, after two U.S. regional lenders reported exposure to bad loans and alleged fraud.

In response to the market turmoil, investors moved towards safe-haven assets, pushing the price of gold to a new record high as concerns about the health of the financial sector grew.

          <p>The Trump administration has released proposals aimed at making in vitro fertilization (IVF) more affordable, but they fall far short of the president's campaign pledge to make the procedure free. The plan offers voluntary guidance for employers and medication discounts through a new portal, measures that will provide little to no relief for most patients facing high treatment costs. The modest proposals managed to disappoint both reproductive rights advocates, who called them hollow, and some religious conservatives, who remain opposed to the federal government endorsing IVF at all.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank has identified DuPont as a short-term "catalyst buy," anticipating that the upcoming spinoff of its electronics division, Qnity, will unlock significant value for shareholders. Analysts believe the chemical company currently trades at a substantial discount to the sum of its parts, a situation the separation is expected to rectify. The CNBC Investing Club noted it plans to hold shares in both the new and parent companies, seeing Qnity as a particularly strong long-term investment due to its growth potential tied to the semiconductor industry.

          <p>A contributor argues that Senate Democrats are pursuing a politically damaging and ultimately futile strategy by prolonging the federal government shutdown. The piece contends that their negotiating position, centered on healthcare subsidies, is weak and that public opinion may turn against them as the shutdown's negative impacts accumulate. The author suggests the party is guided by ideology rather than rational calculation, choosing to fight on unpopular issues like immigration and gender politics instead of adopting a more centrist, electorally viable approach.</p>
