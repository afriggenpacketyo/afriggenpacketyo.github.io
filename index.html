        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labor Department reported that the annual inflation rate in April was 2.3%, slightly below expectations, with the consumer price index rising 0.2% for the month. Core CPI, excluding food and energy, also increased by 0.2% monthly and 2.8% year-over-year. This data reflects the initial impact of President Trump's tariffs on a slowing U.S. economy. The slightly lower inflation rate defies concerns about a surge in prices following the implementation of tariffs, though analysts anticipate a potential rekindling of inflation as retailers restock inventory with goods imported after the tariffs took effect.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article discusses President Trump's decision to reduce tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30% for a temporary period, while China will reciprocate by lowering its retaliatory levies. The move comes after Trump's initial claims that China needed America more, but the administration's actions suggest that America relies on trade with other countries as well. The article notes that Trump's tariffs led to price hikes and potential shortages, weakening his negotiating position, and China's patient approach ultimately led to the tariff reduction. Despite the temporary easing, tariffs remain higher than before Trump's second term, potentially leading to increased prices for consumers.</p>

          <p>This article reports that consumer prices rose 2.3% in April compared to the previous year, slightly cooling from the previous month, even after President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs. The reading matched economists' expectations and defied fears of an inflation surge. Trump paused a large swath of so-called "reciprocal tariffs" within days of the announcement, and temporarily slashed tariffs on China from 145% to 30%. The rollback of levies on Chinese goods is expected to reduce the average cost of tariffs per household this year from $4,900 to $2,800.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article discusses how economists and policymakers are bracing for inflation to re-accelerate as companies adapt to President Trump’s trade war. U.S. inflation held steady in April, but economists warn this could be a final lull before a likely surge in consumer prices. Following negotiations, the U.S. and China agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs on each other's products for 90 days. Economists warn that the tariffs that Trump is likely to keep in place will eventually stoke inflation while simultaneously denting growth, as the full effects of these levies will take time to show up in the economic data.</p>

          <p>Peter Sullivan, who served 38 years in prison for the 1986 murder of Diane Sindall, has had his conviction overturned by the Court of Appeal due to new DNA evidence. The Criminal Cases Review Commission referred the case back to the court after fresh testing found a DNA profile pointing to an unknown attacker in semen samples preserved from the crime scene. Sullivan, now 68, is believed to be the victim of the longest miscarriage of justice involving a living prisoner in British legal history. The prosecution agreed that the DNA evidence undermined Sullivan's conviction, and he will be released.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor revealed a redesigned version of its sole all-electric vehicle in the U.S., with a simplified name, "bZ," and notable increases in EV technologies and capabilities. The new name is to simplify it for customers, but it's also likely a move to distance the updated model from its predecessor, the bZ4X. Toyota appears to address many concerns of the first-generation EV with the 2026 model year updates, including a 25% increase in EV range, up to 50% improvement in horsepower and fast-charging capabilities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariff pause gives Temu and Shein a temporary window of opportunity to restock U.S.-based warehouses and re-evaluate their supply chain management. The U.S. and China agreed to lower tariffs on most Chinese imports to 30% for 90 days. Previous tariff rates had driven price hikes for U.S. consumers on Shein's platforms, while Temu halted shipments directly from China altogether. The recent tariff cut has given them a chance to ramp up shipments from China and restock their warehouses and fulfill existing orders.</p>

The company downgraded almost every financial metric for its current fiscal year ending in March 2026, compared with its latest full-year results.
