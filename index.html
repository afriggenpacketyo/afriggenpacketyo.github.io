            <p>Due to increased customs red tape following President Trump's new tariff regime, DHL Express is temporarily suspending deliveries to American consumers for shipments valued over $800. The delivery company stated that the changes have caused a significant increase in formal customs clearances, leading to potential multi-day delays. While shipments under $800 will continue, the White House is set to close a loophole allowing low-value packages to enter the US without duties, which will impact fast-fashion firms like Shein and Temu.</p>
