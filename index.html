          <p>A major power outage struck southeastern France on Saturday, causing traffic disruptions and briefly halting events at the Cannes Film Festival.

          <p>Swiss brand On is rapidly gaining ground in the global sportswear market, reporting a 40% increase in net sales for the first quarter of 2025. Analysts attribute On's success to its innovative product design and strategic timing, capitalizing on periods of declining sales and innovation stalls from competitors like Nike and Adidas. While Nike and Adidas still dominate the market share, On's earnings growth has surpassed both companies in recent quarters. The company faces potential headwinds from Nike's turnaround plan and tariff uncertainties, as most of its sneakers are manufactured in Vietnam.</p>

          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers will be established across England over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency (A&E) departments. These centers will be open to walk-in patients and referrals from GPs and police, providing specialized care for individuals in acute mental distress. NHS England aims to integrate these units into existing A&Es or create new, self-contained facilities. While some experts are skeptical of the scheme's effectiveness, the government has invested £26 million in new crisis centers, staffing, and therapies to improve mental health services.</p>

          <p>An opinion article on Fox News suggests that eliminating taxes on overtime pay could be a significant political measure for Republicans, potentially helping them in the midterms. The author argues that this policy resonates strongly with working Americans and could be more impactful than stimulus checks or tax cuts on tips. The piece suggests that if workers see a tangible increase in their weekly paychecks due to reduced overtime taxes, they will credit Republicans and vote accordingly. The author believes that President Trump has identified an issue that deeply concerns American voters but is often overlooked by the media. (not investment advice)</p>

The US Air Force is developing unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) as part of its collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) program, aiming to augment crewed fighter aircraft in air-to-air missions. Ground testing has begun on initial CCA designs, with production expected in 2026. However, analysts also note that China is catching up in this area of military technology.</p>

          <p>The UK government is preparing for a challenging Spending Review, with ministers bracing for cuts to various departments as the Chancellor prioritizes health and defense. The review, described as the "last big set of decisions" before the next election, involves intense negotiations over budget allocations until 2029. While overall government spending is increasing due to tax rises, the squeeze on day-to-day spending is causing concern, especially for departments providing public services. Tensions are rising over council budgets, affordable housing, and police funding, as the government seeks to balance fiscal responsibility with political priorities.</p>
