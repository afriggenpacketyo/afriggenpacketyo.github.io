The proposal follows a "constructive" phone call between these leaders, U.S. President Trump, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Despite these efforts, deadly strikes continue in residential areas, and Trump has expressed skepticism about Putin's willingness to end the conflict.</p>

Ralston, a 24-year-old mother, was found dead in her car in 1977. The case went cold until a fingerprint from a cigarette carton at the crime scene matched Sims through an upgraded FBI database. Sims, who was an Army private stationed nearby in 1977, had a prior conviction for assault to commit murder.

          <p>India and Pakistan announced a ceasefire after escalating conflict, but reports of continued violence soon emerged, with both sides accusing each other of violating the truce. The agreement followed days of missile and drone strikes, sparked by a terrorist attack in Kashmir. President Trump claimed U.S. mediation, which India disputed. Despite the ceasefire, cross-border firing was reported, and both sides targeted each other's military bases. The conflict's origins lie in the disputed Kashmir region, claimed by both nations, leading to decades of tensions and wars.</p>

          <p>Over 70 individuals who visited a farm in Cowbridge, Wales, have been infected with cryptosporidium, a microscopic parasite causing diarrhea, with 16 requiring hospitalization. Public Health Wales reports that cryptosporidium is often linked to contact with young farm animals. The farm has voluntarily suspended animal feeding activities while health officials investigate the outbreak. Symptoms of cryptosporidium infection can appear two to ten days after exposure and last up to two weeks, prompting health officials to emphasize the importance of handwashing and seeking medical advice if feeling unwell.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed federal agencies to cease estimating the economic damage caused by climate change when formulating policies and regulations. This decision effectively eliminates the use of the "social cost of carbon," a metric used to weigh the costs and benefits of policies limiting carbon pollution. The administration argues that there are too many uncertainties in calculating the economic impact of climate change. Scientists and environmental groups criticize the move, stating it ignores the reality of climate change's harmful effects.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated significantly, leading to a ceasefire after days of exchanged fire, though dangers in the region remain. The conflict stems from the disputed Kashmir region, which both countries claim. With both nations possessing nuclear weapons, the threat of escalation is a major concern. The recent attacks followed rising tensions, as India blamed Pakistan for a deadly attack in Kashmir, a claim Pakistan denies. The U.S. Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, has been in contact with Indian and Pakistani officials to broker the ceasefire.</p>

Starmer noted unprecedented unity among global leaders and reported that Trump reaffirmed his support for the ceasefire.

          <p>Negotiations are intensifying regarding President Donald Trump's tax agenda, with several key issues under consideration by policy experts. The House Ways and Means Committee released a preliminary partial text of its bill, though significant changes are possible. Republican lawmakers aim to pass Trump's package without Democratic support through reconciliation, which requires navigating budget constraints and competing priorities. Experts highlight the narrow Republican majority in the House and the need for a fiscally responsible package as potential challenges to the bill's passage.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may face criticism for acting too late, as has been the case with many of his predecessors, even if his current approach is deemed appropriate. The Fed's historical tendency to delay action, coupled with the unique challenges of Trump's tariffs threatening both growth and inflation, puts Powell in a difficult position. While Trump has pressured the Fed to cut rates, some economists argue Powell is right to remain cautious given the volatile policy mix. Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, believes the Fed is not being forward-looking enough and will miss the call on interest rate adjustments.</p>
