        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel by ABC, numerous late-night television hosts have publicly defended him and criticized the move as an attack on free speech. Hosts like Stephen Colbert, Seth Meyers, and Jon Stewart used their platforms to show solidarity, employing both earnest statements and satirical sketches to critique the pressure from the Trump administration. The controversy began after Kimmel made comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which prompted the FCC chairman to threaten action against the network. This collective response from the comedy community highlights growing concerns over censorship and political influence in the media.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly set to fire Erik Siebert, the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, for refusing to press criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James. Sources indicate that federal investigators found no clear evidence of mortgage fraud by James, yet Trump officials pushed for an indictment. The expected dismissal has caused alarm within the Justice Department, with concerns about the politicization of law enforcement and potential mass resignations. This move is seen by critics as part of a broader pattern of using federal power to target political adversaries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Florida has dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, labeling the lengthy filing as "decidedly improper and impermissible." Judge Steven Merryday criticized the 85-page complaint for containing excessive political rhetoric and self-praise rather than focusing on legal arguments. While dismissing the current suit, the judge has granted Trump's legal team 28 days to refile an amended, more concise complaint that adheres to legal standards. The ruling is a procedural setback for Trump's legal challenges against media organizations he deems critical of his administration.</p>

The company helps over 200 brands, including Panasonic and Skechers, optimize their sales on various online platforms. Pattern's entry into the public market comes amid a recent revival of tech IPOs, but it also faces risks related to global trade uncertainty and its heavy reliance on the Amazon platform.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Ted Cruz has strongly criticized Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr for his remarks concerning late-night host Jimmy Kimmel. Cruz compared Carr's warnings to ABC about its broadcast license to tactics used by a "mafioso," suggesting it was an inappropriate threat against the network. While stating he was "thrilled" Kimmel was taken off the air for his comments on Charlie Kirk, Cruz warned against the government dictating media content. He argued that such actions set a dangerous precedent that could ultimately be used against conservative voices, emphasizing the importance of free speech principles.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation has found that Walmart's push to expand its third-party online marketplace led to lax vetting processes, resulting in the sale of counterfeit and fraudulent products. To compete with Amazon, Walmart reportedly made it easier for sellers to join its platform, which attracted bad actors who sometimes used stolen business identities. The report details instances of shoppers receiving fake goods, including potentially dangerous health supplements. In response to the findings, Walmart has reportedly tightened its vetting procedures for some sellers in the health and beauty categories, highlighting the ongoing challenge of policing large e-commerce platforms.</p>

          <p>A Vox analysis argues that the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel, prompted by threats from the FCC, exemplifies how an authoritarian regime could take root in the United States.

It posits that recent events, particularly those following Charlie Kirk's death, show an acceleration of these tactics, moving beyond incompetence to a more effective consolidation of power.

For a $750,000 mortgage, the average 30-year fixed rate has dropped to around 6.13%, resulting in a monthly payment of approximately $4,560 before taxes and insurance. This represents a savings of over $450 per month compared to the 7%-plus rates seen at the beginning of the year.

          <p>An NPR analysis details how Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr has become a key figure in the Trump administration's campaign against media outlets critical of the president. Once a collegial staff attorney, Carr has adopted a more aggressive posture since becoming chair, launching investigations into major broadcast networks and using the FCC's regulatory power to influence corporate decisions. His recent threats to revoke broadcast licenses, which preceded ABC's suspension of Jimmy Kimmel, are described as an unprecedented use of the office to intimidate a network over its content. This approach marks a significant shift in the traditionally semi-autonomous role of the FCC.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, along with several state attorneys general, has filed a lawsuit against Live Nation and its subsidiary Ticketmaster, accusing them of anticompetitive and deceptive practices. The complaint alleges that the companies enabled ticket brokers to acquire large quantities of tickets, which were then resold at inflated prices, costing consumers billions. The suit also claims that Ticketmaster privately benefits from these broker sales while publicly maintaining a stance against them. This legal action follows a separate Department of Justice lawsuit filed in May that accused the live entertainment giant of operating an illegal monopoly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bridget Phillipson, the UK's education secretary and a candidate for the Labour deputy leadership, has indicated that the government is considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap. In her strongest statement on the issue yet, she described the policy as "spiteful" and stated its removal is "on the table" as part of a forthcoming child poverty strategy. The cap, introduced in 2017, prevents families from claiming universal credit or child tax credit for a third or subsequent child. The policy has become a key issue in the deputy leadership contest, with rival Lucy Powell also advocating for its removal.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Donald Trump's recent state visit to the UK examines whether the British government's strategy of extensive pageantry and flattery yielded tangible results. While the visit successfully avoided major diplomatic incidents and secured cooperation in areas like technology and finance, it failed to produce breakthroughs on key issues like steel tariffs or a stronger stance on Russia. Experts offer differing views on the approach, with some seeing the strengthening of personal relationships as a crucial gateway to policy wins. Others remain skeptical that flattery can move Trump beyond words to concrete actions, suggesting the strategy is more about buying time.</p>

These products allow investors to make more targeted bets on the chip industry's growth beyond just mega-cap names.

          <p>A public dispute has broken out between former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and MP Zarah Sultana, key figures in the formation of a new left-wing party in the UK. The disagreement centers on an "unauthorised" email sent to supporters, allegedly initiated by Sultana, to sign up for paid memberships. Corbyn and other founding members released a statement disavowing the email, while Sultana accused the group of being a "sexist boys' club" and sidelining her. This infighting has disappointed allies and raised concerns about the viability of the new political venture before it has officially launched.</p>

          <p>The Irish hip-hop trio Kneecap has been banned from entering Canada ahead of a planned tour, with officials citing statements "contrary to Canadian values." The ban is linked to terror offense charges filed in the UK against one member, Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, for allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah, which the UK and Canada consider a terrorist organization. The band, known for its pro-Palestinian advocacy and controversial performances, has called the Canadian ban "deeply malicious" and is threatening legal action. This follows the cancellation of their U.S. tour due to the ongoing legal case in the UK.</p>
