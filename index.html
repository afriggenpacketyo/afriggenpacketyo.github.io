          <p>Volvo Cars, owned by Chinese group Geely Holding, will cut approximately 3,000 white-collar jobs, primarily impacting office-based positions in Sweden, as part of a cost-cutting initiative. The decision is attributed to major challenges facing the global motor industry, including tariffs on imported cars, higher material costs, and slower sales in Europe. CEO HÃ¥kan Samuelsson emphasized that these difficult decisions are essential for building a stronger and more resilient Volvo Cars. The company's global sales for April fell by 11% compared to the previous year, prompting the action plan to streamline operations and adapt to evolving market dynamics.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits rose at a faster pace in April, marking the second consecutive month of growth despite ongoing trade tensions and deflationary pressures. Cumulative profits at major industrial firms increased by 3% compared to the previous year, accelerating from 2.6% in March, bolstered by stronger earnings in the equipment and high-tech manufacturing sectors. While state-owned firms experienced a profit decline, private enterprises and those with foreign investments saw improvements. The improved profitability is attributed to the industrial sectors' resilience and ability to withstand shocks, although challenges such as insufficient demand and declining prices persist.

City and state officials have acknowledged multiple security lapses in the jail, and several individuals have been arrested for allegedly aiding the inmates.</p>
