          <p>Prince William was visibly moved during a conversation with Rhian Mannings, who shared the devastating impact of her husband's suicide, which occurred five days after the death of their one-year-old son. Mannings subsequently founded the 2wish bereavement charity, which will now be a key part of a new National Suicide Prevention Network. The Royal Foundation, led by the Prince and Princess of Wales, is committing £1 million over three years to develop this crucial network across the UK. The initiative aims to deepen understanding of suicide's root causes, offer comprehensive support, and foster collaboration among various organizations. Prince William emphasized the importance of building a unified national response to this heartbreaking and preventable tragedy on World Mental Health Day.</p>

          <p>A powerful 7.4-magnitude earthquake struck off the southern Philippines, resulting in at least two fatalities, significant damage to a hospital and schools, and widespread power outages. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is coordinating damage assessment and preparing rescue and relief operations for affected areas. Initially, a tsunami warning was issued for nearby coastal regions, prompting evacuations, though it was later canceled by the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. The event caused intense ground shaking and panic among residents, marking it as one of the strongest quakes experienced in the geologically unstable archipelago, which is still recovering from a previous 6.9 magnitude tremor.</p>

          <p>France is currently experiencing significant political turmoil and instability, leading to comparisons with Italy and earning it the label "Europe's new bad boy." President Emmanuel Macron is expected to appoint a new prime minister following two days of talks aimed at resolving the current political deadlock. A notable suggestion has emerged for the new leader to be "completely disconnected from presidential ambitions for 2027," potentially paving the way for a technocratic government. This scenario is seen as a way to pause the ongoing political crisis, reassure international investors, and gain time before the 2027 presidential election, despite the deeply political nature of French public opinion.</p>

          <h2>Tech Billionaires' "Doom Prepping" Sparks Concerns Over AI's Future</h2>

          <p>Tech billionaires, including Mark Zuckerberg, are reportedly engaging in "doom prepping" by building elaborate bunkers, fueling speculation about their fears of catastrophic events. This trend is increasingly linked to anxieties surrounding the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and the potential for artificial general intelligence (AGI) or artificial super intelligence (ASI). While some tech leaders express deep concerns about AI's risks, others are evangelical about its benefits, such as solving global challenges and creating "universal high income." Experts remain divided on AGI's imminence and its transformative potential, with some dismissing the "singularity" concept as a distraction from current AI's real-world impacts.</p>

          <p>Peru's Congress has voted overwhelmingly to impeach President Dina Boluarte, citing her government's failure to effectively curb the country's rampant crime. The decision came shortly after a shooting in Lima exacerbated public anger over rising insecurity. Congress leader Jose Jeri was promptly sworn in as interim president, immediately declaring a "war on crime" as his top priority. Boluarte, who became Peru's first female president in December 2022, had struggled to address a significant surge in homicides and extortion, ultimately leading to her removal via the same "moral incapacity" mechanism used against her predecessor.</p>

          <p>Overnight Russian missile and drone strikes have caused extensive power cuts across Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, injuring nine people and disrupting water supplies in eastern districts. In the Zaporizhzhia area, a separate Russian drone strike tragically killed a seven-year-old child and injured three others. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russia of deliberately attempting to "create chaos and apply psychological pressure" by targeting the country's energy grid. Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk confirmed a "massive strike" on energy facilities nationwide, with repair crews actively working to restore power amidst ongoing alerts for difficult-to-detect hypersonic missiles.</p>

          <p>S&P Global Ratings forecasts a more severe decline in China's real estate market for 2025, extending the slump for a fifth consecutive year. The agency now projects new home sales to drop by 8% to between 8.8 trillion and 9 trillion yuan, a steeper decline than previously anticipated. This weaker outlook is primarily attributed to fragile homebuyer sentiment and less aggressive policy easing from Beijing. Despite government efforts to stabilize the sector, a market turnaround remains elusive, with sales expected to halve from 2021 levels by this year. (not investment advice)</p>

The platform stated that Bitcoin lacks characteristics for growth or income, has no intrinsic value, and its performance cannot be reliably analyzed. This stance contrasts with some major institutions, like Morgan Stanley, that are embracing digital assets, while others, such as JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon, remain critical. Proponents argue Bitcoin offers a hedge against traditional asset volatility and has entered the financial mainstream. (not investment advice)</p>

He suggested that the perceived better attitude of current England squads stems more from improved media coverage and player relationships rather than a fundamental difference in effort.

          <h2>Scientists Discover Salt-Laced Ice Can Generate Electricity When Bent</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 00:00:09 EDT</div>

          <p>Scientists from China and Spain have made a discovery that adding salt to ice enables it to generate electricity, potentially opening new avenues for clean power generation in cold environments. Their research found that salt-doped ice, when bent, produced an electrical response comparable to high-performance ceramic materials known for their electrical properties. This phenomenon is attributed to flexoelectricity, where an electrical charge is generated under non-uniform strain. The team has already fabricated devices using saline ice, demonstrating its potential as a low-cost energy source.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Forkish, the chief spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department, has resigned following accusations from the region's top federal prosecutor that her office was leaking information. Forkish vehemently denied the "baseless allegation," stating she was asked to leave by Chief Jim McDonnell due to differing visions for the department's public relations strategy. The controversy reportedly intensified after the U.S. Attorney inquired about a news conference leak. This incident adds to a history of conflict between the LAPD and local media, with the department facing scrutiny over its responsiveness and treatment of journalists.</p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed Drake's defamation lawsuit against Universal Music Group (UMG) concerning Kendrick Lamar's song "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that Lamar's lyrics, which accused Drake of being a "certified paedophile," constituted "nonactionable opinion" within the context of a heated rap battle, rather than verifiable facts. Drake's legal team accused UMG of promoting a "false and malicious narrative," but UMG expressed satisfaction with the dismissal, calling the lawsuit an "affront to all artists and their creative expression." Drake plans to appeal the ruling, continuing the legal fallout from the high-profile rap feud.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued a temporary order halting President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard soldiers in Illinois, including Chicago. The Trump administration had ordered troops to protect federal officials and facilities from what it described as violent protesters, but local Democratic officials accused the president of spurring protests. Judge April Perry stated that deploying Guard troops would "add fuel to the fire" and expressed doubt about the federal government's claims of violence. The ruling, in effect for two weeks, was welcomed by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, while the White House announced plans to appeal.</p>

          <p>China's top economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), and the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) have jointly issued a policy paper to combat "disorderly price competition." The measures aim to limit intense competition that leads to price wars and self-destructive cost-cutting, which authorities believe harm industry development, innovation, and product quality. Regulators will guide industry associations to assess average production costs and help companies set reasonable prices. They also vowed to monitor market competition closely and intervene against pricing law violations to maintain market order. (not investment advice)</p>
