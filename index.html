          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is set to address hundreds of senior U.S. military officers at a rare gathering at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia. According to officials, Hegseth will personally deliver his message about restoring the "warrior ethos" to the U.S. military and present new standards to achieve this goal. The unusual meeting has raised questions regarding security needs and travel costs, as it summons a significant number of high-ranking officers from around the world for what might be a brief address. The Pentagon plans to record the meeting for future public distribution.</p>

European players Jon Rahm and Tommy Fleetwood were standout performers, both going undefeated, while top American players like Scottie Scheffler struggled.

          <p>An AI-powered, interactive holographic-style avatar of the late Stan Lee is being featured at the Los Angeles Comic Con, allowing fans to ask questions and engage with the comic book legend's persona. The "Stan Lee Experience" uses a large language model fed with decades of Lee's interviews, writings, and public appearances to generate responses within specific "guardrails" to keep the conversation focused on his universe. The technology, developed by Proto Inc. and Hyperreal, is seen as an entry point into Lee's storytelling legacy. Organizers hope it will help maintain and expand his legacy for new generations of fans.</p>

          <p>A grand jury in Virginia has indicted former FBI Director James Comey on two counts: making false statements to Congress and obstruction of justice. The charges stem from his 2020 testimony before a Senate committee regarding whether he authorized a leak of classified information. President Donald Trump praised the indictment, while Comey maintained his innocence, expressing confidence in the judicial system and stating he is ready for a trial. The case is being led by a newly appointed U.S. Attorney who previously served as Trump's personal lawyer, raising concerns among Democrats about political motivation.</p>

          <p>Authorities have confirmed that human remains found in a remote area of Washington state belong to Travis Decker, the man accused of killing his three young daughters in May. Following the DNA confirmation, prosecutors are moving to drop the murder charges against him. The discovery brings an end to a monthslong manhunt for the 32-year-old former Army soldier. The Chelan County Sheriff stated that the confirmation brings "a close to this dark chapter," although the cause and manner of Decker's death may never be determined due to the condition of the remains.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly called for Microsoft to fire Lisa Monaco, the company's president of global affairs, who previously served as deputy attorney general in the Biden administration. In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump labeled Monaco a "menace to U.S. National Security," citing that the government had recently stripped her of security clearances. The demand comes amid Trump's broader push to prosecute his political adversaries, following the recent indictment of former FBI Director James Comey.

          <p>A retired detective has stated that the infamous 1991 "yogurt shop murders" in Austin, Texas, have been solved, identifying deceased serial killer Robert Eugene Brashers as the perpetrator. The case involved the killing of four teenage girls. The breakthrough reportedly came from DNA evidence linking Brashers to the crime scene. Previously, four other men were arrested in 1999, with two being convicted based on confessions they later claimed were coerced; their convictions were eventually overturned when DNA evidence did not match them. This new development appears to bring a long-awaited resolution to the high-profile cold case.</p>

          <p>Legal experts suggest that President Trump's persistent public attacks and calls for the prosecution of James Comey could paradoxically undermine the government's case against the former FBI director. Defense lawyers may argue for dismissal based on "selective or vindictive prosecution," using Trump's own statements as evidence of political motivation rather than impartial justice. The case's context is unusual, involving the replacement of a U.S. attorney with a Trump loyalist just before the indictment was secured. This raises questions about the integrity of the prosecution and provides Comey's defense with a strong potential line of attack.</p>

          <p>Newly released documents related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, made public by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, contain mentions of Elon Musk and Prince Andrew. The files include an itinerary note from 2014 about a potential visit by Musk to Epstein's private island and a 2000 flight manifest listing Prince Andrew as a passenger on a flight with Epstein. Other prominent figures like Peter Thiel and Steve Bannon are also named in the documents. The release is part of an ongoing probe into the government's handling of the Epstein case, though it is not suggested that those mentioned were aware of his criminal activities.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Health Policies as a Return to a Nostalgic Past</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" movement is analyzed as being driven by a conservative ideology that idealizes the past to solve present-day health issues. This perspective suggests that Kennedy's skepticism towards modern medicine, including vaccines and processed foods, stems from a belief that purity and health lie in a more "natural" time. The article argues that while this sentiment was once associated with the left, it has now found a strong foothold on the political right, capitalizing on post-COVID mistrust of institutions like the CDC. This trend raises concerns about the resurgence of preventable diseases.</p>

          <p>Major broadcast groups Sinclair and Nexstar have announced they will resume airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on their ABC affiliate stations, ending a preemptive blackout.

The move follows discussions with Disney and feedback from viewers, concluding a contentious episode that raised questions about media influence and free speech.</p>

          <p>The 79-year-old owner of a Los Angeles car wash has filed a $50 million claim against the federal government after he was allegedly assaulted and wrongfully detained by immigration agents. Rafie Ollah Shouhed, a U.S. citizen, claims that during a raid on his business, masked agents slammed him to the pavement, causing broken ribs and a traumatic brain injury, before detaining him for nearly 12 hours without charges. His attorney called the agents' conduct "lawless, reckless and cruel," highlighting it as an example of overreach in the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement operations in Southern California.</p>

The operation is part of a federal task force established by President Trump to address what he has described as overwhelming violent crime in the city. While the governor framed the deployment as a "generational opportunity" to improve safety, the move has been met with mixed feelings. The Trump administration has been accused of targeting Democratic-led cities with such federal interventions, raising concerns about political motivations.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has argued in a Supreme Court filing that President Trump's firing of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook would not lead to a "financial market disaster." The administration is asking the high court to allow Cook's removal to proceed while her lawsuit against the president continues. Trump seeks to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud that predate her appointment, which she denies. Cook's attorneys argue that allowing the president to remove a governor on "manufactured charges" would eviscerate the Federal Reserve's traditional independence and risk creating economic chaos.
