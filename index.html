        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron plans to decrease its share buybacks to between $2.5 billion and $3 billion in the second quarter, a reduction from the $3.9 billion repurchased in the first quarter, due to falling oil prices influenced by Trump's tariffs and OPEC+ production plans. While maintaining its overall repurchase guidance of $10 to $20 billion for the year, the company's net income declined by over 30% to $3.5 billion. An analyst at RBC Capital Markets noted that this decision reflects a proactive approach to a deteriorating macroeconomic environment, preparing for potential future challenges in the oil market.

          <p>Prince Harry has lost his appeal to reinstate automatic taxpayer-funded police protection during visits to the United Kingdom after stepping down from his senior royal role in 2020. The judge acknowledged Harry's feelings of being unfairly treated but found no legal basis to challenge the government's decision to provide security on a case-by-case basis. Harry's legal team argued that he faces significant security risks, including threats from al-Qaeda, making it difficult to bring his family to the UK. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex now rely on privately funded security, having moved to California after relinquishing their royal duties.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street estimates, although profits declined compared to the previous year due to falling crude oil prices driven by concerns over Trump's tariffs. The company's CEO, Darren Woods, acknowledged the market's volatility, attributing lower earnings to weak oil prices despite strong demand, but volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana combined with cost-cutting measures largely offset lower earnings from weak oil prices. Exxon's global production business saw a 19% increase in earnings, with U.S. production profits soaring by over 70%, while the company returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has ended the 'de minimis' tariff loophole, which allowed low-value goods, primarily from China, to enter the U.S. without import fees. This move aims to address what the White House calls 'deceptive shipping practices' and prevent the unchecked flow of illicit goods, including fentanyl. Consequently, prices for cheap goods are expected to increase, with companies like Temu ceasing direct shipments from China and Shein already raising prices on some items, which is part of the wider US-China trade war. The decision is projected to increase costs for American consumers and potentially disrupt the operations of fast-fashion companies.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is preparing for President Trump's tariffs to potentially hinder economic growth and increase inflation, which could delay interest rate cuts. Despite solid job growth and a stable unemployment rate, the central bank is concerned about the impact of tariffs on business investments, hiring, and consumer sentiment. Officials are debating whether the expected rise in consumer prices will be temporary or lead to persistent inflation, emphasizing the importance of containing tariff-related price pressures to maintain a healthy labor market.

          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence service has classified the Alternative for Germany (AfD) as an extremist party, allowing for more intensive surveillance due to the party's ethnic concept of the people and discrimination against migrants. This classification follows a 1,100-page report and is based on concerns that the AfD's views conflict with Germany's Constitution, though the party dismisses this as a political move. Despite past controversies and extremist views, the AfD has gained significant support, with some polls showing it as the most popular party in the country, leading to debates over whether to ban the party.</p>

For its part, Shell on Friday announced another $3.5 billion share buyback program, which it expects to complete over the next three months.</p>
