          <p>In an interview, former FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb expressed concern over the Trump administration's recent changes to public health policy, particularly regarding immunizations. He criticized the politically-driven reconstitution of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which he believes will restrict vaccine access beyond just COVID-19. Gottlieb, who served in the first Trump administration, warned that these policies align with anti-vaccine sentiments and could undermine scientific innovation and public trust. He also addressed the administration's stance on thimerosal in vaccines and fluoride in water, debunking claims of harm.</p>

          <p>An opinion article asserts that the United States is critically vulnerable due to its dependence on China for rare earth elements, which are vital for modern technology and defense. The author argues that despite years of warnings, the U.S. has failed to build a secure domestic supply chain, allowing Beijing to weaponize its control over these materials. A recent trade framework offering a six-month reprieve on Chinese export licenses is described as a temporary fix that doesn't solve the underlying dependency. The piece calls for a long-term, coherent national strategy to treat critical minerals as instruments of geopolitical power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump made a public plea for a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, urging for a deal to be made and for the return of hostages. His call comes as the Israeli military ordered new mass evacuations in northern Gaza amid ongoing military operations. The war, which began in October 2023, has seen repeated but unsuccessful efforts to broker a lasting peace, with a key sticking point being whether the war should end as part of any agreement. Trump also criticized the ongoing corruption trial of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling it a political distraction.</p>

          <p>Scientists and medical researchers are raising alarms over budget cuts and layoffs at the National Institutes of Health and National Cancer Institute, pushed by the Trump administration. In a CBS News report, they argue these actions jeopardize critical, life-saving research and clinical trials aimed at finding cures for cancer. What was once a bipartisan priority is now facing significant financial setbacks, imperiling the development of new treatments and vaccines. Patients participating in clinical trials also face uncertainty as the future of their potentially life-saving treatments is now at risk.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly criticized North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis for voting against his signature tax and spending bill, threatening to support a primary challenger against him in 2026.

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," examines the profound influence of William F. Buckley Jr. on the American conservative movement. The article highlights how Buckley, through his magazine National Review and TV show "Firing Line," catalyzed a political shift that elevated figures from Barry Goldwater to Ronald Reagan. The book argues that Buckley invented a form of cultural politics that reshaped the Republican Party and ultimately paved the way for the rise of Donald Trump, creating the political landscape seen today.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has made a significant U-turn on its planned welfare reforms following a threatened rebellion from over 120 of its own MPs. The initial proposals, which included making it harder to claim Personal Independence Payment (PIP), were met with fierce opposition over concerns they would harm vulnerable people. After making major concessions, such as limiting PIP cuts to new claimants and tying Universal Credit to inflation, the government appears to have secured the support needed to pass the bill. The episode has raised questions about Prime Minister Keir Starmer's leadership and party management.</p>

Gunn notes that his Superman will be seen bleeding and is not all-powerful, a deliberate shift to create more grounded dramatic stakes.
