          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, is receiving radiation and hormone therapy for an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones. His office had previously announced the diagnosis in May, noting a high Gleason score which indicates a fast-spreading cancer. This new five-week radiation treatment marks a significant point in his care. Questions about his health were a recurring theme during his first term in office, which ultimately led him to not seek re-election.</p>

          <p>Independent movie theaters are adapting to challenges from streaming services and high ticket prices by fostering unique community experiences. Filmmaker Kevin Smith saved his childhood cinema by turning it into a non-profit, Smodcastle Cinemas, that hosts special events and festivals. Other theaters, like Vidiots in Los Angeles and Metrograph in New York, are also thriving by operating as non-profits or for-profit community hubs with added amenities like bookstores and restaurants. The common thread is a focus on creating a social, welcoming space for film lovers.</p>

          <p>As part of a broader ceasefire and hostage-release deal, Hamas is insisting that Israel free prominent Palestinian prisoners, including Marwan Barghouti and Ahmad Saadat. Israel has so far refused to include these high-profile figures, who are seen by many Palestinians as symbols of resistance, on its list of 250 prisoners to be released. This disagreement has become a point of contention in the delicate negotiations, potentially impacting the timeline for the return of 20 Israeli hostages from Gaza. U.S. envoys are involved in mediating the dispute between the two sides.</p>

          <p>North Korea showcased a new, powerful intercontinental ballistic missile, the Hwasong-20, during a large-scale military parade in Pyongyang celebrating the ruling party's 80th anniversary. Leader Kim Jong Un attended the event alongside high-level officials from China, Russia, and Vietnam, signaling a strengthening alliance against the West. In his speech, Kim praised North Korean soldiers sent to fight in Ukraine and called for his military to become an "invincible entity." The display of advanced weaponry, including hypersonic and cruise missiles, underscores his continued focus on expanding his nation's nuclear and conventional capabilities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has proposed a ban that would prohibit Chinese airlines from using Russian airspace for flights to and from the United States. U.S. officials argue that access to Russian airspace gives Chinese carriers an unfair competitive advantage with shorter flight times. Aviation analysts suggest that if the rule is implemented, Chinese airlines could face significant financial losses from canceled flights or be forced to absorb higher operational costs by rerouting. This could lead to increased ticket prices or the cancellation of entire trans-Pacific routes.</p>

          <p>Russia has mandated the installation of a new state-aligned "super app" called Max on every new phone sold in the country, a move seen as a major step toward creating a state-controlled digital sphere. Developed by the tech company VK, the app integrates messaging, payments, and other services, drawing comparisons to China's WeChat. This requirement allows the Kremlin to deepen its surveillance of citizens by centralizing digital activities and restricting access to foreign platforms like WhatsApp. The app is also reportedly being enforced in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine, further extending state control.</p>

The incentives would prioritize subjects with teacher shortages, such as math and science, as well as Welsh-medium teaching. The party stated the policy would cost an estimated £6-£7 million and is intended to make Wales more competitive with teacher incentives offered in England.</p>

They are also challenging the federal murder charge by claiming that the alleged underlying crime of stalking does not qualify as a "crime of violence."

          <p>A social media post by President Donald Trump threatening a "massive increase" in tariffs on Chinese goods caused a sharp stock market sell-off, erasing approximately $2 trillion in value in a single day. The S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, its worst performance since April, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 3.56%. The market's violent reaction reflects fears that escalating trade tensions could derail the U.S. economy, which relies on Chinese imports for many industries. The threat was prompted by China's move to tighten control over its rare earth metal exports, which are crucial for technology and defense manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

This strategy involves making high-profile appearances at major events, criticizing rule changes aimed at player safety as "sissy," and even planning a UFC event on the White House grounds. This alignment with the machismo and confrontational ethos of these sports serves to energize his base and blur the lines between entertainment and politics.

          <p>In a personal essay, a Palestinian writer reflects on the difficulty of mourning her grandmother's peaceful death while witnessing the immense suffering and loss of life in Gaza. She explores the concept of "disenfranchised grief," where personal sorrow feels unearned or inappropriate when compared to a larger, public tragedy. The author grapples with the guilt of comfort and memory in a world of profound disparity, where safety and the privilege to mourn are so unevenly distributed. Ultimately, she finds a form of defiance and remembrance in the act of cooking her grandmother's recipes.</p>

          <h2>The Psychological Benefit of Embracing Regret</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Instead of adhering to a "no regrets" philosophy, a more constructive approach is to view regret as a natural and informative emotion. This article posits that regret is the emotional consequence of having free will and making choices. By allowing ourselves to experience feelings of disappointment or sadness over past decisions, we can gain valuable insights into our present selves and our core values. Rather than being a useless fixation on the past, engaging with regret can become a tool for personal growth and self-understanding.</p>

These stories emphasize the significance of living authentically and offer advice and encouragement to others who may be on a similar path.

          <p>The contest to become the new deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party is shaping up to be a verdict on Prime Minister Keir Starmer's leadership. The two main candidates, Lucy Powell and Bridget Phillipson, offer different approaches to the role. Powell, who was recently sacked from the cabinet, is campaigning on a platform of providing a "course correction" from outside the inner circle, while Phillipson, a current cabinet member, argues for working quietly within the government. The outcome could signal the level of satisfaction or frustration party members feel with the current direction of the government.</p>

          <p>Humanity has achieved a significant milestone by making large-scale famines far less common than in the past, thanks to remarkable progress in agriculture. Innovations from the Green Revolution, such as high-yield crops, synthetic fertilizers, and widespread irrigation, have tripled cereal yields since the 1960s. The world is on track for a record grain harvest this year, producing more food than is consumed. While hunger and malnutrition remain serious issues for billions, modern famines, like those in Gaza and Sudan, are now primarily caused by political conflict and access failures, not food scarcity.</p>

          <p>Following the murder of rightwing influencer Charlie Kirk, the Trump administration and its allies have been accused of using the tragedy to justify broad attacks on political opponents. President Trump has labeled critics the "enemy within" and initiated investigations into liberal donors like George Soros, while allies have branded the Democratic party a "domestic extremist organization." Legal scholars and historians warn that this response follows an "authoritarian playbook," using an act of violence as a pretext to undermine civil society, silence dissent, and consolidate power by targeting a wide range of perceived enemies.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Choate, a 27-year-old woman, survived a rare and often fatal childbirth complication known as an amniotic fluid embolism, which caused her heart to stop during labor. The condition occurs when amniotic fluid enters the mother's bloodstream, triggering a catastrophic shutdown of major organs. Thanks to the quick reaction of her medical team, Choate was resuscitated, and her daughter was delivered safely via C-section. After nine days in intensive care, she made a remarkable recovery without long-term medical issues and is now home with her baby.</p>

This deception may have caused the surveillance aircraft to track a non-existent target or travel to an incorrect location.

Benioff, who also praised the president's performance, made the comments while discussing the need to hire extensive private security for his company's Dreamforce conference. The suggestion drew sharp condemnation from local Democratic leaders, including the District Attorney and State Senator, who rejected the idea of a "military occupation."
