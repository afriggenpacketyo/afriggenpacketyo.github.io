          <p>The Trump administration has issued an ultimatum to 17 major pharmaceutical companies, demanding they commit to lowering U.S. drug prices to "most favored nation" levels by September 29. The letters warn of unspecified government actions if the firms do not comply, a move that caused healthcare stocks to decline. The directive includes selling drugs directly to patients to bypass middlemen and ensuring other developed nations do not receive better prices than the U.S. While some industry leaders have expressed agreement with the president's goals, the ultimatum creates significant uncertainty for the pharmaceutical sector.

          <p>The UK's Met Office has officially named Storm Floris, which is expected to bring heavy rain and strong winds across the country on Monday. Forecasts indicate the storm will travel across the northern half of the UK, with potential wind gusts of 60-70 mph in northern coastal and hilly areas. The storm's development is being fueled by an active jet stream in the Atlantic. Officials warn of potential travel disruptions, damage to temporary structures, and power outages, as trees in full leaf are more susceptible to being toppled by high winds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron reported a 44% decline in its second-quarter net income, falling to $2.49 billion, largely due to lower crude oil prices and a $215 million loss related to its acquisition of Hess Corporation. Despite the drop, the company's adjusted earnings per share of $1.77 beat Wall Street expectations. The acquisition of Hess, completed in July, is expected to boost future earnings and add significant assets in Guyana and the U.S. Chevron achieved record worldwide production of 3.4 million barrels per day, with U.S. output, particularly from the Permian Basin, showing strong growth.

Financial planners emphasize the importance of having an emergency fund in a safe, interest-earning account to handle unexpected expenses without resorting to high-interest debt. To secure the best rates, the article suggests choosing high-yield accounts, exploring online banks which often have lower overhead costs, and comparing different account options to find the most favorable terms and minimal fees for maximizing savings growth over time.

          <p>As of July 31, 2025, the price of gold is reported at $3,313.08 per ounce, though this figure is subject to constant change. Gold is widely regarded as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, historically holding its value during times of economic or market uncertainty. The article explains that its price is influenced by numerous factors, including supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. Other key drivers include interest rates, currency movements (particularly the U.S. dollar), market sentiment, and the policies of central banks regarding their gold reserves.

In an interview, Edlow advocated for a more rigorous exam to better assess applicants' understanding of U.S. history, government, and English proficiency. He also criticized the H-1B visa system for allegedly undercutting American workers and stated that the agency would revisit the "public charge" rule, which assesses if green card applicants are likely to depend on public assistance. Edlow identified the growing case backlog at USCIS as a major operational and national security threat.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's announcement of new widespread tariffs, China has reiterated its firm opposition to what it calls protectionist trade policies. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that "there are no winners in tariff or trade wars," warning that such measures will ultimately harm all parties involved. The new U.S. tariffs target 69 trading partners with duties ranging from 10% to 41%. While some smaller Asian economies received lower rates than previously threatened, the new trade barriers still represent a significant increase and create considerable uncertainty for the global economy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added only 73,000 jobs in July, falling significantly short of the 100,000 forecast and signaling a sharp slowdown in the labor market. Compounding the weakness, job growth figures for May and June were revised downward by a combined 258,000. The unemployment rate increased to 4.2%, while the labor force participation rate declined to its lowest level since November 2022. The disappointing report, which one economist called a "gamechanger," has increased expectations that the Federal Reserve may be prompted to lower interest rates at its next meeting to support the cooling economy.

Many organizations, heavily reliant on U.S. government funding, have chosen not to publicly criticize the cuts, fearing further retaliation or hoping to negotiate privately for the restoration of funds. This strategy is controversial within the sector, with some arguing it teaches a repressive government what it can get away with, while others believe quiet, behind-the-scenes advocacy is more effective.

Experts note that these phenomena may become more frequent due to climate change, which is causing longer and more intense fire seasons.</p>

          <p>An opinion column condemns the Trump administration's decision to incinerate nearly $10 million worth of birth control that was originally purchased by USAID for distribution in low-income countries. The destroyed supplies included hundreds of thousands of implants, IUDs, and pills. The author argues this act is a metaphor for the receding status of women and part of a broader trend of hostility towards contraception, citing recent domestic cuts to Title X funding. The column asserts that these policies deny women control over their bodies and opportunities for advancement, subordinating their lives to childbearing.</p>

          <p>The Labubu doll, a fluffy, monster-like figurine from Chinese toy retailer Pop Mart, has become a global phenomenon, particularly after being seen with celebrities like Rihanna. Collectors describe the dolls as a form of "social currency," with their popularity fueled by social media unboxings and limited-edition releases that sell out in minutes. The craze has led to rising prices and a difficult purchasing process, as Pop Mart has moved sales to its app to combat bots and resellers. Despite frustrations over price hikes and accessibility, the trend shows no signs of slowing down, with fans and resellers still eager to acquire the coveted collectibles.</p>

          <p>A professor at City University of Hong Kong reports a "staggering" brain drain of U.S.-based climate scientists who are seeking opportunities abroad due to a difficult political and funding environment in the United States. The professor noted that half of the candidates for recent professorships at the university were from top U.S. institutions like Harvard and Yale. He has been actively reaching out to American colleagues, offering positions in Hong Kong as a "safe haven" for young scientists.

The move follows a deadline for countries to finalize trade agreements with the U.S. While some partners like the EU and Japan have secured deals with lower rates, Canada will see its duties jump to 35%.

The cost of selecting a seat will vary depending on the route, travel date, and seat location, potentially adding hundreds of dollars to a family's travel expenses. For example, a "preferred" seat on a February flight from Denver to Orlando costs an additional $41-$46, while an extra-legroom seat costs $96.
