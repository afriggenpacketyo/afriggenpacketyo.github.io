            <p>An Israeli airstrike struck a field hospital in Gaza, killing a medic and wounding others, following an earlier strike on the Al-Ahli Hospital that rendered it "out of service." The attacks occurred as ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas continue with little progress. Hamas officials have said there will be no ceasefire without a commitment by Israel to end the war and withdraw forces from Gaza. The strikes have been condemned by the UN and other organizations, emphasizing the need to protect medical facilities under international humanitarian law.</p>

            <p>European companies are increasingly concerned about being marginalized in China as Beijing bolsters its technological independence through the "Made in China 2025" initiative. Foreign firms fear exclusion once Chinese companies achieve comparable technology. The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China warns that this could lead to a less globalized world and trigger external actions damaging to China's economy and global standing. The chamber recommends China focus on opening up and attracting foreign investment with clear metrics and accountability.</p>

Plaintiffs allege the DWP ignored wind warnings and kept electrical equipment energized, contributing to the fire.

            <p>A toxic algae bloom is affecting brown pelicans in Southern California, causing a dual crisis of adult birds being poisoned and baby birds starving. Domoic acid, a neurotoxin produced by the bloom, is sickening adult pelicans, leaving baby pelicans without parental care. Rescue centers are overwhelmed with malnourished baby pelicans who are too young to fish on their own. Experts believe runoff from the Los Angeles firestorm may have elevated the bloom.</p>
