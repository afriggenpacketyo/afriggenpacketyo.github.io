          <p>A New York Times article reports that federal transportation safety officials are investigating after two commercial flights had to abort landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport due to an Army Black Hawk helicopter entering restricted airspace. Air traffic controllers instructed Delta Air Lines Flight 1671 and Republic Airways Flight 5825 to abort their landings. The FAA had restricted nonessential helicopter traffic around the airport after a fatal collision in January. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy expressed outrage, and Senator Ted Cruz called for legislation to improve civilian air safety. The Army stated that the incident is under investigation and that they are committed to aviation safety.</p>

          <p>Rolando Romero defeated Ryan Garcia by unanimous decision in a boxing match held in Times Square, marking Garcia's first loss since his win against Devin Haney was overturned due to a failed drug test.

Haney also won his fight against Jos√© Ram√≠rez in the co-main event, and Te√≥fimo L√≥pez retained his WBO title. The event, funded by Saudi Arabia, featured fighters arriving in unique vehicles and celebrity lookalikes as ring card holders. Garcia's future is now uncertain after his lackluster performance.</p>

          <p>A BBC article reports on the significant gains made by Reform UK in the recent local elections across England. The party secured control of several councils from both Labour and the Conservatives, marking a shift in the political landscape. The Liberal Democrats also gained seats, while both Labour and the Conservatives experienced major losses. The mayoral contests presented a mixed outcome, with Labour retaining some positions and Reform UK picking up new mayoralties. The results suggest a potential loosening of the traditional main parties' hold on voters, with Reform UK emerging as a key player.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Welle reports that the Trump administration has criticized Germany's decision to designate the far-right AfD party as a "right-wing extremist" group, leading to a diplomatic dispute. US officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, condemned the move, while Germany defended its decision as necessary to protect its constitution. The AfD has gained popularity in recent years by capitalizing on fears over migration and is now a major opposition party. The designation gives authorities greater powers to monitor the party's activities, potentially leading to efforts to ban the party.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article reveals that water supplies ran dry during the Pacific Palisades fire due to a reservoir being shut down for repairs, and the city failed to prepare an alternative reservoir in time. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power had considered reviving an old reservoir but ultimately deemed it too risky. Firefighters reported hydrants running dry as the fire raged, and the inability to bring either reservoir online undermined the potential water supply. Lawyers representing wildfire victims believe the water supply issues played a role in the destruction, and the city is now working to restore the main reservoir to service.</p>

          <p>ABC News reports that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is pushing back against President Trump's executive order to cease direct funding to NPR and PBS. The CPB argues that Congress, not the president, controls its funding and that it is an independent, non-profit corporation. Trump's order claims that NPR and PBS have fueled partisanship and left-wing propaganda. PBS president and CEO Paula Kerger warned that a loss of federal funding would disproportionately affect rural communities and impact access to essential content. Senators and representatives have responded along party lines, with Republicans supporting the defunding and Democrats condemning it as authoritarian.</p>

China, a key supporter of Bashar al-Assad, must navigate this dilemma as it seeks to deepen its strategic partnership with Syria. This could complicate China's broader ambitions in the region.</p>

          <p>NPR reports that a federal judge has struck down President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie, deeming it unconstitutional. Judge Beryl Howell found the order to be an attack on the independence of the legal profession and the judicial system. The order had imposed punitive measures on Perkins Coie for representing clients and causes that Trump disliked. The judge framed the targeting of Perkins as an attack on the foundational principles of the American legal system. Perkins Coie welcomed the ruling, affirming core constitutional freedoms.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article details the testimony of Miriam Haley, the first accuser to testify against Harvey Weinstein in his Manhattan retrial on sexual assault charges. Haley recounted the details of the sexual assault, leading to heated exchanges with Weinstein's lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean. The retrial was ordered after New York's highest court overturned Weinstein's previous conviction. Prosecutors argue that Weinstein used his power to sexually assault women, while the defense claims the interactions were consensual. Haley also testified about money she received from a settlement fund.</p>

Experts discuss how changes in diagnostic criteria and increased awareness have contributed to the rise. While some worry about potential misconceptions, others view the increase in diagnoses as a positive step toward providing support to those who were previously undiagnosed.</p>
