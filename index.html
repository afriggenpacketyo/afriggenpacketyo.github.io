          <p>The BBC provides a visual breakdown of the 2025 Canadian federal election results, indicating that Mark Carney's Liberal Party is projected to win enough seats to form a government. However, it remains uncertain whether they will secure a majority. The Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre, are expected to remain the opposition. Both major parties saw an increase in their share of the national vote at the expense of smaller parties, particularly the New Democratic Party, whose leader lost his seat. The election outcome reflects a shift in voter preferences and realignments in the Canadian political landscape.</p>

          <p>Dr. Victoria McCloud, the UK's first openly transgender judge, plans to challenge the Supreme Court's ruling on biological sex at the European Court of Human Rights. She argues that the judgment and subsequent guidance violate her human rights, leaving her legally in a state of "nonsense" by being "two sexes at once." The Supreme Court's ruling defines a woman by biological sex under equalities law, leading to interim guidance that may exclude trans women from women's facilities. Dr. McCloud claims trans people were excluded from the court case and that human rights arguments were not adequately considered, leading to this further legal challenge.</p>

          <p>Volvo Cars announced a significant cost-cutting plan of 18 billion Swedish krona ($1.87 billion) and withdrew its financial guidance for 2025 and 2026 after reporting a sharp fall in first-quarter operating profit. The company attributes the decline to reduced wholesales, adverse currency effects, and increased competition in the automotive industry. CEO HÃ¥kan Samuelsson cited tariff pressures and the entry of new players in the electric vehicle market as factors making future predictions difficult. The cost-cutting measures will include reductions in investments and potential redundancies across its global operations.</p>

          <p>Young voters in Australia, now outnumbering baby boomers, are poised to express their frustration with climate inaction at the upcoming election. Many young people feel disempowered by current and former governments' insufficient efforts to address the climate crisis, leading to a "youthquake" in electoral power. Groups like the Australian Youth Climate Coalition are demanding significant reductions in carbon emissions and a rapid transition to renewable energy. However, the influence of the fossil fuel sector on Australian politics and the debate over energy affordability complicate the path towards stronger climate policies.</p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party secured a victory in the federal election, seemingly fueled by President Trump's territorial threats and tariff tactics. The win marks a political turnaround for the Liberals, with Mark Carney now at the helm, as they secured more seats than the rival Conservatives. Trump's repeated threats to annex Canada and his tariffs dominated the campaign, influencing voters who prioritized sovereignty and economic stability. Carney emphasized the need for Canada to look out for itself and build broader partnerships in response to the changing relationship with the United States.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul and state lawmakers reached a budget deal that includes an additional criminal charge for individuals who wear masks while committing crimes. The charge applies to those accused of a Class A misdemeanor or more serious offenses, with a reduced penalty for separate charges. This measure aims to address concerns raised last summer about suspects concealing their identities during criminal acts. The budget also includes provisions for involuntary commitment of mentally ill individuals and a ban on student cell phone use during the school day.</p>

          <p>The Society of Radiographers (SoR) is advocating for a policy change to allow male health workers to perform mammograms to address critical staff shortages. Currently, mammograms are exclusively performed by female staff, leading to a vacancy rate of 17.5% among specialized mammographers. While some women express discomfort with the idea, others support the change if it ensures access to life-saving screenings. The SoR believes this could attract more qualified individuals to the profession and help deliver the service more effectively.</p>

This proposal aims to address concerns about excess sugar consumption, particularly among children.

While the original exemption for milk-based drinks was due to concerns about calcium intake, the Treasury argues that the health benefits do not justify the harms from excess sugar. </p>

More comprehensive talks in the second half of the year could lead to a further reduction in tariffs on Chinese imports, bringing them down to 34 per cent by yearâs end, reflecting the removal of the 20 per cent fentanyl-related tariff, according to the note.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberals have secured victory in Canada's federal election, propelled by a backlash against President Trump's policies and comments. This marks a significant turnaround for the party, which had been struggling in the polls. Carney emphasized the threat posed by Trump and the need to protect Canada's sovereignty. The election results highlight divisions within Canada, with the Liberals largely shut out of Alberta and Saskatchewan. </p>

The past year has been devastating for incumbent governments around the world, with parties all along the political spectrum losing ground or outright control â with the US, UK, Japan, Germany, France and India among the most prominent examples.</p>
