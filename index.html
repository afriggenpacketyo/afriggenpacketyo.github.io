          <h2>States Sue Trump Administration Over HHS Layoffs</h2>

          <p>Nineteen states and Washington D.C. have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the layoffs of thousands of Health and Human Services (HHS) staffers. The lawsuit, filed in Rhode Island federal court, alleges that the administration's job cuts disproportionately impact crucial agencies like the CDC and FDA, hindering their ability to perform essential functions. The states argue that these layoffs have disrupted access to vital data and grants, impacting worker safety and Head Start programs. The lawsuit seeks to halt the reorganization and job cuts, asserting they exceed HHS's legal authority and violate the separation of powers doctrine, while also questioning RFK Jr.'s views on public health. The lawsuit highlights the potential damage to public health and safety due to the staff reductions.</p>

          <p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has announced he will not seek the Republican nomination for the Georgia Senate seat in the upcoming election, a key contest for control of the Senate. Kemp stated that being on the ballot next year is not the right decision for him and his family. He has expressed his commitment to work alongside Senate GOP leadership and President Trump to ensure a strong Republican nominee can win the election next November.

          <p>Former Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva has switched his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican, citing disillusionment with the Democratic Party's values. Villanueva criticized the "party of paid protests, purple hair, and pronouns" and embraced the Republican Party's focus on "faith, family, and freedom." Republican leaders in California welcomed the move, with some noting that the Democratic Party has lost its way and now champions crime and criminals. While some critics welcomed his departure, Republicans hope his switch signals a broader shift in California's political landscape ahead of the 2026 midterms.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art's annual Met Gala has raised a record $31 million this year, solidifying its position as the city's pre-eminent benefit event. The proceeds will support the Costume Institute, the only department that independently raises its operating budget. This year's exhibition, "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style," marks a significant departure by focusing on designers of color and Black dandyism. Despite the gala's glamour and cultural cachet, staging the event is costly, with last year's gala incurring over $6 million in expenses, including entertainment. Anna Wintour's influence shapes the event, transforming it into a powerhouse of public relations and profitability for Vogue.</p>

          <p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has decided against running for Senate in 2026, denying Republicans their strongest potential candidate against Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff. Kemp, a popular two-term governor, cited family reasons for his decision, though his complex relationship with Donald Trump loomed over a potential campaign. Despite Trump's past attacks, Kemp maintained a respectful distance, never engaging in performative groveling. Ossoff, who has already raised $11 million, is preparing for a tough race, accusing Trump of authoritarian impulses. Several other prominent Georgia Republicans are now likely to consider running for the open seat.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump falsely claimed that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. According to AAA, U.S. drivers are actually paying an average of $3.165 per gallon, significantly higher than Trump's claim. Trump's figure appears to be based on RBOB gasoline futures, which touched $1.98 per gallon but do not reflect the retail price paid by consumers. Analysts emphasize that the RBOB contract excludes taxes, transportation, and other costs, making it irrelevant to consumers.</p>

          <p>U.S. crude oil futures fell after OPEC+ agreed to increase production for a second consecutive month. The decision to raise output by another 411,000 barrels per day in June surprised the market, leading to concerns about oversupply amid fears of a recession. Goldman Sachs cut its forecast for U.S. crude prices this year, anticipating downside risks due to high spare capacity and recession risks. Oilfield service firms expect investment in exploration and production to decline due to the weak price environment, and major oil companies have reported lower earnings.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is reducing its overpayment clawback rate from 100% to 50% after facing criticism that the higher rate caused financial hardship for beneficiaries. The change comes after the SSA began recovering overpayments by taking 100% of beneficiaries' monthly checks, a policy directed by Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek to safeguard taxpayer funds. The agency's inspector general found that many overpayments were due to SSA's own calculation errors. While the reduction is a step in the right direction, some advocates argue that taking half of the monthly benefit will still burden many disabled workers.</p>

          <p>Air traffic controllers at Newark Liberty International Airport experienced a temporary loss of communication with planes, causing disruptions and delays. The communication breakdown occurred on April 28, leading controllers to take absences under the Federal Employees Compensation Act. The incident compounds existing issues at the airport, including staffing shortages, runway construction, and bad weather. Senator Chuck Schumer has called for an investigation into the problems, blaming mismanagement at the FAA and cuts imposed by the Trump administration for the staffing issues.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has directed his administration to reopen and expand Alcatraz prison to house Americaâ€™s most violent criminals, a proposal met with criticism, especially from California Democrats. Critics called the idea "absurd on its face" and a political distraction, noting the prison's closure in 1963 due to operational expenses and escape attempts. The Bureau of Prisons said the prison had no fresh water source and that it was more effective to build a new institution than to keep Alcatraz open. Civil rights advocates condemned the proposal as a wasteful and dangerous joke.</p>
