          <p>A worldwide movement to protect children online is spurring the development of new AI-powered safety technologies. Prompted by new legislation like the U.K.'s Online Safety Act, which imposes significant fines on non-compliant tech companies, firms are increasingly adopting age verification systems. Companies such as Yoti are leading this new market with AI that estimates age from facial features, though this has raised privacy concerns among critics. In addition to software, hardware solutions like child-safe smartphones are also emerging to prevent children's exposure to harmful content.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. State Department has blocked Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and 80 other officials from attending the upcoming UN General Assembly by revoking their visas. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio cited actions that allegedly undermine peace efforts as the reason for the decision, which was praised by Israel. The move is unusual, as the U.S. is generally expected to facilitate travel for officials visiting the UN headquarters. This action occurs as international efforts, led by France, are underway to recognize a Palestinian state, a move the current U.S. administration opposes.</p>

          <p>Violent protests in Makassar, Indonesia, resulted in the deaths of three people after demonstrators set a local council building on fire. The unrest was triggered by the death of a motorcycle taxi driver who was run over by a police vehicle. The three victims were trapped inside the burning building. In the capital, Jakarta, related protests targeted the headquarters of the Brimob paramilitary police unit, which was blamed for the driver's death. President Prabowo Subianto has called for calm and promised a thorough investigation into the incident.</p>

Attorney General Pam Bondi confirmed the termination, stating that disrespecting law enforcement is unacceptable within the department. This follows the recent firing of another DOJ paralegal, highlighting a strict stance on employee conduct amid a heightened federal law enforcement presence in the city.</p>

          <p>Micah Parsons has been traded from the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers, where he signed a four-year, $188 million contract, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Parsons expressed his excitement about joining the historic franchise after what he described as the 'hardest four months' of his life during a contract stalemate with Dallas. The trade, which involved the Packers sending two first-round picks and Kenny Clark to the Cowboys, provides Green Bay with a formidable pass rusher expected to significantly boost their defense.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Reveals Tactical Struggles for Manchester United Under Manager Ruben Amorim</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United's performance issues under manager Ruben Amorim are being attributed to the rigid and predictable nature of his 5-2-3 tactical system. An analysis following a recent loss to Grimsby Town shows how the team's reliance on positional play and specific passing routines is easily countered by opponents using man-to-man marking. The system allows for little individual creativity, and the team's defensive structure is often outnumbered in midfield. Despite significant investment in new players, Amorim's methods have yet to prove effective in the highly competitive Premier League.</p>

          <p>North Korea has significantly increased its importation of Chinese wine, with volume more than doubling in the first seven months of 2025 compared to the previous year. This makes the isolated nation the second-largest buyer of Chinese bottled wine by volume. This trade continues despite extensive international sanctions against North Korea, as alcohol is not explicitly included on the UN's list of banned luxury goods. The data highlights a key economic link that persists between Beijing and Pyongyang, providing the regime with access to foreign products.</p>

          <p>The European Union's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, has declared that frozen Russian assets will not be returned to Moscow until reparations have been paid for the war in Ukraine.

Approximately 210 billion euros of Russian assets are currently frozen within the bloc under sanctions. While some member states advocate for confiscating the assets to directly aid Kyiv, others have raised legal questions, shifting the debate towards their use post-conflict.</p>

          <p>Randy 'Duke' Cunningham, a celebrated U.S. Navy flying ace from the Vietnam War whose congressional career ended in a massive bribery scandal, has died at 83. After a highly decorated military career, he served eight terms in the House of Representatives before pleading guilty in 2005 to accepting $2.4 million in bribes from defense contractors. The case was one of the largest congressional corruption scandals in history, leading to an eight-year prison sentence. He was pardoned by President Donald Trump in 2021.</p>
