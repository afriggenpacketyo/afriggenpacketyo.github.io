          <h2>India and Pakistan Engage in Escalating Military Confrontation Amid International Calls for De-escalation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India and Pakistan are embroiled in a dangerous escalation of armed conflict, with both sides reporting attacks on military sites and heavy shelling along their border. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has spoken with leaders from both countries, urging immediate de-escalation to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control. The conflict began after India retaliated for a deadly terrorist attack with strikes inside Pakistani territory, leading to a series of counter-attacks and claims of downed drones and missiles. Civilians in cities like Jammu are experiencing blackouts and panic, with reports of blasts and sirens, raising concerns about the potential for further escalation. Despite claims from both sides that they are not seeking to intensify the conflict, the ongoing violence and military actions suggest a precarious situation between the two nuclear-armed nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) plans to discontinue tracking the costs associated with billion-dollar disasters, citing evolving priorities and staffing changes. This decision raises concerns among insurance companies, researchers, and policymakers who rely on this data to understand the economic impacts of extreme weather events. Critics argue that ending the data collection will hinder efforts to address the risks posed by climate change and extreme weather, as it removes a crucial metric for assessing the financial implications of these events. Senator Ed Markey and climate researcher Virginia Iglesias have voiced strong opposition, emphasizing the importance of this database for informed decision-making and resource allocation. The article underscores the increasing frequency of billion-dollar disasters and the potential consequences of limiting access to this critical information.</p>

          <p>The Florida Highway Patrol (FHP) is now enforcing federal immigration laws on state roads through the 287(g) agreement, a move hailed by Governor Ron DeSantis as a national model. This initiative allows trained state officers to enforce immigration law in partnership with federal agents, marking a significant shift in state law enforcement authority. During a ride-along with Fox News, troopers initiated a traffic stop that led to the apprehension of an individual with prior convictions. FHP is the only state agency currently operating under this agreement, and has already detained numerous undocumented individuals during traffic stops. While immigration advocates criticize the agreement as racial profiling, officials assert that FHP has a lawful basis for these stops and operates with transparency and professionalism.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has reached its highest level since February, climbing above $100,000, driven by positive market sentiment following President Trump's trade announcement. The cryptocurrency's price increased nearly 5%, reaching $100,881.90, according to Coin Metrics. Analysts suggest that recent market uncertainty has benefited Bitcoin, with investors viewing it as a safe-haven asset amid doubts about the stability of the U.S. economy. The pro-crypto stance of the Trump administration and strong buying from spot-ETF investors are also contributing factors. However, experts caution that Bitcoin's resilience will be tested further due to geopolitical tensions and the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to cutting rates.</p>

Gates expressed optimism that the foundation's goals in health and human development can be achieved in a shorter time frame, emphasizing the potential of biomedical tools and AI. He acknowledges the challenges posed by post-pandemic setbacks and political headwinds but remains confident in the power of innovation and the 'Golden Rule' to drive progress.

          <p>A new law in Washington state requiring clergy to report child abuse disclosed during confession has sparked a major conflict between the Catholic Church and the federal government. The Archdiocese of Seattle has threatened to excommunicate priests who comply with the law, while the Department of Justice has launched a civil rights investigation, citing potential violations of the First Amendment. Supporters of the law argue that it is necessary to protect children, while critics, including Thomas Plante, warn that it could discourage people from confessing and seeking help. The law has ignited a debate over religious freedom, the seal of confession, and the responsibility to report child abuse.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several states, including Arkansas, Ohio, and Arizona, are attempting to reinstate Medicaid work requirements, which could affect low-income Americans who rely on the program for health insurance. These requirements, previously halted by courts, mandate that individuals work a certain number of hours to maintain their Medicaid coverage. Critics argue that these measures will disproportionately impact vulnerable populations, including those with disabilities or caregiving responsibilities. Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders claims the requirements will move people off government dependency, while advocates argue they are simply a tactic to reduce Medicaid enrollment. Studies suggest that most eligible adults on Medicaid are already working or exempt, and previous attempts to implement such requirements have resulted in significant coverage losses.</p>

Sources report that Fetterman repeated himself, shouted, and slammed his hands on a desk, leading to a staff member's emotional breakdown. This incident follows a New York Magazine story highlighting concerns about Fetterman's mental state, including a letter from his former chief of staff detailing alarming behavior. While Fetterman's office attributed the incident to frustration with the Trump administration's education cuts, the event has reignited questions about his well-being and ability to serve effectively.</p>

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn his nomination of Ed Martin for U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., following unified opposition from Senate Democrats and pushback from some Republicans. Martin, a Republican activist with no prosecutorial experience, faced criticism for his views on the January 6th Capitol attack and past associations. Senator Thom Tillis stated he could not support Martin due to his views on January 6th, while others cited Martin's lack of relevant experience. Trump indicated he would find another role for Martin in his administration, but one that does not require Senate confirmation.</p>

The GENIUS Act, which would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, fell short of the necessary votes after advancing out of committee with bipartisan support. Democrats, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, expressed concerns that the bill would enable corruption and undermine consumer protection laws, particularly given the Trump family's recent deal with a crypto firm.

          <p>President Trump announced a plan to overhaul the nation's air traffic control system, replacing technology at thousands of sites and building new coordination centers, after an outage at Newark airport. The plan includes replacing over 4,600 air traffic control sites, building six new air traffic coordination centers, buying 25,000 new radios, replacing hundreds of radars, and installing 4,000 new high-speed network connections. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy cited the Newark outage, caused by a fried copper wire, as an example of why modernization is needed. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian supports upgrading the air traffic control system, emphasizing the need for significant government investment.</p>

While the announcement was met with congratulatory remarks, observers note that the coming negotiations could take months to finalize.

The announcement was seen as politically motivated, both in the UK and the US, with hopes that the details won’t kill the deal.

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking Supreme Court intervention to end a program that allowed over 500,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians, and Venezuelans to temporarily live and work in the United States. The request arises from a case challenging Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision to revoke the parole granted to migrants from these countries. A federal district court had previously halted the termination, but the administration argues that federal immigration law grants the Homeland Security secretary discretion over parole decisions. The administration claims that the district court's order undermines its control over foreign policy and immigration, while critics argue that the move will harm vulnerable populations.</p>
