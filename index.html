          <p>President Trump is facing scrutiny over accepting a $400 million luxury jumbo jet from the government of Qatar, raising concerns about potential quid pro quo arrangements. The gift has sparked debate about violating the emoluments clause of the constitution, which bars federal officials from accepting high-value gifts without congressional approval. Since Trump's second presidential victory, the Trump Organization has seen increased activity in the Gulf region, including plans for Trump towers and golf resorts in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE. The proposed gift from Qatar is further complicated by the Trump family's ventures into cryptocurrency, with deals located in the Gulf states.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are moving forward with key components of their bill to fund President Trump’s agenda, including significant Medicaid cuts, despite facing internal resistance. The bill proposes slashing Medicaid spending by imposing work requirements, conducting more frequent eligibility checks, and penalizing states offering Medicaid to illegal immigrants. While the Congressional Budget Office estimates the health portions would save about $715 billion, it also projects that at least 8.6 million more Americans will become uninsured. The legislation also includes tax provisions, such as extending Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act and temporarily increasing the child tax credit.</p>

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced he would place holds on President Trump's Justice Department nominees in response to the Qatari-offered jet for the president's use. Schumer called the possible gift "so corrupt" that even Russian President Vladimir Putin "would give a double take," while calling it a "grave national security threat." He is calling on Attorney General Pam Bondi to testify before Congress to explain why the gift does not violate any ethics law or the emoluments clause. The holds would slow the nominations by requiring Senate Republicans to take each procedural vote rather than moving forward with the nominees under an expedited timeframe.</p>

          <p>Non-profits operating in the US-Mexico borderlands are facing increased surveillance and a more intense atmosphere since the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration. Volunteers with Border Angels, who provide water and food for migrants, report more frequent interactions with border patrol agents and vandalism of their supplies. Despite a drop in illegal crossings, some migrants continue to take the risk, and the lack of legal options has opened the door for coyotes and smugglers. The report details harrowing stories of migrants struggling to survive in the harsh terrain, as well as increased surveillance technology monitoring the area.</p>

The technology gives users control over visual languages that artists have honed over their careers, potentially devaluing those styles. While individual works of art are protected by copyright, visual styles are not, leading to questions about whether OpenAI is liable for millions of dollars in damages. This situation has the flavor of an endorsement deal, where the company is promoting a tech product, in part through its executives’ social media, with the ability to manufacture images in a specific style.</p>

The so-called de minimis package loophole had long allowed Chinese e-commerce firms to ship low-value goods to U.S.-based customers duty-free. The end of the de minimis exemption has upended the business models of companies like Shein and Temu, leaving U.S. consumers unable to procure affordable fashion from the popular e-commerce sites.</p>

The Food and Drug Administration said it will conduct a scientific review of the products by late October with the aim of removing them from the market. Commissioner Marty Makary said the products pose a risk when swallowed by children because they may interfere with healthy gut bacteria that are critical to digestion, immunity and other key bodily functions.

The book follows researchers who have studied the paisa mutation, which causes the illness in nearly everyone who inherits it. Smith also tells the stories of some members of the 6,000-person clan who participate in research trials, donate loved ones’ brains, and care for one another while bracing for their turn. Through the characters she speaks with over six years, Smith suggests that forgetting might be more than just an existential loss; it might also be a chance to explore other forms of humanity that are grounded in feeling, presence, or touch.</p>

          <p>Liverpool fans are expressing disappointment and betrayal over Trent Alexander-Arnold's potential departure to Real Madrid. Fans feel that Alexander-Arnold, who claims to be a local lad whose dreams came true, is betraying the club by running down his contract and potentially leaving for free. The emotional aspect of losing a player who embodies the club's values and connection to the city is particularly tough to accept. Fans believe that if Alexander-Arnold genuinely loved the club, he would have signed a new deal with a clause for Real Madrid.</p>
