          <p>This article details the Senate's version of a major Republican spending and tax bill, a centerpiece of President Trump's agenda. The legislation aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent, increase border and defense spending, and is funded partly by cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP. Key provisions include new work requirements for Medicaid, adjustments to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, and raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. The bill is advancing through a reconciliation process, allowing it to pass with a simple majority. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has abruptly canceled two pandemic-era grant programs that provided about $1 billion for food aid organizations to buy produce directly from local farmers. This decision, described as a return to fiscal responsibility, has left both small farmers and the communities they serve struggling. Nonprofits like Springfield Community Gardens, which supplied fresh food to schools and seniors in food deserts, are now facing significant shortfalls. The cuts are affecting over 8,000 small farmers nationwide who relied on this income, threatening to worsen food insecurity in vulnerable areas.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark was named a captain for the 2025 WNBA All-Star Game, largely due to overwhelming fan support where she ranked first. However, a breakdown of the voting revealed a starkly different view from her colleagues, who ranked her as only the ninth-best guard in the league. The final starter selection combines votes from fans (50%), media (25%), and players (25%).

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, a new generation of younger investors is significantly influencing market trends by favoring companies with bold, innovative ideas over traditional blue-chip stocks. He suggests these investors are drawn to narratives and growth potential, rewarding companies like Robinhood and Reddit while being less interested in established firms focused on stock buybacks. Cramer posits that the market is currently "story-dominated," focusing more on the power of individual company ideas rather than being solely driven by Federal Reserve policy or institutional hedge fund strategies. This shift represents a re-evaluation of what constitutes growth and value in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health suggests that logistical obstacles are a primary reason for falling childhood vaccination rates in the UK, more so than vaccine hesitancy. Difficulties booking appointments, getting time off work, and a lack of clear reminders are preventing many parents from getting their children vaccinated. This decline has led to the resurgence of preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough. Experts are calling for better support and easier access, such as using NHS apps for booking and expanding vaccination services to reverse the concerning trend.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s tenure as U.S. Health Secretary, highlighting his dual focus on tackling chronic disease and his history of promoting health conspiracies. While he has gained some support for targeting food additives and processed foods in his "Make America Healthy Again" campaign, he draws intense criticism from the scientific community for his skepticism towards vaccines. Kennedy has dismantled expert committees and questioned established public health measures, creating a tension between his ambitious health goals and policies that critics argue are not backed by solid science and could cause significant harm.</p>

The administration claims the gang constitutes a "hybrid criminal state" and a "predatory incursion," giving the president authority.

While proponents believe it could provide a crucial strategic advantage, particularly in a potential conflict over Taiwan, significant questions remain about the project's technological feasibility and immense cost.

          <p>Robinhood's stock hit an all-time high after the company announced it would offer tokenized shares of private companies, including OpenAI and SpaceX, to its users in the European Union. This move, a first for the company, makes equity in these highly sought-after, non-public companies accessible on the blockchain through its EU crypto app. The launch is part of a broader global crypto expansion for Robinhood, which is leveraging the EU's more flexible regulatory environment. While the feature is not yet available to U.S. customers due to regulatory hurdles, it marks a significant step in democratizing access to private market investments. (not investment advice)</p>
