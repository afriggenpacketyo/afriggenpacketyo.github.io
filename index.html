          <p>At the memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro addressed the issue of rising political violence in the United States. Shapiro, whose own residence was targeted in an arson attack, described the nation as being at an "inflection point" and urged for healing and unity. He commended Kirk for his commitment to public debate and speech on college campuses and in town squares. The governor emphasized that the appropriate response to speech one disagrees with is more debate and engagement, not violence, a sentiment he hopes the country will embrace following recent tragic events.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, along with other prominent American business leaders like Larry Ellison and Michael Dell, are likely to be part of the investment group for the U.S. operations of TikTok. The deal aims to address national security concerns by transferring control from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to American entities. According to the White House, the new structure would feature a seven-member board with six Americans and place U.S. data and privacy under Oracle's management. Negotiations between the U.S. and China are ongoing, with both sides releasing statements that suggest key details are still being finalized.</p>

          <p>In a coordinated diplomatic shift, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have officially recognized a Palestinian state, joining over 140 other nations. The leaders of the three countries stated the move is intended to build momentum for a two-state solution and revive hopes for peace, clarifying it is not a reward for Hamas, which they assert has no future role. The decision drew a sharp rebuke from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a "huge reward to terror" and vowed that no Palestinian state would be established west of the Jordan River. This symbolic but historic recognition marks a significant moment in the long-standing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <p>A shooting at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, resulted in one death and two injuries during a Saturday evening dinner service. Authorities have arrested 23-year-old Hunter Nadeau, a former employee of the club, and charged him with second-degree murder. The deceased victim was identified as 59-year-old Robert Steven DeCesare, who was dining with his family. Officials praised the courageous actions of other patrons in the restaurant who intervened to stop the shooter, potentially preventing a more tragic outcome. The investigation is ongoing to determine a motive, though authorities have stated it was not a hate-motivated crime.</p>

She highlighted the impact Kirk had on young people, including her own brother, and emphasized the importance of bringing Christianity back into American households as a path to national healing.

          <p>The Department of Justice has reportedly closed a public corruption investigation into Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," that was initiated during the previous administration. The probe involved an FBI sting operation where Homan was allegedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover agents posing as business executives, in a potential exchange for help with government contracts. After the investigation was handed over to the new administration, DOJ leadership reviewed the case and ultimately decided to shut it down. In a statement, top officials said they found no credible evidence of criminal wrongdoing, while the White House criticized the probe as a politically motivated effort to target Trump's allies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly called on Attorney General Pam Bondi to expedite investigations into his political adversaries, including former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James. In a social media post, Trump expressed frustration over a perceived lack of action, stating the delay is damaging the country's reputation. The call for prosecution was criticized by Democrats as an abuse of power and a step toward authoritarianism. This development follows the departure of a federal prosecutor who reportedly concluded there was insufficient evidence to charge James, a claim Trump disputes while praising Bondi's performance as attorney general.</p>

          <p>Gary Cohn, former National Economic Council director in the first Trump administration, stated that the U.S. job market has degraded, a view he says is shared by the Federal Reserve. Speaking after the Fed's recent interest rate cut, Cohn pointed to a slowdown in job creation from over 100,000 to less than 50,000 jobs per month. He attributes this to companies aggressively managing labor costs in a difficult economic environment with rising input costs from tariffs. Cohn suggests that after a period of "hoarding labor" post-COVID, businesses are now letting their workforce decline naturally, a trend reflected in recent economic data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump appeared to dismiss the significance of new Pentagon restrictions that require journalists to pledge not to report on unauthorized information. When asked about the policy, Trump stated he doesn't believe the Pentagon should control what reporters cover and commented, "Nothing stops reporters." The directive, issued by the recently rebranded Department of War, has been heavily criticized by press freedom advocates as a form of prior restraint and a direct assault on independent journalism. The new rules, which also limit reporters' physical access within the building, come after a period of increased hostility toward major media organizations from the department's leadership.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly condemned the United Kingdom's decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state, labeling it an "absurd prize for terrorism." He argued that such a move rewards Hamas for its deadly attack in 2023 and will not lead to the establishment of a Palestinian state. The sentiment was echoed by other Israeli officials and groups representing hostages' families, who believe the recognition undermines efforts to secure the release of captives. In contrast, Israel's opposition leader criticized Netanyahu, asserting that the diplomatic shift was a direct result of the current government's political recklessness and refusal to end the war.</p>

In response, England chased down the total with 17 balls to spare, with Cox's crucial 55 runs anchoring the innings after an unsteady start. Cox, who was a late addition to the squad, demonstrated his value after overcoming a minor injury scare earlier in the match, guiding his team to a comfortable victory in the first-ever T20 series between the two nations.</p>

While many pedestrians welcomed the safer, more pleasant atmosphere, some local councillors and residents have raised concerns about the potential for traffic congestion on smaller side streets and accessibility issues for those with mobility challenges.

Macron firmly rejected this connection, stating that while he equates anti-Zionism with antisemitism, disagreeing with the Israeli government's policies does not make him antisemitic.

Detainees also report being denied access to a law library and religious services, which are required under federal detention standards, prompting calls from advocates to shut the facility down immediately.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Argues Trump's Push to Prosecute Foes Stems from Waning Public Support</h2>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic suggests President Trump's urgency in pressuring Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute his political rivals is a reaction to his declining public support. The article posits that as economic pressures like rising grocery prices and stalled job growth mount, public tolerance for corruption diminishes, weakening Trump's hold on power. This creates a difficult calculation for officials like Bondi, who must weigh the benefits of pleasing the president against the potential legal risks if his power fades. The author argues that Trump senses this vulnerability and is attempting to consolidate power before potential losses in the 2026 elections further erode his influence and impunity.</p>

          <p>Germany's governing coalition has reduced the budget for the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development by 8%, to just under €10 billion. Development Minister Reem Alabali Radovan acknowledged the cut of approximately €910 million, stating it falls short of what is needed to address increasing global crises. Aid organizations have warned the cuts will have drastic consequences, with one NGO estimating that the halving of German emergency aid could result in over 4 million people losing food assistance. The move is part of what some see as a broader global trend of Western donor countries reducing their financial commitments to multilateral aid systems.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 1927, hundreds of swimmers participated in an organized swim in the Chicago River, marking a major milestone in the waterway's transformation from a polluted sewer to a recreational asset. The event was the culmination of decades of environmental work, spurred by the 1972 Clean Water Act, which helped restore the river's health and bring back dozens of fish species and other wildlife. Once known as "the stinking river," it is now a central part of Chicago's civic life, with riverside paths, restaurants, and booming recreational use. Organizers hope the swim becomes an annual event, symbolizing the remarkable progress in urban river revitalization.</p>

          <p>UCLA's interim football coach, Tim Skipper, is bringing in veteran assistant Kevin Coyle to join the defensive staff for the remainder of the season. The move is intended to stabilize the defense following the departure of coordinator Ikaika Malloe and a difficult 0-3 start to the season. Coyle, 69, has extensive experience as a defensive coordinator in both college football and the NFL, including a recent successful stint at Fresno State working alongside Skipper. The Bruins' defense has struggled, ranking among the worst in major college football, and the team hopes Coyle's expertise will help turn their performance around as they head into conference play.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, which pushed stocks to new record highs, some Wall Street strategists believe the market may have further room to grow. Analysts argue that the current S&P 500 is fundamentally different from historical benchmarks due to the dominance of high-growth technology and communication services companies. They suggest that productivity gains from the artificial intelligence boom and strong corporate earnings prospects justify higher valuations. However, some experts caution that easier monetary policy could fuel a speculative "melt-up" rally driven by investor fear of missing out rather than solid fundamentals, potentially leading to a sharp correction later.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to aging and well-being expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the aging process at a cellular level by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes. While telomeres naturally shrink with age, prolonged stress quickens this process, which can lead to various health problems. However, Epel emphasizes that this damage is not irreversible. She recommends simple, sustainable daily practices to manage stress and promote cellular restoration. These include eating more fruits and vegetables, incorporating short meditative breaks, increasing Omega-3 intake, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga or breathwork to create an anti-inflammatory lifestyle.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party is considering reversing its long-held opposition to national ID cards, a policy they helped scrap in 2010. Party leader Sir Ed Davey stated that "times have changed" and suggested the party should not have a "knee-jerk" reaction, especially with the Labour government reportedly planning a digital ID scheme to tackle illegal immigration. Davey pointed to Estonia's digital ID system as a model that could potentially increase citizens' freedom and access to services, but warned against any system that could be abused by an authoritarian government. The topic has sparked debate within the party, with many veteran members raising concerns over civil liberties and data security.</p>

          <p>Turkey's primary opposition party, the CHP, has re-elected Ozgur Ozel as its leader in a move designed to protect him and other senior figures from a pending court decision. A court in Ankara is expected to rule on whether to annul the results of the party's 2023 leadership congress, a case critics view as politically motivated by President Erdogan's government. By holding an extraordinary congress and re-electing Ozel, the party aims to demonstrate that he has a fresh mandate from its members. This strategy is intended to shield him and other key figures, including the jailed Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, from potential removal and further government crackdown.</p>

          <p>A child psychologist who has studied numerous parent-child relationships suggests that children with exceptional social skills often have parents who model key behaviors from an early age. These practices focus on creating an environment of emotional safety and authentic connection rather than just memorizing polite phrases. Key behaviors include talking openly about feelings, modeling empathy in daily life, fostering genuine confidence by allowing children to try and fail, and teaching them how to repair relationships after conflict. By validating their child's feelings and listening more than they lecture, parents teach the foundational skills for building strong, healthy relationships later in life.</p>
