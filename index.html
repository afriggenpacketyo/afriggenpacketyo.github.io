          <p>The White House has confirmed that the Trump administration plans to soften the impact of automotive tariffs, addressing regulatory uncertainty and costs facing the car industry. Current tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles will remain, but measures will prevent the stacking of additional levies, such as those on steel and aluminum. While additional tariffs on auto parts are expected to take effect, reimbursements will be available, phased out over three years, tied to a percentage of the value of U.S.-made cars. This adjustment aims to alleviate some of the financial burden on domestic automakers navigating the complex trade landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

While Richards believes transgender women who transition after puberty should not compete in women's sports, she criticizes the broader restrictions on transgender rights during the Trump administration's first 100 days, including halting passports with "X" gender markers and limiting access to gender-affirming care. She suggests that Trump's stance is influenced by a small group opposing transgender rights, while acknowledging the political appeal of the issue, particularly regarding sports participation.</p>

          <p>Amazon has refuted reports that it would display tariff costs alongside product prices, a move that drew criticism from the White House. The company clarified that while it considered the idea for its ultra-low-cost Amazon Haul store, it was never approved. This consideration was reportedly in response to Trump's removal of the de minimis trade loophole, not related to his 145% tariff on imports from China. The White House had labeled the reported plan a "hostile and political act," questioning why Amazon did not take similar action during the Biden administration's period of high inflation.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's first 100 days have unleashed economic disruption through tariffs and executive orders, leading to market instability and strained global trust. Despite promises of prosperity, businesses and consumers are struggling with the impact of unprecedented tariffs, particularly on China-made products, which now face a 145% tariff. Economists are increasingly concerned about a potential recession in the US and globally, while the US's reputation with allies has suffered due to protectionist policies and skepticism towards international institutions.

While GM believes it can offset a portion of the North American tariffs, it is deferring major capital spending decisions until there is more certainty.

          <p>The Vietnam War, ending 50 years ago, profoundly altered perceptions of war, particularly its long-term psychological and social consequences. The war led to the recognition of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its impact on soldiers, though this was not openly acknowledged in Vietnam due to political constraints. Overcoming trauma requires societal engagement, including rituals of remembrance, popular narratives, reconciliation, and recognition of atrocities. The article highlights the complex and asymmetrical reconciliation process in Vietnam, with limited acknowledgment of the suffering of South Vietnamese soldiers.</p>

          <p>Following a massacre in Kashmir, tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated, overshadowing the voices of the Kashmiri people. The attack, which targeted Hindu pilgrims, has reignited the long-standing conflict between the two nations, with each accusing the other of sponsoring militancy. Kashmiris, caught in the middle, have long suffered the consequences of this conflict, with limited say in their future and growing resentment over their disempowerment. The article argues for a consultation with the Kashmiri people as a step towards breaking the cycle of violence.</p>

          <p>Despite seeking to diversify its energy supply away from Russia, the EU does not import gas from Iran, which possesses the world's second-largest proven gas reserves. Sanctions, rooted in geopolitics and Iran's human rights record, prevent Iranian energy from reaching the EU. While the EU does business with other countries facing sanctions or having conflicting values, the US-led restrictions on Iran's energy sector and the risk of penalties deter European companies from engaging with Tehran.
