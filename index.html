The company raised its adjusted profit forecast for fiscal 2025, citing significant improvements in its retail pharmacy operations and its Aetna insurance division. CEO David Joyner credited the positive results to a multiyear recovery effort at Aetna and new technology enhancing pharmacy efficiency. This performance marks a positive turn under Joyner, who took over as CEO amid struggles to boost profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's final order for a 50% tariff on copper surprised markets by exempting raw materials like copper cathode, causing U.S. futures prices to plummet. However, the tariff still applies to semi-finished products such as pipes, wires, and electrical components, which are direct inputs for many consumer goods. Analysts predict that manufacturers of items like air conditioners, plumbing parts, and appliances will likely pass the increased costs on to consumers. The exemption primarily impacts raw copper traders, while manufacturers using finished copper parts will face higher expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court appeared doubtful of the legal arguments defending President Donald Trump's authority to impose broad global tariffs. The case, which the president has described as critical to his trade agenda, centers on whether he overstepped his constitutional power by using an emergency-powers law to enact the tariffs. Plaintiffs argue that the power to set tariffs belongs exclusively to Congress, a principle rooted in the U.S. Constitution. The hearing is significant as many of the administration's tariffs are scheduled to take effect imminently. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An appeals court in Dublin has dismissed MMA fighter Conor McGregor's appeal against a civil verdict that found him liable for sexually assaulting a woman in 2018. McGregor was originally ordered to pay £206,000 in damages after a jury sided with the accuser, Nikita Hand. His appeal argued that his police interviews and the wording of a jury question were improperly handled, but the three-judge panel rejected these claims. Speaking outside the court, Ms. Hand expressed that the appeal process had repeatedly retraumatized her but hoped her case would encourage other survivors to seek justice.</p>

He argued that Figma's complex graphics engine and proprietary technology are not easily replicable by AI models trained on public internet data. The design software company, which recently priced its IPO at $33 per share, is valued at $19.3 billion. Field's comments come as other tech giants like Meta are heavily investing in the pursuit of superintelligence.</p>

The company needs to provide clarity on its lagging artificial intelligence strategy, navigate trade uncertainties related to potential tariffs, and reassure Wall Street about the future of its crucial Services division. The Services unit, a key growth driver, is facing threats from legal challenges like the Justice Department's antitrust case against Google. Positive news on supply chain diversification and a reacceleration in services revenue would be critical for improving market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Comcast reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat analyst estimates, causing its stock to rise despite a net loss of 226,000 broadband customers. The company's performance was bolstered by growth in its mobile business, which added a record 378,000 lines, and strong results from its theme parks and film studio. While the broadband losses were better than feared, they reflect ongoing intense competition from fixed wireless providers. Executives expressed confidence in a new market strategy, including new pricing plans, aimed at stabilizing the crucial broadband segment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, former Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif proposes the creation of a Middle East network for peaceful nuclear research, named Menara. He argues that after decades of stalled progress on making the region a nuclear-weapon-free zone, a new approach focused on cooperation is essential for stability. The proposed body would be open to all regional states that reject nuclear weapons and would facilitate shared advancements in nuclear energy, medicine, and agriculture under mutual verification. Zarif contends this is a necessary step to move beyond mistrust and prevent a catastrophic regional conflict.</p>

          <p>Ivory Coast's President Alassane Ouattara has been nominated by his ruling party to run for a fourth term in the upcoming presidential election. The 83-year-old is able to run due to constitutional changes he implemented in 2016 that reset term limits, a move he previously justified by citing the country's security and economic challenges. The decision is highly controversial, with opposition parties viewing it as a breach of the constitution and a blow to democracy. The announcement intensifies an already tense political climate, with several key opposition leaders having been barred from the election.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly contradicted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's claims that there is no starvation in Gaza, stating that images of children show "real starvation stuff." This break comes amid growing frustration within the White House that Netanyahu is prolonging the conflict for his own political survival, defying Trump's desire for the war to end. While the disagreement marks a notable strain in their relationship, administration officials do not anticipate a significant shift in U.S. policy or any meaningful consequences for the Israeli leader. Trump continues to blame Hamas for the breakdown in ceasefire talks.</p>
