Trump has publicly criticized the institution, describing it as "OUT OF CONTROL" for focusing on negative aspects of American history like slavery. This confrontation highlights a broader conflict over cultural narratives and the independence of national institutions from political influence.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has reportedly informed confidantes that she will not seek a third term in 2026, with a formal announcement expected soon. Having served since 2015, Ernst has been a key figure in the Republican conference and a reliable supporter of President Trump's agenda. Her decision to step down and enter the private sector opens up a competitive race for her seat, adding to the list of GOP senators not running for reelection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to unilaterally cancel nearly $5 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid using a rare "pocket rescission" maneuver. This move allows the White House to withhold funds until they expire at the end of the fiscal year, effectively bypassing congressional authority. The action has drawn sharp, bipartisan criticism from Capitol Hill, with key Republicans like Senator Susan Collins calling it unlawful and a violation of Congress's constitutional power of the purse.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent President Trump from firing her, with a court hearing underway to address the matter. Trump's administration argues the president has sufficient cause based on allegations of mortgage misrepresentation, while Cook's legal team contends the move is an illegal effort to politicize the central bank. The Federal Reserve Board has taken a neutral stance but requested a prompt ruling to resolve the uncertainty surrounding its governance and independence.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of the Interior has drafted a proposal to expand its list of critical minerals, adding commodities like copper, silicon, and silver. This move is designed to guide government investment and streamline permitting to reduce reliance on foreign sources, particularly China, and prevent potential supply-chain disruptions. By officially designating these minerals as critical, the U.S. aims to encourage domestic production for key industries such as semiconductors, automotive manufacturing, and renewable energy, enhancing national and economic security.</p>

          <p>Six European nations, including Spain and Ireland, have jointly condemned Israel's expanded military offensive in Gaza City and its plans for a permanent presence there. The statement warns that the operations endanger hostages and will cause intolerable civilian deaths, while also denouncing the forced displacement of Palestinians. This comes as a UN-backed monitor confirmed a state of famine in Gaza City, intensifying international pressure on Israel to cease its operations and uphold its humanitarian obligations.</p>

          <p>Thailand's Constitutional Court has removed Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra from her position, ruling that she violated ethics rules. The case stemmed from a leaked phone call with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen, in which her comments were deemed inappropriate amid a border conflict. The ousting of Paetongtarn, daughter of former PM Thaksin Shinawatra, creates political instability, forcing the ruling Pheu Thai party to nominate a successor and navigate a fragile governing coalition to avoid potential snap elections.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed a new regulation that would end the "duration of status" policy for visas held by international students, exchange visitors, and foreign journalists. Instead of being valid for the length of their program or employment, these individuals would be granted a fixed time period, typically two to four years, and would have to apply for extensions. The administration claims the change is necessary for better oversight, but it creates significant new bureaucratic hurdles for those legally in the U.S. for education and work.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's recent firing of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Susan Monarez has sparked rare bipartisan criticism from Congress. Monarez was reportedly dismissed by Health Secretary Robert F.

Lawmakers from both parties, including Republican Senator Susan Collins, have expressed alarm over the turmoil and political interference at the nation's leading public health agency.</p>

          <p>A new analysis argues that the Trump administration's AI Action Plan will embed and automate biases within the U.S. healthcare system. The plan's push to remove "ideological dogmas" and its history of restricting data collection on marginalized communities could lead to the development of AI tools trained on incomplete or skewed data. This could perpetuate and even worsen existing health disparities, as flawed assumptions about race and gender become encoded into the clinical algorithms that will guide medical decisions for years to come.</p>

While Harris was legally entitled to six months of security after leaving office, the extension was revoked just before she is set to begin a national book tour. The move has been criticized by some as political retaliation, though White House sources claim a recent threat assessment did not warrant continuing the protection beyond the mandated period.</p>

          <p>Despite a massive surge in overseas sales, Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD reported a nearly 30% drop in its second-quarter profit compared to the previous year. The company attributed the decline to an intense price war and aggressive marketing within the highly competitive Chinese domestic market, which has negatively impacted industry-wide profitability. While international deliveries grew by almost 145%, the fierce competition at home was significant enough to erode the company's bottom line. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The median price for condominiums in the U.S. has fallen, in contrast to rising prices for single-family homes, largely due to an oversupply in the market. However, real estate experts caution that a lower sticker price doesn't necessarily make condos a bargain for prospective buyers. Rising costs for HOA dues, insurance premiums, and new reserve requirements can significantly increase the total cost of ownership, often offsetting the initial savings and making long-term affordability comparable to more expensive properties.
