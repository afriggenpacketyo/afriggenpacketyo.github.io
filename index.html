        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has urged Europe to increase its defense spending and reduce its reliance on the United States, citing the need for strategic independence and resilience against hybrid threats. Germany aims to allocate 2.4% of its GDP to defense this year, with plans to increase it to 3.5% by 2029. A recent poll indicates that nearly two-thirds of Germans support the idea of a European nuclear deterrent independent of the US, reflecting a shift in public opinion. The call for increased defense spending comes amid growing concerns about the reliability of American support for European security.</p>

          <p>Compass has filed a lawsuit against Zillow, claiming that Zillow's new rule, which bans home listings from its platform if they appear on other services for more than 24 hours, violates antitrust laws. Compass argues that this "Zillow ban" leverages Zillow's market dominance to stifle competition by preventing agents from posting homes on other platforms first. Compass's CEO stated that no company should have the power to ban listings simply because they don't follow its business model, emphasizing the importance of consumer choice. Zillow maintains that the claims are unfounded and that its policy ensures fair access to listings for all buyers. </p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iran has vowed retaliation, potentially targeting U.S. military assets in the Middle East or disrupting global oil supply routes. Potential Iranian responses could include attacks on U.S. bases in Qatar, Bahrain, and Iraq, as well as attempts to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical chokepoint for global oil shipments. Experts suggest that Iran may also resort to asymmetric warfare, including terror and cyber attacks, to retaliate against the U.S. These actions could significantly escalate tensions in the region and impact global energy markets.</p>

While larger families are slightly more common in western Germany, the overall trend reflects a demographic shift influenced by immigration patterns.

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has proposed a policy allowing non-domiciled residents to pay a £250,000 fee to avoid certain UK taxes, with the proceeds distributed to low-income workers. The party estimates this could raise £1.5bn to £2.5bn annually. Critics argue the policy could lead to a loss in tax revenue and disproportionately benefit the wealthy. The proposal comes as the Labour government plans to abolish the non-dom tax status, prompting concerns about an exodus of wealthy individuals from the UK. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has demanded that "everyone" keep oil prices down amid escalating conflict in the Middle East following U.S. strikes on Iran. He warned that high prices would play "into the hands of the enemy," and urged the Department of Energy to increase drilling. The message comes after the U.S. bombed Iran's key nuclear sites, raising concerns about potential disruptions to global energy supplies. Oil prices initially rose but later stabilized following Trump's statement.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites, more tankers are diverting course away from the Strait of Hormuz due to concerns about potential disruptions to trade. Data indicates that several vessels have altered their routes, while reports of electronic interference and GPS jamming are adding to worries. Some tanker owners are avoiding the area due to increasing insurance costs and potential risks, which could lead to a partial supply disruption. Despite these concerns, some vessels have resumed their course towards the Strait, suggesting that overall flow is being sustained for now.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, an expert suggests Iran has a "wide range of options" for retaliation, but will likely seek a "sweet spot" to avoid provoking further U.S. strikes. Possible actions include demonstrative attacks against Israel or U.S. forces, balanced to justify retaliation to the Iranian people without escalating the conflict. The expert suggests that complete capitulation is unlikely, but Iran will likely attempt to calibrate its response to minimize further American intervention.</p>
