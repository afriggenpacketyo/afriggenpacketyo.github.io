        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk has publicly opposed President Trump's tax-cut bill, arguing it will lead to "debt slavery" for America. Musk used his social media platform X to urge people to contact their senators and representatives, demanding they reject the bill. He described the budget package as a "disgusting abomination" and said it would massively increase the deficit. Musk's criticism comes after his departure from the Trump administration, where he led the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), and shortly after a meeting with Trump where the president touted the bill as his defining legislative achievement. Optimism is relatively low due to the high profile nature of this news and its potential impact on markets.</p>

          <p>The Department of Education is threatening Columbia University's accreditation, alleging the institution violated federal anti-discrimination laws, specifically Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon claims Columbia acted with indifference towards the harassment of Jewish students during protests related to the Israel-Hamas war. The department stated Columbia failed to establish effective reporting mechanisms for antisemitism and did not properly investigate or punish acts of vandalism against Jewish students. The university denies the allegations and says it is committed to combating antisemitism on campus. The optimism score is relatively low due to the negative implications for the school.</p>

          <p>Amazon has established a new group within its Lab126 research and development unit focused on agentic artificial intelligence. This team will develop an AI "framework" for robotics operations, often referred to as "physical AI", which will enable robots to understand and act on natural language commands. The goal is to transform warehouse robots into flexible assistants capable of completing complex, multi-step actions on a user's behalf. This initiative builds upon Amazon's previous AI endeavors, including a web browser-based agent and the Alexa+ update, suggesting a broader push towards integrating agentic AI across various Amazon services.

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a Republican policy bill would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt. This nonpartisan assessment is likely to intensify the debate within the Republican Party regarding the fiscal impact of President Trump's legislative agenda. The bill aims to enact Trump's policies, but the CBO's projection raises concerns about the long-term financial consequences. This estimate is likely to fuel further debate and scrutiny of the bill's provisions. The optimism score is low due to the financial implications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly developing a plan to impose time limits on federal rental assistance and introduce work requirements for recipients. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) aims to expand the number of local housing authorities that can implement such restrictions, potentially affecting millions of people. Housing policy experts express concern that these policies will not increase employment or help people move off subsidies, and advocates argue that most recipients who can work already do so. Supporters suggest time limits could spread limited rental aid among more people and encourage upward mobility, but this should include fixed rent and automatic savings accounts. The optimism score is low because of the potential negative consequences for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>A judge appointed by the Biden administration has issued an emergency order temporarily halting the deportation of the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, who is under investigation for the Boulder firebombing attack. Soliman's family had overstayed their visas, but an asylum application had been submitted on their behalf. The judge's decision came after a friend of Soliman's wife sought legal protection for the family, arguing they faced imminent deportation without the chance to present their case. The ruling has sparked political debate, with some Republicans criticizing it as a result of failed sanctuary policies and poor immigration management. The optimism score is moderate as the deportation is only temporarily halted.</p>

This change is expected to make 500,000 more pupils eligible, saving parents Â£500 a year and lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The Department for Education has allocated Â£1 billion to fund the change up to 2029. While welcomed by the education sector and organizations fighting child poverty, some argue that other measures, such as lifting the two-child limit on benefits, would be more effective.

          <p>The California Supreme Court heard arguments on whether the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) violated state law when it significantly reduced financial incentives for residential rooftop solar panels in 2022. Environmental groups argue that the CPUC failed to consider all the benefits of solar panels and did not ensure their continued expansion in disadvantaged communities. Attorneys for the state argued that the credits given to rooftop panel owners were causing a "cost shift" to those without solar panels, raising electric bills. The justices will weigh the arguments and issue a decision within 90 days. The optimism score is moderate as the future of solar incentives is uncertain.</p>

          <p>Sean Penn and Dustin Lance Black, known for their work on the Harvey Milk biopic, have condemned the decision to remove Harvey Milk's name from a US Navy ship. The order to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, christened in 2021, is part of an internal memo reportedly aimed at aligning with President Trump's objectives of reestablishing a "warrior culture". Black called the move an attempt to fuel culture wars and distract from more serious issues. The optimism score is moderate due to the controversy surrounding the renaming decision.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has proposed an innovative solution to address President Trump's efforts to weaken civil service protections. Trump has effectively neutralized the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB), the agency responsible for hearing civil servants' claims of unlawful employment actions. The court argues that if the MSPB is unable to fulfill its role, federal courts should step in and hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants. This decision aims to close a legal loophole that has left federal civil servants unprotected. The optimism score is moderate due to the uncertain outcome of potential appeals to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded Biden-era guidance that used a federal law to require hospitals to provide emergency abortions. The 2022 guidance, issued by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), stated that under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), doctors must perform abortions in emergency departments if it serves as a "stabilizing medical treatment". The Trump administration argues that the guidance "does not reflect the policy of this Administration." Abortion rights groups have criticized the move, while the administration insists that EMTALA still requires care for miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, and medical emergencies.
