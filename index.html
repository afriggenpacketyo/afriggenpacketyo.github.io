          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani declared victory after a strong first-round showing, with former Governor Andrew Cuomo conceding the race. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, capitalized on momentum gained through social media and younger voters, despite no candidate reaching the 50% threshold for an outright win. Cuomo acknowledged Mamdani's successful campaign, conceding before the ranked-choice votes were fully tabulated and suggesting a possible independent run in November. The race will proceed to a ranked-choice count, with comprehensive results expected on July 15, to determine the Democratic nominee in a city where the primary winner is heavily favored in the general election.</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old Brazilian tourist, Juliana Marins, was found dead after falling nearly 2,000 feet from Mount Rinjani, an active volcano in Indonesia. Marins was hiking with a guide and a group of other foreigners when the incident occurred, prompting a four-day search by Indonesian authorities. The search was complicated by harsh terrain and weather conditions, with a thermal drone eventually locating her body near a crater.

Renzi highlighted trade disputes and the lack of European involvement in peace talks between Ukraine and Russia as examples of the complicated relationship, urging Europe to wake up.

The neighbor, who has pleaded guilty to threatening the father with a knife, was released on bail and allegedly continued the harassment, leaving the family feeling unsafe and anxious. The housing ombudsman reports a significant increase in complaints about social landlords failing to address anti-social behavior, highlighting a systemic issue of inadequate tenant protection.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's governing doctrine centers on unpredictability, a trait that serves him well domestically but complicates international relations. His inconsistent approach to foreign policy, particularly regarding NATO and the Middle East, keeps allies and adversaries guessing, creating instability. While some argue this "madman theory" forces caution, it also undermines diplomacy and trust, as evidenced by his handling of the Israel-Iran conflict and the war in Ukraine. European leaders struggle to coordinate defense against external threats when the U.S. president is a source of instability, highlighting the challenges of relying on an unreliable ally.</p>

          <p>Richard Gerald Jordan, Mississippi’s longest-serving death row inmate, is scheduled to be executed nearly five decades after kidnapping and killing a bank loan officer’s wife in 1976. Jordan, a 79-year-old Vietnam veteran with PTSD, is one of several inmates suing the state over its three-drug execution protocol. The execution follows a rejection of his petition by the U.S. Supreme Court, with his lawyer arguing he was denied a mental health professional independent of the prosecution during his trial.</p>

          <p>A major heat wave in eastern North America has led to dozens of hospitalizations due to heat-related illnesses, with heat warnings in effect for over 160 million people.

Experts warn that high humidity levels and extended duration of the heat wave, with little nighttime relief, could aggravate the risk of heat-related illness, with several places expected to experience record highs.</p>

          <p>California leaders have reached a tentative agreement on a $321-billion state budget, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal. The deal addresses a $12-billion budget deficit through borrowing, tapping reserves, and shifting funding. The budget continues the practice of sparing state programs from immediate cuts while avoiding long-term financial problems, and includes reduced healthcare expansion to undocumented immigrants and reinstated asset limits for Medi-Cal enrollees. The agreement hinges on passing a bill that would lessen the number of building projects requiring full environmental review under CEQA.</p>

          <p>A preliminary US intelligence assessment reportedly found that US strikes on Iran's key nuclear facilities have only set back the country's nuclear program by a few months. The assessment, cited by Reuters, contradicts President Donald Trump's assertion that the strikes "fully obliterated" Iran's nuclear program. The White House dismissed the report as "flat-out wrong," while Trump described CNN's reporting of the assessment as "fake news." The damage assessment was based on the use of conventional weapons and bunker-busting bombs, believed to be the only bombs capable of destroying Iran's underground Fordo nuclear site.</p>
