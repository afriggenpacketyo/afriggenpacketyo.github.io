          <p>New research indicates that domestication is causing cats and dogs to evolve similar skull shapes due to human selection. Selective breeding for traits like flat faces has led to convergence, where distantly related species develop similar characteristics. This trend, driven by human preferences for infant-like features, can result in health problems for the animals, such as breathing difficulties and neurological conditions. The study highlights the significant impact of human intervention on animal evolution and the ethical concerns surrounding breeding for extreme physical traits.</p>

          <p>Fivespan Partners, an activist investment firm, has acquired a stake in Qiagen NV, a life sciences tools company, and is engaging with management to enhance shareholder value. Fivespan sees Qiagen as a high-quality business in a growing industry but believes it has underperformed due to a lack of focus. Fivespan suggests investing in the core business, improving margins, and optimizing the balance sheet to drive growth. Given Qiagen's strategic assets, the firm also acknowledges the potential for a strategic transaction, noting that the company previously held discussions with potential suitors.</p>

          <p>President Trump has proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) in his latest budget proposal. This move, aimed at decreasing the size of the federal government, echoes similar attempts during his first term that were ultimately thwarted by bipartisan support in Congress. The proposal has drawn strong opposition from Democrats, who view it as an attack on the arts and culture. The endowments have already faced significant cuts and changes under the Trump administration, raising concerns about the future of arts funding in the United States.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing increasing pushback from the judiciary, as several judges have ruled against the president's policies, particularly on immigration. A Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas deemed the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act "unlawful." This judicial resistance is notable, as many other institutions that previously opposed Trump have been less active during his second term. The legal process appears to be one of the few remaining checks on the president's power, operating at a different tempo than politicians or executive orders.</p>
