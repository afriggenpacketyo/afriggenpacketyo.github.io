His comments were immediately contradicted by his own FDA, major medical groups, and the drug's manufacturer, Kenvue. Health experts emphasized that acetaminophen is considered the only safe over-the-counter painkiller during pregnancy and that untreated fevers can pose significant risks to both the mother and fetus.</p>

          <p>Following chaotic federal advisory meetings influenced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a public health expert discussed the science behind childhood immunization schedules. In an interview, the expert explained that variations in vaccine schedules between countries are based on trade-offs considering disease burden, economics, and logistics, not a lack of scientific consensus. He stressed that public health officials must listen to parental concerns to build trust and counter misinformation, as underestimating disease risk is a major challenge.</p>

          <p>NASA has accelerated its timeline for the Artemis II mission, now targeting a potential launch as early as February to send four astronauts on a flight around the Moon. This would be the first crewed mission beyond low-Earth orbit in over 50 years. Officials cited that preparations, including engineering fixes to the capsule's heatshield, are ahead of schedule, while also emphasizing that mission safety remains the top priority in what is being called the "second space race" against China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American households are expected to face higher heating costs this winter, with average energy bills predicted to rise by 7.6% to around $976, according to a new study. The increase is driven by soaring electricity and natural gas prices, which continue to outpace general inflation. This follows a costly summer for air-conditioning, compounding the financial strain on consumers and leading to a significant increase in the total amount of unpaid energy bills nationwide.

          <p>After a period of strength, rent growth for single-family homes in the U.S. began to slow in July, falling below the pre-pandemic average range. This cooling trend was observed across all price tiers and in most major metropolitan areas, with some markets like Miami experiencing no annual rent growth at all. Economists suggest this loss of steam indicates that landlords are feeling pressure from a struggling consumer base and may need to adjust their pricing expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Commentators and diplomats have described President Trump's speech at the UN General Assembly as bizarre, incoherent, and a source of humiliation for the United States. The address was marked by strange tangents, false claims about his accomplishments, and attacks on U.S. allies and global institutions. Observers noted that while foreign officials laughed at his boasts in 2018, the tone has now shifted to alarm, with one senior diplomat messaging a reporter to ask if Americans were aware of the humiliation.</p>
