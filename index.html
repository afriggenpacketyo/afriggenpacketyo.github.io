The event will include a military procession in Parliament Square, a flypast featuring the Red Arrows and historic aircraft, and a concert at Horse Guards Parade. This year's VE Day is especially poignant as it may be the last major anniversary with a significant number of veterans from the war. Recycled fabrics will be used to make the bunting.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that Reed Bank, a contested area in the South China Sea rich in gas and oil, could become a future flashpoint between China and the Philippines. This is especially true if Manila proceeds with unilateral resource exploration to enhance its energy security. The bank holds substantial oil and gas reserves, but joint development efforts have stalled due to ongoing tensions.
