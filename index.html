He also discussed the merger between U.S. Steel and Japan's Nippon, stating that Nippon has committed to maintaining U.S. Steel's blast furnaces at full capacity for a minimum of ten years, with no layoffs or outsourcing.

          <p>The Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump to block his attempt to cut off its federal funding, accusing him of retaliating against the public broadcaster for perceived political slights in news coverage.

The White House has responded that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) was creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers' dime.

          <p>Stephanie Case, an ultramarathon runner and new mother, won the Ultra-Trail Snowdonia race in Northern Wales while breastfeeding her six-month-old daughter at three points along the course. Case took a three-year break from competing and was happy to be running again. She says the reaction has shown her that we still have these ideas in our head culturally about what a new mom should look like. She feels like she is eating all the time, but actually becoming a mum has made her a lot more efficient in both her training and in her fueling strategies.</p>

          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed in April, with consumer prices rising 2.1% compared to a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March. The report indicates that President Trump's tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices. Americans reduced spending on longer-lasting factory goods in April, with overall consumer spending rising 0.2% from March. The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared with their target of 2%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Donald Trump saw Elon Musk off from the White House on Friday, as the Tesla chief concluded his more than four months leading the so-called department of government efficiency. Standing alongside Trump in the Oval Office, Musk vowed that his departure “is not the end” of Doge. Trump was effusive in his praise of the world’s richest man, saying Musk “delivered a colossal change in the old ways of doing business in Washington”. The president presented Musk with a golden key to the White House to mark his service.</p>

Musk referred to articles about Trump's first presidential campaign and said that the judge just ruled against The New York Times for their lies about the Russia-gate hoax.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom's office has requested the Trump administration to remove California from its list of sanctuary jurisdictions that obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration law. Newsom's office contended that federal court rulings have rejected the argument that California law limiting law enforcement coordination with immigration authorities "unlawfully obstructs the enforcement of federal immigration laws." The state strengthened its sanctuary policies under a law signed by former Gov. Jerry Brown that took effect 2018 after Trump won office the first time. Homeland Security said jurisdictions will receive a formal notice of non-compliance with federal law and demand that cities, counties and states immediately revise their policies.</p>

PBS's lawsuit accuses the administration of unlawfully interfering in the operations of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and committing multiple violations of the First Amendment. Trump signed the executive order instructing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to "cease direct funding to NPR and PBS" on his way to Florida aboard Air Force One on May 1. The order blocks federal funding to NPR and PBS to the maximum extent allowed by law.</p>

          <p>Wall Street is recognizing a pattern in President Trump's tariff announcements, dubbed the “TACO trade” (Trump Always Chickens Out), where markets initially drop but investors profit from the subsequent rally. Trump's reaction to the expression suggests that the traders are correct. Despite the White House's tough talk about tariffs, Trump has frequently lowered or delayed them. The president may be fainthearted, but his track record shows that he can easily be dared into taking bad options by reporters just asking him about them.</p>

          <p>Canadian officials are warning of tough days ahead for fighting growing wildfires in Saskatchewan and Manitoba due to hot and dry weather. The wildfires have forced thousands to evacuate in the two central prairie provinces, with both declaring states of emergency.

Residents in northern Minnesota have been warned smoke could reach levels "unhealthy for everyone", with the rest of the state facing air quality that could effect those in sensitive groups.</p>

          <p>President Trump's attacks on judges are undermining faith in the judicial system, with threats against federal judges rising since he took office.

In April, federal agents arrested a Wisconsin judge for allegedly obstructing their apprehension of an unauthorized immigrant appearing in her courtroom. Trump has also discarded the evidence-based convictions of judges and juries scores of times, issuing clemency orders for individuals such as MAGA-backing Virginia sheriff and a former reality TV couple sentenced for tax evasion and massive bank fraud.</p>
