          <p>Following two days of tariff talks in Geneva, the White House announced a trade deal with China, although details remain unclear. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng stated that substantial progress was made, and an important consensus was reached, including establishing a consultation mechanism for trade and economic issues. Both sides emphasized the importance of equal-footed dialogue to resolve differences and avoid a trade war, with China stating its commitment to win-win outcomes. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed productive talks and promised a complete briefing on Monday, indicating a potential de-escalation in the ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to meet with airline leaders to address ongoing technological and staffing issues at Newark Liberty International Airport, which have caused significant delays and cancellations. Duffy acknowledged that the country hasn't adequately invested in modernizing airport systems, leading to the current problems. While affirming the safety of flying out of Newark, he warned that similar disruptions could occur at other U.S. airports if improvements aren't made. The F.A.A. has attributed the issues to equipment failures and staff shortages, and Duffy's proposal to improve air travel includes digitizing flight data management tools and upgrading radio systems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A head-to-head clinical trial revealed that Eli Lilly's Zepbound resulted in significantly more weight loss than Novo Nordisk's Wegovy among overweight or obese participants. The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found that Zepbound users lost nearly 50% more weight on average over 72 weeks. While both drugs improve health markers and have similar side effects, Zepbound's dual hormone targeting may explain its greater efficacy. Access and affordability remain challenges, as CVS Health recently favored Wegovy on its standard formulary, highlighting the importance of having multiple treatment options for obesity.</p>

          <p>CVS Caremark's decision to exclude Zepbound from its formulary in favor of Wegovy has sparked concerns among patients who have found Zepbound more effective for weight loss. This decision, driven by efforts to lower drug prices, will force many to switch medications despite research indicating Zepbound's superiority in weight loss. While CVS Caremark claims the move will reduce costs for employers, patients and doctors express frustration over the limited ability to tailor obesity drug prescriptions. The New York Times article highlights the increasing trend of benefit managers restricting drug coverage, disrupting treatments and upsetting patients.</p>

          <p>The first group of White South Africans, granted refugee status by the U.S., departed from Johannesburg, highlighting a controversial initiative by the Trump administration. This move, contrasting with the administration's restrictions on other refugees, claims to address government-sponsored race-based discrimination against Afrikaners. The South African government disputes these claims, viewing the resettlement as politically motivated and questioning South Africa's democracy. Despite the controversy, the U.S. State Department maintains its prioritization of resettlement for Afrikaners facing racial discrimination, while relations between South Africa and the U.S. have deteriorated over various policy issues.</p>

'A Minecraft Movie' followed in third place, contributing to a year-to-date box office increase of approximately 16% compared to last year, although still down over 32% compared to 2019.

          <p>President Trump urged Ukraine to engage in direct talks with Russia, as proposed by President Putin, without insisting on a cease-fire first. This stance contrasts with the European leaders' plan for a 30-day cease-fire deadline, after which Russia would face additional sanctions. President Zelensky responded cautiously, reiterating the need for a halt in fighting but expressing willingness to personally attend negotiations in Turkey. The flurry of diplomatic exchanges underscores the complex efforts to end the war, with the Trump administration aligning with Russia on some issues while leaving existing sanctions in place.</p>

The piece emphasizes the importance of considering the agency and interests of third parties, including countries, multinational organizations, and corporations not fully aligned with either Beijing or Washington.

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reported that the U.S. and China have made "substantial progress" in de-escalating the trade war following high-level talks in Geneva. While details are scarce, Bessent said an announcement would be made on Monday, and President Trump praised the talks for engendering a "total reset" in the relationship. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng also lauded the "important progress," and WTO Inspector General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala called the talks "a significant step forward." The meetings, held after Trump levied steep tariffs against China, aim to ease tensions and restore predictability to the multilateral trading system.</p>

          <p>California, despite being the fourth-largest economy globally, is facing a confluence of economic, political, social, and environmental challenges that are testing its resilience. The state is grappling with potential population decline due to wildfires and immigration policies, a $1 billion budget shortfall in Los Angeles, and a homelessness epidemic. The state's relationship with the Trump administration has become more antagonistic, making it harder to secure federal assistance. While some leaders remain optimistic, others acknowledge the difficult times ahead, marked by budget deficits, higher taxes, and climate change.</p>

          <p>A U.S.-funded charter plane transported white South Africans, claiming discrimination, to the United States as refugees, marking a remarkable shift in President Trump’s foreign policy. This move contrasts with the administration's halting of virtually all other refugee admissions, raising criticism from aid groups and the South African government. While some Afrikaner activists prefer support to build a better life at home, others cite violent attacks and job discrimination as reasons for seeking refuge. The initiative has deepened tensions between South Africa and the United States, with the Trump administration criticizing South Africa's policies and relationships.</p>

Alexander, captured during the October 7 attack, is believed to be the last living captive with U.S. nationality in Gaza.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is preparing to accept a luxury jet from the royal family of Qatar, which he will use as Air Force One, raising questions about the legality of the move. The lavish gift is likely to raise questions from legal scholars and experts surrounding the legality of the move. The administration will retrofit the plane so it can be used in Trump's official capacity as president. The plane, a Boeing 747-8 jet, is set to be transferred to Trump's presidential library foundation at the conclusion of his second White House term, two sources confirmed to NBC.</p>

          <p>One of the defining Los Angeles rock bands of the last quarter-century, Rilo Kiley formed in 1998 — both Lewis and the group’s other singer and songwriter, Blake Sennett, had been child actors — then spent the next decade steadily approaching the big time with clever if jaundiced songs about sex, bad decisions and the Hollywood dream machine. Yet just as the band was poised to blow up, Rilo Kiley split amid creative and personal tensions between Lewis and Sennett, who’d also been romantically involved. Now, for the first time since 2008, the group — rounded out by Pierre De Reeder and Jason Boesel — is on the road playing shows again; its reunion tour launched last week with gigs in San Luis Obispo and Ojai and is scheduled to run through the fall.</p>

Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital viewed the news as slightly better than expected but awaited more details before making investment decisions.
