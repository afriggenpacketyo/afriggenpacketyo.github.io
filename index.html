          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the first at-home cervical cancer screening tool, offering women an accessible alternative to Pap smears. The test, made by Teal Health, involves a vaginal swab to detect HPV, the cause of almost all cervical cancer cases. Studies show the at-home test is about as accurate as Pap smears and can help women who have trouble accessing in-person appointments. Teal Health plans to launch the test in California next month before expanding to other states, working with insurers to secure coverage.</p>
