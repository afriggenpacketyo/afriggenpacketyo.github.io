          <p>A trade policy expert from the Brookings Institution suggests that unpredictable trade policies in the United States may lead other countries to seek stronger ties with China as a safeguard against instability. Joshua Meltzer highlighted that many countries are signaling engagement with China to create alternative options, reducing their reliance on the U.S. President Donald Trump's administration's policies. The extent of this trend hinges on whether the Trump administration can stabilize its trade policies in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The landmark antitrust case against Microsoft in the late 1990s continues to cast a long shadow over the current antitrust trial involving Google. The earlier case, which accused Microsoft of monopolizing the PC market, established legal precedent that the Justice Department is using as a model in its complaint against Google. The government claims that Google is following the Microsoft playbook in its monopolistic practices, specifically in the search engine market. The outcome of the Microsoft case, which resulted in a settlement rather than a breakup, is being examined to determine potential penalties for Google.</p>

Tariffs on imported pipes and equipment are increasing the cost of doing business, creating uncertainty and volatility in the oil patch. While there's hope that new gas pipelines could boost the industry, executives fear that Trump's policies could trigger a recession, driving down oil prices and discouraging new drilling.
