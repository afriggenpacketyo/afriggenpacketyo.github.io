          <p>George Simion, a right-wing nationalist candidate skeptical of EU support for Ukraine, secured a significant lead in the first round of the Romanian presidential election. Simion, who admires Donald Trump, will face the liberal mayor of Bucharest in a runoff election. His victory is causing unease in European capitals, Washington, Kyiv, and Moscow, given Romania's strategic importance in supplying Ukraine and hosting NATO assets. Simion has expressed skepticism about continued financial support for Ukrainian refugees, though he denies being pro-Russian, and the Trump administration is reassessing its commitment to Romania. </p>

          <p>Two Chinese scientists assert that "Shi’s Star Catalogue," an astronomical list of celestial bodies, is the world’s oldest star log, dating back approximately 2,400 years to around 335BC. Researchers used image processing technology to convert ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, confirming the observations' approximate age. If verified, this would predate the Hipparchus star catalogue from Greece, previously considered the oldest. Experts believe detailed astronomical studies began in both China and Greece around the same period. </p>

          <p>The Australian government has pledged to defend its film industry following Donald Trump's threat to impose 100% tariffs on film productions made outside the US. Trump cited the need to revitalize the American movie industry and labeled foreign film incentives a national security threat. Australia, known as "Hollywood Down Under," offers a 30% rebate for big-budget film projects, making it a popular location for international productions. The proposed tariffs could significantly impact the global film industry and potentially affect the export of Australian content to the US market. </p>

          <h2>Study Suggests First Roses Were Likely Yellow</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis by Chinese and Dutch researchers suggests that the first roses were likely yellow, despite the common association of roses with the color red. The study, published in Nature Plants, examined domesticated and wild rose samples to trace the flower's origins. The research team concluded that the common ancestor of roses most likely had single-petal flowers with yellow color and seven leaflets. Roses are known as the 'queen of flowers' and a symbol of love and beauty. </p>

          <p>Eighty years after the Battle of Berlin, which marked the end of Nazi Germany, the city still bears visible scars from the intense fighting. While central Berlin has been transformed through restoration and modern architecture, bullet-riddled facades and gaps in rows of houses serve as reminders of the past. The battle in late April and early May 1945 reduced much of the city to rubble. Despite the destruction, the city quickly rebuilt its infrastructure, eventually becoming the capital of a reunited, democratic Germany. </p>

The event was sponsored by Baroness Brown of Silvertown, who said she had no memory of the event and did not believe she had met or spoken to the individuals.

          <p>Japan is projected to be the fourth-largest provider of official development assistance (ODA) among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third place. The United States remains the top ODA donor, followed by Germany. Japan's decline in donations is attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to sharp increases in previous years. Japan views ODA as an important diplomatic tool in the Indo-Pacific region. Overall ODA by Development Assistance Committee members fell 7.1 percent in real terms, marking the first decline after five consecutive years of growth. </p>
