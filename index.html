          <p>Following a deadly mass shooting in a Manhattan office building, New York City mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani is facing renewed criticism for his previous support of the "defund the police" movement. Past social media posts from 2020 where he called for defunding and dismantling the NYPD have resurfaced, contrasting with his more recent campaign statements supporting the police's role in public safety. The scrutiny highlights the political sensitivity of policing issues in the mayoral race, especially in the immediate aftermath of a high-profile violent crime. Mamdani's campaign has not yet responded to the renewed focus on his past remarks.</p>

          <p>Ryne Sandberg, the iconic Chicago Cubs second baseman and a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame, has passed away at the age of 65 after a battle with prostate cancer. Remembered for his exceptional skill and competitive spirit, Sandberg was a 10-time All-Star, nine-time Gold Glove winner, and the 1984 National League MVP. His career, almost entirely with the Cubs, left a lasting legacy, culminating in the unveiling of his statue outside Wrigley Field. The baseball community is mourning the loss of a player celebrated for his integrity and dedication to the game.</p>

          <p>A gunman opened fire in a Park Avenue office building in Manhattan, killing four people, including a police officer, before taking his own life with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The shooter was identified as a 27-year-old from Las Vegas, and the motive remains under investigation by authorities. The incident, which prompted a lockdown and a major police response, marks the 254th mass shooting in the United States this year, according to the Gun Violence Archive.

          <p>Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te will not make a stopover in the United States on his way to South America, a decision that could create a diplomatic opening for a potential meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump later this year. While the official reason cited was the need to focus on domestic typhoon recovery efforts, the move is seen as a de-escalation amidst sensitive US-China relations. Beijing typically opposes any official contact between the U.S. and Taiwanese leaders, viewing it as a challenge to its sovereignty claims over the island.</p>

The memo from the Office of Personnel Management states that workers can engage in polite religious discussions and display religious items, provided they cease if asked and the expression does not constitute harassment. This policy, which builds on previous guidance, is part of a broader push for religious expression but has drawn criticism from groups like the Freedom From Religion Foundation, who argue it unconstitutionally encourages proselytizing in the workplace.</p>

          <p>A Delta Air Lines co-pilot was arrested in the cockpit of his plane shortly after landing at San Francisco International Airport on suspicion of committing sexual crimes against a minor. Law enforcement and federal agents boarded the flight from Minneapolis and apprehended 34-year-old Rustom Bhagwagar in front of passengers. The arrest followed a months-long investigation by the Contra Costa County sheriff's office. Bhagwagar was booked on five counts of oral copulation with a child under 10, with bail set at $5 million, while Delta stated it has zero tolerance for such alleged conduct.</p>

Would-be campers can now enter a free drawing for a chance to book a spot months in advance.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, the stock market's muted reaction to President Trump's new trade deal with the European Union is due to investors being preoccupied with more immediate concerns. He argues that Wall Street is currently focused on this week's major tech earnings reports, the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, and key employment data, which overshadow the trade news. Furthermore, Cramer suggests investors may have "tariff ennui," having seen similar negotiations play out before, and are waiting for resolutions with other major partners like China before reacting strongly to trade developments.

          <p>A federal appellate court is scrutinizing the legality of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, including the use of "roving patrols" to detain individuals in Southern California. Judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals intensely questioned a Justice Department lawyer about whether these sweeps, which a lower court blocked, violate the 4th Amendment's protection against unreasonable seizures. The case centers on whether agents are unconstitutionally using factors like race and location as a pretext for enforcement, setting the stage for a potential Supreme Court showdown over the limits of federal immigration authority.</p>

          <p>A garment factory in Lesotho, which has manufactured Trump-branded golf shirts, faces potential closure due to high import tariffs imposed by the U.S. government. The southern African nation, known for producing denim and apparel for major American brands, was hit with a 50% tariff rate, which threatens the viability of its largest private sector employer. Workers express deep concern over their livelihoods, as the factory has already reduced work schedules and pay.

The district joins others like Beaverton in adopting this model, which aims to provide clearer feedback on what students are expected to learn and how they can improve their comprehension of the material, shifting the focus from grades to learning.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic argues that President Trump's policy decisions and public statements are overwhelmingly influenced by what he sees on television, rather than intelligence briefings or expert advice. His recent comments on starvation in Gaza, which he based on TV images, serve as a prime example of this tendency. This reliance on a narrow, visual medium makes him susceptible to manipulation and misinformation, while also attuning him to public sentiment in a way that has fueled his political success. The dynamic creates a concerning feedback loop, especially as his administration seeks greater control over broadcast media.</p>
