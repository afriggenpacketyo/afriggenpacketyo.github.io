          <p>Despite the government's reliance on Elon Musk's companies like SpaceX for critical services, former President Trump is exploring avenues to exert pressure on the tech entrepreneur. The president could potentially increase federal oversight of Musk's businesses, even if terminating contracts proves impractical due to the Pentagon and NASA's dependence on them. This stems from growing tensions between Trump and Musk, particularly regarding Musk's stance on certain policy issues. The situation highlights the complex relationship between the government and private sector tech giants, especially when political disagreements arise.

          <p>A man in southern England discovered that he was swapped at birth in a hospital nearly 80 years ago after his family joked that he looked nothing like his parents. During the pandemic, he used a home DNA test to uncover the truth, which was later confirmed by his father's DNA sample. The article highlights that this type of incident was more common before the NHS in 1948 when babies were cared for in nurseries without individual identification. This revelation came too late for his father, who passed away before learning the truth about his family history. Optimism score is 40</p>

          <p>Global spirit makers are encountering a mix of challenges, including tariffs and shifts in consumer drinking habits, leading to revised sales targets. Remy Cointreau recently withdrew its sales targets due to economic and trade uncertainties, particularly related to U.S.-China tariff policies. The cognac business has been significantly affected by ongoing U.S.-Sino tensions, with other spirit makers like LVMH also experiencing sales declines. These factors are weakening demand for spirits, creating a complex and uncertain market environment. Optimism score is 40</p>

          <p>Elon Musk publicly mused about creating a new political party, potentially escalating his feud with former ally President Trump. Musk posted a poll on X asking his followers if it's time to create a new political party that represents the 80% in the middle. He endorsed a fan's suggestion to name it the "America Party," reminiscent of his America PAC. While starting a new party is challenging, Musk's engagement could signal his intent to challenge Trump's influence. Optimism score is 50</p>
          <p>50/100</p>
