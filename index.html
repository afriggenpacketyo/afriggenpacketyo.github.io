            <h2>Trump Administration Grants Tariff Exemptions for Tech Products</h2>

            <p>President Trump has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices from tariffs, providing relief to US tech companies concerned about rising costs. The decision, backdated to April 5th, also includes semiconductors, solar cells, and memory cards. This move is seen as a win for tech investors, potentially preventing a tripling of iPhone prices and allowing companies more time to move production to the US. The White House indicated that these exemptions aim to encourage companies to onshore their manufacturing, reducing reliance on China, though the tariffs on fentanyl-related goods remain.

            <p>A co-worker of Rex Heuermann, the accused Gilgo Beach serial killer, recounted how he unnerved her by tracking her down on a cruise, stating, "I told you I could find you anywhere."

Heuermann is charged with the murders of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Costello and is the prime suspect in the death of Maureen Brainard-Barnes. The case highlights the devastating impact on the victims' families and the long journey to finding a suspect.</p>

            <p>Iran and the U.S. will hold further negotiations next week regarding Iran's nuclear program, following initial talks in Oman, marking the first such interaction since Trump's return to the White House.

Trump indicated the talks were "going okay" but offered no specifics. Key issues include sanctions relief for Iran and restrictions on uranium enrichment, with the U.S. seeking dismantlement of Iran's program and preventing weaponization.</p>

            <p>The UK government has taken control of British Steel's Scunthorpe plant to prevent its imminent closure, passing emergency legislation to ensure continued operation of its blast furnaces. The plant, owned by Chinese firm Jingye, employs 2,700 people and is the UK's last producer of virgin steel. The government intervened after Jingye claimed the plant was losing £700,000 a day and sought excessive funds to keep it running. The government aims to secure private investment, but public ownership remains a likely option, ensuring the UK maintains its steel production capabilities.</p>

            <p>Big tech has gained a major exemption from Donald Trump’s trade war after the US president exempted smartphones, computers and other electronics from the 125% levies imposed on imports from China as well as tariffs imposed on other countries. Experts had previously warned tariffs would cause electronic consumer prices to spike in the US, with Apple reportedly chartering cargo flights to bring in 600 tons of iPhones from India rather than China amid the cratering trade ties between the two countries. The move will benefit many countries in South-east Asia, for whom tech exports are a key part of their US trade.</p>
