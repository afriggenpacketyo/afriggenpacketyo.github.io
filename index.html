            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly shared details about impending U.S. airstrikes in Yemen with a private Signal group, including his wife and brother. The messages included flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets tasked with striking Houthi targets. This incident follows a previous report where Hegseth inadvertently included The Atlantic's editor-in-chief in a similar Signal chat, raising concerns about the handling of sensitive military information. A Defense Department spokesperson claimed no classified information was shared, but the incidents have drawn scrutiny. </p>

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for China's Xiamen Airlines was returned to Boeing's U.S. production hub due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The jet, painted with Xiamen livery, was waiting at Boeing's Zhoushan completion center for final work. Increased tariffs on Chinese imports by the U.S. and retaliatory tariffs by China have made the delivery economically unviable. Confusion over changing tariffs could leave many aircraft deliveries in limbo, with some airline CEOs saying they would defer delivery of planes rather than pay duties.</p>

Experts are concerned about a widening gap between those eligible for funded hours and those missing out.

Private nurseries are facing increased operating costs, and some are threatening to pull out of the scheme altogether.

            <p>Men tend to visit doctors less frequently than women, often delaying medical attention until symptoms become severe. This reluctance is linked to societal expectations of masculinity, which emphasize self-reliance and discourage vulnerability. Concerns about appearing weak and appointment systems that don't accommodate work schedules also contribute. Encouraging men to seek preventative care and providing accessible, tailored healthcare services are essential for improving men's health outcomes.</p>

            <p>India's roads are among the world's deadliest, with over 172,000 fatalities in 2023, averaging one death every three minutes. Over-speeding, lack of safety precautions, overloading, and driving without a valid license are major causes. The chaotic traffic mix and poor road design exacerbate the problem. Experts attribute this crisis to infrastructure issues, human behavior, enforcement gaps, and systemic neglect. Road crashes cost India 3% of its annual GDP.</p>
