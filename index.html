          <p>Authorities in Boulder, Colorado, have charged Mohamed Sabry Soliman with multiple felonies, including attempted first-degree murder and a federal hate crime, after he allegedly threw Molotov cocktails at a group rallying for Israeli hostages. The attack injured 12 people, and the FBI is investigating it as a targeted act of terrorism. Witnesses reported that Soliman yelled "Free Palestine!" during the attack and had 16 unused Molotov cocktails within reach at the time of his arrest. Soliman, an Egyptian national, reportedly told investigators he wanted to kill all Zionist people and had been planning the attack for a year after researching how to make Molotov cocktails on YouTube.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Joss, known for voicing John Redcorn on 'King of the Hill' and playing Chief Ken Hotate in 'Parks and Recreation,' was shot dead in Texas. His husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, described the incident as a homophobic hate crime, stating that a man yelled violent homophobic slurs before opening fire. Police, however, have stated that the investigation has found no evidence to indicate that the murder was related to Joss's sexual orientation. Gonzales recounted finding the skull of one of their dogs at the site of their former home, which was previously destroyed in a fire after threats, leading to the confrontation and shooting where Joss pushed Gonzales out of the way, saving his life.</p>

          <p>Thames Water's future is in doubt after KKR, a US private equity firm, withdrew from plans to invest Â£4 billion into the UK's largest water company. This setback increases the possibility of the company entering government-supervised administration. The company, serving about a quarter of the UK's population, faces debts of approximately Â£19 billion. An independent review highlighted that the current regulatory system is "chaotic" and needs reform, emphasizing the need for long-term investors in the sector.</p>

          <p>Two people from Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm, Upper Bavaria, have been infected with the rare Bornavirus, resulting in one death, according to regional authorities. The local health department is investigating the possible mode of infection, which is often spread by the bicolored shrew. The virus is present in bicolored shrews in many parts of Bavaria, and humans can become infected through contact with the excrement, urine, or saliva of infected animals. Since March 2020, up to seven cases of infection have been reported in Germany, with a total of 55 infections registered across the country.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the water sector in England and Wales has concluded that it is failing and requires stronger regulation to protect billpayers and the environment. The Water Commission, led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, cited shaken public trust due to pollution, financial difficulties, mismanagement, and infrastructure failures. The review emphasized the need for clearer government direction, better long-term investment, and a stronger voice for local communities. The government has ruled out nationalizing the sector, arguing it would be too expensive and not necessarily lead to improvements.</p>

Allergy charities emphasize the need for TikTok to ensure sellers meet safety and labeling standards, as failing to provide ingredient information is potentially dangerous.

          <p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) projects that US economic growth will slow to 1.6% this year, down from 2.8% last year, due to President Donald Trump's trade wars disrupting global commerce. The OECD also forecasts a further slowdown to 1.5% in 2026. Trump's policies have significantly raised US tariff rates, increasing costs for consumers and manufacturers. The world economic growth is also expected to slow to 2.9% this year and remain at that level in 2026.</p>

          <p>Many popular holiday destinations are struggling with the environmental impact of large visitor numbers, a phenomenon known as overtourism. This issue is exacerbated by factors such as increased air travel, the popularity of short trips, and the influence of film locations. Overtourism strains infrastructure, threatens water resources, and contributes to climate change through increased emissions. Some cities and regions are implementing measures such as limiting visitor numbers, imposing taxes, and promoting attractions outside city centers to manage visitor flows.</p>

          <p>Red Bull made two key mistakes during the Spanish Grand Prix, according to a post-race analysis. The first mistake was ordering Max Verstappen to give back his position to George Russell after an incident at Turn One, a decision based on recent penalty precedents. The stewards later ruled that no further action was needed, suggesting Verstappen could have justifiably kept the place. The second error was pitting Verstappen for fresh hard tires under the safety car, a decision that Verstappen immediately questioned and that Red Bull later admitted was incorrect.</p>

          <p>The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has sharply cut its economic growth forecast for the U.S., citing President Donald Trump's tariff policies as a major factor. The U.S. growth outlook was revised down to just 1.6% this year and 1.5% in 2026. The OECD attributed the downgrade to fallout from Trump's tariff policy, elevated economic policy uncertainty, a slowdown of net immigration, and a smaller federal workforce.
