        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has formalized a wide range of new tariffs on global trading partners, with rates varying from 10% to over 40%. An executive order detailed the updated duties for dozens of countries, including a significant 40% tariff on goods deemed to be transshipped to evade duties. While President Trump had set a firm August 1 deadline, the order grants a seven-day delay for most countries, allowing more time for implementation and last-minute negotiations. Experts note the move creates continued uncertainty for global trade, even as some deals with partners like the EU and Japan are confirmed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several Asian countries have responded to the newly announced U.S. tariff schedule, with some expressing relief at lower-than-expected rates. Cambodia's prime minister welcomed its revised 19% duty, a significant reduction from a previously threatened 49%, as beneficial for its economy. Similarly, Thailand's finance minister noted its 19% tariff reflects a close partnership with the U.S. and helps maintain competitiveness. Meanwhile, Taiwan's president confirmed a 20% temporary tariff, which is lower than the initial proposal, and indicated that ongoing negotiations could lead to further reductions in the future.

          <p>A 42-year-old woman, Jeny Morenoparra, was arrested for allegedly attempting to smuggle fentanyl into a Los Angeles juvenile hall while visiting her child. Authorities state that a probation officer discovered her in possession of over 30 pills containing the dangerous opioid. The L.A. County District Attorney's office reopened the case after her initial release, emphasizing the severe threat posed by fentanyl. The incident highlights ongoing safety concerns at the facility, which was recently deemed "unsuitable" for youth by a state board due to issues like inadequate staff training and improper confinement of minors.</p>

Lohan expressed her excitement about returning to a role beloved by fans and noted that becoming a mother herself has given her a new perspective on the film's themes. Curtis, who initiated the sequel, emphasized the importance of the movie's message of understanding and empathy in the current global climate.</p>

          <p>An office cleaner at a Midtown Manhattan high-rise has shared her harrowing experience of coming face-to-face with the gunman who killed four people on Monday. Sebije Nelovic, 65, was working on the 33rd floor when she heard gunshots and saw the suspect, Shane Devon Tamura, enter through a shattered glass door and point an AR-15-style rifle at her. She identified herself as a cleaner and managed to run and hide in a closet, where she prayed for hours until the ordeal ended. The shooting is believed to have been an attempt to target the NFL headquarters, located in the same building.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has acknowledged that an air traffic controller failed to properly warn a commercial airliner about an Army helicopter in its path before a fatal collision in Washington, D.C. The crash, which occurred in January, resulted in 67 deaths. During a National Transportation Safety Board hearing, an FAA official confirmed the controller should have notified the PSA jet's crew of the helicopter's position and the risk of their paths merging. Testimony revealed the controller was managing 21 aircraft in the 10 minutes before the crash, highlighting concerns about high traffic volume and staffing shortages at the airport.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein who died earlier this year, stated she wanted related investigative documents to be made public. In an interview, her siblings said Giuffre fought for transparency and justice for Epstein's victims until the very end. The family also expressed shock at President Trump's recent comment that Epstein had "stolen" Giuffre from his Mar-a-Lago club, clarifying she was a person recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell, not an object. They urged the president not to consider a pardon for Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking.</p>

The move comes after universities warned of significant funding pressures due to high inflation and a decline in international student enrollment. Critics, however, point to recent changes in loan repayment rules that will likely result in students paying back more over a longer period. (not investment advice)</p>

Rather than trading key players for future prospects, the Angels acquired two veteran relief pitchers and an infielder.

The proposal would raise half the money from shareholders of the state's major utilities and the other half from their customers.

          <p>Researchers have published a study suggesting that the modern potato's ancestor is, unexpectedly, the tomato. According to findings in the journal Cell, the potato evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago through a hybridization event. The study explains that an ancient tomato provided a crucial gene that signals the plant to form tubers, while another species contributed a gene that controls their growth. By analyzing hundreds of genomes from both cultivated and wild potatoes, scientists believe they have finally solved the long-standing puzzle of the starchy vegetable's origins, demonstrating how inter-species breeding can create new traits.</p>

          <p>In the first federal jury trial of its kind, plaintiffs are seeking approximately $345 million in damages from Tesla over a fatal 2019 crash involving its Autopilot system. The lawsuit centers on a collision in Florida where a driver, believing the system would brake automatically, crashed into a parked car, killing one person and severely injuring another. The plaintiffs argue that Tesla knowingly marketed a defective system and overstated its capabilities, encouraging dangerous reliance. Tesla's defense counters that the driver was at fault and that the company provides clear instructions on how to use the feature safely.</p>

          <p>Two senior U.S. officials, special envoy Steve Witkoff and ambassador Mike Huckabee, are making a highly unusual visit to a food distribution site in Gaza. The visit comes amid growing international concern and warnings from aid workers of a "politically manmade famine" in the territory. President Trump has expressed frustration that aid is not reaching Palestinians, blaming Hamas for intercepting supplies. The visit signals heightened U.S. attention to the humanitarian catastrophe, as international partners like Germany and Sweden increase their criticism of Israel's actions and the dire conditions faced by civilians in Gaza.</p>

While the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud unit saw revenue growth, it was not as substantial as rivals, and its profit margins declined. Furthermore, the company's guidance for third-quarter operating income fell short of Wall Street's expectations. Despite strong performance in its e-commerce and advertising businesses, the mixed signals from its high-margin cloud division and a cautious outlook tempered investor enthusiasm for the tech giant's performance.

          <p>Experts are raising concerns about the increasing use of caffeine pouches among teenagers, a trend popular in the U.S. that may be spreading. These small, teabag-like pouches are placed in the mouth for a quick caffeine hit, with some containing the equivalent of two cups of coffee. Promoted on social media for boosting energy for studying or workouts, their discreet nature makes them easy to hide from parents and teachers. Health professionals warn that young people have lower caffeine tolerance and could easily consume dangerous amounts, leading to side effects like rapid heart rate, anxiety, and seizures.</p>

          <p>Health officials are monitoring a significant surge of Chikungunya fever in China, with over 5,000 cases reported since last month, primarily in the southern Guangdong province. The U.S. CDC is now considering a travel notice for the country due to the outbreak. Chikungunya is a virus transmitted by infected mosquitoes, and its most common symptoms are fever and severe joint pain, though it can also cause headaches, muscle pain, and rashes. While rarely fatal, the symptoms can be debilitating, and there is currently no specific vaccine or treatment for the virus, with care focused on relieving symptoms.</p>

          <p>Guangzhou and Shenzhen, two major cities that have long been economic engines for southern China, are reporting GDP underperformance compared to their peers. This simultaneous slowdown is attributed to a combination of weakening global demand for exports and insufficient domestic demand to compensate for the shortfall. Analysts point to specific headwinds in Shenzhen, including a downturn in the local property market that has dragged down investment. The sluggish performance in these key economic hubs has prompted calls for stronger government action to revive business activity and investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Social media companies like X and Reddit are broadly restricting content, including posts about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, in an effort to comply with the UK's new Online Safety Act. The law, which fines companies for failing to protect minors from harmful material, has led to platforms placing content behind age-verification walls. Experts and critics warn this approach risks stifling legitimate public debate, as it has restricted access to clips of parliamentary debates on topics like sexual assault and even historical artwork. The over-application of the rules highlights the challenge platforms face in balancing child protection with freedom of speech.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new policy to make its main civil service internship scheme exclusively available to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The change, effective in 2026, aims to increase the number of working-class young people in Whitehall to ensure it better reflects the country it serves. Eligibility will be determined by parental occupation when the student was 14. Successful interns will also be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program, creating a new pathway for underrepresented talent into senior government roles and addressing concerns that the civil service is too privileged.</p>

The proposal would require legislative approval to place the new maps on a statewide ballot. If approved by voters, the new districts would be in effect until 2030, after which California would return to its current independent redistricting commission system.</p>

The team acquired veteran relief pitcher Brock Stewart and outfielder Alex Call, addressing needs in the bullpen and outfield without giving up significant prospect capital. The front office expressed strong faith in its current roster, believing the team is talented enough for a deep postseason run once key players return from injury and others return to form. This conservative strategy contrasts with aggressive moves made by rivals like the San Diego Padres and New York Mets.</p>
