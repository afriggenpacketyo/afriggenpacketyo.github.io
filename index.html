          <h2>Federal Student Loan Borrowing Limits and Options Explained</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 13:03:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With average annual college costs exceeding $38,000, many students rely on federal loans, which offer borrower protections but have strict limits. The article details these annual and lifetime borrowing caps, which vary by dependency status and academic level, often leaving a significant funding gap. For instance, dependent undergraduates are limited to $5,500 in their first year. When federal aid is insufficient, private student loans can be an alternative, though they typically require credit checks and may have less flexible repayment terms. (not investment advice)</p>

However, it will differentiate itself by focusing on generating yield through staking, a process that contributes to the Ethereum network's operations and produces returns, which current ether ETFs do not offer.

          <p>The Texas Legislature is holding a special session to redraw the state's congressional districts, a move pushed by President Trump to increase the Republican majority in the U.S. House. This mid-decade redistricting is unusual, as the current maps were only established after the 2020 Census. Critics argue the effort is purely political and legally risky, as it could undermine the voting power of communities of color and potentially backfire on Republicans in future elections due to Texas's changing demographics.</p>

          <p>An inquest has revealed that a mother, Alphonsine Djiako Leuga, and her disabled 18-year-old daughter, Loraine Choulla, were found dead in their Nottingham home months after Alphonsine made a 999 call. During the call, she reported feeling cold and unable to move, but an ambulance was never dispatched due to an error by the call handler. The East Midlands Ambulance Service has apologized for the "missed opportunity." The inquest is investigating the circumstances of their deaths, including the possibility that Loraine died from malnutrition or dehydration after her mother passed away.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-made F-7 BJI training aircraft of the Bangladesh Air Force crashed into a school campus in Dhaka, killing at least 19 people and injuring over 100. The plane crashed shortly after takeoff while students were in class at the Milestone School and College, marking the country's deadliest aviation accident in over four decades. The cause of the crash is currently unknown, and the government has launched an investigation. Emergency services responded to a large fire at the scene, where the plane appeared to have struck a building.</p>

          <p>A Montreal man, Luciano Frattolin, has been charged with the second-degree murder of his 9-year-old daughter, Melina, during a vacation in upstate New York. Authorities allege that Frattolin killed his daughter and concealed her body in a pond near Ticonderoga before fabricating a story that she had been kidnapped. The false report triggered a massive search and an Amber Alert. Police grew suspicious after finding inconsistencies in his account and arrested him. The motive for the horrific crime remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>This article shares two uplifting stories of individuals making a difference through personal challenges. One man, Brian Flynn, became a rare double living organ donor, donating a kidney to a stranger and later part of his liver to a 4-year-old boy, saving both their lives. The other story features Rachel Bee, a teenager diagnosed with Crohn's disease, who used her experience in infusion centers to invent "Infusion Hero," a sweatshirt with zippered sleeves to keep patients warm and comfortable during IV treatments. Both individuals have found profound meaning and purpose in helping others.</p>

          <p>UK media regulator Ofcom has warned that the future of public service broadcasting (PSB) is at risk because young audiences predominantly watch platforms like YouTube. To address this, Ofcom is urging YouTube to give more prominence to content from established PSBs like the BBC, ITV, and Channel 4, particularly in genres such as news and children's programming. The regulator suggests that broadcasters must work with YouTube to make their content easier to find and has even raised the possibility of new legislation to enforce this.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is experiencing a summer surge of COVID-19, with the CDC reporting that cases are growing or likely growing in at least 26 states and Washington, D.C. This follows a now-typical pattern of winter and summer spikes in infections. While the new variants, Nimbus and Stratus, are not considered more deadly, and overall hospitalizations continue a downward trend, experts urge caution, especially for the vulnerable. This includes the elderly, the immunocompromised, and very young children, for whom emergency room visits have reached their highest point since March.</p>

          <p>Christine Hunsicker, the former CEO of clothing technology companies CaaStle and P180, has been charged with defrauding investors out of more than $300 million.

The scheme allegedly bilked CaaStle investors of $275 million before she formed P180 to raise more funds. CaaStle has since filed for bankruptcy, and Hunsicker pleaded not guilty to fraud and other charges.</p>

          <p>Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has publicly urged New Jersey's district court judges to extend the tenure of interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba. Her initial 120-day appointment expires this week, and without Senate confirmation, she can only remain if the judges vote to keep her. Habba, a former personal lawyer for President Trump with no prior law enforcement experience, has had a tumultuous tenure, clashing with state Democrats and making politically charged statements. Blanche's intervention is a highly unusual public push in what is typically a nonpartisan judicial process.</p>

According to a New York Times report, Farmer specifically raised Trump's name due to an unsettling late-night encounter with him in Epstein's office in 1995. This account provides context for why Trump's name might appear in unreleased Epstein files, a matter that has become a political firestorm for the president as he faces pressure to release the documents.</p>
