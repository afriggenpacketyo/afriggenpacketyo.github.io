        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and India are reportedly close to finalizing a trade agreement that could see Washington significantly reduce tariffs on Indian exports, from 50% to 15-16%. In return, New Delhi is considering increasing imports of non-GMO corn from the U.S. and scaling back its substantial purchases of Russian oil. President Trump confirmed a phone call with Indian Prime Minister Modi regarding the oil reduction, though India's foreign ministry has previously denied knowledge of such discussions, citing consumer interests in a volatile energy market. The deal aims to boost bilateral trade, which reached a record $132.2 billion in the last fiscal year.</p>

          <p>The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a stark warning that Gaza faces a health "catastrophe" with impacts expected to last for generations. Despite a recent ceasefire and an increase in aid, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus states that current levels are insufficient to rebuild the devastated healthcare system. He highlighted widespread famine, overwhelming injuries, disease outbreaks due to destroyed infrastructure, and restricted humanitarian access as a "fatal combination." The WHO chief urged Israel to remove conditions on aid delivery and allow full access for humanitarian groups, emphasizing that "peace is the best medicine" in the region.</p>

          <p>The Spanish soccer league has announced the cancellation of plans for Barcelona to play a regular-season game against Villarreal in Miami this December. The decision, made after discussions with the game promoter, cited "uncertainty that has arisen in Spain over the past few weeks" due to increased domestic opposition. Despite receiving approval from UEFA and the Spanish federation, players, clubs, and fans had protested the match, arguing it would compromise the competition's fairness. The league expressed regret, stating the initiative was crucial for global growth and revenue generation, but acknowledged the need to postpone without sufficient time for proper execution.</p>

          <p>China's jobless rate for individuals aged 16 to 24, excluding students, saw a marginal decrease to 17.7% in September from 18.9% in August.

The persistent high unemployment rate reflects ongoing challenges for young graduates, with many struggling to secure positions even after applying to numerous state-owned enterprises.

          <p>Over 300 individuals have contacted the BBC with allegations of racism, corruption, and bullying by police, particularly concerning domestic abuse and sexual assault victims. These reports follow a Panorama undercover investigation that exposed evidence of misogyny, racism, and excessive force at a London police station. Women described their experiences of reporting sexual assault as "like being sexually assaulted again" due to dismissive attitudes from officers. The National Police Chiefs' Council stated it is working to build a culture of integrity, while the Policing Minister urged reporting of "sickening comments" and highlighted new powers to dismiss officers for gross misconduct.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly attacked NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, questioning his intelligence and accusing him of "trying to kill NASA." This criticism stems from NASA's decision to open proposals for moon landers to companies other than SpaceX, despite SpaceX holding a $2.9 billion contract for the Artemis III mission. NASA aims to return astronauts to the moon before China and is exploring multiple options due to delays in SpaceX's Starship development. Duffy responded by emphasizing competition among innovators for America's benefit, while Musk maintained SpaceX's rapid progress and ultimate success in lunar missions.</p>

In another Western Conference matchup, the Golden State Warriors defeated the Los Angeles Lakers 119-109. Despite Luka Doncic's 43 points for the Lakers, the Warriors' balanced scoring, led by Jimmy Butler with 31 points and Stephen Curry with 23, proved too much for a Lakers team missing an injured LeBron James.</p>

Despite earlier assurances that the project would not "interfere" with the existing structure, initial work involves tearing down part of the building. The President confirmed the construction, stating it would significantly increase capacity for major functions and state visits. Historic preservation groups, including the National Trust, have voiced concerns that the proposed 90,000-square-foot annex could "overwhelm the White House itself" and disrupt its classical design, urging a pause for public review.</p>

CEO Ted Sarandos stated AI would help creators tell stories "better, faster and in new ways," expressing confidence it won't replace creativity. However, this stance comes amidst broader entertainment industry anxieties about AI's potential to displace human workers and its use of human-made content, highlighted by previous SAG-AFTRA strikes that secured contractual AI protections for performers.</p>

Corbet argues that aliens probably don't possess warp drives or wormholes, implying that technological limitations and vast distances prevent interstellar travel and encounters.

San Diego Police responded quickly but have yet to make arrests or identify suspects, urging anyone with information to come forward regarding this brutal incident.</p>

          <h2>Gold and Silver Prices Experience Significant Daily Drop After Extended Rally</h2>

          <p>Gold and silver prices have seen their largest daily declines in years, bringing a halt to a remarkable rally in precious metals. Spot gold dropped over 6% to below $4,100 per troy ounce, its steepest intraday fall since 2013, while silver tumbled more than 8%. This downturn is attributed to easing U.S.-China trade tensions, a stronger U.S. dollar, and technical indicators suggesting overbought conditions. Despite the dip, some analysts remain bullish, forecasting gold to reach $4,900 by late next year and $6,000 by 2029, citing persistent inflation and geopolitical concerns as underlying support.

          <p>Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has reiterated that the national inquiry into grooming gangs will maintain its explicit focus and not be "watered down," particularly regarding the ethnicity and religion of offenders. Her assurance comes after three abuse survivors resigned from the inquiry's panel, citing fears that its scope might be broadened to general child sexual abuse and exploitation, and concerns over the suitability of potential chairs. Mahmood expressed regret over the resignations, stating the door remains open for their return, and emphasized the government's commitment to getting the inquiry right, despite frustrations over delays in appointing a chairperson.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protestors gathered in New York City's Chinatown after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) conducted raids targeting the sale of counterfeit goods, resulting in an undisclosed number of detentions. Videos show masked, armed federal agents zip-tying individuals and pushing back onlookers, prompting chants of "ICE out of New York" and "No Ice, no KKK, no fascist USA." Local officials and mayoral candidates condemned the aggressive tactics, with Mayor Eric Adams emphasizing that NYC does not cooperate with federal law enforcement on civil deportations. Critics, including Governor Kathy Hochul, accused the Trump administration of authoritarian theatrics that create fear rather than safety.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles communities are grappling with rampant copper wire theft, leaving many streetlights in darkness and raising safety concerns. The iconic Sixth Street Bridge, for example, remains unlit after seven miles of wire were stolen, costing millions in repairs. A new statewide metal theft law, Assembly Bill 476, is set to take effect next year, aiming to curb the problem by increasing responsibility for junk dealers purchasing scrap metal. The bill will require buyers to verify sellers' identities and lawful ownership, make certain scrap metal from public infrastructure illegal to possess, and stiffen penalties for recyclers dealing in stolen public property.</p>

          <p>Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has characterized the ongoing government shutdown as a "'Seinfeld' shutdown because it's a shutdown about nothing," criticizing Democrats for refusing a "clean" continuing resolution. McCarthy argued that Democrats are seeking extensions for expiring health insurance subsidies and rollbacks of Medicaid restrictions, rather than a straightforward funding bill. He contrasted the current impasse with the 2013 shutdown, noting that Republicans are now pushing for a clean bill while Democrats introduce new demands. McCarthy suggested that the heightened political division means both sides are blaming opponents, making it harder to assign clear responsibility for the impasse.</p>
