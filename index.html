          <p>Coinbase shares experienced a downturn after the company's second-quarter revenue failed to meet analyst expectations. While subscription and services revenue saw gains, it was not enough to compensate for weaker-than-anticipated trading volumes from both retail and institutional investors. The company's reported revenue of $1.5 billion was just shy of the $1.6 billion consensus estimate, reflecting a slowdown from the market exuberance seen earlier in the year. Despite the revenue miss, net income was significantly boosted by gains from its investment portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue, driven by 13% sales growth. However, the company's stock fell in extended trading due to a third-quarter operating income forecast that was lighter than anticipated, raising investor concerns about the return on its substantial AI investments. The Amazon Web Services cloud unit saw revenue climb 18% to $30.87 billion, while the advertising business was a notable bright spot, growing 23% year-over-year. The guidance reflects ongoing caution about recessionary fears and trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a directive to 17 major pharmaceutical companies, demanding they take significant steps to lower U.S. drug prices within the next 60 days. In letters sent to firms like Pfizer, Merck, and Eli Lilly, he threatened to use every available tool to combat what he termed "abusive drug pricing practices." The administration is pushing for companies to adopt a "most favored nation" policy, aligning U.S. prices with the lowest costs in other developed countries. This move caused shares of several major drugmakers to fall significantly following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

The senators argue the task force has become ideologically motivated, citing its 2023 Health Equity Framework as a departure from its evidence-based mission toward what they call "radical wokeness" and "social justice activism." They contend the framework improperly uses criteria related to race and gender identity, urging a return to a focus on science.

          <p>Apple announced third-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations, posting its largest quarterly revenue growth since December 2021 with a 10% overall increase. The company's success was largely driven by a 13% year-over-year jump in iPhone sales, with CEO Tim Cook highlighting the popularity of the iPhone 16 model. Mac sales also grew significantly, while the services division continued its steady expansion. However, sales for the iPad and the wearables division, which includes the Apple Watch and AirPods, both experienced a decline during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent meeting in France between LeBron James, his business partner Maverick Carter, and Nikola Jokić’s agent has fueled reports of plans for a new $5 billion international basketball league. The proposed venture, inspired by LIV Golf and Formula One, would feature touring men's and women's teams and offer players equity stakes, a practice currently prohibited in the NBA. This development comes as the NBA pursues its own expansion into Europe, creating potential competition. The new league would likely require full-time commitments, preventing players from participating in the NBA simultaneously.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has uncovered that the potato evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago through a process of ancient interbreeding. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences solved this long-standing botanical mystery by analyzing hundreds of genomes from both cultivated and wild potato species. They discovered that a hybridization event combined a crucial gene from an ancient tomato, which instructs the plant to form tubers, with a gene from a wild potato relative that controls their growth. This genetic combination was essential for creating the modern starchy vegetable.</p>

          <p>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a federal agency that distributes over $12 billion annually to community health programs, has been severely impacted by staffing purges under the Trump administration. Since February, the agency has lost approximately a quarter of its workforce, including grant managers, analysts, and scientists. Former leaders and health advocates express deep concern that these cuts threaten HRSA's ability to fund and oversee critical services, such as addiction treatment, rural hospitals, and maternal care, potentially weakening the nation's health safety net.</p>

          <p>Morgan Stanley has significantly increased its 12-month price target for Nvidia stock from $170 to $200, reaffirming its overweight rating. The firm's analyst cited "exceptional" and sustained demand for Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell AI chips, which continues to outpace supply. The updated valuation is based on an increased earnings multiple, reflecting strong confidence in the company's future performance and its dominant position in the AI sector. The analysis points to burgeoning infrastructure investment from major tech and enterprise buyers as a key driver of this momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance for homeowners considering borrowing against their home equity, highlighting several potential pitfalls in the current economic climate. Experts warn against opting for a variable-rate Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) if predictable payments are needed, as interest rates could rise. They also caution homeowners to borrow only what is necessary to avoid financial strain and to be vigilant about closing costs and hidden fees, which can significantly increase the overall cost of a loan. Comparing the full Annual Percentage Rate (APR) across multiple offers is recommended. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has announced it will impose sanctions, including visa denials, on officials from the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The U.S. cited the Palestinian leadership's actions to "internationalize its conflict with Israel" through bodies like the International Criminal Court and alleged continued support for terrorism. The move comes shortly after several key U.S. allies, including France, the U.K., and Canada, committed to recognizing an independent Palestinian state, a development the U.S. has opposed. Palestinian leaders described the sanctions as an act of revenge.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh defended the court's management of a rising number of emergency appeals, particularly from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, he argued that as presidents increasingly use executive orders to bypass congressional inaction, legal challenges that require swift court intervention are inevitable. Kavanaugh stated that the court has implemented internal changes to better handle these cases on its so-called "shadow docket." He also emphasized the strong collegiality among the justices, stating they are all patriots operating in good faith even when they disagree.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is conducting a major legal review of President Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose widespread tariffs on U.S. trading partners. During arguments, judges sharply questioned the Justice Department on whether the law, which has never before been used for this purpose, grants the president such broad authority to set levies. The case challenges a cornerstone of Trump's economic agenda, with judges expressing concern that the administration's interpretation could grant it unbounded power to rewrite the tariff schedules set by Congress.</p>

They warned that attacks on the judiciary for unfavorable rulings undermine the rule of law and called for political leaders to tone down rhetoric that emboldens individuals to threaten them.

          <p>Tata Steel has been ordered to pay a £1.5 million fine after a contractor, Justin Day, was crushed to death by a steel beam at its Port Talbot plant in 2019. A court found that while a risk assessment was in place, safety systems were not sufficiently adhered to, leading to the fatal incident. The judge noted that Mr. Day, a 44-year-old father, was a well-versed worker who entered the machinery area believing it was safe. His family expressed that their lives have been shattered by his death and criticized the company for a lack of support.</p>
