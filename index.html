          <p>Ken Dryden, the Hall of Fame goaltender who led the Montreal Canadiens to six Stanley Cup titles in the 1970s, has passed away at the age of 78 after battling cancer. Dryden's career spanned eight seasons, during which he won the Calder Trophy, five Vezina Trophies, and the Conn Smythe Trophy, becoming a six-time All-Star. Known for his relaxed posture on the ice, Dryden retired early at 31 but left an indelible mark on the sport. After retiring, Dryden became a broadcaster, author, and later entered politics, serving as a Member of Parliament and a cabinet minister. His legacy extends beyond hockey, encompassing his contributions as a public servant and author.</p>

          <p>A fire broke out at the BBC's former headquarters, Television Centre, in west London, requiring the response of approximately 100 firefighters. The fire affected the nine-story building, which now houses a restaurant, flats, and television studios. Authorities evacuated residents as a precaution, and the cause of the fire is currently unknown, with investigations underway. The London Fire Brigade worked with multi-agency partners, including the Metropolitan Police, to manage the situation and ensure public safety, with Wood Lane closed to traffic.</p>

The Nacala Corridor network, connecting landlocked Zambia and Malawi to the Port of Nacala in Mozambique, is a focal point of this competition. This race is not only about transporting minerals but also about establishing long-term influence over critical mineral supply chains and reducing dependence on rivals.

          <h2>Chicago Community Responds to Potential National Guard Deployment</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-06 01:56:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the reaction in Chicago to the possibility of President Trump deploying the National Guard to combat crime. While Trump cites Labor Day crime statistics as justification, local activists argue that community-led initiatives are already reducing violence. Violent crime in Chicago has decreased significantly in the past two years, but overall levels remain higher than in many other US cities. Community leaders express concern that deploying the National Guard is not the answer, advocating instead for continued funding for crime prevention programs and addressing the root causes of violence.</p>

          <p>A BBC News reporter recounts her experience interviewing Neil Hopper, a surgeon who claimed to have lost his legs to sepsis, only to discover he had intentionally frozen them for amputation. Hopper, who had a sexual interest in amputation and suffered from body dysphoria, defrauded insurance companies and sought media attention for his unique situation. The reporter expresses shock and confusion upon learning the truth, highlighting the challenges of fact-checking such an unusual story. The case underscores the importance of skepticism in journalism and the unpredictable nature of human behavior, as Hopper's actions deceived medical professionals and those close to him.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuelans and Haitians, allowing over one million people to remain and work in the United States. The judge criticized Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for revoking protections, arguing it would force individuals to return to dangerous conditions. The ruling halts the administration's efforts to end TPS and Humanitarian Parole designations for approximately 1.5 million people. The DHS spokesperson said that the program has been "abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program" and that "unelected activist judges" cannot stop the American people's desire for a secure country.</p>

The author argues that India's foreign policy tilt towards the US has been unbalanced, and it must now recognize its limitations in the global order.

Studies on the topic have yielded conflicting results, and experts highlight the complexity of determining a causal link. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises pregnant women to consult their doctors before using acetaminophen, as with all medicines.</p>

          <p>Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, saw its shares drop sharply after a report that US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may suggest a link between autism and the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy. Kenvue defended its product, stating that it believes there is no causal link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and autism. The company said leading medical organizations agreed on the safety of acetaminophen and its use during pregnancy. The US Department of Health and Human Services said claims about the contents of its much-anticipated autism report were speculation.</p>

          <p>China's yuan has experienced a recent rally primarily driven by stronger guidance from its central bank, rather than market forces. Analysts noted that the US dollar index showed no significant weakening during this period. However, the strengthening of the yuan is likely to remain measured, as Beijing prefers to avoid harming the competitiveness of its exporters amid trade tensions with the United States. The central bank's intervention reflects a desire to manage the yuan's value amid global economic uncertainties.</p>

The McKinley grove, home to roughly 200 giant sequoias, is considered particularly vulnerable due to its isolation and accessibility, but favorable weather conditions have improved the outlook. The safety measures aim to prevent further loss of these iconic trees, which have been decimated by severe wildfires in recent years.</p>

          <p>Economists express alarm over the August jobs report, which showed employers added only 22,000 jobs, far short of expectations, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%. The weak job market is attributed to the Trump administration's tariffs, which are heightening economic uncertainty and boosting costs for importers. Some economists also suggest that the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence is hurting demand for entry-level workers. The report has increased the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut in September to stimulate the economy.</p>
