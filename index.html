          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly passed a massive spending and tax bill championed by President Donald Trump, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote for a 51-50 victory. The legislation now faces a significant challenge in the House of Representatives, where a narrow Republican majority and opposition from some conservative members create an uncertain path to final approval. Concerns persist among some House Republicans regarding the bill's projected $3 trillion addition to the federal deficit and changes made by the Senate. The bill's passage in the House is a critical test for Speaker Mike Johnson ahead of a self-imposed July 4 deadline.</p>

          <p>A business school professor and CEO suggests that job seekers should ask, "What kind of person should not work at this company?" to uncover a company's true values during an interview. This question often elicits more honest and less rehearsed answers than direct inquiries about company culture, revealing practical realities about work-life balance, collaboration, and workplace environment. The article advises saving this disarming question for the end of the interview process, once rapport has been established. The goal is to help individuals find a job that aligns with their personal values, which is crucial for long-term career satisfaction and success.</p>

          <p>California has passed a significant overhaul of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a landmark 1970s environmental law. Governor Gavin Newsom and other state leaders argue the changes are necessary to streamline development and address the state's severe housing shortage and homelessness crisis. The reform aims to remove bureaucratic hurdles that have historically slowed down or prevented the construction of new housing projects. This legislative change was pushed through despite opposition from some environmental groups, marking a major shift in the state's approach to balancing environmental protection with urgent housing needs.</p>

          <p>As interest rates on Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) have decreased, homeowners have an attractive option for borrowing, but there are potential pitfalls to avoid. Experts advise against overborrowing just because rates are lower than alternatives like personal loans, as the home serves as collateral. Homeowners should also actively monitor the rate climate rather than assuming HELOC rates will perfectly mirror Federal Reserve actions. Finally, it is recommended to use HELOCs for strategic purposes, such as value-adding home renovations or as an emergency fund, rather than for discretionary spending like vacations.

Rubin Observatory in Chile, home to the world's largest digital camera, has released its first stunning images of deep space, providing unprecedented views of distant cosmic structures. Among the debut portraits is a detailed image of the Trifid Nebula, nicknamed the "cotton candy" nebula for its pink and blue hues, located 5,000 light-years away. The powerful telescope is set to begin a decade-long mission to scan the night sky, aiming to create a comprehensive cosmic map. Scientists expect the observatory to gather more data about the universe than all previous optical telescopes combined, helping to unravel mysteries like dark energy.</p>

          <p>Kouri Richins, a Utah mother accused of murdering her husband with a fentanyl-laced cocktail and later writing a children's book on grief, is now facing 26 new charges. The new indictments, filed Friday, include multiple counts of mortgage fraud, money laundering, and forgery. Prosecutors allege that Richins engaged in a pattern of unlawful activity, stealing from her husband's business accounts, issuing bad checks, and using altered financial documents to secure loans. These alleged financial crimes occurred in the years leading up to her husband's death in March 2022, adding another layer to the complex and high-profile case.</p>

          <p>Savers with Certificates of Deposit (CDs) maturing in July 2025 face a different interest rate environment than when they first opened their accounts, as top rates have fallen from previous highs. Financial experts advise against allowing CDs to automatically roll over, which would likely lock in a new, lower rate. Instead, savers should actively shop around, particularly at online banks, which often offer more competitive rates. With further Fed rate cuts anticipated, considering a long-term CD now could be a strategic move to lock in current rates for several years, ensuring a stable return on savings.

          <p>The Republican-led Senate has passed a signature domestic policy bill that would extend trillions in tax cuts while implementing significant spending reductions for social safety net programs. The legislation, which now moves to the House, includes major changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to offset the cost of the tax extensions. Early estimates from the Congressional Budget Office project the bill would add over $3 trillion to the deficit and result in around 11 million people losing health coverage. The bill's passage represents a key legislative push for the administration, consolidating various policy goals into one large package.</p>

Gleizes was detained 13 months ago while on assignment for So Foot magazine to write about the JSK Kabylie football club. His supporters contend he is being punished for contacting an exiled opposition figure, who was once influential at the club, for information related to football, not politics.

          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices fell by 0.8% in June, marking the largest single-month drop since February 2023.

Despite the monthly fall, the annual growth rate remained positive at 2.1%, though this is the slowest pace in nearly a year.

          <h2>Fed Chair Powell Attributes Lack of Interest Rate Cuts to Trump's Tariffs</h2>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has directly linked the central bank's decision to hold off on interest rate cuts to the economic uncertainty created by President Trump's tariffs. Speaking at an event in Portugal, Powell explained that the administration's trade policies forced inflation forecasts to be revised upward, prompting the Fed to adopt a wait-and-see approach. He suggested that without the tariffs, the Fed likely would have already reduced borrowing costs. This statement provides a clear rationale for the Fed's recent policy stance and directly counters the president's persistent demands for immediate rate reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With millions of Americans burdened by medical debt, various relief options are available for those who qualify. Many nonprofit hospitals are required by law to offer charity care, providing free or discounted services to patients who meet specific income criteria, typically based on the federal poverty level. For those who don't qualify, debt settlement companies can negotiate to reduce balances with creditors, though this can impact credit scores. As a last resort, filing for Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can eliminate or restructure medical debt, but it has severe long-term financial consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Minimum Wage Increases Take Effect in Multiple U.S. States and Cities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 11:20:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On Tuesday, minimum wage increases became effective in seven states and Washington, D.C., as well as in several specific cities, providing raises for an estimated 880,000 workers. The new rates vary by location, with Alaska's statewide minimum rising to $13.00 per hour and the city of Everett, Washington, now requiring large employers to pay $20.24 per hour. These local and state-level adjustments stand in contrast to the federal minimum wage, which has remained unchanged at $7.25 since 2009. The increases aim to help workers better afford basic living expenses in their respective regions.</p>

          <p>Police in the U.K. have arrested three former senior managers of the Countess of Chester Hospital on suspicion of gross negligence manslaughter. The arrests are part of an investigation into the hospital's leadership during the period when nurse Lucy Letby murdered seven babies and attempted to kill seven others. This corporate-level investigation is examining the decision-making and response of hospital bosses to the increased infant mortality rates. The development comes as Letby's conviction faces scrutiny from some medical experts, though police stated these arrests do not impact the legal findings against her.</p>
