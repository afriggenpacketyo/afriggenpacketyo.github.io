          <p>Donald Trump's implementation of widespread tariffs has ended an era of globalization, causing alarm among governments and investors. Trump, fulfilling a campaign promise, imposed tariffs ranging from 10% to 50% on US trading partners, leading to stock market declines. While Trump claims tariffs will revitalize the US economy and generate revenue, many economists and businesses fear they will harm American consumers and businesses. The tariffs, reminiscent of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, could increase household costs and disrupt the global economy, potentially leading to a recession.

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a novel vaccine booster that can amplify immune responses against cancer and viruses by up to 150-fold. This molecular 'elevator,' known as SABER, effectively transports vaccine antigens directly to the endoplasmic reticulum, bypassing cellular barriers. The technology promises to improve treatments for malignancies like melanoma and liver cancer, as well as enhance the effectiveness of vaccines against rapidly mutating coronaviruses. The research, conducted by multiple universities, highlights China's advancements in biotechnology and its potential impact on global health.</p>

          <p>President Trump's unilateral 10% tariff on imports from numerous countries has taken effect, signaling a major departure from the post-World War II system of mutually agreed tariff rates. Higher tariffs on goods from larger trading partners are slated to follow, further disrupting global trade. Experts anticipate these tariffs will evolve through negotiations, but the initial impact has already shaken global stock markets. While some sectors are exempt, the tariffs are expected to increase costs for American consumers and businesses, potentially leading to significant economic consequences.</p>

          <p>The Japanese Grand Prix faced disruptions during practice sessions due to trackside grass fires, raising concerns about safety. Despite mitigation efforts, the fires persisted, prompting the FIA to focus on dampening the grass before qualifying. The incidents are believed to be caused by sparks from the cars igniting dry grass, a particular issue given Japan's upcoming wet season. The fires highlight the challenges of managing environmental factors in motorsport events, particularly when dealing with high-performance vehicles.</p>

          <p>The L.A. Dodgers are scheduled to visit the White House to celebrate their World Series championship, sparking debate among players and fans due to the Trump administration. Shortstop Mookie Betts, who previously boycotted a White House visit, announced he would attend this time, emphasizing loyalty to his teammates. While some fans oppose the visit due to Trump's policies, others believe it is a traditional honor for championship teams. The team's manager, Dave Roberts, has refrained from making political statements about the visit.</p>

          <p>President Trump has granted TikTok a second extension to comply with a law requiring it to either sell its US operations or face a ban. The extension comes as the Trump administration attempts to broker a deal for American ownership of the social media platform. However, a potential deal fell apart after Trump announced sweeping global tariffs, including on China. The future of TikTok in the US remains uncertain amid ongoing trade tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, through Elon Musk's DOGE teams, has slashed funding to the Institute of Museum and Library Services, a federal agency that supports libraries nationwide. The cuts have resulted in terminated grants and staff layoffs, disrupting critical funding for libraries across the country. Library officials warn that the cuts will impact vital services, particularly in rural communities, and have already put summer reading programs on hold. The move has drawn criticism from members of Congress and publishing houses, who argue that libraries are essential community hubs.</p>

          <p>A deal for TikTok to be acquired by an American-owned company was seemingly finalized, but it has now been held hostage due to trade war tensions between the US and China. The deal was agreed upon by investors, ByteDance, and the Trump administration, but it required approval from the Chinese government. The Chinese government refused to approve the deal until negotiations could be held on Trump's tariffs, which were announced on the same day as the deal's finalization. The deal remains in limbo, with the revival dependent on US-China negotiations on trade.</p>
