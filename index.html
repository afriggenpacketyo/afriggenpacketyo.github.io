        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's recent efforts to stimulate economic growth through interest rate cuts and liquidity injections have not boosted the stock market as investors remain concerned about the ongoing trade war with the U.S. The stimulus package, which includes measures like low-cost relending facilities for tech-related bonds and elderly care investments, was largely anticipated by the market. Analysts suggest that investors are awaiting more targeted fiscal measures that directly boost consumer sentiment and prop up the real estate sector for a meaningful market rally. The article highlights the contrast between this stimulus and previous measures, noting a shift towards industrial and social needs rather than direct market support.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reportedly asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to include a tax increase on wealthy Americans in the upcoming fiscal package. Trump proposes creating a new top income bracket for individuals earning over $2.5 million per year, taxing income above that level at 39.6%. This would partially reverse the 2017 tax cuts, which lowered the top rate to 37%. The article suggests that Trump believes this measure could help protect Medicaid from spending cuts and improve the optics of the fiscal legislation, while some Republicans express concerns about raising taxes.</p>
