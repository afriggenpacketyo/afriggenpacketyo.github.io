          <p>Disney has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will resume broadcasting on ABC this Tuesday, reversing a previous decision to suspend the show indefinitely. The initial suspension followed comments by Kimmel linking the alleged killer of a conservative activist to President Trump's political movement, which prompted major affiliate station owners like Nexstar and Sinclair to threaten preemption. After several days of discussions with Kimmel, Disney executives decided to reinstate the program, stating the host will address the controversy upon his return.</p>

          <p>A man has been arrested on a federal charge after allegedly pointing a red laser at the Marine One helicopter while it was transporting President Trump near the White House. According to the criminal complaint, a Secret Service officer on patrol first noticed the man, who then aimed the laser at the officer before pointing it toward the low-flying helicopter. Such actions pose a significant danger to aircraft by risking pilot disorientation and flash blindness, and the suspect now faces a felony charge.</p>

The White House clarified that the one-time fee applies only to initial applications and not to current visa holders or renewals, aiming to prioritize American workers. However, immigration lawyers are advising caution, as gray areas in the policy could still impact current visa holders who need to travel internationally or change employers.</p>

          <p>President Trump's increasingly blunt public directives for the Justice Department to investigate his political adversaries are reportedly causing significant unease and concern within the agency. His recent social media posts calling for immediate criminal probes into figures like former FBI Director Jim Comey have heightened fears about the erosion of prosecutorial independence. This pressure, combined with the forced departure of a U.S. attorney who reportedly resisted such demands, is fueling concerns over job security and ethical obligations among career government lawyers.</p>

Amazon denies the claims, arguing that its terms are clear and that occasional customer mistakes are inevitable for a program with over 200 million members.</p>

This "mega coral" is larger than a blue whale and appears to be in good health, providing a rare positive sign for marine ecosystems amid global concerns over climate change and coral bleaching.</p>

The plan involves moving the app's U.S. operations into a U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American investors and board members. Under this arrangement, software company Oracle would provide comprehensive security oversight, including monitoring the app's powerful algorithm to prevent malicious use or foreign influence, though China has not publicly confirmed its agreement.</p>
