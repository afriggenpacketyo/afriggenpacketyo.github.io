          <p>A salvage team is en route to the Morning Midas, a cargo ship carrying approximately 3,000 vehicles to Mexico, which caught fire in the waters off Alaska's Aleutian Islands.

The Coast Guard is monitoring the vessel, which remains afloat with smoke emanating from it.

          <p>Bieke Depoorter's new book, Blinked Myself Awake, combines memoir and image in a series of reflections on astronomy, stargazing, and the relationship between photography and objectivity. Depoorter is interested in observing others observing, animated by the conviction that looking up is intimately related to the practice of looking inward and backward. Her subjects are not celestial bodies but peopleâ€”a young man with his eye fixed on his lens; a nightscape of a man with his telescope, framed in the gateway of a chain-link fence; a laser pointer, aimed toward space. The work reminds us that all knowledge begins first with wonder.</p>

          <p>An article discusses the increasing prevalence of wealth in television shows, noting that many series now focus on affluent characters and their lifestyles. This trend has led to a decline in relatable, middle-class portrayals and a shift towards aspirational content. The author argues that this obsession with wealth is not only making television boring but also reshaping our collective psyche, prioritizing wealth as the sole marker of a significant life. The article laments the loss of shows that reflect the economic anxieties and realities of average people.</p>

          <p>An article previews the UK government's upcoming Spending Review, highlighting a substantial increase in overall public spending. The review will allocate significant funds to long-term projects and prioritize specific departments like the NHS. However, short-term spending money will be tight, and the government faces pressure to convince the public of its economic strategy. The article suggests that the government aims to present a compelling narrative of rebuilding the country through strategic investments and addressing key priorities like security and healthcare.</p>

          <p>The article explores the financial implications of drawing down a 401(k) to delay Social Security benefits. While delaying Social Security can result in higher monthly checks, it is important to consider the opportunity cost of lost investment growth within the 401(k). The decision depends on factors such as market returns, the size of the nest egg, and individual financial circumstances. A simple calculation may have you believe that itâ€™s best to delay collecting Social Security as long as possible, but this theoretical calculation is done in a vacuum and doesnâ€™t consider any other factors.
