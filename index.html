          <p>A new Investigation Discovery docuseries, "The Bakersfield 3: A Tale of Murder and Motherhood," explores the intertwined cases of three missing or murdered individuals in Bakersfield, California. The mothers of Micah Holsonbake, Baylee Despot, and James Kulstad joined forces after their children disappeared or were killed within a short period in 2018, frustrated by the lack of progress from law enforcement. The article details their relentless search for answers, including digging with their bare hands and following up on tips, as they grappled with personal struggles and community secrets. Queen was convicted of second-degree murder in Micahâ€™s death and sentenced to 30 years to life in prison, plus 56 years, but the rest of Micahâ€™s remains have never been found, Jamesâ€™ killing remains unsolved, and Baylee is still missing.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested restarting direct negotiations with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, without preconditions, following calls from European leaders for a 30-day ceasefire. This proposal references the unsuccessful 2022 peace talks that took place in Istanbul in March, shortly after Moscow's full-scale invasion. European leaders, including those from France, the UK, Germany, and Poland, had threatened increased sanctions if Russia did not agree to an unconditional ceasefire. The article highlights the complexities of achieving lasting peace, with both sides accusing each other of sabotaging previous ceasefire attempts and continuing attacks despite proposed truces.</p>

          <p>Maryland oral surgeon James Ryan is accused of providing his much younger girlfriend, Sarah Harris, with habit-forming anesthesia drugs, ultimately leading to her death from an overdose. Ryan, who had been romantically involved with Harris after performing her wisdom teeth surgery, allegedly admitted to noticing her when she was only 14 years old. Texts revealed that Ryan provided Harris with propofol and ketamine, and prosecutors argued that he used these drugs to control her, resulting in a 'depraved heart murder.' Ryan was convicted of drug distribution, intent to distribute, and murder, receiving a 45-year prison sentence.</p>

          <p>The average U.S. mortgage rate for a 30-year fixed loan remains steady at 6.76%, close to the year's highest levels, influenced by factors such as Treasury bond demand and Federal Reserve policies. Recent fluctuations in mortgage rates mirror the volatility in the 10-year Treasury yield, a key benchmark for pricing home loans. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for prospective homebuyers, contributing to a sluggish start to the spring home-buying season. Sales of previously occupied homes have declined, reflecting the impact of these economic pressures on the housing market.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa toward renewable projects, with solar and wind power now comprising 59% of its energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China's energy sector investment and construction activity in Africa totaled US$66 billion, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. This shift aligns with global trends, as China committed to halting funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas in 2021, and is fueled by Africa's rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production.</p>
