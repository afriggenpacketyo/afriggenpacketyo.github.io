          <p>OpenAI announced it would restructure into a public benefit corporation while maintaining nonprofit control, bowing to pressure from civic leaders and ex-employees. The decision followed discussions with the attorneys general of California and Delaware, with the nonprofit retaining control over OpenAI's mission. CEO Sam Altman expressed satisfaction with the decision, emphasizing the shared mission between the nonprofit and the public benefit corporation. The article also notes that the restructuring will not affect Elon Musk's ongoing legal battle against the company.</p>

The indictment details a pattern of abuse toward women, including manipulating them into commercial sex acts and physical assaults. A security video showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, Casandra Ventura, in 2016 is expected to be a key piece of evidence. If convicted, Combs could face life in prison.</p>

          <p>Soybean and corn farmers in western Iowa are facing economic challenges due to tariffs, high costs, and low crop prices, echoing the struggles of the 1980s farm crisis.

Farmers are increasingly reliant on exports to China, but tariffs are making it harder to sell their products. Many farmers are hoping President Trump will provide financial assistance if prices remain low. (not investment advice)</p>
