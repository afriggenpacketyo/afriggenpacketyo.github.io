        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new government loan subsidy scheme in China may face challenges due to a prevailing cultural aversion to debt among consumers. Many Chinese households, particularly from older generations, view borrowing for non-essential spending as undesirable, a stark contrast to the credit-driven consumption common in Western economies. Even younger individuals express caution, preferring to avoid debt despite the incentives. This deep-seated financial prudence suggests that official efforts to stimulate the economy by encouraging borrowing might not be as effective as hoped. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwanese electronics manufacturer Foxconn announced a 27% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter operating profit, surpassing market expectations. This growth was primarily driven by its burgeoning artificial intelligence server business, with sales from server products accounting for 41% of revenue and overtaking consumer electronics for the first time. The company, a key partner for Nvidia and the main assembler of Apple's iPhones, anticipates its AI server business will continue to fuel growth and has been expanding production in India in response to global tariff situations.

          <p>The United States has officially designated the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) as a foreign terrorist organization, a move that analysts believe could create an opportunity for enhanced counterterrorism cooperation between the U.S. and China via Pakistan. The BLA has been responsible for attacks in a region where China has significant economic interests, often targeting Chinese nationals. This action by the U.S. State Department is seen as a step toward addressing Beijing's long-standing security concerns in the area and fostering a potential side effect of improved trilateral relations on this specific issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BTecs are practical, vocational qualifications in the UK, assessed through a mix of coursework, projects, and exams, serving as an alternative or supplement to traditional GCSEs and A-levels. Graded from Pass to Distinction Star, they are a popular route to university or direct employment, especially in fields like health and social care. Recent UK government plans to defund many BTecs in favor of new T-levels were partially reversed, with funding for 157 key qualifications extended. This decision acknowledges the vital role these courses play for many students, particularly in crucial economic sectors.</p>

Students who believe their grade is incorrect can appeal through their school or college, which can lead to a mark review. For those who miss their university offer grades, the UCAS clearing system provides a pathway to find available courses, while resitting exams next year remains another viable option.</p>

          <p>Solomon Peña, a defeated Republican candidate for a New Mexico state House seat, has been sentenced to 80 years in prison for organizing a series of drive-by shootings. The attacks targeted the homes of four Democratic officials in Albuquerque following his November 2022 election loss, which he baselessly claimed was fraudulent. Although no one was injured, Peña was convicted on 13 felony charges, including conspiracy and intimidation, for orchestrating the politically motivated violence. He also attempted to have his co-conspirators murdered to prevent their testimony.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Secondary sanctions are a foreign policy tool, primarily used by the United States, that extends economic restrictions to third-party countries or entities doing business with a sanctioned target. Their power stems from the global dominance of the U.S. dollar and financial system, as foreign entities often choose compliance to avoid losing access to American markets. While they were used effectively to bring Iran to the negotiating table over its nuclear program, their overall success is debated. Critics argue they can be difficult to enforce, risk alienating allies, and may push targeted nations closer together, undermining U.S. influence.</p>

          <p>A recent study found that 60% of workers in Singapore, one of the world's most expensive cities, are living paycheck to paycheck, a figure higher than the Asia-Pacific average. Experts attribute this trend to a combination of high inflation outpacing wage growth, expensive housing, and a cultural shift among younger generations who prioritize experiences over saving. While Singapore has a mandatory retirement savings system, many residents find it challenging to build additional savings. This financial pressure is compounded by a desire for a certain lifestyle and the availability of 'buy now, pay later' schemes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy expanded by 0.3% between April and June, a slowdown from the 0.7% growth seen in the first quarter but better than the 0.1% forecast. According to the Office for National Statistics, the services and construction sectors were the primary drivers of this modest expansion. While the government hailed the figures as positive, economists expressed doubt that this pace could be maintained, citing the weak global economy and the potential for cautious consumer spending. The data suggests the economy avoided stagnation despite facing significant headwinds.</p>

The amendment was championed by lawyer John Feerick, who recognized a critical gap in the Constitution's original text, a concern that became more urgent after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The narrative details the multi-year effort to convince lawmakers of the need for clear instructions on what should happen if a president is unable to serve. The amendment provides a crucial framework for ensuring stability and continuity in the executive branch during a crisis.</p>

The scholars label the move as censorship and an act of anti-Palestinian discrimination, particularly amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza. The publisher had demanded an unprecedented legal "risk assessment" for the articles, and when authors protested, the entire issue was scrapped, with the publisher citing procedural issues rather than censorship.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have fallen out of first place in the National League West for the first time since April after a 6-5 loss to the Los Angeles Angels completed a season series sweep. The defeat followed a familiar, frustrating pattern for the Dodgers, who took an early lead but failed to extend it before their struggling bullpen faltered in the eighth inning. This loss marks their fourth straight and continues a significant slump since early July. The team now faces a critical series against the San Diego Padres, who have overtaken them for the division lead.</p>

          <p>A federal trial has concluded over a lawsuit filed by California against the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles. The state argued the deployment for immigration enforcement support violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which limits domestic use of the military. Justice Department lawyers claimed the act did not apply and that the troops were providing lawful protection for federal agents and property. The judge expressed significant concern over the government's arguments, questioning the apparent lack of limits on the president's authority to create a national police force and pressing for a clear remedy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is deploying federalized National Guard troops to the National Mall in Washington, D.C., as part of a plan to address crime in the city. According to a source, the deployment is intended to create a significant military presence visible to residents and tourists. President Trump announced the mobilization of 800 troops, but officials clarified they will work in smaller shifts, providing logistical and administrative support to law enforcement. The move is described as extraordinary, as the National Mall is a relatively safe area primarily frequented by tourists.</p>

          <p>A hearing has wrapped up in a lawsuit challenging an immigration detention center, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," built in the Florida Everglades. Environmental groups and the Miccosukee tribe argue that the facility's construction violated federal law by failing to conduct a required environmental assessment. A key question during the trial was who ultimately controls the facility—the state of Florida or the federal government—which determines if federal environmental laws apply. Plaintiffs presented evidence of the facility's negative impact on endangered species like the Florida panther and on the fragile wetland ecosystem's water quality.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at easing the regulatory burden on the commercial spaceflight industry. The order directs the Department of Transportation to simplify or eliminate environmental reviews for launch licenses issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Citing inefficient permitting as a barrier to investment and innovation, the White House stated the goal is to remove outdated and restrictive rules. The move is expected to benefit private space companies like SpaceX, though environmental groups have criticized it as reckless, warning of risks to people and wildlife.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that the proportion of American adults who consume alcohol has fallen to 54%, a record low since the firm began tracking the data in 1939. This decline coincides with a growing belief, especially among young adults, that even moderate drinking is harmful to one's health. Only 50% of adults aged 18-34 report drinking, and they are more likely to view moderate consumption as unhealthy. Experts suggest this shift is driven by increased health awareness, the social acceptability of not drinking, and economic factors, reflecting a significant change in cultural attitudes toward alcohol.</p>

The replacement highlights the growing technological rivalry and Beijing's push for self-sufficiency, especially in sensitive sectors. The change was prompted by alarms over potential cyberattacks, similar to the Stuxnet virus that targeted Iran's nuclear program via industrial controllers.</p>
