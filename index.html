          <p>Following two days of discussions in London, the United States and China have agreed on a framework to implement the Geneva trade consensus. This agreement aims to stabilize the relationship between the two countries, which had been strained by accusations of violating the Geneva trade agreement. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that he and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer would seek President Trump's approval of the framework, while China's Li Chenggang would do the same for President Xi Jinping. Jianwei Xu from Natixis noted that this framework signals a commitment to de-escalation, though concrete agreements remain uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>
