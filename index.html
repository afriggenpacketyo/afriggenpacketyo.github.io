          <p>Google is hiring Varun Mohan, the CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other key employees, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion for licensing and compensation. This move intensifies the ongoing talent war in the artificial intelligence sector, following similar high-stakes hires by competitors like Meta and Microsoft. While Google gains top talent and licenses some technology, Windsurf will continue to operate independently under a new interim CEO. The deal underscores the increasing value of specialized AI startups and their personnel in the competitive tech landscape.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's value surged to a new record, briefly exceeding $121,000, driven by significant inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On a single day last week, these ETFs saw inflows of $1.18 billion, signaling strong institutional interest in the cryptocurrency. Analysts suggest this institutional buying could propel the price even higher in the near future. The rally also coincides with the U.S. Congress beginning deliberations on new crypto-focused legislation, which is supported by the Trump administration and aims to provide regulatory clarity for the industry.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, exceeding analysts' forecasts and indicating resilience in its trade sector. This growth was largely supported by strong demand from non-U.S. markets, particularly Southeast Asian nations and the European Union. A temporary 90-day tariff truce with the United States also helped slow the decline in shipments to America. Despite the positive data, the overall trade relationship with the U.S. remains complex, with both sides working towards an August deadline for a more durable agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union is navigating a complex and challenging trade environment, facing pressure from both the United States and China. The bloc is currently deliberating its response to President Trump's recent announcement of a 30 percent tariff on all EU-made goods. Simultaneously, EU leaders are preparing for difficult discussions in Beijing, further complicating their economic strategy. This dual pressure from the world's two largest economies places the EU in a precarious position as it tries to protect its interests and maintain stability.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed expectations, was primarily driven by strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors. This economic expansion was partly attributed to a temporary pause in U.S.-China tariffs, which may have encouraged businesses to front-load exports. However, the Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, citing significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy for the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prosecutions for fare evasion on the London Underground have hit a six-year high, with 3,691 people prosecuted in the 2024-25 period. Transport for London (TfL) also issued over 13,000 penalty notices on the Tube during this time. While prosecutions on the London Overground fell, a record number of penalty notices were handed out on that service. TfL states that fare evasion costs Londoners vital investment and has committed to reducing the evasion rate, expanding its team of investigators to target the most persistent offenders across the network.</p>

          <p>Kwon Ping Ho, the founder of the Banyan Group luxury hotel chain, observes that today's tourists have vastly different expectations compared to 30 years ago. He notes that younger, more seasoned travelers are less interested in traditional sightseeing and are instead seeking deeper, more authentic experiences that involve interaction with local communities. Ho also highlights the rise of "rainbow tourism," with travelers coming from a more diverse range of countries than in the past. This shift is pushing the hospitality industry to move beyond one-size-fits-all offerings toward more creative and personalized travel experiences.</p>

          <p>Buckingham Palace has confirmed that U.S. President Donald Trump will make a second state visit to the United Kingdom from September 17 to 19. King Charles III will host the president and first lady at Windsor Castle, an invitation seen as a strategic move by the British government to maintain close ties with the U.S. This marks an unprecedented second state visit for an American president and comes amid criticism from Canadian officials over the timing. Unlike his 2019 visit, Trump is not expected to address Parliament, which will be in recess.</p>

          <p>The Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland is marking a major milestone: 230 years of continuous, daily weather observation. This unbroken sequence of handwritten data, which began on July 14, 1795, is the longest of its kind in the UK and Ireland. The tradition continues today, with a human observer manually recording temperature and pressure, a practice largely replaced by automated stations elsewhere. This invaluable historical record has documented significant weather events and contributed to the science of meteorology, including the development of the cup anemometer for measuring wind speed.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte following his announcement of a plan to help arm Ukraine. The plan involves selling advanced U.S. weapons, such as Patriot missiles, to European NATO allies, who would then transfer their existing, compatible arms to Ukraine, ensuring faster delivery. This strategy comes as the U.S. administration and Congress consider imposing heavy sanctions on Russia and any countries supporting its war effort. The meeting and weapons plan signal a potential turning point in the U.S. approach to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced plans for a significant increase in France's defense spending, warning that Europe's liberty faces its greatest threat since World War II. He called for the military budget to double by 2027, reaching €64 billion, three years ahead of the original schedule. In a speech to the armed forces, Macron cited complex geopolitics and the "imperialist policies" of powers like Russia as justification for the increase. The proposal, which requires government approval, reflects a broader trend among European nations to bolster their military capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers ended the first half of the baseball season on a high note, defeating the San Francisco Giants 5-2 in extra innings. The win solidifies their position atop the National League West, despite an uneven performance marked by both offensive brilliance and pitching staff injuries. Starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a stellar seven-inning, scoreless performance, though the bullpen later gave up the lead before the offense rallied in the 11th inning. The team enters the All-Star break with the best record in the NL, positioned well for a postseason run.</p>

The "State of the UK Climate" assessment finds that the country is warming at about 0.25°C per decade, leading to more very hot days and wetter winters. The report highlights that 2024 saw numerous heat and rainfall records broken, a trend continuing into 2025. This long-term shift, driven by global warming, is impacting the natural world and increasing risks like flooding.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, known for his "illiberal democracy" and admired by some conservatives globally, is facing a significant political challenge at home. A new opposition figure, Peter Magyar, who emerged from Orban's own circle, is gaining traction by focusing on domestic issues like the state of hospitals and schools. While Orban has maintained power by targeting perceived threats like migration and LGBTQ rights, polls suggest his Fidesz party is losing ground to Magyar's Tisza party. This internal challenge from the center-right suggests Orban's long-established playbook may be weakening.</p>

          <p>A severe, long-term drought in northern Mexico is escalating a water-sharing dispute with the United States. Under an 81-year-old treaty, Mexico is required to send a specified amount of water from the Rio Grande to the U.S., but it is currently in arrears due to critically low reservoir levels. Farmers in Texas, who are also suffering from water shortages, are pressuring the Trump administration to enforce the treaty, with the president threatening tariffs. Mexican farmers and officials argue they cannot send water they don't have, highlighting the need to renegotiate the outdated agreement.</p>
