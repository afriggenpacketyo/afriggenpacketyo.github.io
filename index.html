Captain Nat Sciver-Brunt was instrumental, scoring a century with 117 runs, while Sophie Ecclestone delivered a remarkable bowling performance, taking four wickets for just 17 runs. Despite an early injury to their captain, Sri Lanka showed some resistance but ultimately fell short, being bowled out for 164.

          <p>Quaker, one of the five British army horses that bolted and ran through London in April 2024, has been retired to a sanctuary. The horse sustained a broken bone and significant injuries after being spooked by construction noise, an incident that also injured several soldiers and civilians. Due to the severity of his injuries, Quaker was unable to return to his ceremonial duties with the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment. He will now live at The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown has led to the closure of all 21 Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo, effective Sunday. The institutions were able to remain open for the first 11 days of the shutdown by using prior-year funds, but those resources have now been exhausted. While essential staff will continue to care for the animals at the zoo, popular nonessential features like the animal webcams will be turned off. This closure is a prominent example of the widespread impact the budget impasse is having on public services.</p>

The S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell sharply on Friday following the announcement of an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports and new export controls on critical software, set to begin November 1. The move was framed as a response to China's own export controls on rare earth minerals.

          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden has begun radiation and hormone therapy as part of his treatment for an aggressive form of prostate cancer. The diagnosis, which was first revealed in May, indicated that the cancer had metastasized to the bone. According to his spokesperson, the treatment plan is proceeding, and the radiation therapy is expected to last for five weeks. This follows a separate procedure in September where Biden had cancerous cells successfully removed from his skin.</p>

          <p>Spanish police have arrested an individual after discovering a horrific scene at an illegal animal breeding facility in northwestern Spain. Authorities found the corpses of 250 animals, mostly dogs, in a warehouse with "extremely poor" hygiene conditions, alongside 171 surviving animals that were in a life-threatening state. Some of the survivors, which included exotic birds, were reportedly feeding on the dead animals due to a lack of food and water. The site manager faces charges of animal abuse and other related offenses.</p>

          <p>Cameroon's 92-year-old president, Paul Biya, is seeking an eighth term after 43 years in power, highlighting a trend of gerontocracy on the world's youngest continent. He is not an isolated case; leaders like Peter Mutharika of Malawi (85), Alassane Ouattara of Ivory Coast (83), and Teodoro Obiang Nguema of Equatorial Guinea (83) also continue to defy age and, in some cases, constitutional term limits. This phenomenon persists despite growing frustration among younger generations who are increasingly protesting for change and new leadership.</p>

          <p>A drone strike has killed dozens of people, including children, at a displacement shelter in the besieged city of el-Fasher, Sudan. Local activists attribute the attack to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which has been surrounding the city for months. The city is the last army stronghold in the Darfur region, and its potential fall raises fears of a humanitarian catastrophe for the 250,000 civilians trapped there. The ongoing conflict between the RSF and the Sudanese army has created one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.</p>

          <p>A potential historic peace agreement between Israel and Hamas has been brokered with significant influence from U.S. President Donald Trump, according to political analysis. Observers argue that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reliance on American support made him susceptible to pressure from Trump, leading to a breakthrough. As American public opinion on the conflict has shifted, the U.S. president's role became pivotal in pushing the parties toward a deal to end the war in Gaza. The durability of the agreement remains a key question.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Australian soccer players are moving to Major League Soccer (MLS) in North America, seeing it as a viable pathway to advance their careers and gain national team recognition. Players like Nashville SC's Patrick Yazbek have found that the league's quality and visibility provide a strong alternative to traditional moves to European leagues. The trend also extends to coaching and staff roles, offering professional opportunities that are sometimes limited in Australia's domestic A-League. This shift is changing perceptions of MLS within the Australian football community.</p>

          <p>Following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from some areas, Hamas has reportedly recalled around 7,000 members of its security forces to reassert control within Gaza. The move, aimed at countering "outlaws and collaborators," has raised fears of internal violence, especially after a deadly clash with the powerful Dughmush clan. This mobilization comes as uncertainty grows over the future governance of Gaza and could complicate the implementation of the U.S.-brokered peace plan, which calls for Hamas to disarm.</p>

Others, like New York's Metrograph, have found success as for-profit ventures by offering a premium experience with a restaurant, bar, and bookstore. These strategies aim to counter the rise of streaming by emphasizing the unique social experience of moviegoing.</p>
