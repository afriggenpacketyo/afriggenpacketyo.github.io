          <p>Newark, N.J. Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility while visiting with New Jersey's congressional delegation, sparking outrage from Governor Murphy who called for his immediate release. Baraka, a Democrat running for governor, has been protesting the opening of the 1,000-bed facility, alleging it's dangerous and illegal due to lacking proper permits and blocked inspections. DHS claims members of Congress "stormed the gate" and broke into the facility, while congressmembers say Baraka's arrest was meant to intimidate, showing the escalating tensions surrounding immigration detention centers. Baraka was released later that evening.</p>

          <p>A robotic Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-482, launched in 1972 and intended for Venus, is expected to re-enter Earthâ€™s atmosphere after 53 years adrift in space. Due to a rocket malfunction, it remained in Earth orbit and has been slowly spiraling back. Experts predict re-entry on Friday or Saturday, but the exact location remains unknown, though it is estimated to be between 52 degrees north and south latitude. While the spacecraft is expected to mostly burn up upon re-entry, some parts could survive impact, and legally belong to Russia if recovered.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan are engaged in their most expansive military conflict in decades, with Pakistan accusing India of launching air-to-surface missiles targeting multiple air bases, including one near Islamabad. Pakistan retaliated with strikes targeting Indian air bases and a missile storage facility. The conflict, initiated after militants killed 26 people in India-controlled Kashmir, has escalated with drone attacks and exchanges of gunfire, causing civilian casualties and prompting diplomatic pressure from Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Both sides have mobilized troops and suspended cricket leagues due to safety concerns, raising fears of further escalation and potential nuclear war.</p>

          <p>California public health officials have announced an annual statewide mussel quarantine effective through October 31, warning against eating sport-harvested mussels due to naturally occurring toxins. Mussels may contain paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins, which can be deadly and have no known antidotes. The quarantine area spans the entire California coastline, but commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt due to regular testing. Symptoms of poisoning include tingling lips, loss of balance, and muscular paralysis, with death possible within 30 minutes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that left-handedness may be associated with certain neurological disorders, particularly those affecting language or neurodevelopment. Researchers found that individuals with autism are 3.5 times more likely to be left-handed, and atypical handedness is also more common in people with schizophrenia and intellectual disability. The study suggests a potential link between handedness and brain organization, with language functions often divided between both sides of the brain in left-handed individuals. While the study highlights correlations, experts caution that it does not establish causation and call for further research.</p>

Ozturk was detained in March after her visa was revoked, allegedly due to her pro-Palestinian activism and criticism of the university's response to resolutions concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The judge highlighted declarations attesting to her peaceful character and commitment to her academic career, noting the absence of evidence of violence or advocacy for violence.

          <p>As the trade war between the U.S. and China intensifies, analysts are concerned that China could use its $1.2 trillion holdings of American mortgage-backed securities (MBS) as a 'nuclear option'. If China floods the market with these securities, it could trigger higher interest rates and destabilize the U.S. housing market. This move could prompt other nations like Canada and Japan, which also hold significant MBS portfolios, to follow suit.

          <p>Google has agreed to pay nearly $1.4 billion to the state of Texas to settle allegations of violating the data privacy rights of state residents. Attorney General Ken Paxton sued Google in 2022, accusing the company of unlawfully tracking and collecting users' private data. The settlement, which covers two separate lawsuits, is the largest data privacy settlement by a state with Google to date. Google did not admit any wrongdoing, stating that the settlement involves allegations related to Chrome's incognito setting, location history on Google Maps, and biometric claims related to Google Photos.</p>
