          <p>A passenger on a SkyWest flight described the moment the plane made a sudden, sharp turn to avoid a B-52 bomber near Minot, North Dakota. The pilot, who was not informed of the bomber's approved flyover for the state fair, apologized for the aggressive maneuver, stating it was the safest option. The incident, which left passengers shaken, is now under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration to determine the proximity of the two aircraft and the communication breakdown between air traffic control and the military.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has restricted two U.S. citizens, a Commerce Department employee and a Wells Fargo banker, from leaving the country. The State Department confirmed the travel ban on the patent office employee, who was traveling in a personal capacity, and is working to resolve the situation. Chinese officials also confirmed that the banker, Mao Chenyue, is subject to an exit ban due to her involvement in an ongoing criminal investigation.

          <p>President Trump's judicial nominee for the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, Emil Bove, is facing significant opposition from both Democrats and conservative legal activists. Critics express concern that Bove's nomination prioritizes personal loyalty to the president over judicial ideology, a departure from the conservative legal movement's long-term strategy. Bove, a former Trump defense lawyer, is criticized for his aggressive tactics at the Justice Department, leading some prominent conservatives to question his character and fitness for a lifetime judicial appointment.</p>

          <p>Corporate spending on business travel is increasing but at a more moderate pace than previously predicted, as companies adopt a strategic, cautious approach due to economic pressures and trade policy uncertainty. A new report from Navan shows a 15% year-over-year increase in spending, with a focus on individual relationship-building meetings rather than large team events. The Global Business Travel Association has tempered its growth forecast, citing a drop in industry optimism. This trend reflects a "wait and see" mode among C-suite leaders prioritizing high-return-on-investment travel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian cricket captain Shubman Gill has accused the England team of acting against the "spirit of cricket" by using time-wasting tactics during their recent Test match at Lord's. Gill claimed England's openers were deliberately late to the crease to reduce the number of overs they had to face, sparking confrontations between the two teams. England's captain, Ben Stokes, acknowledged the third-day events "sparked everyone off" but maintained that neither side crossed the line of unacceptable behavior. The heightened tensions set the stage for a contentious fourth Test.</p>

          <p>Laura Anne Jones, a sitting Member of the Senedd (MS), has defected from the Welsh Conservatives to join the Reform party, becoming its first representative in the Welsh Parliament. Party leader Nigel Farage announced the high-profile defection, which Jones attributed to her feeling that the Conservative Party was no longer recognizable. The move was met with anger by her former party, which stated that voters would feel "very let down." The defection comes as recent polls suggest Reform is gaining significant traction in Wales ahead of the next Senedd election.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Hunter Biden directed profanity-laced criticism at actor George Clooney, blaming him for helping to precipitate his father's withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race. Clooney was one of the first major Democratic figures to publicly call for Joe Biden to step aside after a poor debate performance, citing concerns about the former president's sharpness. Hunter Biden accused Clooney of exaggerating his father's condition and suggested the actor's intervention was motivated by policy disagreements over Israel. The comments offer a personal, bitter reflection on the final months of the campaign.</p>

          <p>The announced cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" is being analyzed as a significant moment for both network television and political satire. While CBS cited "purely financial" reasons, critics and commentators speculate that the decision is an act of "pre-compliance" to appease the Trump administration amid a potential corporate merger. The move is seen as symbolic of the decline of the once-dominant genre of late-night political comedy, which rose to prominence in the Bush era. Colbert's ousting suggests a chilling effect on media institutions in the current political climate.</p>

          <p>This literary travel essay explores the Greek island of Corfu through the lens of author John le Carré and his novel "A Perfect Spy." The article delves into how the island's own history as a crossroads of great powers mirrors the themes of espionage, identity, and betrayal in le Carré's work. It connects the author's personal history, particularly his fraught relationship with his con-man father, to the psychological depth of his characters. The narrative weaves together personal travel experiences with literary analysis, reflecting on how places, memory, and fiction intertwine.</p>

This marks the third time the U.S. has left the Paris-based body, having previously withdrawn under Presidents Reagan and Trump's first term, only to rejoin later.

          <p>Following Coca-Cola's announcement to offer a cane sugar-sweetened soda, health experts are clarifying the nutritional differences between it and high-fructose corn syrup. Dietitians explain that while their chemical compositions vary slightly, both sweeteners have similar metabolic impacts and contribute equally to health issues like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease when consumed in excess. Both are considered "empty calories" and have a high glycemic index. The key takeaway from experts is that moderation is crucial, and limiting overall intake of all added sugars is more important than choosing one type over the other.</p>
