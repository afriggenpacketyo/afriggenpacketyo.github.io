          <p>Daniil Medvedev was eliminated from the US Open after a contentious incident involving a photographer during his match against Benjamin Bonzi. As Medvedev faced match point, a cameraman walked onto the court, leading to a six-minute delay and a replayed first serve for Bonzi. Medvedev's furious reaction and the crowd's subsequent frenzy created a wild atmosphere, ultimately contributing to his five-set defeat.

          <p>Singapore's inflation rate eased to a lower-than-expected 0.6% in July, marking its lowest level since January 2021. Core inflation also dipped to 0.5%, driven by falling retail and gas prices. The Monetary Authority of Singapore projects moderate inflation in the near term, citing easing global oil prices and contained food commodity hikes. This article indicates that the central bank has already loosened monetary policy twice this year to counter weaker economic growth and anticipates further easing if inflation remains low.
