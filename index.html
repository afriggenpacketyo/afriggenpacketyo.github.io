            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russian forces continued attacks, including shellings and assaults, despite Russia's announced 'Easter truce.' Zelenskyy accused Russia of creating an 'impression' of a ceasefire while still attempting to advance in some areas. He reiterated Ukraine's readiness to extend the truce for 30 days, a proposal previously rejected by Russia, emphasizing that Ukrainian forces would respond based on the combat situation. The BBC reports a quieter front line despite the continued attacks, highlighting the skepticism among Ukrainians regarding the possibility of a genuine ceasefire.</p>

            <p>The article critiques Donald Trump's attempts to impose political authority over academic life by demanding that universities like Harvard hire faculty to ensure 'viewpoint diversity.' The author argues that this approach is a form of identity politics that undermines scholarly objectivity. The piece suggests that true diversity of thought requires fostering a culture of intellectual engagement and freedom of expression, rather than imposing state mandates or bureaucratic procedures. The author advocates for encouraging the capacity of the human mind to move between different points of view.</p>

            <p>Chinese researchers have successfully detonated a non-nuclear hydrogen bomb in a controlled field test, using a magnesium-based solid-state hydrogen storage material. The 2kg bomb generated a fireball exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius for over two seconds without using any nuclear materials. The device, developed by the China State Shipbuilding Corporation, uses magnesium hydride, which releases hydrogen gas when activated by conventional explosives, creating a sustained inferno. The technology was originally intended to power fuel cells in off-grid areas.</p>
