            <p>Some American tourists in Paris are experiencing a sense of shame and embarrassment due to President Trump's recent trade tariffs. Some tourists are concealing American symbols to avoid negative attention, reflecting a broader transatlantic rift. A French travel guide company reports a significant drop in orders for books about the US, balanced by increased interest in Canada. While some, like Nicolas Conquer, defend Trump's 'America First' agenda, others express pessimism about the future of transatlantic relations and travel to the United States.</p>

            <p>The UK government is contemplating nationalizing British Steel to prevent its collapse, potentially making the UK the only G7 country without primary steelmaking capability. The government is changing the law to allow intervention, including buying coal to keep furnaces running, after the Chinese owners sought a billion-pound bailout without job guarantees. While nationalization is not yet confirmed, it aligns with Labour's stance on government intervention to protect national interests and jobs. The move follows concerns about the plant's financial viability and the high cost of energy.</p>

            <p>American, European, and German business chambers in China are expressing concerns about the escalating trade war with the US, fearing long-lasting impacts.

            <p>The US-China trade war has impacted the biotech industry, with some Chinese companies benefiting from tariffs on US plasma products. China relies on imports to meet its albumin demand, and tariffs on US products could boost domestic manufacturers' market share. The US is a major exporter of pharmaceuticals and medical devices to China, but the trade war could disrupt this flow. This situation highlights the complex and evolving dynamics of the trade war and its impact on specific industries. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The law firm Susman Godfrey, which represented Dominion Voting Systems, is suing the Trump administration over an executive order targeting the firm. The lawsuit claims the order, which seeks to block the firm's access to government buildings and contracts, is an unconstitutional act of retaliation for their work defending the integrity of the 2020 election. Susman Godfrey argues that the order would irreparably harm their ability to represent clients in federal courts and interact with federal agencies. The firm's lawsuit highlights concerns about potential abuse of power.</p>

            <p>A small plane crash in Boca Raton, Florida, resulted in the deaths of all three people on board. The Cessna 310 crashed near I-95 and Tri-Rail tracks after departing from Boca Raton Airport. One person was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries after possibly driving through the crash site. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the incident, which caused significant traffic disruptions and suspension of train services. Witnesses reported seeing the plane in distress before the crash.</p>

            <p>A US judge has ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and legal US resident, can be deported for his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests. The Trump administration cited a Cold War-era law, claiming his presence is adverse to American foreign policy interests, despite Khalil not being charged with a crime. The ACLU criticized the decision as "pre-written", arguing that the government's evidence was based solely on his speech. Khalil's lawyers plan to appeal, and he has also filed a federal lawsuit challenging his arrest.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has ended Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans in the U.S., potentially leading to their deportation starting May 20. The decision was based on a review of conditions in Afghanistan, with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem stating that the country no longer meets the requirements for TPS designation. Advocates argue that conditions in Afghanistan have worsened and that the decision is cruel and undermines America's commitment to its allies. This move aligns with the Trump administration's broader efforts to overhaul immigration policy.</p>

            <p>The US tariff policy could deal a blow to African exports, and experts warned that a prolonged US-China trade war would devastate the continent if China’s economy were to stumble. The United States runs its largest trade deficits with Africa’s top commodity exporters – South Africa, Nigeria, Algeria and Angola – as it is heavily reliant on their precious metals, oil and platinum, according to Renaissance Capital Africa. But it said US-Africa trade remained small – last year the continent accounted for US$39 billion of American imports, or just over a month’s worth of US trade with Mexico or Canada. South Africa and Nigeria account for over half of those imports. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Southern California Edison (Edison) believes a dormant powerline is a leading theory for the cause of the Eaton fire. Edison will take steps to harden other idle towers and lines across its network to prevent reenergizing incidents. Those measures include conducting additional field inspections, reviewing past inspections, and making changes in an internal maintenance manual that instruct crews on how to properly ground the idle equipment. The possibility that an idle, unconnected Southern California Edison transmission line somehow reengerized on Jan. 7 is “a leading hypothesis” for what started the destructive Eaton fire, Edison International Chief Executive Pedro Pizarro said Friday.</p>
