          <p>Donald Trump toured central Texas to survey the damage from catastrophic flash floods that killed over 120 people. His visit highlights a shift in tone compared to his previous criticisms of governors during disasters, particularly Democrats. This time, Trump has focused on his cooperative relationship with Texas's Republican Governor, Greg Abbott, while avoiding scrutiny of the local or federal response. The visit comes as search efforts continue for over 170 missing people and questions arise about the adequacy of warnings before the Guadalupe River swelled.</p>

          <p>Lord Ian Blair, who served as the commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police from 2005 to 2008, has passed away at the age of 72. His tenure was marked by significant events, including the 7/7 London bombings and the controversial shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes. He dedicated over 30 years to public service, rising through the ranks after joining the force in 1974. Lord Blair stepped down in 2008 after losing the confidence of the newly elected London mayor, Boris Johnson.</p>

          <p>Relatives of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, who also hold German citizenship, have traveled to Berlin to press for greater German involvement in securing their release. They met with German officials to appeal for more diplomatic pressure, stating that while they have received sympathy, it is now time for decisive action. The families are pinning their hopes on ongoing ceasefire negotiations, emphasizing the critical condition of some captives, like 24-year-old Alon Ohel. Of the hostages taken on October 7, 24 are still believed to be alive in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Jannik Sinner has advanced to his first Wimbledon final after a decisive straight-sets victory over seven-time champion Novak Djokovic. The 23-year-old Italian dominated the match, winning 6-3, 6-3, 6-4, and ending Djokovic's latest attempt to secure a record 25th Grand Slam title. Sinner will now face defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in a highly anticipated final, a rematch of their recent epic at the French Open. The defeat raises questions about the 38-year-old Djokovic's future prospects of achieving another major title.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services is facing a significant backlog of over a billion dollars in delayed grants, prompting it to ask some laid-off staff to return temporarily. Officials attribute the delays to new bureaucratic processes implemented by the Trump administration, which have stalled funding for critical programs, including services for unaccompanied migrant children and youth homelessness. The department is now in a race against the fiscal year-end deadline of September 30, potentially shortening application periods and straining resources to process the awards. These administrative hurdles have reportedly been lifted, but the backlog remains a major challenge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid concerns about Social Security's long-term solvency and potential benefit reductions, seniors may need to explore alternative income sources. This article outlines three potential strategies for supplementing retirement funds to ensure financial stability. These options include reverse mortgages, which allow homeowners aged 62 and older to tap into their home equity for monthly payments. Another strategy is purchasing an annuity, which provides guaranteed lifetime income in exchange for a lump-sum investment. A third, though less ideal, option is a personal loan for more immediate financial needs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded an unexpected budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a rare occurrence driven by a sharp increase in receipts, particularly from tariffs. Customs duties for the month were 301% higher than in June of the previous year, following the implementation of broad tariffs on imports. This surplus helped reduce the fiscal year-to-date deficit to $1.34 trillion, a 1% decrease from the same period a year ago. However, net interest payments on the national debt remain a significant expense, totaling $84 billion for the month alone. (not investment advice)</p>

The young cast, many of whom came of age during the pandemic, exhibit a hesitancy and suspicion towards forming deep connections. Despite this, the show's popularity suggests viewers may relate to this cautious dynamic or are drawn to the rare contestants who display genuine, unfiltered emotion.</p>

Tax professionals warn that as the benefit is reduced for those with modified adjusted gross incomes between $500,000 and $600,000, it creates a "SALT torpedo." This effect can push the marginal federal tax rate on income within that specific range to as high as 45.5%.

While the number itself is arbitrary, subsequent research has shown it to be a reasonably effective benchmark for promoting good health. Studies indicate that health benefits, such as reduced cardiovascular risk, can begin at lower step counts like 2,500 per day, often plateauing around 7,500 steps.

One article reviews a book on Argentina's Dirty War, drawing parallels between state-sponsored kidnappings and recent U.S. immigration policies, suggesting no nation is safe from the loss of checks on state power. Another piece discusses Greg Grandin's "America, América," which reframes Latin America not as a perpetual victim but as a pioneer of democratic concepts like birthright citizenship. These works suggest the U.S. has as much to learn from its neighbors as it has to teach.</p>

          <p>A new analysis has ranked the most expensive states to live in for 2025, highlighting areas where inflation and high costs for housing and goods hit residents hardest. California leads the list as the nation's most expensive state, with nearly 40% of households considered "cost-burdened" by housing expenses. Other states in the top tier for high living costs include Hawaii, Florida, and Colorado, which are grappling with skyrocketing home insurance premiums. The report considers factors like consumer prices, housing affordability, and insurance costs, which are becoming a critical issue for homeowners in many parts of the country.

          <p>Despite a weaker overall market influenced by new tariff threats against Canada, megacap technology stocks like Amazon and Nvidia demonstrated resilience. An analyst upgrade from Morgan Stanley boosted Amazon, raising its price target to $300 and citing manageable tariff impacts and accelerating growth in its AWS cloud division. Meanwhile, Nvidia's stock continued to rise following CEO Jensen Huang's meeting at the White House, which fueled speculation that the U.S. may use the company's chips as a diplomatic tool with China. The S&P 500 was generally lower as investors took profits in an overbought market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The summer 2025 wave of COVID-19 appears to be starting, with the CDC estimating that cases are now likely on the rise in half of all U.S. states. The uptick is most pronounced in the Southeast, Southern, and West Coast states, with the Pacific Northwest and Southeast seeing the highest rates of COVID-related emergency room visits since February. While national activity is still considered "low," it has increased from "very low" in the previous week. A recent CDC analysis concluded the virus has settled into a biannual surge pattern, driven by cyclical genetic changes in its spike protein.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals with low incomes struggling with debt, several relief options can provide a path to financial stability. This article details four strategies designed for those in tight financial situations. These include nonprofit credit counseling and debt management plans, which can lower interest rates and create a structured payoff schedule. Another option is credit card debt forgiveness, or debt settlement, where a lump-sum payment is negotiated to clear a reduced balance. Additionally, many lenders offer temporary hardship programs, and for overwhelming debt, Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy may be the most effective solution. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Missouri's Republican governor, Mike Kehoe, has signed a bill repealing a paid sick leave law that was approved by state voters in a ballot measure just eight months ago. The original law guaranteed workers one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked. Business groups, who labeled the mandate a "job killer," lauded the repeal, while workers' rights advocates called it a "betrayal" to families who supported the measure. Advocates have already submitted a new proposal to reinstate the benefits via a constitutional amendment, which would prevent the legislature from overturning it again without another public vote.</p>

          <p>GP surgeries across 15 regions in England are piloting a new project aimed at reducing long-term sickness absence by offering patients support to return to work. The "WorkWell" initiative provides funding for career coaches or occupational therapists who can give advice, refer patients to exercise classes, or help with job-seeking skills. The goal is to shift the focus from simply signing patients off as "not fit for work" to creating a proactive plan for their recovery and re-entry into the workplace. The program is part of a wider government effort to address the 2.8 million people currently out of the workforce due to health conditions.</p>

This public rejection follows reports that the U.S. is urging several African nations to accept such individuals under threat of tariffs and visa restrictions. The announcement comes as the U.S. imposed new, stricter visa rules on citizens from Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Cameroon, a move Nigerian officials believe is linked to their refusal to comply with migration demands.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise new album titled "Swag," his first full-length project in four years, but it has been met with lukewarm reviews from music critics. While some praised its nostalgic, alt-R&B sound, others described it as an "uncomfortable cry for help" and criticized its lyrical content and spoken-word interludes. The album features collaborations with several rappers and seems to address recent public speculation about his personal life and mental health. The mixed reception suggests the album may not be the triumphant return some fans were hoping for from the pop superstar.</p>

The complaint alleged that Lowe had failed to properly register donations raised via a crowdfunder.

Lowe described the complaint as a "malicious attempt" to undermine his inquiry, which has raised over £600,000 to investigate gang-based sexual exploitation in the UK.</p>
