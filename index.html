          <p>Tadej Pogacar is poised to win his fourth Tour de France, having maintained his overall lead through the penultimate stage of the race. Australian sprinter Kaden Groves secured his first-ever Tour stage victory after a bold solo attack with 16 kilometers remaining, completing his personal trilogy of stage wins across all three Grand Tour cycling races. Pogacar finished safely within the main group of riders, known as the peloton, and is not expected to be challenged during the final processional stage into Paris. The victory was an emotional one for Groves, who triumphed despite challenging rainy conditions that caused crashes for other riders.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for Venezuelan men deported by the U.S. to El Salvador's notorious Cecot mega-prison allege their clients endured state-sanctioned torture. Freed detainees are now sharing detailed testimonies of their experiences, which include severe beatings, humiliation by guards, and being shot with rubber bullets. The accounts describe inhumane conditions such as limited food, dirty water, and constant light, painting a grim picture of the facility that human rights groups say is designed to disappear people. This article highlights the severe psychological and physical trauma inflicted upon individuals who were never convicted of a crime in the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An aid distribution in Gaza designated as 'women only' to ensure safety ended in tragedy, with at least two women killed by gunfire. Witnesses described a chaotic scene where private security contractors and Israeli troops used pepper spray and stun grenades on the crowd before shots were fired. The incident highlights the extreme dangers Palestinians face while trying to access humanitarian supplies, with the UN reporting over 1,000 have been killed near aid points since May. The Israel Defense Forces stated it fired 'warning shots' at suspects who posed a threat hundreds of meters from the site before it opened, and was unaware of casualties.</p>

          <p>The Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), a body established by the Trump administration, is reportedly utilizing an artificial intelligence tool to identify federal regulations for elimination. According to internal documents, the 'Doge AI Deregulation Decision Tool' is analyzing 200,000 regulations with the goal of cutting half of them within a year of a potential second inauguration. The initiative aligns with Donald Trump's campaign promise for an aggressive reduction in government rules, which he claims drive up costs. While the White House confirms that various options are being explored for deregulation, it states that no single plan has been finalized yet.</p>

          <p>The arrest of Varna's reformist mayor, Blagomir Kotsev, has triggered protests across Bulgaria, with citizens expressing alarm over what they see as the weaponization of the justice system for political purposes. Kotsev, a member of the pro-European PP party, was accused of running a criminal extortion group, but critics claim the charges are politically motivated by the ruling conservative GERB party. Protesters and political scientists warn that these actions represent a serious threat to Bulgarian democracy and an abuse of power to suppress opposition.

          <p>Media analyst Tom Rogers, previously a strong supporter of Netflix, has revised his outlook, citing growing concerns about the streaming giant's long-term engagement. He points to increasing competition from free content on platforms like YouTube, which is gaining a larger share of total TV viewership. While Netflix's recent earnings were positive, Rogers notes a decline in viewing time per subscriber, a critical metric for driving price increases and funding new programming. He also suggests that while AI will help Netflix, it will also empower independent creators on YouTube, potentially intensifying the competitive pressure on the streaming service.

These 'Wolbitos' are bred by the nonprofit World Mosquito Program to carry Wolbachia, a naturally occurring bacteria that prevents the dengue virus from replicating inside the insect, thus stopping its transmission to humans. A pilot program in the city of Niterói resulted in a roughly 90% drop in dengue cases. The Brazilian government is now scaling up the project, building a massive new factory to produce billions of these 'good mosquitoes' for release across the country.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced that Britain is actively working with Jordan to facilitate airdrops of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The move comes as Israel agreed to allow such deliveries amid growing international alarm over the humanitarian catastrophe in the territory. This effort is complemented by plans to evacuate critically ill children from Gaza for medical treatment in the UK. The announcement coincides with increasing pressure on the British government to officially recognize a Palestinian state, with over 200 MPs signing a letter advocating for the move as a vital step toward a two-state solution.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by Bankrate has ranked the worst states in the U.S. for retirement, with Louisiana, Texas, and Oklahoma topping the list. The study evaluated all 50 states based on key factors like affordability, healthcare quality, weather, and safety, with six of the bottom ten states located in the South. Weather, particularly the risk of natural disasters like hurricanes, significantly lowered the scores for states such as Texas and Florida. The report advises that while these rankings are a useful guide, personal preferences, such as proximity to family, should ultimately drive an individual's decision. (not investment advice)</p>

While Israel's intelligence agency has not officially confirmed its connection to the account, the page has been active in posting satirical and investigative content targeting the Iranian regime.

          <p>In a significant recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected an attempt to oust two dozen lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to shift the balance of power in the legislature where an opposition coalition currently holds a majority. The failure of the recall effort means President Lai Ching-te's administration will likely continue to face strong legislative resistance to its agenda. The KMT framed the recall as political retaliation, while supporters of the recall were angered by the opposition's blocking of key legislation.</p>

In June, 15% of homes that went under contract fell through, the highest rate for that month since 2017.
