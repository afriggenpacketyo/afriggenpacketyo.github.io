          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Mortgage rates have spiked to 7.1%, the highest since mid-February, influenced by President Trump's tariff announcements and subsequent bond market reactions. Despite a cooler inflation report, bond yields increased, mirroring the yield on the 10-year Treasury. Consumer sentiment has also dropped significantly, with inflation expectations reaching levels unseen since 1981. This development is particularly concerning given its timing within the spring housing market, with economists predicting further weakness in housing due to rising rates and consumer anxieties.

            <p>The Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that the Trump administration must attempt to return a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. The government conceded the deportation was an "administrative error" but alleges Garcia is an MS-13 gang member, which his lawyer denies. A lower court ordered the government to facilitate Garcia's return, and the Supreme Court upheld this directive, while also noting that the lower court may have exceeded its authority. The Justice Department has struggled to provide information about Garcia's whereabouts, leading to tense court hearings.</p>

GM attributes the decision to market demand and inventory rebalancing, explicitly stating it's unrelated to President Trump's tariffs.

            <p>President Trump's strategy of using unpredictability and tariffs as negotiating leverage is causing significant damage to the U.S. economy and its global reputation. Investors are reacting negatively to the implementation of chaotic and impulsive tariffs, leading to a flight from U.S. bonds and currency. This has resulted in rising interest rates and increased risk of a financial crisis, as the U.S. is no longer seen as a stable and reliable economic actor. While Trump may aim for "big, beautiful deals," his current approach is inflicting grave and potentially long-lasting harm.</p>

            <p>The stock market initially reacted with uncertainty to China's announcement of increased tariffs on U.S. goods, before gaining momentum. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all saw gains, despite China's retaliatory measures. Investors are closely monitoring the escalating trade war between the U.S. and China, with some analysts raising concerns about a potential recession. However, recent economic data and a pause in tariffs by President Trump have provided some relief. (not investment advice)</p>

The DOJ argued that the deadline was "impracticable," given the timing of the Supreme Court's decision.

            <p>Allergy season is becoming longer and more intense due to climate change, leading to a rise in pollen allergies and other environmental threats. Warmer temperatures are causing stinging and biting insects to spread to new areas and increase in numbers, resulting in more frequent and severe allergic reactions. Insect allergies, while less common than pollen sensitivities, can cause deadly complications and are often understudied and misdiagnosed. Climate change is exacerbating these issues, making it essential to reduce fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
