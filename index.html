          <p>A federal judge in Texas has ordered the release of a Venezuelan couple, Julio Cesar Sanchez-Puentes and Luddis Norelia Sanchez-Garc√≠a, who were granted Temporary Protected Status in 2024, criticizing the government's attempt to deport them under the Alien Enemies Act. Judge David Briones, a Clinton appointee, accused the government of lacking meaningful evidence to support claims that the couple were gang members, despite ICE officials alleging the wife's ex-husband was affiliated. The couple's lawyers emphasized the potential life sentence Cesar could have faced in El Salvador had ICE succeeded. Judge Leonie Brinkema also previously criticized the government's evidence in the case, highlighting the legal challenges the administration faces regarding immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military launched an airstrike on Beirut's southern suburbs, targeting what it claimed was a Hezbollah storage site for precision-guided missiles, marking the first such attack in almost a month. The Lebanese presidency condemned the strike, urging the U.S. and France to intervene and halt Israeli attacks, while the UN expressed concern over renewed violence. Israel stated the missile storage violated understandings and posed a threat, vowing to prevent Hezbollah from growing stronger, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office stated. Western officials have accused Israel of multiple truce violations, including airstrikes and drone surveillance, despite Hezbollah largely complying with the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>President Trump's approval ratings are declining as he approaches his first 100 days in office, with recent polls indicating that a majority of Americans disapprove of his handling of the presidency. His approval ratings, ranging from 39% to 45% across three surveys, are the lowest for any newly elected president at this milestone in over seven decades. These ratings mark a significant shift from the start of his term in January, when Trump experienced an increase in favorability. The polls reflect growing skepticism among Americans regarding Trump's sweeping actions to transform the government.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two 18th-century shipwrecks found off the coast of Costa Rica have been identified as Danish slave ships, Fridericus Quartus and Christianus Quintus, which sank in 1710. Investigations of ship timbers, bricks, and clay pipes confirmed the ships' identities, resolving a long-standing mystery as they were previously mistaken for pirate vessels. Marine archaeologists from Denmark's National Museum conducted underwater excavations, finding evidence that aligned with historical accounts, including charred timbers from Fridericus Quartus. The discovery sheds light on Denmark's role in the transatlantic slave trade, which the country banned in 1792, though slavery wasn't abolished until 1847.</p>

Mantashe criticized South African citizens who have appealed to Trump to "punish" the country, while tensions have also surfaced on Elon Musk's X platform regarding ownership laws.

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that President Trump's first 100 days in office are perceived as bringing significant changes, but with growing concerns over tariffs and their impact on prices. While Trump maintains support from his base, a majority of Americans believe he is focusing too much on tariffs and not enough on lowering prices, negatively affecting his economic approval ratings. The poll also highlights divisions in views on immigration, deportation, and the role of government. Democrats express frustration with their party's response to the Trump administration, while Republicans are largely satisfied with the changes.</p>

          <p>A new ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll reveals that President Trump has the lowest 100-day job approval rating of any president in the past 80 years. The poll cites public disapproval of many of his policies and widespread economic discontent, including recession fears. Despite this, Trump outperforms Democrats in Congress regarding trust to address national problems. The poll also highlights negative views on the economy, tariffs, and concerns about Trump's expansion of presidential powers and respect for the rule of law, yet he maintains strong support from his base.</p>

          <p>Dividend stocks are becoming more attractive to investors amidst increasing volatility in both the stock and bond markets. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on dividend stocks, such as Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF and Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF, are popular options. Actively managed dividend ETFs, like the T. Rowe Dividend Growth ETF, aim to identify higher-quality dividend payers for a mix of capital appreciation and yield. While some dividend funds have tech exposure, investors can find options that limit tech overweighting. These funds appeal to retirees seeking income and to investors seeking a balance between growth and yield in a volatile market. (not investment advice)</p>
