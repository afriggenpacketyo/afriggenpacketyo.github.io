            <p>Former President Donald Trump has once again urged the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, even suggesting the "termination" of Chairman Jerome Powell. Trump criticized Powell's handling of monetary policy, contrasting it with the European Central Bank's rate cuts. These comments followed a speech by Powell in which he addressed the challenges posed by the administration's tariffs. Trump's remarks have previously drawn attention to the potential conflict between taming inflation and boosting economic growth, particularly in light of trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is exploring the possibility of detaining U.S. citizens involved in criminal activity and sending them to prisons in El Salvador, raising constitutional concerns. Meanwhile, a U.S. District Judge ruled that the Trump administration showed "willful disregard" for a court order regarding deportation flights to El Salvador. Despite economic gloom, retail sales jumped sharply last month as people bought goods ahead of Trump's new tariffs. This surge in spending may lead to reduced spending in the coming months as consumers adjust to the higher costs.</p>

While colossal squid can grow to be enormous, the squid filmed was a juvenile, measuring around 11 inches long.

            <p>Amid rising tensions between the U.S. and China, Chinese students are rethinking their plans to study in the United States due to increased visa risks. Reports have emerged of hundreds of international students having their visas revoked and facing potential deportation. Chinese authorities have issued warnings to people planning to travel or study in America due to the deterioration of Sino-US economic and trade relations. This has led to some Chinese parents shifting their children's preparations from U.S.-focused curricula to European alternatives.</p>

            <p>Dozens of Democratic lawmakers are raising concerns that President Trump's tariff-heavy trade agenda is starting to resemble a "corrupt scheme to enrich administration officials and those loyal to them." They argue that the administration's rollout of tariffs is "rife with opportunities to unduly influence President Trump and other administration officials." The lawmakers have sent a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer requesting details on the administration's plans to prevent the misuse of tariffs for self-dealing.</p>

            <p>The proposed listing of monarch butterflies under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) is now uncertain with the return of the Trump administration. Scientists have linked the staggering decline in monarch populations to the destruction of grasslands, insecticides, and drought caused by climate change. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, a government agency that oversees the ESA, proposed to list monarchs as threatened, a formal designation meaning they’re likely to soon become at risk of extinction. Experts worry that conservatives in Congress who want to weaken the Endangered Species Act will use that argument to try and strip down the law.</p>

            <p>American winemakers are expressing concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariffs on the European Union, despite the potential for increased domestic wine sales. The winemakers fear that the costs of essential materials like glass bottles, corks, and barrels will increase, damaging the wine supply chain. Concerns also exist regarding the chilling effect on distributors who rely on importing and selling wine from Europe. The Wine Institute stated that the tariffs will hurt the broader wine sector, including farmers, vintners, distributors, retailers and the millions of people working across the extended wine supply chain.</p>
