          <p>During a rare presidential visit to the Federal Reserve, Donald Trump publicly disputed the cost of building renovations with Chairman Jerome Powell. Trump, citing a document, claimed a project was significantly over budget, a charge Powell immediately refuted by clarifying the figures included a separate, older building. The tense exchange occurred amid Trump's ongoing public criticism of Powell and the Fed's interest rate policies. This visit highlights the continued political pressure being exerted on the traditionally independent U.S. central bank.</p>

          <p>Christina Marie Chapman, an Arizona woman, has been sentenced to 102 months in prison for her central role in a major international fraud scheme. She assisted North Korean IT workers in obtaining remote jobs at over 300 U.S. companies by using the stolen identities of 68 American citizens. The operation generated more than $17 million, with a portion of the funds benefiting the North Korean government's illicit weapons program. Chapman managed and distributed company-issued laptops from her home, creating a logistical hub for the elaborate conspiracy.</p>

          <p>A DACA recipient, Erick Hernandez-Rodriguez, is being detained and faces deportation to El Salvador after he made a wrong turn and accidentally drove into Mexico. While attempting to return to the U.S. minutes later, he was arrested by border officials who claimed he had "self-deported." Hernandez-Rodriguez, who has lived in the U.S. since he was a teen and has a pregnant wife in California, alleges officials tried to solicit a bribe from him. His case underscores the precarious situation for DACA recipients under strict immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>The mountain village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, experienced severe flash flooding following another bout of heavy rainfall, necessitating multiple water rescues of trapped individuals. The area is particularly vulnerable due to extensive burn scars from past wildfires that have stripped the landscape of vegetation, hindering water absorption. This event follows a massive flood less than three weeks prior that resulted in three fatalities and widespread property damage. Social media videos showed muddy torrents destroying property and forcing road closures as authorities worked to manage the ongoing crisis.</p>

Releasing such materials faces significant legal barriers, particularly the secrecy of grand jury testimony, which is only unsealed by a judge in exceptional circumstances. Furthermore, the FBI rarely discloses evidence that is not part of a criminal indictment to protect individual privacy and ongoing investigations.

          <p>The 2026 U.S. Senate race in North Carolina is taking shape, as Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley and former Democratic Governor Roy Cooper both plan to run. Whatley is expected to announce his campaign shortly and has reportedly received President Trump's endorsement, especially after Lara Trump confirmed she would not be running. On the Democratic side, Cooper, a popular former two-term governor, is anticipated to launch his bid next week. The contest to fill the seat of retiring Republican Senator Thom Tillis is expected to be a major national battleground.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has agreed to a settlement with the Trump administration to restore hundreds of millions in federal research funding that was frozen earlier this year. The administration had accused the university of permitting antisemitism on campus following pro-Palestinian protests. The deal requires Columbia to pay $221 million and make concessions regarding DEI programs and international student admissions. This agreement is part of a broader pattern of the administration targeting major U.S. institutions, raising concerns about the use of federal power to compel compliance.</p>

          <p>A judge in Ontario has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room in 2018. The judge, in her ruling, said she did not find the complainant's evidence to be "credible or reliable." The high-profile case, which has been closely followed across Canada, centered on the issue of consent, as the defense contended the woman had agreed to all sexual acts. The woman had testified that she was intoxicated and fearful, and did not consent to the acts that followed an initial consensual encounter.</p>
