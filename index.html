          <p>The Trump administration has cut off new federal grants to Harvard University, alleging antisemitism and criticizing its diversity policies, a move Harvard is contesting as illegal government overreach. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated Harvard failed its legal obligations and won't receive new grants until it demonstrates responsible management. This action follows protests at universities, including Harvard, regarding divestment from Israel, which Trump labeled as pro-Hamas. Harvard, with a $53 billion endowment, argues the administration's demands impose unprecedented control and stifle research, vowing to defend against this overreach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested a judge to dismiss a lawsuit from Idaho, Kansas, and Missouri that seeks to limit telehealth access to mifepristone, an abortion drug. The Justice Department attorneys argue that the states lack legal standing to sue, maintaining the course charted by the Biden administration. The lawsuit challenges FDA actions from 2016 that loosened restrictions on mifepristone, arguing it undermines state abortion laws. While abortion is banned in Idaho, it's legal with restrictions in Kansas and Missouri after recent constitutional amendments. Trump has stated abortion should be a state issue, emphasizing his Supreme Court appointments.</p>

          <p>El Salvador President Nayib Bukele ordered the arrest of five bus company heads after they allegedly defied his order to provide free transport for a week due to highway construction. Bukele accused them of sabotaging the country, claiming the government would cover their usual daily income, though this is unverified. The arrested men face charges of breach of duty, denial of assistance, and extortion, sparking surprise from the National Transportation Committee. This action highlights Bukele's authoritarian tactics, which have drawn criticism for undermining democratic institutions and due process, especially amid a state of emergency declared in 2022 to combat gangs.</p>

          <p>According to this New York Times article, Gaza is facing a full-blown humanitarian emergency, exacerbated by Israel's ongoing blockade of aid and commercial supplies. Two million Palestinians are surviving on minimal meals, and makeshift clinics report alarming signs of starvation. The article asserts that Israel is exploiting aid as a tool of war, deliberately delaying and denying access, which violates international law. The author calls for immediate resumption of humanitarian aid, open and secure corridors, and a political agreement guaranteeing Palestinian presence, security, and self-determination. Ultimately, sustainable peace is built through dignity, freedom, opportunity, and mutual security, not through domination and starvation.</p>

          <p>According to this New York Times article, President Xi Jinping's order for his forces to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027 faces uncertainty due to an ongoing purge of top military officials. Over the past two years, several high-ranking officers, including defense ministers and leaders of the Rocket Force, have been removed from their positions. The article suggests that this internal turmoil raises concerns about the competence and reliability of Xi's commanders, potentially weakening his appetite for war. While China's military has made significant advancements, battlefield leadership and experience remain crucial, and the lack of trust within the ranks poses a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>Tourists visiting Alcatraz Island expressed shock and disbelief at Donald Trump's proposal to reopen the former federal prison, with many calling the idea "insane" and unfeasible. Visitors highlighted the island's history as a symbol of Indigenous resistance and a place for reflection on justice. Concerns were raised about the high costs of operating the prison and the potential erasure of the island's cultural significance. While some believed Trump would follow through, most dismissed the plan as a publicity stunt, emphasizing the island's current role as a national monument and tourist destination.</p>

          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG will pay nearly $511 million after pleading guilty to conspiring with wealthy American taxpayers to hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts. This plea comes after Credit Suisse violated a 2014 plea agreement and allowed clients to evade U.S. tax obligations from 2010 through 2021. The Department of Justice said that Credit Suisse and UBS are required to cooperate fully with ongoing investigations and disclose any information regarding U.S.-related accounts. The case involves falsifying bank records and concealing U.S. ownership of accounts, resulting in a tax loss of over $71 million to the United States.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to close a tariff loophole is expected to significantly impact shipping companies like UPS and FedEx, which have benefited from a surge in inexpensive goods from China. The de minimis exemption, which allowed goods worth $800 or less to enter the U.S. without tariffs, has been eliminated for imports from mainland China and Hong Kong. This change could lead to a decline in revenue for logistics companies and airlines, though some companies may adapt by shifting their focus to other markets.

          <p>More than 1,000 GP surgeries in England will receive a share of £102 million to expand and modernize their facilities. The funding aims to create additional space for doctors to see more patients and is described as the biggest public investment in facilities for five years. Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the investment is possible due to necessary budget decisions and will help tackle long waiting times. The funding aims to improve patient satisfaction with GP services, which has declined since the pandemic due to fewer in-person appointments.</p>

          <p>Sen. Chuck Schumer is demanding a full inspector general investigation into the FAA, citing a "mess" at Newark Airport and across the East Coast. The airport has experienced significant delays and cancellations due to air traffic controller shortages, equipment outages, and runway construction. Schumer points to a nationwide shortage of air traffic controllers, cuts at the FAA, old technology, and depleted federal funds as contributing factors. United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights a day at Newark due to the disruptions. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy plans to release details of a new plan to revamp the air traffic control system this week.</p>

          <p>Major delays and cancellations at Newark Liberty International Airport are attributed to air traffic control staffing shortages, equipment malfunctions, and runway construction. The FAA has instituted ground delays and stops due to these issues, affecting flights across the country. A shortage of controllers in Philadelphia, where the air traffic control center for Newark is based, has reduced the facility's ability to manage air traffic. United Airlines has canceled 35 flights per day from Newark due to the ongoing disruptions. Lawmakers are calling for an investigation into the FAA to address these critical issues.</p>

This undermines Trump's rationale for using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to El Salvador.
