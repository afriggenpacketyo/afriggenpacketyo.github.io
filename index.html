          <p>Donald Trump's promise of a US economic "golden age" is off to a rocky start, with GDP shrinking in the first quarter. Trump attributes any negative indicators to his predecessor, Joe Biden, while taking credit for positive reports. The article highlights that the new administration's trade policies, particularly tariffs, have created confusion and uncertainty for businesses. The erratic implementation of tariffs has disrupted supply chains and impacted consumer confidence, potentially setting the stage for an economic downturn, according to economists.

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election amidst economic challenges and a volatile international landscape. Voters are primarily concerned with the rising cost of living and housing affordability, overshadowing global issues stemming from Washington. Both major parties have offered limited solutions to address these economic pressures. The opposition leader's attempts to emulate Trump's rhetoric have not resonated well with voters. This New York Times article emphasizes a shift away from major parties towards independent candidates, reflecting a broader dissatisfaction with the current political offerings.</p>

          <p>Over 80 people have died in Syria following violence sparked by an audio recording deemed blasphemous by some Muslims. The violence spread through Druze-majority areas, leading to armed clashes and intervention by Syrian government forces.

Israel's military actions in Syria, purportedly to protect the Druze, are exacerbating the situation, according to analysts.

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Tim Friede's blood contains antibodies that protect against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes. Current antivenoms are species-specific, but Friede's mission could lead to a universal antivenom. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that, combined with a drug, protected mice from fatal doses of 13 of 19 deadly snake species.</p>

The museum recorded only 2.87 million visitors in 2024, with South Korea and Japan being the largest overseas groups.

          <p>The elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods entering the US is impacting advertising revenue for Meta, Alphabet, and other platforms. Temu and Shein, known for low-cost items from Chinese factories, heavily advertised online. President Trump ended the exemption, subjecting these companies to tariffs. Temu has stopped shipping directly from China, transitioning to local warehouses.
