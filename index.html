          <p>A group of British parents who believe social media contributed to their children's deaths traveled to New York to urge tech companies to implement better online safety protections for children, following a similar push from UK regulator Ofcom. They are calling for websites to block harmful content and introduce rigorous age checks. The parents have filed lawsuits against TikTok, accusing the platform of promoting dangerous challenges and pranks to children. Meta claims to share the goal of keeping teens safe online and has recently introduced 'teen accounts' with enhanced protections. Social media accounts could provide evidence needed to understand the challenges children face online.</p>

          <p>Bristol Myers Squibb reported better-than-expected first-quarter results and increased its revenue and profit outlook for 2025, driven by strong performance of newer drugs and better-than-anticipated sales from older medications.

CEO Christopher Boerner acknowledged uncertainty related to potential tariffs and economic factors, but expressed confidence in the company's ability to deliver results.

          <p>Germany's economy faces significant headwinds, including potential disruption from Trump's tariffs, which are expected to grind the country's economic growth to a halt. Economists warn that unless Germany addresses underlying structural issues such as burdensome bureaucracy, high corporate tax rates, and soaring energy prices, even increased government spending may not provide relief. Germany is also facing a shrinking workforce and rising anti-immigrant sentiment, which makes it difficult to attract skilled foreign workers. Many companies have scaled back their growth outlook as they digest the 10 percent blanket tariff on goods exported to the United States.</p>

Industry executives stress the importance of responsible technology use and ensuring safety is not compromised for cost reductions.

          <p>The Trump administration is considering investing in companies that mine and process critical minerals to reduce U.S. dependence on imports from countries like China, according to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.

          <p>The general manager of the McVitie's factory in Stockport, where chocolate digestives have been made for 100 years, claims that people have been eating them incorrectly. According to Anthony Coulson, the biscuit was originally intended to be eaten with the chocolate-covered side facing down. Coulson admits to being a chocolate-on-top man himself, despite the company's claim that the chocolate coats the underside of the plain biscuit as it passes through a "chocolate reservoir".</p>
