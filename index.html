        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Powerball jackpot for Saturday's drawing soared to an estimated $700 million, marking the largest prize of the year, following 36 consecutive rounds without a grand prize winner since May 31. The winning numbers announced were 11, 14, 34, 47, 51, and the red Powerball 18. While no one claimed the top prize, several participants secured substantial smaller winnings, including a Tennessee player who matched five numbers with the Power Play option for $2 million, and two others who won $1 million each. The potential grand prize winner faces a choice between a full jackpot paid in annual installments over 29 years or a one-time cash option of $316.3 million before taxes, underscoring the life-changing opportunity presented by this lottery.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand has developed in the Atlantic Ocean, situated southeast of Bermuda, marking the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. This follows Hurricane Erin, which formed in a similar region earlier in August. As of Saturday night, Fernand was located approximately 325 miles southeast of Bermuda, sustaining winds of 40 mph and moving north-northeast. Forecasters from the National Hurricane Center anticipate the storm will strengthen over the weekend, possibly becoming a hurricane by Monday, before weakening on Tuesday. It is expected to remain over open ocean waters, passing well east of Bermuda, and currently poses no major threat to the U.S. coast.</p>

Despite a US immigration judge's 2019 order protecting him from deportation to El Salvador due to a "well-founded fear" of gang persecution, and his return to the US after a Supreme Court order, he was subsequently arrested on human smuggling charges. The latest development saw Ice demanding he report for deportation to Uganda, intensifying the legal battle and drawing criticism from human rights advocates.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock plummeted by 7.2%, shedding nearly $100 million in market value, after the company unveiled a new, simplified logo. The redesign removes the iconic overall-clad man, "Uncle Herschel," a figure long associated with the chain's traditional country store image, in favor of a cleaner wordmark. This change is part of CEO Julie Felss Masino's strategy to modernize the 55-year-old brand, which she described as "not as relevant as we once were." The move has drawn criticism from conservative commentators and marketing experts, with some on social media labeling it "woke" and questioning its impact on the brand's loyal customer base.</p>

The incident, which Pyongyang labeled a "premeditated and deliberate provocation," coincides with ongoing joint military exercises between the United States and South Korea.

          <p>The UK government is planning a major overhaul of its asylum appeals system, aiming to accelerate case hearings and reduce the reliance on hotels for asylum seekers. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the establishment of a new, independent body with adjudicators to process the 51,000 pending appeals, which currently take over a year on average. This initiative comes amid increasing pressure and public protests against the use of hotels, including a High Court ruling in Epping that blocked housing asylum seekers in a local hotel due to planning breaches and public safety concerns. The government is committed to closing all asylum hotels in a managed way, but faces challenges and legal actions from various councils.</p>

The visit also included a bilateral meeting, but the fishing incident drew attention, with Vance jokingly noting that Lammy failed to catch any fish while his children did.

The phenomenon, reportedly initiated by groups like the "Weoley Warriors," began in response to a school incident where a girl was prevented from wearing a Union Jack dress. While supporters claim it's about "love, unity, and patriotism," critics express discomfort, fearing associations with far-right movements and xenophobia, especially as flags have featured in protests against asylum seeker housing. This widespread display reflects a complex relationship with national symbols and a broader sense of public disillusionment.</p>

However, art historian Konstantin Akinsha notes a lack of documentation from Malevich's lifetime, and the art historian who authenticated them has a history of validating disputed works and false affiliations with auction houses.

While the White House states no formal policy change, the decision comes amid concerns over depleting US munition stocks and Trump's past criticism of escalating the war.

          <p>The UK Parliament's e-petitions system celebrates its 10th anniversary, prompting reflection on its effectiveness in influencing government policy. While some historical petitions led to significant civil rights advances, modern digital petitions often feature a mix of serious calls for change and humorous, tongue-in-cheek campaigns. The system allows petitions with over 100,000 signatures to be debated by MPs, a process that can pressure ministers but rarely guarantees government action. Despite criticisms of it being a "dead end" by some, the system is defended as a vital "bridge between the public and Parliament," demonstrating that "democracy does not end at the ballot box," as seen with "Finn's Law" success.</p>

          <p>A growing trend sees young adults, some as young as 23, opting for "preventative botox" to stave off wrinkles, a practice supported by some like Sydney Brown, whose plastic surgeon mother administers her injections. Users believe these treatments delay deeper lines and boost confidence, with botox procedures globally increasing among 18-34 year olds. However, experts like Nora Nugent of BAAPS caution against starting too early, calling it a "waste of money" and potentially leading to altered expressions or tolerance buildup. Concerns also rise about social media pressure and the mental health implications for young people, emphasizing the need for accredited practitioners and a focus on self-acceptance beyond appearance.</p>

          <p>The Texas Senate has passed a contentious GOP redistricting bill, which Governor Greg Abbott has pledged to sign swiftly into law. This Republican-backed proposal aims to redraw the state's congressional map, creating five new GOP-leaning districts to bolster the party's majority ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, a move supported by former President Donald Trump. Democrats vehemently oppose the plan, vowing legal challenges, arguing it dilutes minority voting power and undermines fair representation. The bill's passage follows a weekslong standoff where Texas House Democrats fled the state to deny a quorum, and it has spurred a nationwide political boundaries fight, including a counter-redistricting plan in California.</p>

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) declared famine, likely to spread without a halt to fighting and aid restrictions, intensifying global pressure on Israel. Israel dismissed the famine declaration as "lies" and continues preparations for a Gaza City offensive, where ground troops are already active. Efforts for a ceasefire remain stalled as mediators await Israel's response to a Hamas proposal, while the humanitarian crisis deepens and the death toll rises, further complicating the conflict.</p>

          <p>Lt. General Jeffrey Kruse has been removed as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), a move that has sparked concerns among intelligence committee leaders and DIA employees about the politicization of their work. The ousting follows a DIA assessment that military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities set back Tehran's program by months, contradicting President Trump's claim of "total obliteration." Senator Mark Warner criticized the Trump administration's "dangerous habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test." Two other military officials were also removed without consultation from senior military leadership, leading to widespread loss of faith within the agency.</p>

          <p>The United States immigrant population has decreased by over a million people since Donald Trump took office in January, falling from a record 53.3 million to 51.9 million by June. This decline, representing a drop from 15.8% to 15.4% of all US residents, is attributed to the Trump administration's extensive crackdown on immigration, including 181 executive actions targeting new arrivals and mass deportations. A Pew Research Center study highlights the impact of these policies, which also saw 750,000 immigrant workers leave the labor force. The article reveals a significant shift in immigration trends, contrasting with over 50 years of growth and raising concerns about enforcement practices.</p>

          <p>A male killer whale, Keijo, at the closed Marineland Antibes zoo is being sexually stimulated by trainers to prevent inbreeding with his mother, Wikie, due to an ongoing stalemate over their rehoming. The French facility closed ahead of a December law banning whales in shows, but the government, managers, and activists disagree on a new home. Footage obtained by TideBreakers showed trainers stimulating Keijo, who is reaching adolescence, with managers stating it's necessary to relieve sexual tensions and avoid injury from fighting. Animal rights groups criticize the practice as a "perverse new low," while concerns about the orcas' welfare and the slow rehoming process continue to mount.</p>

While promoted as a boost to North Korea's tourism ambitions, international tourism was paused due to COVID-19 and remains highly restricted, with only Russian groups currently permitted. The resort's construction has faced human rights criticisms regarding worker treatment, and experts note Pyongyang's deliberate limits on foreign visitors to prevent unfavorable comparisons with local living standards.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered a halt to the nearly complete Revolution Wind farm off the coasts of Rhode Island and Connecticut, sparking outrage from Democratic governors and environmental advocates. The US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management cited unspecified "national security interests" for reviewing the project, which was 80% finished and set to power over 350,000 homes. This decision follows President Trump's directive to reconsider existing wind energy leases and aligns with his long-standing opposition to wind power, which he has called "the scam of the century." Critics, including Senator Chris Murphy, accuse the administration of corruption, linking the move to alleged regulatory favors for the oil industry.</p>

The findings from Keeladi suggest an independent urban civilization in southern India dating back to 580BC, challenging traditional narratives focused on the north.

This "erroneous" release sparked anger and accusations of creating a "spectacle" from the brothers' attorney, who argued it compromised a fair hearing.

Representatives Ro Khanna and Summer Lee accused the DOJ of "stonewalling" and demanded the full release of files, particularly communications between former Biden administration officials and the DOJ, sought by Trump supporters for transparency. The "only new disclosure" amounted to fewer than 1,000 pages of Customs and Border Protection flight logs for Epstein's plane. The committee plans to publicly release the documents after reviewing them for victim identities and sensitive matters, amidst accusations of the DOJ trying to distract from a "White House cover-up."</p>

          <p>Several major European parcel companies, including DHL and national post offices, are temporarily suspending some shipments to the US. This action is a direct response to a new Trump administration executive order, effective August 29, which eliminates the "de minimis" rule that allowed packages under $800 to enter the US duty-free. The companies cite ambiguous policies and insufficient time to establish new logistics for customs duty collection and data transmission as the primary reasons for the pause. While the rule aims to increase tariff revenue and prevent illicit goods, the disruption highlights the significant impact of sudden policy changes on international trade and logistics.</p>

          <p>Russia's economy is reportedly on the brink of recession, facing a disastrous harvest and plummeting fossil fuel revenues. Grain exports in July hit a 2008 low due to unseasonable frost, record heat, and drought, with total production expected to fall 18% from 2022. This reveals "structural fragility" in Russia's war economy, which relies heavily on fiscal buffers and fossil fuels. The Kremlin's oil and gas revenue dropped 27% year-over-year in July, leading to widening budget deficits and a significant depletion of its National Wealth Fund from $135 billion to $35 billion. Experts suggest these economic pressures could encumber Russia's war effort, although it may not immediately compel Vladimir Putin to seek peace. (not investment advice)</p>
