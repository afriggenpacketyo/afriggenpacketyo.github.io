          <p>A meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, has been identified as being older than Earth itself. Researchers from the University of Georgia analyzed fragments and determined it to be a chondrite meteorite, approximately 4.5 billion years old. The event, which caused a loud boom across the state, marks the 27th meteorite recovery in Georgia. Scientists hope to use data from this event to better understand and guard against the threat of future asteroid impacts.</p>

The show's hosts strongly advised against this plan, arguing that it would involve taking on new debt for a depreciating asset. Instead, they recommended the "debt snowball" method, urging the couple to leverage their six-figure combined income and low rent to aggressively pay off the debt within a few years.

          <p>In the Russian-occupied Luhansk region of Ukraine, residents like Oksana from Novoaidar report severe economic struggles, with insufficient income and soaring food prices. Many rely on bartering and Ukrainian pensions accessed via VPNs to survive, as local jobs are scarce and basic services like power and internet are unreliable. The occupying authorities are increasing pressure on residents to accept Russian citizenship to access services like healthcare, while also making them eligible for military conscription. Despite the hardships, many residents intend to remain, hoping for a return to their previous lives.</p>

          <p>When 32-year-old nurse Alexandra Pennig was found dead from a gunshot in her St. Paul apartment, her companion Matthew Ecker claimed it was a suicide. However, detectives grew suspicious due to inconsistencies, such as a dry sink where Ecker claimed to have washed his hands. The crucial piece of evidence was a small metal part of the bathroom door lock found under Pennig's body, indicating the door was forced open before she was shot. This discovery led to Ecker's conviction for second-degree murder and a 30-year sentence.</p>

          <p>Actress Lindsay Lohan has stated that the intense and terrifying experiences she had with paparazzi in her youth led to "PTSD to the extreme." This was a primary motivation for her and her husband, Bader Shammas, to raise their son in Dubai, where she feels safe and can lead a normal life. Lohan noted that while social media has given celebrities more control over their own narratives compared to the early 2000s, the lack of privacy in Hollywood remains a significant stressor. She credits her move to Dubai in 2014 with allowing her to separate her private and public lives.</p>

          <p>A sweeping bill signed by President Trump, which extends tax cuts and funds mass deportations, is dominating the political landscape as lawmakers return to their districts for the August recess. Republicans are promoting the bill's benefits, such as tax relief on tips, while facing constituent anger over controversial provisions like work requirements for Medicaid. Democrats are campaigning against the bill, highlighting cuts to safety net programs and the expiration of Affordable Care Act subsidies, framing it as a key issue for the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>A "no tax on tips" provision within President Trump's new bill is raising questions among service industry workers, with some feeling it's "too good to be true." The measure provides a temporary deduction of up to $25,000 on tip income for federal taxes, but workers will still owe state and payroll taxes. Uncertainty remains about which occupations qualify and how employers must report tips for the deduction, adding to the confusion for workers who are already seeing a decline in tipping amid consumer "tipping fatigue."

          <p>This article recommends Michael Young's 1958 novel, "The Rise of the Meritocracy," a book that ironically popularized a term Young intended as a pejorative. The satirical work imagines a dystopian future where society is rigidly stratified by educational achievement, leading to a populist revolt against the meritocratic elite. The recommendation highlights the book's relevance today, as it critiques a system where intelligence and effort become the new basis for class division.

          <p>The Trump administration has directed NASA to develop a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor for the moon by the end of the decade, a crucial step for establishing a permanent lunar settlement. This move signals a renewed focus on the Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the moon in 2027 and build a base. The push is partly framed as a national security issue to counter a planned Chinese-Russian lunar base, which is slated to have a more powerful reactor. A lunar base could enable new scientific research, such as radio astronomy on the moon's far side.</p>

The article recommends a "reducetarian" diet, which focuses on minimizing harm by choosing pasture-raised meat over factory-farmed products and consuming larger animals like cows instead of many smaller ones like chickens, thereby balancing personal well-being with ethical considerations.</p>

          <p>In her book "SLIP," author Mallary Tenore Tarpley shares her personal journey with anorexia nervosa, which began after her mother's death when she was 11. The book combines memoir with research to explore the concept of living in a "middle place" of recovery, rather than striving for an elusive state of being "fully recovered." Tarpley argues that embracing imperfections and accepting setbacks has allowed her to live a fulfilling life, and she discusses the challenges of parenting while still contending with her own disorder in a world of resurgent diet culture.</p>

          <p>The 1988 film "Miracle Mile," which depicts a frantic escape from Los Angeles ahead of an imminent nuclear strike, has found a new audience and cult status in recent years. Written and directed by Steve De Jarnatt, the movie is noted for its affectionate portrayal of L.A. locations like the Miracle Mile and the La Brea Tar Pits. The story begins as a romance between characters played by Anthony Edwards and Mare Winningham before pivoting to a thriller. Its enduring appeal lies in its specific, anxious vision of an L.A.-centric apocalypse.</p>

A successful example is Bangkok's Benjakitti Park, which transformed a former factory site into a flood-mitigating public space. While L.A. has programs to fund similar projects, progress is slowed by high costs and bureaucracy, highlighting the challenges of implementing these nature-based solutions.</p>

          <p>Facing reduced reliability from traditional water sources like the Colorado River due to climate change, Southern California water agencies are planning for a more resilient future. The Metropolitan Water District is pursuing a diversified portfolio, including a major wastewater recycling project in Carson, expanding stormwater capture, and potentially investing in new transport infrastructure. Drawing lessons from crises in cities like Cape Town, the goal is to create a sustainable and affordable water supply to avoid a "Day Zero" scenario where taps could run dry for the region's 19 million residents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite California being a major focus of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement, federal data reveals that Texas and Florida had more ICE arrests in the first five months of his second term. Texas led with over 26,000 arrests, compared to California's 8,460. Experts attribute this discrepancy to greater cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE in Republican-led states. However, California saw one of the most dramatic increases in arrest rates, as federal agents conducted more at-large arrests in communities due to the state's "sanctuary" policies limiting cooperation in jails.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is dismissing the asylum applications of dozens of immigrants, some of whom have been waiting for years, because they did not receive a mandatory "credible fear" interview at the border. This interview is a preliminary screening, but a shortage of asylum officers meant many were not conducted between 2019 and 2022. Now, these applicants are being told their cases are closed and they must report to ICE to restart the process. Lawyers fear this leaves their clients undocumented and at risk of detention under new, stricter policies.</p>
