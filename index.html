            <p>Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian stated that President Trump's shifting trade policies are negatively impacting bookings, leading the airline to halt expansion plans for the second half of 2025. Citing a decline in consumer and corporate confidence since mid-February, Bastian noted weaker main cabin bookings despite previously optimistic projections for the year. While international and premium travel remain resilient, the overall slowdown has prompted Delta to maintain flat capacity year-over-year instead of the planned 3-4% increase. Bastian had previously praised the Trump administration's approach to industry regulation. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A bill laying the groundwork for Republicans to enact President Trump's agenda, including tax cuts, passed a crucial preliminary vote in the House. Despite clearing this procedural hurdle, the legislation faces opposition from fiscal conservatives who seek deeper spending cuts to offset new federal investments and address the national debt. Speaker Mike Johnson acknowledged these concerns, and Trump himself has been actively lobbying for support. The Senate's version of the budget framework calls for significantly lower spending cuts than the House's, further complicating the bill's path to passage.</p>

            <p>The White House is ending funding for the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP), the body responsible for producing the federal government's national climate assessment. This move effectively jeopardizes the Sixth National Climate Assessment, due by 2027, and undermines federal climate research efforts. Experts warn that the cancellation of the contract with ICF International, which coordinated the USGCRP, will dismantle interagency working groups and hinder the government's ability to address climate change. The decision follows a right-wing media attack on ICF International and aligns with the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which advocates for dismantling the USGCRP.</p>

            <p>President Trump's recent tariff policies, marked by sweeping announcements and sudden pauses, have created global financial instability and raised questions about the administration's strategy. While supporters attempt to justify the erratic behavior as part of a grand plan, critics argue that the tariffs are damaging the economy and undermining trust. The situation has drawn comparisons to conspiratorial thinking, with Trump portrayed as a hero orchestrating events to deliver political salvation. The market's wild fluctuations reflect the uncertainty and volatility created by the administration's actions. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump has implemented tariffs, taxes on goods bought from other countries, to boost the US economy, encourage American-made goods, and reduce the trade deficit. These tariffs include a 10% baseline on all imports and higher 'reciprocal tariffs' on specific countries. While some tariffs have been paused, the US-China trade war continues to escalate. Economists warn that these measures could harm the global economy and increase prices for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

Kennedy compared the outbreak to Europe's, but public health experts say the US response is inadequate and cases are severely undercounted. Measles was eliminated in the US in 2000, but anti-vaccine sentiment has increased hesitancy.</p>

The tariffs come at a difficult time for China's sluggish economy, with businesses scrambling to adjust their supply chains.
