          <p>Amazon is launching self-service pharmacy kiosks at its One Medical locations, starting in December in select California cities. These kiosks will allow patients to quickly pick up commonly prescribed medications directly after appointments, aiming to improve prescription fill rates. The initiative is part of Amazon's broader expansion into healthcare, following its 2023 acquisition of One Medical and the 2020 launch of Amazon Pharmacy. The company plans a wider rollout in 2026, extending quick medication access to various environments.</p>

          <p>Scott Gaffner, an Illinois soybean farmer and Trump supporter, is experiencing significant financial strain due to China's boycott of American soybeans amidst the ongoing trade war. Historically China's largest consumer of U.S. soybeans, the country has made no purchases this harvest season, leaving farmers anxious. While the Trump administration considers a $10 billion aid package, Gaffner emphasizes a preference for trade over aid, fearing long-term loss of market access. The article highlights the broader economic impact on rural areas dependent on agriculture.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson has rejected calls for a standalone House vote to ensure military service members are paid during the ongoing government shutdown, now in its eighth day. Johnson stated the House already passed a funding bill that would have covered troops, placing the responsibility on the Senate. Democrats are pushing for a vote, while Republicans accuse them of holding the government hostage over demands for enhanced Obamacare subsidies. Military personnel, deemed essential, will continue working but face deferred paychecks if the shutdown persists beyond their next payday.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang voiced surprise regarding AMD's deal to offer OpenAI a 10% ownership stake in exchange for a multi-billion dollar chip purchase agreement. Huang described the deal as "imaginative, unique, and surprising," particularly given AMD's enthusiasm for its next-generation products. This agreement, which has significantly boosted AMD's shares, challenges Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market. Nvidia also recently announced its own substantial investment in OpenAI, highlighting the intense competition and complex financial arrangements in the rapidly expanding AI infrastructure sector.</p>

          <p>A Mobile County, Alabama sheriff is facing widespread criticism for a Halloween display outside his home depicting skeletons in sombreros being chased by skeletal figures in "ICE" T-shirts. The scene has drawn online condemnation, neighbor complaints, and objections from Hispanic interest groups, who view it as dehumanizing and inappropriate for an elected law enforcement official. The sheriff's wife claimed responsibility, calling it "tongue-in-cheek" and citing her Cuban background, while local business groups highlighted the positive contributions of the Latin community. The controversy also coincides with broader debates on immigration and offensive Halloween costumes.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by Public Citizen and the Revolving Door Project reveals that over 40 Trump administration appointees have direct ties to oil, gas, or coal companies. The report, which examined officials across key energy and environmental agencies, highlights a pattern of placing fossil fuel insiders in positions dictating policy. This trend supports the administration's broad attacks on climate policies and renewable energy, including opening federal lands to drilling and dismantling climate science initiatives. Critics argue these appointments ensure a deregulatory agenda driven by specific moneyed interests within the industry.</p>

The psychologist described Norris as an "unreliable narrator" with inconsistent details in his confession and noted a lack of racial awareness, along with past racially abusive language in prison. The recommendation is for Norris to remain in a closed prison and be moved to a lower security facility for further testing of his behavior.</p>

          <p>Germany's Federal Cartel Office has initiated an investigation into the Chinese e-commerce giant Temu, focusing on potential unacceptable pricing conditions for traders on its German marketplace. The competition watchdog suspects Temu's practices could dramatically threaten competition and lead to price increases in other sales channels. With over 100 million monthly users from European marketplaces, Temu's rapid expansion has drawn scrutiny. The article notes that the EU-wide parent company, Whaleco Technology Limited, is the formal target, following earlier criticism from the European Commission regarding the sale of illegal products on its platform.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative Party leader, launched a "policy blitz" at the party conference, aiming to garner attention and redefine the party's economic agenda amidst dire poll ratings. Her keynote speech, which included the surprise announcement of abolishing stamp duty on main homes, sought to present clear dividing lines with opponents. The article notes that Badenoch's strategy emphasizes economic responsibility, with proposed savings funding new policies. This approach is intended to rebuild credibility and rally party activists, who showed a "pleasant surprise" at the new policy direction, despite ongoing challenges for the party.</p>

          <p>Social media claims suggesting Generation Z is leading a U.S. church revival are largely unsubstantiated, according to a DW Fact Check. While a Barna Group study notes Gen Z churchgoers attend slightly more frequently than older generations, this measures attendance among existing churchgoers, not the overall population. Other research, including a Pew Research Center survey, indicates that young Americans remain significantly less religious than older adults, with a growing number identifying as "nones." The article clarifies that while Gen Z churchgoers may be more active, the broader data does not support a nationwide religious resurgence among this demographic.</p>

          <p>Dutch authorities made an unusual discovery when two century-old hand grenades were found hidden within a consignment of French onions destined for a factory in Zeeland. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) identified the projectiles as consistent with pre-1925 French and German manufactured chemical weapons, though the specific chemical fill remains unknown. The reason for their presence in the delivery is a mystery. The grenades will be destroyed in Belgium, as the Netherlands lacks the specialized facilities for such objects.</p>

          <p>A recent Zillow report highlights that attending a single wedding and bachelor/bachelorette weekend can cost around $2,010, comparable to the typical monthly rent of $2,007.

The article notes that some opt for roommates or save less for down payments. Financial experts advise early saving in high-yield accounts and carefully choosing which weddings to attend, especially when homeownership is a priority, to avoid incurring debt.

This signals a light recovery anticipated for autumn 2025, with internal economic dynamics gaining speed by year-end, supported by federal financial measures. Economy Minister Katherina Reiche attributed substantial future growth to higher state financing, particularly for infrastructure and defense investments. However, the article notes criticism that this growth is largely debt-financed, and calls for further reforms to lower energy prices and taxes. (not investment advice)</p>

This comes as National Guard troops, ordered by the Trump administration, began arriving near Chicago despite objections from Illinois officials. Trump has described Chicago as a "hellhole" of crime, though police data shows significant crime reductions. The article highlights a lawsuit filed by Illinois and Chicago to block the deployment, arguing it's an "unlawful and dangerous" escalation of Trump's "War" on the city, raising concerns about federal overreach and the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>

The U.S. has targeted individuals and companies tied to Iran's oil industry, including a shipping empire linked to the Shamkhani family, accused of funding the regime's nuclear ambitions.
