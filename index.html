          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 01:03:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The development of solid-state batteries for electric vehicles is gaining momentum, with major automakers like Volkswagen, Toyota, and Stellantis setting production timelines around 2027-2028. Often called the "holy grail" for EVs, this technology promises higher energy density, improved safety, and faster charging compared to current lithium-ion batteries. While some experts see this as a pivotal step towards next-generation EVs, others remain skeptical, pointing to high costs and persistent technical challenges, especially as existing battery technologies continue to improve rapidly.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory against the Minnesota Twins, largely thanks to a surge in home run power that helped overcome ongoing offensive struggles. Shohei Ohtani hit a two-run homer in the first inning, and Will Smith added two solo shots, contributing to a four-homer night for the team. While the win provided a much-needed boost, it highlighted the team's reliance on power hitting amidst a broader slump in batting performance. The game ended with concern as closer Tanner Scott left with a potential arm injury.</p>

          <p>A new immersive show in London, "Elvis Evolution," is facing backlash from attendees who claim it was misleadingly advertised as featuring a life-sized AI hologram of the star. Many fans, who paid significant amounts for tickets, reported feeling "conned" as the experience primarily used upscaled archive footage and live actors instead. The show's creator, Layered Reality, defended the creative decision, stating they chose not to mimic Elvis's iconic performances directly. While some attendees have demanded refunds, reviews remain mixed, with some praising the show's innovative approach.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second-term presidency has been marked by a frequent and often unpredictable use of tariffs as a primary foreign policy tool, blurring the lines between trade policy and punitive sanctions. This approach allows for unilateral action without congressional approval and generates revenue, unlike traditional sanctions. However, this "tariff tango" has created significant uncertainty in global markets and has been used to pressure countries on non-trade issues like immigration and drug trafficking.

          <p>An analysis by property portal Zoopla indicates that the average monthly rent for new tenancies in the UK has risen by £221, or 21%, over the past three years. This sharp increase is attributed to high tenant demand and a shortage of available rental properties. The rising costs are forcing some individuals to make career decisions based on local rent prices and leading parents to financially support their adult children. While the rate of increase has recently slowed, particularly in cities, rents in more affordable areas continue to rise sharply. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recently circulated air-to-air images of China's J-35 fifth-generation stealth fighter are providing strong evidence that the aircraft has entered production and is preparing for deployment. The photos show two jets with clear naval markings, including a "Flying Shark" insignia, and official serial numbers, suggesting they are part of an initial production run. According to a military analyst, these details indicate the J-35 has been formally integrated into the navy's carrier aviation force. The jet is expected to be deployed on China's newest aircraft carrier, the Fujian.</p>

          <p>The family of Keith McAllister, the 61-year-old man who died after being pulled into an MRI machine on Long Island, alleges that the facility's technician was responsible for the fatal accident. According to his daughter, the technician invited McAllister into the room to assist his wife but failed to warn him about the danger of wearing metal near the powerful magnet. The chain McAllister was wearing caused him to be pulled into the machine, where he remained stuck for nearly an hour before passing away from multiple heart attacks.

          <p>The preliminary report into the Air India Flight 171 crash, which killed 260 people, has generated significant controversy and speculation. A key detail from the cockpit voice recorder indicates that both fuel-control switches were moved to "cut-off" moments after takeoff, causing total power loss. The recording captures one pilot asking the other why they did it, with the other denying the action. This has led to speculative media reports focusing on potential pilot error, prompting India's accident investigation bureau to condemn the rush to judgment while the full investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump is facing accusations that he is using a flurry of social media posts on unrelated topics to distract from the growing controversy surrounding his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. Critics point to his recent posts about the Washington Commanders' name change and attacks on political rivals as attempts to shift public focus. The accusations come after the Justice Department announced it would not release additional Epstein files, a reversal that has angered some of Trump's own supporters who were promised transparency on the matter.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while Donald Trump's universal tariffs are widely criticized, they may have an unintended positive consequence. The author suggests that the tariffs are forcing countries and trading blocs like Canada, China, and the European Union to confront and dismantle their own long-standing internal trade barriers. By exposing the economic drag of their own protectionist policies, the tariff crisis could be a catalyst for these nations to pursue domestic free-market reforms. This could ultimately lead to greater economic efficiency and growth within those regions. (not investment advice)</p>
