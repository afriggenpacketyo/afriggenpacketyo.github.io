          <p>Hurricane Humberto has rapidly strengthened to a Category 5 storm, posing a potential threat to the northern Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda. The article notes that while no U.S. watches or warnings are currently active, coastal areas from Florida to North Carolina could experience downstream impacts next week. Humberto is the eighth named storm of the season, with forecasters expecting it to remain a major hurricane for several days. Swells generated by the storm are anticipated to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>Fading West, a modular homebuilder, is working to address the nationwide housing affordability crisis by offering homes that are up to 20% cheaper and built in half the time of traditional construction. The company utilizes lean manufacturing in its 110,000-square-foot factory, assembling homes in about seven days. This article highlights their successful deployment of 82 modular homes in Lahaina, Maui, for wildfire victims, marking a first for FEMA. The approach also provides solutions for labor shortages and reduces waste, offering a potentially sustainable path to more accessible homeownership.</p>

          <p>Former MP George Galloway and his wife, Putri Gayatri Pertiwi, were stopped by counter-terrorism officers at Gatwick Airport upon returning from Moscow. The Metropolitan Police confirmed they were stopped under Schedule 3 of the Counter Terrorism and Border Security Act 2019, which allows questioning at ports to determine hostile activity. Neither individual was arrested, and they were subsequently released. Galloway's Workers Party of Britain condemned the incident as "politically motivated intimidation," alleging it was an attempt to silence opponents of a potential war with Russia and China.</p>

          <p>The UK government will underwrite a £1.5 billion loan guarantee for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support its supply chain, as a cyber attack continues to halt production. The car manufacturer has suspended operations for weeks, leading to concerns that smaller suppliers could face bankruptcy. This article explains that the loan, facilitated through the Export Development Guarantee, aims to boost JLR's cash reserves and ensure payments to its 700 suppliers. Business Secretary Peter Kyle emphasized the move's importance in protecting skilled jobs across the UK automotive sector.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's inaugural nationwide HPV vaccination campaign, targeting girls aged 9-14 to combat cervical cancer, is confronting a significant wave of misinformation. This article debunks viral claims, including AI-generated videos falsely asserting the vaccine is dangerous or causes infertility. Extensive scientific research from bodies like the ECDC and STIKO confirms the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in preventing HPV infections and precancerous lesions. Despite a history of vaccine skepticism in Pakistan, officials are pressing forward, with Federal Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal publicly vaccinating his daughter to build trust and counter the unfounded rumors.</p>

This article notes Lavrov also accused Western powers of sabotaging diplomacy regarding Iran sanctions. Despite recent incidents involving drones and airspace violations, Russia maintains it seeks pragmatic cooperation, particularly with the U.S.</p>

          <h2>Chimpanzees Regularly Consume Alcohol from Fermented Fruit, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 14:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Science reveals that wild chimpanzees regularly consume significant amounts of alcohol from fermented fruit, equivalent to about one small bottle of beer for humans daily. Researchers analyzed popular fruit varieties in Uganda and Ivory Coast, finding an average alcohol content of 0.3% in ripe pulp. This article highlights that the findings suggest regular alcohol consumption is not solely a human cultural phenomenon but has deeper evolutionary roots. The research challenges previous assumptions and supports the idea that shared consumption of ethanol-containing foods may have long played a role in primate societies.</p>

Forecasters are monitoring the developing system, expected to become Tropical Storm Imelda, as both systems pose a potential threat to the southeastern U.S. coast, with South Carolina already declaring a state of emergency.</p>
