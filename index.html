          <p>The Israeli military announced the recovery of the body of Nattapong Pinta, a Thai farmworker who was taken hostage and killed by a small militant group in Gaza. Pinta, who worked in southern Israel, was captured during the Hamas-led attack in October 2023 and was likely killed during his first months of captivity, according to an Israeli military official. The recovery operation took place in the Rafah area of southern Gaza, and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum urged the Israeli government to reach an agreement with Hamas to free the remaining captives, as Pinta is believed to be the last remaining Thai national abducted during the attack. The IDF stated that the mission to recover his body was launched following information from the interrogation of a captured terrorist.</p>

          <p>The Russia-backed Wagner Group announced its departure from Mali after over three years of combating Islamic extremists and insurgents. Despite Wagner's exit, Russia will maintain a mercenary presence through the Africa Corps, a state-controlled paramilitary force under the Russian defense ministry. Wagner's withdrawal follows accusations of targeting civilians and heavy losses suffered during attacks by the al-Qaida linked group JNIM. Experts suggest this transition signifies a shift in Russia's strategy, with Africa Corps focusing more on training and equipment provision rather than direct combat operations, and the lack of an official announcement from both Malian authorities and Wagner indicates a possible internal dispute which led to this sudden decision.</p>

          <p>Ukraine reported that Russia launched a significant air assault on Kharkiv, resulting in at least three deaths. The attack, described by Kharkiv‚Äôs mayor as the ‚Äúmost powerful attack‚Äù since the beginning of the war, involved drones and bombs. This escalation comes amid ongoing tensions and stalled ceasefire talks between the two countries, with Russia recently intensifying its attacks in response to Ukrainian strikes on Russian air bases.

          <p>Pentagon investigators are examining whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth personally authored text messages containing classified military plans to strike Houthi targets in Yemen, or if staff members were responsible. The probe, conducted by the Department of Defense‚Äôs Office of Inspector General, seeks to determine how details from a classified system ended up on the commercial messaging app Signal. The information was shared in two chat groups, including one with Vice President JD Vance and another with Hegseth's wife, and investigators are also looking into whether staff members were instructed to delete messages. Hegseth is scheduled to testify before Democratic lawmakers, who are expected to question his handling of sensitive information.</p>

          <p>A progressive group, Indivisible, which has received funding from George Soros, is accused of backing Beth Davidson, a progressive Democrat, in a key congressional swing district against Rep. Mike Lawler. Indivisible has organized protests at Lawler's town hall events, and Davidson has actively promoted the group on social media, attending events and expressing support. Republicans accuse Indivisible of attempting to undermine Trump's agenda by infiltrating congressional races, while Davidson has condemned Nazi imagery found at a rally she attended that was organized by Indivisible. The race for NY-17 is expected to be closely watched as Republicans seek to maintain their narrow majority in Congress.</p>

The event's organizers have lowered their visitor expectations, and hotel occupancy rates are down compared to last year, however, Capital Pride Alliance is implementing increased security measures, including an enclosed perimeter and weapons detectors, to address safety concerns and an elevated presence of the Metropolitan Police Department's LGBTQ+ liaison unit.</p>

          <p>The upcoming Spending Review in the UK reveals significant investment plans by the Labour government, with total real-terms spending projected to exceed ¬£650 billion by 2029-30, roughly ¬£100 billion more than when Labour took office. While overall spending is increasing, a large portion is allocated to long-term projects, with some departments, such as the NHS, receiving substantial funding boosts. However, other departments, like the Home Office, are reportedly in dispute over their settlements, raising concerns about potential cuts and the government's ability to meet its promises. The review aims to present a convincing narrative of economic rebuilding and strategic investment in key areas like defense and healthcare.</p>

          <p>Tesla is facing significant challenges following a disastrous first quarter, compounded by the collapse of Elon Musk's relationship with President Trump. What began as a policy disagreement over Trump's spending bill escalated into a public feud, causing Tesla shares to plummet and wiping out billions in value. The fallout could impact future regulations, investigations, and government support for Tesla, as the company already struggles with increased competition and consumer backlash to Trump's political activities. Pension funds are calling for stronger leadership and accountability from Tesla's board, with concerns that Musk's behavior is damaging the brand and threatening the company's future.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has pioneered the use of drones in innovative ways, creating significant challenges for Russia's military, from stealthy attacks on Russian warplanes to pioneering the use of sea drones in the Black Sea. Ukrainian drones also pose problems for Russian ground forces, making troop movements more difficult and costly, and Russia has responded by developing its own drone arsenal, partnering with Iran to produce the Geran drone. Both countries are now mass-producing drones, leading to increased drone attacks and countermeasures.</p>
