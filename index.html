The letter made no mention of the CIFâ€™s rule change last week â€” after Trump threatened to revoke federal funding from California if Hernandez competed in the state championships.

          <p>A columnist argues that Donald Trump values loyalty above all else, citing his reaction to a court ruling against his global trade war and his criticism of the Federalist Society. Trump attacked Leonard Leo and the Federalist Society for providing bad advice on judicial nominations after the Court of International Trade ruled against his tariffs. The columnist suggests that Trump's administration demands servile loyalty and that this ethos extends beyond the executive branch, influencing law firms, universities, and media outlets. 45</p>
