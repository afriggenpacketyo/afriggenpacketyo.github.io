          <p>Jannik Sinner has secured his first Wimbledon title, defeating Carlos Alcaraz in a compelling four-set final. This victory marks a significant turnaround for the 23-year-old Italian, who bounced back from a heartbreaking loss to Alcaraz at the French Open just five weeks prior, where he had held championship points. Sinner's win also comes after a challenging year that included a three-month doping ban, from which he has emphatically recovered to solidify his world number one ranking. His performance demonstrates immense mental fortitude and resilience in the face of both on-court and off-court adversity.</p>

          <p>A violent sequence of events in Lexington, Kentucky, resulted in the deaths of two women at a local church. The incident began when a suspect shot and injured a state trooper during a traffic stop, then carjacked a vehicle and fled to the Richmond Road Baptist Church. Upon arrival, he opened fire on parishioners, killing a 72-year-old and a 32-year-old woman and injuring two men before being shot and killed by responding law enforcement. Investigators believe the suspect had a personal connection to individuals at the church, which is described as a small, tight-knit community.</p>

          <p>In a discussion on the future of U.S.-China relations, leading experts Professor Li Cheng and Andrew Browne analyzed the complexities of the world's most consequential bilateral relationship. They explored the potential trajectory of ties under a second Donald Trump administration, considering the impact of ongoing trade frictions and tariffs. The dialogue focused on what they believe President Trump misunderstands about China and the strategic challenges facing both nations.

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge on the park's North Rim, a cherished landmark known for its rustic architecture and stunning views. The Bravo Dragon fire, one of two blazes in the area, consumed the lodge along with the visitor center and other key facilities, forcing the seasonal closure of the entire North Rim. The fire also damaged a water treatment plant, releasing chlorine gas and prompting further evacuations of hikers and firefighters from the inner canyon. The loss of the lodge, originally built in the 1920s and rebuilt in 1937, is a devastating blow to the park's heritage.</p>

          <p>A Senate Homeland Security Committee report has identified a "cascade of preventable failures" by the U.S. Secret Service leading up to the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania.

The report also highlights organizational mistakes, such as a countersniper team having an obstructed view, and claims the agency denied resources to Trump's detail during the campaign.

Critics, including prominent conservative figures, have accused the administration of a lack of transparency.

          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, a former president and one-time military ruler of Nigeria, has died in London at the age of 82 after a period of illness. Buhari was a polarizing figure who first led the country after a military coup in 1983 before being ousted, and later returned to power as a democratically elected president from 2015 to 2023. His presidency was marked by promises to fight corruption and insecurity, but was ultimately defined by economic decline, widespread violence, and his own undisclosed health problems. Despite a controversial legacy, he maintained a loyal following, particularly in Nigeria's north.</p>

          <h2>Bipartisan Senators Push for 'Sledgehammer' Sanctions Bill Against Russia</h2>

          <p>A bipartisan group of U.S. senators, led by Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal, is advancing a sanctions bill designed to give President Trump a "sledgehammer" against Russia's economy. The legislation aims to pressure countries like China, India, and Brazil that support Russia's war effort by purchasing its oil and other goods, with potential tariffs of up to 500%. This move signals a potential turning point in U.S. policy, as senators say President Trump's patience with Vladimir Putin is wearing thin after months of attempted diplomacy. The bill is intended to provide maximum flexibility to the president to escalate economic pressure.</p>

          <p>In Denver, a historic 1940s fortune cookie factory has been transformed into a unique, free-to-the-public art gallery by founder Amanda Precourt. After purchasing the dilapidated building nearly a decade ago, Precourt spent eight years renovating it into a space designed for connection and healing through art. The gallery, named the Cookie Factory, opened in May with a mission to provide a place for quiet contemplation and community gathering. Its inaugural exhibition features nature-based work by artist Sam Falls, with plans to rotate artists and continue serving as a gift to the city.</p>

          <p>A growing number of singles, particularly from Gen Z, are using artificial intelligence-powered dating assistants to help them navigate the complexities of online dating. Apps like Rizz and Keepler offer users AI-generated suggestions for profile writing, conversation starters, and even how to handle being "ghosted." While some users find the technology to be a confidence booster and a useful icebreaker, the trend raises questions about authenticity in digital communication. Experts suggest that while these tools can be a helpful supplement, they should not become a substitute for genuine human connection and self-expression.</p>

          <p>Following the deadly Texas floods, Senator Maria Cantwell has stated that improving the nation's weather forecasting systems is a "national responsibility." Cantwell, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, is planning to send bipartisan recommendations to President Trump for a major investment to upgrade forecasting infrastructure, including Doppler radar and ocean buoys. She argued that a smarter, federally-led system could provide earlier and more accurate warnings for floods, tornadoes, and fires, potentially saving lives and preventing tragedies like the one in Kerr County. The call for action comes amid proposed budget cuts for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its pressure on the Federal Reserve, with National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stating that the authority to fire Chair Jerome Powell is "being looked into." While President Trump has said he does not want to fire Powell, Hassett suggested on Sunday that it is possible "if there's cause." This comes as the administration criticizes the Fed's management, particularly a headquarters renovation project, potentially laying the groundwork to justify a removal. The ongoing conflict highlights significant political pressure being applied to the traditionally independent central bank. (not investment advice)</p>
