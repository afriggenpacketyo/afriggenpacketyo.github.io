          <p>Marius Borg Hoiby, the 28-year-old son of Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit, has been formally charged with multiple counts of sexual assault and bodily harm following a ten-month investigation. The charges stem from allegations made by a "double-digit" number of victims and include one case of sexual assault involving intercourse and two without. Hoiby's defense attorney stated he denies wrongdoing in most cases, especially those concerning sexual abuse, though he previously admitted to violence while under the influence of drugs. As the princess's son from a prior relationship, Hoiby does not hold a royal title or perform public duties.</p>

          <p>The NHL's first non-pandemic semi-remote draft was met with criticism from some league veterans, including Kings GM Ken Holland, who prefer the traditional, single-venue format. The event, held at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, featured numerous technical difficulties, such as audio failures and delays during virtual calls between draftees and their new teams. Critics felt the decentralized format lacked the excitement and personal touch of past drafts, where players and their families could celebrate together in the arena. Despite the logistical issues, the draft proceeded with top prospects like Matthew Schaefer and Roger McQueen being selected by their respective teams.</p>

          <p>Japanese and U.S. officials have agreed to continue discussions on tariffs, though significant disagreements remain, especially concerning U.S. duties on Japan's automotive sector. The talks occurred as a 90-day pause on certain country-specific tariffs, which President Trump implemented, nears its July 9 expiration. While officials on both sides described the talks as "fruitful," the Trump administration has shown no sign of removing tariffs on autos, steel, or aluminum, creating ongoing uncertainty for Japanese industries. The outcome will significantly impact trade relations between the two economic powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels. This minimally invasive technique, which avoids open-skull surgery like that used by Elon Musk's Neuralink, helped a paralyzed patient regain some limb movement. The procedure involved inserting a stent electrode into the patient's intracranial vasculature via a neck vein under imaging guidance. This development could represent a safer, less risky alternative for BCI technology with shorter recovery times and a wider range of potential applications for paralysis.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have charged 11 individuals in connection with a massive, Russia-based scheme that aimed to defraud the U.S. Medicare program of $10.6 billion. The indictment alleges the transnational criminal organization stole personal information from over a million Medicare recipients to file fraudulent claims for expensive medical equipment that was never provided. The group allegedly purchased legitimate medical equipment companies to facilitate the fraud and laundered the proceeds through shell companies and cryptocurrency. The scheme was uncovered after hundreds of thousands of Americans reported receiving benefit forms for equipment they never ordered or received.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, taking sole possession of the best record in the MLB despite what their manager described as an incomplete performance. The game featured a shaky start from pitcher Dustin May, defensive errors, and a quiet offense in the later innings. Key contributions included a leadoff home run by Shohei Ohtani and a two-run homer from Max Muncy, which helped counter the early deficit. The game was ultimately decided by a bases-loaded, game-ending double play in the ninth inning, highlighting the team's ability to win even when not playing at its peak.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that public schools must allow parents to opt their children out of lessons involving LGBTQ+ themed storybooks if they conflict with their religious beliefs. The case originated in Montgomery County, Maryland, where parents sued for the right to remove their children from classes where books like "Uncle Bobby's Wedding" and "Pride Puppy" were read. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Samuel Alito, stated schools must provide advance notification for such lessons. In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued the decision fails to account for the existence of LGBTQ+ people in society and their families.</p>

The author posits that this agenda, once confined to neoconservative circles, became official U.S. policy following the September 11 attacks.

          <p>China's solar manufacturing industry is experiencing a significant downturn, facing a combination of a domestic supply glut, a fierce price war, and prohibitive U.S. tariffs. Prices across the solar panel supply chain have plummeted by up to 80% since 2023, leading to substantial financial losses for many of the nation's leading producers. The mood at a recent major industry conference in Shanghai was described as weary, with many top firms reporting losses and their stock values declining sharply.

This decision, along with Australia's similar move, is seen by experts as a reflection of growing concerns in the Indo-Pacific region. Analysts suggest that these nations are prioritizing regional issues and are worried that conflicts in the Middle East may be diverting U.S. attention and resources away from Asia. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba reportedly canceled his trip after it became clear a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump was unlikely.</p>

          <p>Canadian businesses are facing significant challenges and uncertainty due to the ongoing tariff war with the United States, their largest trading partner. Business owners express frustration over the shifting nature of the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, which makes future planning nearly impossible and has been described as "killer" for small businesses. The conflict has impacted various sectors, including manufacturing and services, slowing Canada's economic growth. While intense negotiations for a new trade deal are underway, the lack of a stable set of rules has left many companies in a precarious position, hoping for a resolution that brings certainty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Tulane University reveals that parts of New Orleans' concrete flood protection system, reinforced after Hurricane Katrina, are sinking at an alarming rate. Using satellite radar data, researchers found that some sections of the flood walls are subsiding by nearly two inches per year, faster than the rate of sea-level rise. This sinking degrades the system's ability to protect the city from storm surges and increases flood risk, particularly in neighborhoods like Michoud. The study serves as a wake-up call for the need for ongoing monitoring and maintenance to preserve the integrity of the city's critical defenses.</p>

          <p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned a new aid distribution system in Gaza, calling it "inherently unsafe" and a "death sentence" for people seeking food. The system, operated by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) and backed by Israel and the U.S., bypasses the UN and has been criticized for using food as a weapon. According to the UN, over 400 Palestinians have been killed while trying to get assistance from GHF sites.

          <p>A recent meeting of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has highlighted a significant shift in U.S. vaccination policy under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. After the dismissal of all 17 previous voting members, a newly appointed panel, including noted vaccine contrarians, convened to discuss vaccine safety. The meeting was characterized by questions and hypotheses suggesting potential harms from vaccines, challenging the consensus of CDC staff experts. This event, coupled with the termination of funding for a global vaccine initiative, indicates that America's long-standing approach to vaccination policy is undergoing a radical transformation.</p>

          <p>In a significant 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has limited the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions that block government policies. The ruling stemmed from challenges to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, but its impact is much broader, affecting how legal challenges against executive actions are handled. Writing for the majority, Justice Amy Coney Barrett argued that such sweeping orders often exceed the authority granted to courts by Congress. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the birthright citizenship order itself, the decision is a major procedural victory for the executive branch.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned that a Republican budget bill in the U.S. Senate could cause as many as 3.4 million Californians to lose their Medi-Cal health insurance. The bill proposes new work requirements for many Medicaid recipients, which Newsom argues would be devastating for the state, potentially forcing rural hospital closures and driving up insurance premiums. Health policy experts echo concerns that such requirements often lead to eligible individuals losing coverage due to bureaucratic hurdles. The governor criticized the proposal as "reckless and cruel," highlighting its potential to reverse California's progress in reducing its uninsured rate.</p>

          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security has found a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age people who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet. The research assessed diets comprising rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, mushrooms, and seaweed, and found that individuals adhering to this eating pattern were less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms. The study, which surveyed nearly 12,500 employees, suggests that specific nutrients in the diet, such as omega-3 fatty acids in fish and folic acid in vegetables, may contribute to improved mental well-being. Researchers hope the findings can inform public health measures for depression prevention.</p>

          <p>Scientists are revisiting phage therapy, a century-old medical concept that uses viruses to kill bacteria, as a potential weapon against antibiotic-resistant superbugs. Phages, or bacteriophages, are viruses that specifically target and destroy bacteria, offering a highly precise alternative to broad-spectrum antibiotics. As the threat of an "antibiotic apocalypse" grows, researchers are collecting and studying these phages from various environments to build a library of potential treatments. While the path to widespread clinical use is still being charted, phage therapy is already available on compassionate grounds and represents a promising frontier in the fight against untreatable infections.</p>

          <p>The European Space Agency's new Biomass satellite is providing the first-ever views beneath the dense canopies of the world's rainforests. Using a unique P-band radar frequency, the satellite can see through thick foliage and clouds to measure the woody material in tree trunks, where most carbon is stored. This pioneering technology will allow scientists to create a global 3D map of forests, accurately estimate their carbon storage, and better understand their role in mitigating climate change. The first images have already revealed previously hidden wetlands and patches of deforestation, enabling authorities to react more quickly to illegal logging.</p>

          <p>Molly Schafer, a quiet 18-year-old senior at Waunakee High School in Wisconsin, found a unique way to reconnect with classmates she had grown distant from over the years. Battling social anxiety, she spent over 600 hours painting detailed portraits of 44 of her peers, working from her garage loft. She then presented the paintings to each student as a gift, an act that was met with astonishment and appreciation. Her project not only helped her bridge the social gap she felt but also prompted her classmates to reflect on their own high school relationships, fostering a renewed sense of connection.</p>

          <p>A fourth federal judge has permanently blocked one of President Trump's executive orders targeting a prominent law firm, ruling the action unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan struck down the order against the firm Susman Godfrey, calling it a "resounding victory for the rule of law." This is the latest in a series of legal defeats for the administration's campaign to punish law firms for representing clients or causes the president opposes. The orders have sought to impose punitive measures like suspending security clearances and ending government contracts, which judges have consistently found to be an unconstitutional assault on the legal system.</p>
