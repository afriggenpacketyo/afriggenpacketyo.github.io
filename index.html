          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, an article explores the profound and lasting impact on its youngest survivors, now adults. Many, like Arnold Burks and filmmaker E'jaaz Mason, experienced immense trauma, displacement, and loss, with some facing persistent mental health issues and disrupted community bonds. Mason's documentary "Katrina Babies" highlights the untold stories and the need for open dialogue about PTSD and hurricane preparedness. The article also touches on New Orleans' ongoing vulnerability to climate change and the debate over the "resilience" narrative, which some argue absolves those in power of accountability.</p>

          <p>Germany's cabinet is set to discuss a new draft law focusing on voluntary recruitment for the Bundeswehr, aiming to address a significant shortfall in military personnel. This move comes as an anti-war alliance, "Rheinmetall Entwaffen," protested outside an armed forces careers center in Cologne, highlighting public dissent against potential reintroduction of compulsory service. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius seeks to signal a clear focus on voluntary service to meet NATO commitments, which require approximately 80,000 additional professional soldiers and 140,000 reservists. The government hopes to avoid reintroducing conscription, which was suspended in 2011.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, labeling them "incompetent" and "no better" respectively, regarding Chicago's persistent crime issues. Following a deadly weekend in the city, Trump suggested they should seek his help, an offer previously rejected by the Democratic leaders who view federal intervention as an overreach. Trump has advocated for deploying the National Guard, a move opposed by Pritzker and Johnson who emphasize local solutions and a holistic approach to community safety. Crime statistics show a complex picture, with some categories down year-over-year but an overall increase since 2021.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK households will see their annual energy bills rise by £35 from October, as energy regulator Ofgem announces a 2% increase in the price cap. This adjustment will push a typical household's annual bill to £1,755, signaling another winter of relatively high energy costs. The increase is attributed to higher wholesale energy prices, transport costs, and new government support measures for consumers. Campaigners warn that many families are already struggling with energy debt, prompting advice for consumers to consider fixed-price deals while being mindful of exit fees.</p>

          <p>Former Australian Football League (AFL) player Mitch Brown has publicly come out as bisexual, marking a historic moment as the first openly gay or bisexual man in the league's 129-year history. Brown revealed that concealing his sexuality significantly influenced his decision to retire and hopes his disclosure fosters a safer environment for others. He described a "hyper-masculinity" culture within the AFL, recalling homophobic comments and a lack of safe spaces for discussing identity. Experts believe Brown's candor, particularly his willingness to address systemic issues, could drive significant cultural and behavioral changes in Australian men's sports.</p>

The investigation revealed that attempts to fix the issue, including "touch and go" landings, ultimately led the jet's computer to mistakenly believe it was on the ground, rendering it uncontrollable and forcing the pilot to eject safely.

The 1.2-inch piece depicts a meticulously groomed man with an imperial mustache, braided beard, and neatly styled hair, challenging common perceptions of Vikings as savage. Discovered in Norway in 1796 and long forgotten in museum archives, the detailed carving stands out from other Viking-era depictions which rarely show individual human features or expressions.

The analysis highlights significant challenges, such as the unprecedented scale of deportations, the immense cost and logistical hurdles of building prison-grade facilities, and potential legal conflicts with fundamental human rights principles. While new laws could be drafted, previous attempts to fast-track removals have been deemed unlawful.

While overall profits for major industrial firms fell 1.7% in the first seven months, manufacturing and utilities sectors saw gains, and the raw-material manufacturing sector rebounded significantly.

This article details the potential economic impact, with analysts predicting a 0.6 percentage point hit to India's GDP and diminished competitiveness against regional peers. Key sectors like engineering goods, gems and jewelry, textiles, and electronics, which heavily rely on the U.S. market, are particularly vulnerable. The tariffs risk eroding India's attractiveness as a manufacturing hub and forcing a re-evaluation of its trade relationships. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hostilities between Israel and the Houthis have escalated significantly, with Israeli fighter jets conducting massive air strikes on Yemen's capital, Sanaa, targeting military installations. This retaliation follows a Houthi missile attack on Israel, which for the first time reportedly included internationally prohibited cluster munitions, signifying a qualitative escalation. The Houthis, who control much of northern Yemen and are backed by Iran, began targeting Israel in late 2023 in "solidarity" with Palestinians, seeking regional leverage and domestic support. This conflict further impacts global trade routes through the Bab el-Mandab Strait, prompting international military action to protect shipping.</p>

The article highlights Russia's widening budget deficit, projected meager economic growth for 2025, and declining oil export revenues amidst sanctions. Unprecedented defense spending, coupled with labor shortages and high inflation, has led to an overheating economy, forcing the central bank to cut interest rates. Analysts warn of a "prolonged period of weak growth" and a high risk of recession, suggesting that economic pressures might eventually compel the Kremlin to consider a more balanced approach to the ongoing conflict.

Leaders like Brazil's Lula are advocating for diversification and bypassing the dollar, strengthening blocs like BRICS. This strategy, aimed at protecting national sovereignty and economies from unilateral U.S. actions, suggests a potential long-term shift in international trade and political alignments, creating a deeply ironic outcome for U.S. foreign policy.
