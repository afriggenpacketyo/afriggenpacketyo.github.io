          <p>Mark Cuban, along with Steve Cannon and Rashaun Williams, has launched Harbinger Sports Partners (HSP), a $750 million private equity fund focused on acquiring minority stakes in professional sports franchises across U.S. leagues. HSP will utilize a data-driven approach to identify undervalued sports assets, targeting positions between 1% and 5% in 92 franchises, with deal sizes ranging from $50 million to $150 million. The move comes as professional sports valuations surge and leagues increasingly open to private equity investment. Cuban, who sold his majority stake in the Dallas Mavericks in 2023, retains a 27% minority stake and will leverage his experience in sports and business to guide HSP's investments and liquidity planning for portfolio teams.</p>

          <p>Direct peace talks between Ukrainian and Russian negotiators in Istanbul resulted in an agreement to conduct a large prisoner swap, exchanging 1,000 prisoners each. However, the two sides failed to broker a temporary cease-fire or arrange a meeting between their leaders, indicating persistent disagreements on ending the conflict. Russia demanded Ukraine withdraw from the four regions it annexed in 2022 as a condition for a cease-fire, a condition Ukraine is unlikely to meet. Despite the lack of major breakthroughs, both delegations agreed to present their visions of a potential cease-fire and continue discussions, with Turkey offering to host future talks and Pope Leo XIV extending an offer to host subsequent talks at the Vatican.</p>

Judge Hannah Duncan acknowledged that the activists caused no "actual harm" or disruption but criticized them for showing "no remorse" and treating their trial as an "extension of the protest," delaying proceedings and wasting court resources.</p>

This strategy suggests that both parties engaged in abusive behavior, but legal experts argue that "mutual abuse" is not a legal defense of abuse, which is defined as a pattern of behavior designed to maintain control over another person. The defense may be attempting to reframe the violence as a consensual part of the sexual relationship, similar to the defense used in the case of former Dodger's player Trevor Bauer.</p>

          <p>President Trump's first major foreign trip to the Middle East focused on securing deals and money for the United States, with Gulf states obliging through investments and arms deals. The trip played to Trump's ego, with opulent displays and lavish treatment. Trump lifted sanctions against Syria and praised the country's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, while also continuing to pursue a nuclear deal with Iran. The trip highlighted Trump's transactional approach to foreign policy, prioritizing deals over democracy and human rights.</p>

          <p>The tech IPO market is showing signs of life after an extended drought, with shares of stock brokerage platform eToro jumping nearly 29% in their Nasdaq debut and artificial intelligence infrastructure provider CoreWeave reporting 420% revenue growth. This follows a period of uncertainty caused by President Trump's tariff policy, which led to delays in several IPOs. The successful debut of eToro could encourage other companies to follow suit, signaling a potential resurgence in IPO activity.</p>

          <p>The Mexican government is opposing a provision in the House Republican bill to enact President Trump's domestic policy agenda that would impose a 5% excise tax on remittances sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries. Mexico's ambassador to the U.S., Esteban Moctezuma BarragÃ¡n, urged lawmakers to reconsider the proposal, arguing that it would amount to double taxation and disproportionately affect those with the least. The Mexican government and representatives from the electronic payment transfer industry have expressed concerns that the proposal would harm vulnerable communities and drive consumers toward unregulated channels.</p>

          <p>New York University (NYU) is withholding a diploma from a graduating student, Logan Rozos, who used his commencement speech to condemn Israel's actions in Palestine and U.S. complicity, stating that he lied about the speech he was going to deliver. The university cited Rozos's misuse of his role as a speaker to express personal and one-sided political views, violating his commitment to comply with school rules. This decision has drawn criticism from faculty who view it as an overreaction to pressure from the Trump administration to crack down on pro-Palestinian speech.</p>

          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is accused of misleading a judge to obtain a warrant to access the homes of Columbia University students sought for deportation over their pro-Palestinian activism. Attorneys claim that ICE used the warrant application, citing an investigation into Columbia for "harboring aliens," as a pretext to arrest two students, including a green card holder. The ACLU has warned universities and magistrate judges of ICE's attempts to use similar accusations to justify judicial warrants, arguing that providing housing and services to students does not violate the "harboring aliens" law.</p>

Civil rights advocates fear that any rollback of desegregation orders would harm Black students. The Justice Department has already dismissed one order in a district south of New Orleans, and is open to lifting others, but civil rights advocates argue that the orders are still needed to ensure that school districts are not engaging in discriminatory practices.</p>

          <p>Scientists are closely monitoring Axial Seamount, an undersea volcano located 300 miles off the Oregon coast, as they anticipate an eruption sometime in 2025. The volcano, which last erupted in 2015, is not expected to pose any danger to people due to its depth of 4,500 feet below the ocean's surface. Researchers hope to use the eruption as an opportunity to study underwater lava flows and test theories about volcanic activity, utilizing a network of instruments to gather real-time data.</p>
