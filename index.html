          <h2>American Airlines CFO Notes Some Travelers Avoiding Newark Airport Due to Disruptions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 15:22:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American Airlines CFO Devon May mentioned that some travelers are opting for alternative airports like LaGuardia, JFK, or Philadelphia to avoid recent disruptions at Newark Liberty International Airport. This shift is occurring as the FAA has ordered temporary flight cuts at Newark to alleviate congestion caused by air traffic controller shortages, equipment outages, and runway construction. Bad weather has further exacerbated these issues in recent weeks. The impact on American Airlines is considered modest, but the trend highlights ongoing challenges at Newark Airport. Optimism score is based on a relatively stable situation, as it is a relatively minor disruption to airport traffic.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is planning a large-scale military parade in Washington, D.C., on June 14, 2025, to commemorate its 250th birthday, coinciding with President Trump's 79th birthday. The parade will showcase military equipment from different eras, including World War II airplanes, Vietnam War-era helicopters, and modern tanks. A notable participant will be an Australian Cattle Dog named Doc Holliday, who belongs to the Army's 1st Cavalry Division Horse Cavalry Detachment and is accustomed to parades. The event aims to strengthen the connection between America and its Army, despite costing an estimated $45 million.

          <p>The Trump administration has blocked Harvard University from enrolling future international students and retaining existing ones, citing "pro-terrorist conduct" and accusing the university of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem revoked Harvard's Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification, leading to a legal battle. Harvard has stated the government's action is unlawful and retaliatory, threatening serious harm to the university and its academic mission. A federal judge has issued an injunction that could block the administration's actions, pending the outcome of a lawsuit.

          <p>An auction of Abraham Lincoln's personal belongings, held to fund payments on a loan taken out by the Lincoln Presidential Foundation, saw significant interest in several items. A pair of bloodstained leather gloves that were in Lincoln's pocket the night he was assassinated sold for $1.52 million. Other items, including a handkerchief and a "wanted" poster for John Wilkes Booth, also fetched high prices. The auction raised a total of $7.9 million, highlighting the enduring historical significance and public interest in artifacts related to the former president. The optimism score is somewhat stable, as the auction itself is a historical event and does not involve any new loss of life.</p>

          <p>A White House report led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attributes the crisis of chronic disease in American children to factors like ultraprocessed foods, chemical exposures, lack of physical activity, and excessive prescription drug use. The report calls for more research into the causes and prevention of diseases like heart disease, cancer, and depression, while also highlighting the undue corporate influence in federal policymaking. The report suggests further scientific inquiry into the links between vaccines and chronic disease, despite numerous studies that have failed to find such a link. The report reflects a consensus across government agencies and officials, including Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and EPA head Lee Zeldin. The optimism score is moderate, given the focus on prevention but also the skepticism surrounding some of the report's claims.</p>

          <p>A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that China's 2019 embargo on fentanyl exports to the U.S. led to a temporary spike in the drug's street price, deterring its use and reducing fentanyl-related overdose deaths by up to 25% over a period of three to five months. The strict drug control policy, implemented in May 2019, added all fentanyl-related substances to its list of controlled substances, restricting their export. The study estimated that without China's restrictions, as many as 947 more Americans would have died from a fentanyl overdose. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the positive impact of the embargo but also the ongoing opioid crisis.</p>

          <p>The Senate has blocked California's plan to phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles, a move that could significantly impact the electric car market in the United States. The vote, a victory for the oil and gas industry and Republicans, sets the stage for a legal challenge. California leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta, have vowed to fight the Senate vote, arguing that repealing the policies would hinder the state's efforts to combat climate change. The vote also prevents California from requiring half of all new trucks sold in the state to be electric by 2035 and from limiting emissions of nitrogen oxide from cars and trucks.

The study analyzed 1,200 cereals and found increases in total fat and sodium content, as well as sugar content. Protein and dietary fiber, two necessary nutrients, decreased over the same period. Researchers suggest that these trends make it harder for parents to ensure their children are getting a healthy start to the day and hope the research sparks a conversation on how food industry stakeholders can create healthier options for kids.

          <p>The House passed a budget package that includes a provision to lift the tax deduction cap for state and local taxes (SALT) to $40,000 from the current $10,000 limit, potentially providing tax savings for homeowners with high property taxes or significant state income tax liabilities. The full $40,000 deduction would only be available to filers with household incomes below $500,000, with a phaseout for higher earners. High-income homeowners are most likely to benefit from the new deduction, with more than half of the benefit going to taxpayers making at least $400,000.

          <p>The U.S. Congress is moving to block California's law that would have banned the sale of petrol-only cars in the state by 2035. The Senate followed the House in voting to nullify a waiver granted to the state, which had allowed it to set stricter auto emissions standards. The vote is a win for Republicans, energy firms, and carmakers, but a blow to Democrats and environmental groups. President Trump is expected to sign the measure, likely setting the stage for a legal battle. The optimism score is low, reflecting the setback for environmental regulations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries, returning almost all of them to the shelves after a new review using the Pentagon's standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion titles. The initial removal was based on the Navy's own terms, which identified 381 titles, including works by Maya Angelou and Ibram X. Kendi. However, the new review found only about 20 books that need to be removed pending a future review by a Department of Defense panel. The Pentagon memo standardizing search terms was issued to bring the DOD into compliance with a Trump executive order to eliminate DEI programs. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the reversal and the ongoing debate over DEI initiatives.</p>

          <p>The article discusses whether an annuity can run out of money, explaining that it depends on the type of annuity. Immediate and lifetime annuities are designed not to run out of money as long as the issuing insurer remains solvent, guaranteeing income for life. However, fixed-term annuities, variable annuities, and indexed annuities can run out of money under certain circumstances. The article provides strategies to protect against losing annuity payments, such as choosing a lifetime income annuity, adding an income rider, diversifying retirement income, researching the insurance company, and watching withdrawal habits.

          <p>The number of white nationalist, hate, and anti-government extremist groups in the U.S. has dropped, not because of their declining influence, but because many proponents feel their beliefs have become normalized in government and mainstream society, according to a new report by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC). The report documented 1,371 hate and extremist groups across the country in 2024, down from 1,430 groups in 2023. The 5% drop can be attributed to the fact that many feel a lesser sense of urgency to organize because their beliefs have infiltrated politics, education, and society.

          <p>The Trump administration has halted Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, citing a sprawling records request and an ongoing investigation by the Department of Homeland Security. This move is likely to prompt a second legal challenge from Harvard, which sued the administration last month over attempts to impose changes to its curriculum, admissions policies, and hiring practices. The administration notified Harvard about the decision after a back-and-forth in recent days over the legality of the records request. The move is likely to have a significant effect on the university’s bottom line, as international students tend to pay larger shares of education costs compared with other students.
