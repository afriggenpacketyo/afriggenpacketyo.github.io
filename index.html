          <p>UK-based pharmaceutical company GSK has announced a commitment to invest at least $30 billion in its U.S. research, development, and manufacturing over the next five years. The announcement coincides with President Donald Trump's state visit to the U.K., highlighting strengthening transatlantic business ties. This investment includes $1.2 billion for advanced manufacturing and AI technologies, with plans for a new biologics factory in Pennsylvania to produce respiratory and cancer medicines. The move follows similar large-scale U.S. investment commitments from other major global pharmaceutical firms amid pressure from the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>This opinion article highlights the progress of the B-21 Raider, America's new sixth-generation stealth bomber, with the second aircraft, nicknamed "Spartan," recently beginning flight tests. The author argues that the program's efficiency, coming in under budget, justifies opening a second production line to bolster the U.S. stealth fleet more quickly. The piece frames the B-21 as a crucial strategic asset for maintaining a deterrent advantage over adversaries like China and Russia. It emphasizes the bomber's advanced AI, aerodynamics, and its dual role in both nuclear deterrence and conventional global strikes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reveals that large-scale mummification was practiced in southern China and Southeast Asia as early as 12,000 years ago. Researchers analyzed 54 pre-Neolithic burials and found evidence that bodies were intentionally smoke-dried over long periods. This discovery predates the well-known Chinchorro mummies of Chile by 5,000 years and the earliest Egyptian mummification by approximately 7,500 years. The findings provide new insights into the complex mortuary practices of the region's ancient hunter-gatherer populations.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Promotes High-Deductible Catastrophic Health Plans as ACA Costs Rise</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 05:00:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid concerns over rising Obamacare premiums, the Trump administration is expanding eligibility for "catastrophic" health insurance plans. These plans feature lower monthly premiums but require consumers to pay very high deductibles, over $10,000 for an individual, before most coverage begins. This policy change is a response to the potential political fallout from the expiration of enhanced COVID-era subsidies, which could cause a 75% increase in premium costs for millions.

          <p>In the wake of several recent high-profile shootings, including the assassination of an activist and a school shooting, this article provides context on gun violence data in the United States. Experts note that while mass shootings are more frequent than 50 years ago, they represent a small fraction of total gun deaths, with many incidents linked to domestic violence. Gun-related incidents on school grounds have surged since the pandemic, often stemming from escalated disputes. The article also discusses the rise in politically motivated violence and notes that a majority of Americans have taken precautions to protect themselves from gun violence.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the cultural history of the "zarf," a decorative holder for small, handleless coffee cups, originating in the Ottoman Empire. Zarfs were not only functional, protecting hands from hot coffee, but also served as symbols of luxury, status, and elegance, often crafted from precious metals and adorned with jewels. The tradition of Turkish coffee service is a UNESCO-recognized cultural ritual, and the zarf was an integral part of this ceremony. While the term is sometimes anachronistically applied to modern cardboard coffee sleeves, purists argue the original zarf represents a rich artistic and cultural heritage.</p>

          <p>President Trump's second term is being marked by a systematic effort to expand executive power and dismantle established checks and balances within the federal government. A key example is the firing of Cathy Harris, a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, an independent agency designed to protect federal employees from political abuses. This and other firings of inspectors general and heads of independent agencies are being challenged in court, with cases likely heading to the Supreme Court. The administration argues for the president's broad authority to remove any executive officer, a move critics warn could erode the non-partisan civil service.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce a quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut this week, marking the first reduction in nine months.

The decision comes amidst sustained pressure from President Trump, who has sought to exert greater control over the central bank, including appointing a new board member and attempting to fire another. Policymakers are balancing concerns about a weakening labor market against persistent inflation, which is partly fueled by the administration's tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

Stricter country-of-origin rules and the elimination of a cost exemption for small parcels have resulted in significant tariffs being applied to their blended teas, which often contain ingredients from both India and China.

          <p>The United Kingdom's annual inflation rate remained unchanged at 3.8% in August, matching the figure from July, according to the Office for National Statistics. While some costs like airfares decreased, a persistent rise in food prices, particularly for items like cheese, fish, and vegetables, kept the overall rate high. This marks the fifth consecutive month of rising food price inflation, which economists attribute partly to businesses passing on higher labor costs. The sustained high inflation rate, well above the Bank of England's 2% target, increases pressure on the central bank to maintain current interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the sun's 11-year activity cycle approaches its peak in 2025, concerns are growing about the vulnerability of our global internet infrastructure to a major solar storm. A powerful storm could eject a massive cloud of charged particles toward Earth, potentially disabling satellites, power grids, and the undersea cable repeaters that form the backbone of the internet. A 2021 study warned that our current systems are not designed to withstand such an event, which could lead to a prolonged, multi-month internet outage with catastrophic economic consequences. While a direct hit is a low-probability event, the potential impact is significant.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has launched a new initiative to bolster domestic economic growth by boosting consumption in the service sector. A 19-point plan aims to relax market access and increase the supply of services in areas like culture, sports, and high-end healthcare. The measures include supporting international sporting events, extending the hours of museums, attracting more private investment in medical care, and expanding visa-free travel to draw in foreign tourists. The plan also calls for increased financial support, such as encouraging more lending to service businesses and providing subsidies for consumer loans.</p>

          <p>Renowned football manager Jose Mourinho is reportedly close to being appointed as the new manager of Portuguese club Benfica. The club recently sacked its previous manager, Bruno Lage, following a disappointing loss in the Champions League. Mourinho, who was himself dismissed by Turkish club Fenerbahce in August, began his managerial career at Benfica in 2000, though his tenure was brief. The club's president has stated they are seeking a "winner" to lead the team, and Mourinho's extensive record of success at top European clubs fits that profile.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology firm Baidu saw its Hong Kong-listed shares jump by nearly 16%, reaching a two-year peak, driven by growing optimism about its artificial intelligence ventures. The surge followed a rating upgrade from Arete Research, which cited a positive outlook for Baidu's AI chip and cloud-computing revenue. The company has been heavily investing in its AI capabilities, including developing its own chips to train its popular Ernie Bot, which could reduce its reliance on foreign suppliers like Nvidia. This strategic pivot to AI is seen as a key growth driver for the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jerry Greenfield, co-founder of the iconic ice cream brand Ben & Jerry's, has resigned from the company after nearly 50 years. In a letter, Greenfield stated that parent company Unilever has "silenced" the brand's social activism, violating the independence agreement made when Unilever acquired the company in 2000. This departure deepens a long-running dispute that escalated in 2021 when Ben & Jerry's announced it would stop sales in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. Greenfield's exit highlights the ongoing tension between the brand's progressive values and the corporate interests of its parent company.</p>

          <p>After nearly three decades of research, archaeologists have uncovered the remains of a "forgotten" castle at Finlaggan on the Scottish island of Islay, believed to have been a royal center over 700 years ago. The fortress, which predates the famous MacDonald Lords of the Isles, featured a fortified stone tower, a great hall, and a chapel. The structure is similar to castles built by Anglo-French kings, suggesting it was a significant seat of power and wealth. This discovery provides new insights into the early history of a site that later became a major power base in western Scotland.</p>

However, exports to the United States continued to fall sharply, dropping 13.8%, with auto shipments remaining particularly weak.
