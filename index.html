          <p>FedEx exceeded expectations in its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, announcing the achievement of its $4 billion cost-cutting goal and a plan to reduce costs by another $1 billion in the next fiscal year.  Despite the positive financial results, FedEx stock dropped slightly in after-hours trading due to less-than-stellar profit guidance for the current quarter.  The company's performance is considered a significant indicator of the global economy's health, given its broad reach across various businesses. This follows the recent death of FedEx founder Fred Smith.</p>
