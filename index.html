          <p>In a recent speech in Chicago, former President Joe Biden touted his administration's record on appointing demographically diverse judges, including Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. The address was marked by several instances of slurred speech, fueling ongoing Republican-led investigations into his cognitive fitness during his presidency. These concerns were amplified following a difficult debate performance in 2024 and are the subject of multiple tell-all books and congressional inquiries. The event occurred just as a former top aide testified about potential financial gains had Biden won re-election.</p>

          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, has been transferred from a low-security prison in Florida to a minimum-security camp in Texas. The move follows a two-day, multi-hour meeting between Maxwell and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, where she reportedly discussed numerous individuals connected to Epstein. This has prompted speculation about whether she is cooperating with the Justice Department for a potential sentence reduction. The transfer was confirmed by her attorney, who did not provide a reason for the change in facility.</p>

          <p>Doehler Dry Ingredient Solutions has issued a recall for its Member's Mark brand freeze-dried fruit variety packs due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. The affected products were sold at Sam's Club stores across 42 states between July 1 and July 25, 2025. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advises consumers to discard the product and seek a full refund from any Sam's Club location. Listeria can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections, particularly in vulnerable populations such as the elderly, pregnant individuals, and those with weakened immune systems.</p>

          <p>The most senior civil servant at the UK's Ministry of Defence, Permanent Secretary David Williams, is set to step down this autumn. His departure follows the revelation of a massive data breach that exposed the personal details of nearly 19,000 people, including British spies and vulnerable Afghan allies seeking refuge from the Taliban. The leak occurred in February 2022 when an official accidentally emailed a spreadsheet with sensitive information. While the MoD states his departure was agreed upon before the breach became public, it comes amid a parliamentary inquiry into the "shocking" security failure.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's latest round of global tariffs is causing significant uncertainty for U.S. retailers as they begin placing orders for the Spring 2026 season. Industry groups like the National Retail Federation warn that the tariffs will likely lead to higher consumer prices, fewer product choices, and potential job cuts. Small and large businesses alike are struggling to navigate the unclear trade terms, with some pausing new product launches and others exploring new supply chains outside of affected countries. The ongoing volatility is forcing CEOs to spend more time on logistics and less on growth, creating a challenging environment for the entire sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Celebrity chef Paula Deen has announced the sudden and permanent closure of her flagship Savannah restaurant, The Lady & Sons, which she operated with her sons for nearly three decades. The restaurant, known for its Southern comfort food, was a major tourist draw even after Deen's Food Network show was canceled in 2013. Her second Savannah eatery, The Chicken Box, has also been shut down, though no reason was provided for the closures. Deen's four other restaurants in Tennessee, South Carolina, and Missouri will remain open, and she assured fans that Savannah will always be her home.</p>

          <p>During his 2024 campaign, Donald Trump promised that his administration would ensure IVF treatment was covered for all Americans who need it, either through direct payment or insurance mandates. However, after signing a February executive order to study the issue, a 90-day deadline for recommendations passed in May with no further action from the White House. Fertility advocates and families struggling with the high cost of treatment are now questioning the delay, highlighting the nonpartisan nature of the issue. With IVF cycles costing up to $25,000, the lack of federal action leaves access largely dependent on state laws and individual financial means.</p>

Critics, including some Gazans and international aid groups like Oxfam, have labeled the visit a "media stunt" that fails to address the root causes of what the UN calls a man-made starvation crisis.

Neeson, known for his stone-faced action roles, is a natural successor to Leslie Nielsen, playing the bumbling detective with a straight face amidst the chaos. The review suggests that in an era dominated by action blockbusters, this unabashedly silly farce offers a refreshing and much-needed comedic experience for theater audiences.</p>

          <p>California, along with 15 other states and the District of Columbia, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration to block an executive order targeting gender-affirming care for minors. The order denounces such care as "mutilation" and has led the Justice Department to issue subpoenas to healthcare providers nationwide. The lawsuit argues the administration's actions are an unconstitutional overreach of federal power that undermines state laws and endangers vulnerable young people. The legal challenge comes as clinics across the country have already begun closing due to the federal pressure, drastically reducing access to care.</p>

          <p>As summer temperatures rise, personal neck cooling fans have become a popular gadget for staying cool, but experts question their effectiveness. These devices work by blowing air across the neck and face, which can enhance the body's natural evaporative cooling process. However, in high humidity, this effect is diminished, and the fans only cool a small surface area of the body. While they can make you feel cooler due to the high concentration of thermal receptors in the neck, physiologists warn they do little to lower core body temperature. This could create a false sense of security, potentially leading to overexertion in dangerous heat.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled that Italy can use an accelerated asylum process for migrants from countries it designates as "safe," but only under specific conditions. The court stipulated that the sources used to make such a designation must be publicly accessible and that the country must be safe for its entire population, including minorities. Furthermore, migrants must have the ability to legally challenge the "safe country" designation. The ruling provides clarification on a key part of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's controversial immigration policy, which has faced legal challenges within Italy and criticism from rights groups.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Swiss government and public have reacted with shock and anger after the Trump administration imposed a 39% tariff on Swiss goods, the highest rate in Europe. The punitive tariff is far worse than the 10% rate that Swiss officials had hoped for following recent diplomatic talks. The primary sticking point appears to be the U.S. trade deficit with Switzerland, which President Trump views as a problem. Despite Switzerland offering zero tariffs on U.S. industrial goods and promising billions in U.S. investments, the measures failed to secure a more favorable outcome, leaving Swiss businesses warning of potential job losses.</p>

          <p>Utility workers installing a natural gas network in Lima, the capital of Peru, have unearthed a pre-Incan tomb estimated to be over 1,000 years old. The tomb contained the remains of one individual from the Chancay culture, found wrapped in a bundle and interred with clay vessels and other artifacts. This discovery is not unusual for Lima, a city with over 400 archaeological sites, where civil projects frequently lead to such finds. The gas company, Cálidda, has reported making over 2,200 similar archaeological discoveries during its two decades of excavation work in the region.</p>

          <p>With ongoing economic uncertainty, annuities are gaining appeal as a source of guaranteed retirement income, but they come with complexities. This article outlines several key rules for potential buyers, such as keeping total annual fees below 1% and not committing funds to a deferred annuity unless you can wait at least a decade for it to mature. It also advises using annuities to first cover essential living expenses and limiting their allocation to no more than 25% of your total retirement portfolio to maintain liquidity and diversification. These guidelines can help retirees avoid common pitfalls and make more informed financial decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starting August 1, interest will once again begin to accrue for the 8 million student loan borrowers who were enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE repayment plan. These borrowers had been placed in zero-interest forbearance after court injunctions halted the program. The change could add an average of $300 to a typical borrower's monthly costs, significantly increasing their financial burden. While borrowers can opt to remain in forbearance and not make payments, their loan balances will now grow, making future repayment more expensive and potentially negating progress toward loan forgiveness programs.</p>

          <p>Nintendo has announced it will be raising the prices for its original Switch family of systems and some accessories in the United States, effective August 3. The company cited "market conditions" as the reason for the hike, which will affect the standard Switch, Switch Lite, and OLED models. The price of the newly released Switch 2 console and all games will remain unchanged for now, though Nintendo noted future adjustments may be necessary. The move comes as companies navigate a volatile trade environment with shifting tariff policies, which can impact the cost of imported electronics.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed significant signs of cooling as employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, falling well short of economists' forecasts. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%. Adding to the concern, the Bureau of Labor Statistics sharply revised job growth for May and June downward by a combined 258,000, indicating hiring was much weaker than previously thought. The slowdown, with an average gain of just 35,000 jobs over the last three months, raises concerns that escalating trade tariffs are beginning to have a substantial negative impact on the economy.

          <p>A growing number of allergy experts are warning that the risks associated with the common over-the-counter medication diphenhydramine, best known as Benadryl, outweigh its benefits. As a first-generation antihistamine, it can cause significant side effects like drowsiness and cognitive impairment, which can be dangerous for driving or for masking worsening allergic reactions. Experts argue that for every use case, from allergies to insomnia, newer-generation antihistamines like Zyrtec or Claritin are safer and more effective. They are calling for the drug to be moved behind the pharmacy counter to better guide patients toward safer alternatives.</p>

          <p>Amazon's stock fell about 7% despite reporting second-quarter results that beat expectations on revenue and profit. The negative market reaction was driven by weaker-than-expected profit guidance and slower growth in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud division, which trailed the growth rates of competitors Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. While the company is navigating trade tariffs effectively and increasing its capital expenditures on AI infrastructure, investors remain concerned about when these massive AI bets will translate into profit. CEO Andy Jassy defended AWS's market position, but the overall report left Wall Street underwhelmed. (not investment advice)</p>
