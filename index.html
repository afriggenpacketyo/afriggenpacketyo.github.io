          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping declared the world faces a choice between 'peace or war' and 'dialogue or confrontation' during a military parade in Beijing, commemorating the 80th anniversary of World War II's end. The event showcased China's military might and was attended by leaders including Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un. Concurrently, former U.S. President Donald Trump, in a social media post, urged Xi to acknowledge U.S. WWII contributions while alleging Beijing was conspiring against Washington, highlighting escalating geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>A brush fire erupted in the Hollywood Hills on Tuesday evening, with flames advancing uphill through dense vegetation towards several residences. The Los Angeles Fire Department reported the blaze started north of West Sunset Boulevard on Sunset Plaza Drive, with one vehicle initially catching fire. Air and ground crews from both city and county fire departments quickly responded, with helicopter water drops significantly slowing the fire's progress. Approximately 80 firefighting personnel were assigned to the quarter-acre blaze, and no structures were reported involved at the time of the article.</p>

While Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 saw modest gains, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined, and Japan's Nikkei 225 also experienced losses, reflecting a cautious regional sentiment.</p>

          <p>Australia's economy grew by 1.8% year-over-year in the second quarter, surpassing Reuters' forecast of 1.6% and marking its fastest expansion since September 2023. This growth was primarily fueled by domestic spending, including household and government consumption, despite a slight fall in public investment. The Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut rates to 3.6% and noted improved clarity on global tariffs, leading to a more optimistic outlook. Consumer and business confidence are also rising, with inflation nearing the RBA's target range. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump refuted recent speculation about his health, labeling the rumors as 'fake news' during an Oval Office appearance. The 79-year-old president stated he had a very active Labor Day weekend, engaging in media interviews and visiting his Virginia golf course. Speculation had circulated on social media due to his lack of a public schedule late last week and comments from Vice President JD Vance. Trump expressed frustration over the rapid spread of such unverified claims.</p>

While the worms cannot survive solely on a plastic diet, scientists are optimistic about developing supplements to maintain their health while they process waste.

          <p>A U.S. federal judge ruled that Google will not be forced to sell its Chrome web browser or Android operating system in a landmark antitrust case, but must share search data with competitors. The decision also bars Google from entering exclusive contracts that condition payments on default placement of its products. Google hailed the ruling as a victory, citing the transformative impact of AI on the industry. While the Department of Justice expressed concerns about the scope of the remedies, the ruling is seen as a mixed outcome, aiming to restore competition without drastic structural changes.</p>

          <p>US filmmaker Hopwood DePree has initiated a High Court legal battle against Rochdale Borough Council in England to gain control of Hopwood Hall, his ancestral stately home. DePree claims he fulfilled an agreement to buy the 15th-century building for £1 after spending seven years and £750,000 on its restoration and securing planning permission. However, the council asserts he failed to meet conditions, including providing a commercially viable business model, and locked him out in November 2024. The dispute highlights the challenges of preserving historic properties and the complexities of public-private partnerships.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that a U.S. strike on a Venezuelan vessel, described as a drug-carrying boat belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang, resulted in 11 deaths. Speaking at the White House, Trump asserted the U.S. would be on 'offense against drug cartels,' while Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated the drugs were likely headed to the Caribbean. Trump later posted a video of an exploding vessel, alleging the gang is controlled by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. This marks a significant U.S. military operation in the southern Caribbean, intensifying tensions with Venezuela.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has resumed erupting, marking its 32nd episode since December 2024, with lava fountains shooting up to 330 feet from its Halemaʻumaʻu summit crater. All lava from this ongoing eruption has remained contained within the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain the phenomenon as magma rising through narrow vents, with expanding gases creating the spectacular fountains. While the current eruption pattern is not unprecedented for Kilauea, its future trajectory remains uncertain, with possibilities ranging from a summit cessation to a prolonged leak from lower elevations, as seen in past decades.</p>

          <p>Police forces and councils nationwide have issued fresh warnings about an increase in sophisticated parking fine scams, ranging from fake text messages to tampered payment machines. Scams expert Nick Stapleton advises checking for three key details on any fine—vehicle registration, time, and location—as genuine notices always include them. He also cautions against clicking suspicious links in texts, recommending device restarts and password changes if compromised. Additionally, he warns against 'skimming devices' on parking machines, urging users to inspect for extra stickers or mismatched branding before paying.</p>

          <p>A federal judge delivered a scathing opinion, ruling that the Trump administration's deployment of National Guardsmen and Marines in Los Angeles in June was illegal, violating the Posse Comitatus Act. The ruling by Judge Charles Breyer criticized the administration's attempts to circumvent the law, which bars military involvement in domestic law enforcement. Breyer highlighted concerns about the administration's expansive views of presidential power, suggesting a move towards martial law. While the immediate deployment has ended, the ruling serves as a critical judicial check on executive authority, with implications for potential future federal interventions in other cities.</p>

Residents, frustrated by perceived government inaction, are increasingly resorting to direct confrontations, with demonstrators shouting slogans like 'Gringos leave' and damaging property. While such protests can make travelers feel unwelcome and prompt some to reconsider trips, research suggests the effects are often short-lived, with tourist arrivals continuing to rise.

Experts fear this pressure could undermine military independence and due process, especially given the ongoing purges within the Pentagon.
