          <p>Novak Djokovic commenced his US Open campaign with a challenging first-round victory against American teenager Learner Tien, securing a 6-1, 7-6 (3), 6-2 win. The 38-year-old Serb, competing in his first singles match since Wimbledon, is pursuing a record 25th major title, navigating physical issues and a time violation during the contest at Arthur Ashe Stadium. Despite a strong effort from the 19-year-old Tien, who sought to hand Djokovic his first opening-round Grand Slam loss since 2006, the veteran prevailed. Djokovic's experience and resilience were evident as he overcame a right foot blister to secure his advance, setting the tone for his quest for another major championship.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific stock markets experienced a broad rally on Monday, tracking positive movements on Wall Street, after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at a potential easing of monetary policy next month. Speaking at the annual Jackson Hole symposium, Powell's emphasis on slowing job growth, rather than tariffs or inflation, fueled investor hopes for upcoming interest rate cuts. This sentiment led to significant gains across the region, with South Korea's Kospi and Kosdaq, Japan's Nikkei 225, and China's CSI 300 all posting increases. The positive market reaction reflects expectations that central banks will prioritize economic support, though further data, like Singapore's upcoming CPI reading, remains crucial for sustained trends.

          <p>Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency, as the state's infant mortality rate has reached its highest point in over a decade, nearly doubling the national average. This crisis disproportionately impacts Black infants, who are more than twice as likely to die before their first birthday. The declaration aims to accelerate improvements in care, including expanding prenatal services in underserved counties and strengthening community health worker programs. Experts stress that structural inequities like poverty and healthcare access are root causes, compounded by federal funding cuts to vital maternal and infant health programs. Additionally, Mississippi's failure to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act leaves many low-income women uninsured, further hindering efforts to improve outcomes.</p>

          <p>Russian officials reported that Ukrainian drones caused an overnight fire at a nuclear power plant in Russia's Kursk region, an incident that coincided with Ukraine's 34th Independence Day. Although a transformer was damaged and the blaze was swiftly extinguished, authorities confirmed that radiation levels remained normal and no injuries were reported. The UN nuclear watchdog, aware of the media reports, had not independently verified the claims. Separately, a fire also erupted at the Ust-Luga fuel export terminal in Russia’s Leningrad region, which the regional governor attributed to debris from approximately ten shot-down Ukrainian drones. These events highlight the ongoing intense drone warfare between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

This marks an escalation in President Trump's intervention into the capital's policing, initially aimed at combating what he termed an "epidemic of crime." The armed troops are instructed to use their service weapons only as a last resort in response to imminent threats of death or serious bodily harm. This deployment has drawn criticism from local officials who contend that violent crime in D.C. has actually been declining for the past 18 months, contradicting the President's justification for the federal presence.</p>

This initiative seeks to provide readers with a clearer understanding of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), which aims to achieve "world-class military" status by 2049, aspiring to rival the US military. Although the PLA has not been involved in direct combat for more than four decades, its increasing intensity in exercises and the rapid expansion of its arsenal have attracted considerable global attention. The databank will serve as a comprehensive resource detailing the significant advancements and capabilities within China's armed forces.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer presents his market strategy following a substantial stock rally, which was ignited by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's signals of potential rate cuts at the Jackson Hole symposium. Powell's unexpected emphasis on slowing job growth, rather than tariff-related inflation, caught many "bear-side" hedge funds off guard, leading to a powerful market surge. Cramer advises investors to focus on sectors like housing, mergers and acquisitions, and initial public offerings, identifying companies such as Toll Brothers and Goldman Sachs as key bellwethers. He also points out potential pain points in enterprise software and healthcare, while endorsing specific tech and retail stocks. The article offers a detailed breakdown of market dynamics and investment considerations for the week ahead. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>France has formally summoned U.S. Ambassador Charles Kushner after he authored a letter to President Emmanuel Macron, accusing the country of not adequately combating rising antisemitism. The French foreign ministry swiftly rejected these allegations as "unacceptable" and a breach of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, which prohibits interference in internal state affairs. This diplomatic spat follows Macron's recent dismissal of similar criticisms from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu concerning France's plan to recognize a Palestinian state.

          <p>Chinese property developer Evergrande has been officially delisted from the Hong Kong stock market, signifying a grim milestone in its dramatic fall from a peak valuation of over $50 billion. Once China's largest real estate firm, Evergrande accumulated an staggering $300 billion in debt, ultimately leading to its demise after Beijing introduced new regulations on developer borrowing in 2020. The company was formally ordered to be wound up in January 2024, with liquidators now working to recover assets for creditors. This collapse, alongside broader issues in the property sector, has profoundly impacted China's economy, contributing to suppressed consumer spending, high local government debt, and a substantial decline in household wealth tied to property.</p>

Earlier tests this year have resulted in multiple in-flight failures and a ground explosion, raising doubts about the rapid development of the massive 403-foot-tall rocket.

While prosecutors have not confirmed if LA County's money was directly disbursed as new bribes, they seek to establish a pattern of illegal activity. Concurrently, Fox News, currently defending against a defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic, alleges that LA County's registrar-recorder may have received undisclosed gifts from the company.

Although the Biden administration reversed Trump-era restrictions on asylum for gang violence, the underlying law remains unchanged, leaving many applicants in legal uncertainty. Moreover, Trump's policies, which label some cartels as terrorist organizations, could inadvertently classify victims who were coerced into paying extortions as having provided "material support," further complicating their already backlogged cases and intensifying their fear of deportation.</p>

          <p>Lourdes, France, remains a significant site where the Catholic Church has recognized over 70 medical miracles in the past 163 years, drawing more than 3 million pilgrims annually. The Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, overseen by Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, rigorously investigates thousands of reported cure claims, with world-renowned doctors conducting extensive, decade-long scrutinies. Their strict criteria demand cures that are sudden, complete, lasting, and possess no plausible medical explanation according to current knowledge. Despite some skepticism regarding the historical scientific rigor of earlier cases, no one has successfully disproven the 72 officially recognized miracles, which include recoveries from severe conditions like osteosarcoma and paralysis, demonstrating a unique intersection of faith and scientific inquiry.</p>

          <h2>New 9/11 Evidence, Including Capitol Video, Withheld from FBI and CIA</h2>

          <p>Nearly 24 years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, new evidence has emerged, including a chilling video from 1999 of a Saudi national filming the U.S. Capitol, which was inexplicably withheld from FBI field agents and top intelligence officials. This video, along with an airplane sketch and a mathematical formula, was recovered from Omar al-Bayoumi, an alleged Saudi intelligence operative with known connections to two of the hijackers. Retired FBI and CIA officials express profound anger and surprise that such "critical evidence" was not disseminated, potentially impeding investigations and leaving the 9/11 Commission incomplete. These revelations prompt serious questions about the handling of crucial information and accountability within U.S. intelligence agencies, suggesting a significant failure in information sharing.</p>

          <p>A human case of the flesh-eating screwworm parasite has been identified in Maryland, traced to an individual who recently traveled from Guatemala, marking a significant development as the outbreak spreads northward from Central America. The New World screwworm, whose larvae burrow through living flesh and are fatal if left untreated, poses a severe threat to warm-blooded animals, particularly cattle. This detection occurs shortly after USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins announced plans for a sterile fly facility in Texas, intended to combat the pest, which could inflict an estimated $1.8 billion in losses on the state's cattle industry. The incident underscores growing concerns for both public health and agricultural stability, highlighting challenges in controlling the parasite's spread.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has accused President Trump of "manufacturing a crisis" to justify his plan to deploy federalized National Guard troops to Chicago, circumventing local authority. This proposed intervention, following similar deployments in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, has drawn strong condemnation from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who label it an abuse of power and a flagrant violation of the constitution. Trump insists that Chicago residents are "screaming for us to come" due to rampant crime, despite local statistics indicating significant reductions in gun violence. This escalating political dispute underscores a contentious battle over federal executive power, local governance, and the appropriate role of military personnel in domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse has been removed as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), with his deputy, Christine Bordine, stepping in as acting director. Congressional intelligence committee leaders were notified but given no specific reason for the ousting, beyond a Pentagon spokesman stating that "senior military leaders serve at the pleasure of President Trump and Secretary Hegseth." This follows the DIA's assessment that military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities only set back Tehran's program by months, contradicting President Trump's claim of "decades" of setback. Senator Mark Warner criticized the move as another instance of the administration treating intelligence as a "loyalty test," fueling widespread concerns among DIA employees about politicization.</p>

          <p>A homeowner faced prohibition from their Homeowners Association (HOA) against charging a visiting family member's Tesla in their driveway, not due to the electric vehicle itself, but because the Level 1 charging cable was deemed an "electrical chord running along the ground." The HOA's formal letter, which contained spelling errors, referenced NEC 625, but numerous online commenters and renewable energy engineers asserted that using manufacturer-supplied equipment for Level 1 charging is typically compliant with electrical codes. The underlying issue appears to stem from the HOA's emphasis on maintaining specific aesthetics rather than legitimate safety concerns or actual code violations, illustrating common frustrations homeowners experience with seemingly arbitrary association rules.</p>

          <p>A catastrophic and fiery crash on Interstate 15 in Temecula resulted in four fatalities when a BMW M4, reportedly driven recklessly, crossed the concrete median into oncoming southbound traffic. The BMW then collided with a Nissan Sentra, engulfing both vehicles in flames. Tragically, three passengers in the BMW—a 23-year-old woman, a 14-year-old boy, and a 15-year-old girl—lost their lives. The 25-year-old BMW driver sustained major injuries but survived, while the 35-year-old driver of the Sentra was pronounced dead en route to the hospital. Authorities are actively investigating the collision, confirming that alcohol was not a factor, and charges against the BMW driver are currently pending.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners slugger Cal Raleigh made history by hitting his 48th and 49th home runs against the Athletics, establishing a new single-season record for catchers and surpassing Salvador Perez's 2021 total. This remarkable achievement also marked Raleigh's ninth multi-home run game of the season, setting a new major league record for switch-hitters, eclipsing Mickey Mantle's 1961 record. Raleigh, a first-time All-Star and recent Home Run Derby champion, has showcased exceptional power, with 39 of his home runs occurring while playing the catcher position. His outstanding performance places him among an elite group of catchers in baseball history and positions him to potentially lead the American League outright in home runs for the season.</p>

His attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, believes ICE intends to deport him to Uganda after he declined a plea deal for deportation to Costa Rica, suggesting Uganda is being used as a "means of punishment." This ongoing legal struggle highlights significant concerns regarding due process, the potential for re-deportation to El Salvador, and the broader treatment of immigrants within the U.S. system.</p>
