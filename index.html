          <p>President Trump indicated possible news regarding a Gaza ceasefire within 24 hours during a swearing-in ceremony. The administration also announced the cessation of bombing the Houthis in Yemen, claiming their "capitulation." Furthermore, the U.S. is closely monitoring the escalating tensions between Pakistan and India following an exchange of fire. On the domestic front, Republicans are working on a comprehensive bill encompassing Trump's legislative agenda, while key officials like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are providing testimony before various committees, addressing economic and policy matters.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, remaining in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, citing increased uncertainty in the economic outlook. The Fed's statement acknowledged the volatility in trade policy, particularly President Trump's tariffs, which pose risks of both higher unemployment and inflation, potentially leading to stagflation. While the economy has shown resilience with job growth and a stable unemployment rate, inflation has been ticking lower, nearing the Fed's 2% target. The Fed will remain patient as it calibrates monetary policy amidst these fluctuating economic signals.</p>

          <p>DHS Secretary Kristi Noem visited Illinois to criticize the state's sanctuary policies, claiming they endanger citizens, while standing alongside families who have lost loved ones in incidents involving undocumented immigrants. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker responded by condemning the Trump administration's immigration policies as unconstitutional and defended the Illinois Trust Act, which limits state and local law enforcement cooperation with ICE in civil immigration enforcement. Pritzker characterized Noem's visit as a publicity stunt and accused her of performing for Fox News, while Noem's office accused Pritzker of emboldening violent criminal illegal aliens.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve pausing interest rate hikes, homeowners are weighing the options of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). Traditionally, a home equity loan was favored during rate pauses due to its fixed interest rate, providing protection against potential rate increases. However, with potential rate cuts on the horizon, a HELOC, with its variable rate, may be more advantageous as rates are expected to fall. Currently, HELOC rates are lower than home equity loan rates, potentially offering savings over the repayment period.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's decision to hold its benchmark rate steady raises questions about the future of mortgage rates. While the Fed's actions influence the broader interest rate environment, mortgage rates are more closely tied to the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield, which is affected by factors like inflation, economic growth, and investor sentiment. A rate pause could create favorable conditions for mortgage rates to decline, especially if it signals potential rate cuts later in the year. Prospective homebuyers and homeowners should improve their credit scores, shop around for offers, and consider options like rate buydowns to secure competitive mortgage rates.</p>

          <p>A son of a Mexican immigrant truck driver defends immigrant truckers against Trump's executive order cracking down on those with limited English proficiency. He recounts his father's successful 30-year career as a trucker, despite limited English, and criticizes Trump's order as xenophobic. The article highlights the contributions of immigrant truckers and challenges the notion that English proficiency is essential for safety, while pointing out that the trucking industry has become more diverse.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic, like SARS, originated in the wildlife trade, where coronaviruses jumped from bats to wild mammals and then to humans. Researchers compared the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, finding similar patterns of viral recombination and transmission through markets. The study's findings contrast with the lab leak theory, which has gained political traction amidst tensions between the U.S. and China, and underscore the risks associated with selling wildlife in urban centers.</p>

          <p>A government minister in the UK has acknowledged that more victims of the infected blood scandal will die without receiving full compensation. It's thought 30,000 patients in the UK were infected with HIV or hepatitis B and C after being treated with a contaminated blood clotting product or given a blood transfusion in the 1970s and 80s. The paymaster general Nick Thomas-Symonds agreed it was "profoundly unsatisfactory" that just 106 final compensation awards have been paid, almost a year after a damning report into the scandal was published.</p>
