          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced his intention to nominate Lindsay Halligan, one of his past defense attorneys, to serve as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. The move comes after the resignation of the previous office head, Erik Siebert, who reportedly faced pressure to prosecute one of Trump's political adversaries. In a social media post, Trump described Halligan as a "tough prosecutor" needed to provide "JUSTICE FOR ALL" in what he called a very important district. The nomination signals a significant and controversial choice for a key federal law enforcement position.</p>

          <p>Over a decade after 21-year-old Agnes Wanjiru was found dead in a septic tank in Nanyuki, Kenya, a local court has issued an arrest warrant for a British national in connection with her murder. Wanjiru was last seen leaving a bar with British soldiers, and her death has highlighted long-standing tensions and allegations of misconduct by UK troops stationed in the area. The article details the final night of Wanjiru's life and the prolonged fight for accountability by her friends and family. A potential extradition would mark a significant step towards justice in a case that has drawn attention to systemic issues.</p>

          <p>Germany's national rail operator, Deutsche Bahn, is expected to name Evelyn Palla as its first female CEO, according to media reports. Palla, who currently heads the company's regional subsidiary DB Regio, would replace Richard Lutz, who was recently dismissed amid widespread operational issues. The company has been plagued by significant delays and cancellations, which it attributes to aging infrastructure, leading to calls for major restructuring. Palla's appointment is anticipated as part of a broader plan by the German government to modernize the state-owned railway and improve its struggling performance.</p>

          <p>A cyber-attack targeting Collins Aerospace, a major provider of aviation software, caused significant flight delays and disruption at several major European airports, including Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack affected the 'Muse' software, which manages passenger check-in and baggage systems, forcing airlines to revert to manual processing and leading to long queues. The company, owned by RTX, confirmed a "cyber-related disruption" and stated it was working to resolve the issue. The incident has highlighted the vulnerability of the interconnected aviation industry to digital system failures, impacting hundreds of flights and thousands of passengers.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security is escalating its conflict with sanctuary states, issuing warnings to California, New York, and Illinois that their refusal to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement could lead to lawsuits and the loss of federal funding. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons demanded the states comply with immigration detainers, which are requests to hold individuals for federal custody. The states have argued that compliance is voluntary and that their laws limit cooperation without a judicial warrant.

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle is gaining strength in the Atlantic Ocean and is expected to become a Category 2 hurricane over the weekend, with winds potentially reaching 105 mph. According to the National Hurricane Center, the storm is projected to pass east of Bermuda, largely sparing the island a direct hit but likely generating dangerous surf and rip currents. While the U.S. mainland is not in the storm's direct path, swells could affect the East Coast north of North Carolina. The formation of the season's second hurricane is occurring nearly a month later than the historical average.</p>

          <p>An Italian woman named Giulia Baccosi has shared her story of being stranded at sea for over six months after taking a last-minute job as a cook on a cargo ship in early 2020. Shortly after the voyage began, the COVID-19 pandemic led to global lockdowns, closing ports and leaving the crew isolated in the Atlantic with dwindling supplies. During their journey, the crew also rescued 16 migrants adrift in a small boat and navigated extreme weather. The experience, detailed in a BBC podcast, highlights a unique story of human resilience, isolation, and survival during an unprecedented global crisis.</p>

          <p>A significant increase in Chinese tourism to Japan is being driven by the yen's weakness, attracting affluent travelers who are spending heavily on luxury goods, high-quality food, and cultural experiences. In the first eight months of 2025, Japan recorded over 6.7 million visits from Chinese travelers, a substantial rise from the previous year. This trend is providing a welcome boost to Japan's economy, as tourists take advantage of favorable exchange rates to purchase items they perceive as higher quality than those available at home. The influx is particularly noticeable among middle-class and wealthy families seeking premium experiences.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers All-Star catcher Will Smith has been diagnosed with a hairline fracture in his right hand, making his return for the remainder of the regular season doubtful. The injury, sustained when he was hit by a foul ball, was not detected in initial scans but was revealed in a subsequent MRI after symptoms persisted. Manager Dave Roberts stated that Smith's availability for the start of the playoffs is now "up in the air." The team will rely on backup catchers Ben Rortvedt and Dalton Rushing in his absence, a significant blow to the Dodgers' lineup as they head toward the postseason.</p>

The move, which follows a series of recent intelligence leaks, has raised concerns among press freedom advocates about potential restrictions on transparency and government accountability.</p>

          <p>Republican state senators in Oklahoma have introduced a bill that would require every public university in the state to build a memorial plaza featuring a statue of the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The legislation specifies that the memorial must include signage describing Kirk as a "modern civil rights leader" and a "martyr for truth and faith." Universities that fail to comply would face monthly fines equivalent to 1% of their budget. The proposal is part of a broader effort by some conservatives to elevate Kirk's legacy, a move that has drawn significant criticism and controversy.</p>

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard revoked the security clearances of 37 individuals last month, including senior CIA officials, without first notifying the White House, according to sources familiar with the matter. The move reportedly caused significant frustration within the administration, as it precluded a thorough vetting of the list and appeared to lack a direct presidential paper trail. The action has deepened tensions between the DNI's office and the CIA, reflecting broader friction within the intelligence community under the Trump administration. Gabbard's office claimed the revocations were aimed at individuals who had politicized intelligence.</p>

The agreement is aimed at resolving long-standing national security concerns over the Chinese-owned app's access to U.S. user data.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law that bans law enforcement officers, including federal agents, from wearing masks that obscure their identity while on duty. The "No Secret Police Act" includes exceptions for tactical situations like riots, medical needs, or approved undercover work. The legislation was motivated by recent immigration enforcement actions where masked federal agents detained individuals without clear identification. While proponents champion the law as a crucial step for transparency and accountability, it has drawn opposition from law enforcement groups citing officer safety and is expected to face legal challenges over state jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>New York's Cardinal Timothy Dolan has sparked widespread outrage after comparing the recently killed conservative activist Charlie Kirk to St. Paul during an appearance on Fox News. Dolan described Kirk as a "missionary" and a "hero," comments that were quickly condemned on social media by critics who pointed to Kirk's history of divisive and controversial rhetoric. The remarks also drew renewed attention to Dolan's own controversial history, including his handling of clergy sexual assault cases. The comparison has intensified the already polarized public discourse surrounding Kirk's legacy following his death.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications, a program widely used by technology companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers. President Trump signed a proclamation enacting the fee, which the White House says is a one-time charge for new applicants and does not apply to current visa holders or renewals. The administration argues the move will protect American jobs and discourage abuse of the system. The policy represents a dramatic overhaul of the program and is expected to significantly impact companies that rely on it to recruit global talent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to officially announce the United Kingdom's recognition of a Palestinian state, marking a major shift in British foreign policy. The decision follows a deadline set in July, which conditioned the move on Israel agreeing to a ceasefire and committing to a two-state solution. With those conditions unmet and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza worsening, the government is proceeding with the change. The announcement has been met with strong criticism from the Israeli government and some hostage families, but UK ministers argue it is a necessary step to maintain hope for a long-term peace.</p>
