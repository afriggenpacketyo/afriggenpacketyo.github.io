          <p>Japan's core inflation rate increased to 3.5% in April, marking the highest level since January 2023, driven by rising rice prices and other factors. Headline inflation remained steady at 3.6%, exceeding the Bank of Japan's 2% target for over three years. The Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled intentions to raise rates while closely monitoring the effects of U.S. tariffs. Economist Masato Koike expects core inflation to ease due to lower crude oil prices and the yen's appreciation, but the article notes that government subsidies for electricity and gas bills may also create downward pressure on inflation.</p>

          <p>A domestic policy bill passed by House Republicans would limit the power of federal judges to hold people in contempt, potentially shielding President Trump and his administration from the consequences of violating court orders. The article reports that Democrats argue the measure would rob courts of their power by stripping away consequences for officials ignoring judges' rulings. The provision would apply retroactively, including ongoing cases where judges are weighing contempt charges against Trump administration officials over deportations.</p>
