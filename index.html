        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses $1.21 trillion, many Americans are exploring debt forgiveness programs as a potential solution. These programs typically involve negotiating with creditors to settle debts for a lump sum that is less than the total amount owed, potentially reducing balances by 30% to 50% before fees. However, this strategy is not suitable for everyone, as it can negatively impact credit scores and may result in the forgiven debt being considered taxable income. The article suggests this option is best for those with significant debt who are already behind on payments and have limited alternatives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to broaden the availability of cryptocurrency within retirement plans, signaling a friendlier regulatory stance toward digital assets. This development comes as crypto ETFs, such as those for Bitcoin and Ethereum, see record inflows, offering investors a way to gain exposure without directly holding the currencies. The article discusses the growing interest in these investment vehicles for long-term portfolios, while also cautioning investors about the higher risks associated with leveraged crypto products, which are designed for short-term trading rather than stable, long-term holding.

          <p>Intel's shares experienced a notable drop after President Donald Trump publicly demanded the immediate resignation of its CEO, Lip-Bu Tan. In a social media post, Trump labeled Tan as "highly CONFLICTED," referencing concerns raised by Republican Senator Tom Cotton about the CEO's investment ties to Chinese companies. The demand introduces significant political pressure and uncertainty for the major U.S. chipmaker, which has been attempting a strategic rebound under Tan's new leadership. The company has not yet issued a formal response to the president's statement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly's stock fell approximately 13% after its experimental daily obesity pill, orforglipron, showed modest results in a late-stage trial. Patients on the highest dose lost nearly 12% of their body weight, a figure that fell short of some Wall Street analysts' expectations of around 15%. While some doctors praised the pill as a promising needle-free alternative for patients, others noted that discontinuation rates due to side effects were higher than for existing injectable treatments. The company plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval by the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The former players were seeking compensation, similar to modern NIL deals, for the use of their names, images, and likenesses over the past four decades. The judge's dismissal was based on the grounds that the argument was "untimely" and failed to demonstrate a violation of a legally enforceable right. The team, known as the "Cardiac Pack," achieved a legendary underdog victory in the 1983 NCAA tournament.</p>

          <p>Democratic Senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren are demanding internal records from UnitedHealth Group concerning a controversial program that provides financial bonuses to nursing homes for reducing hospital transfers. The inquiry follows a Guardian investigation and whistleblower complaints suggesting the initiative may prioritize profits over the health and safety of elderly residents. The senators expressed concern that the bonus structure, which caps all hospitalizations regardless of necessity, could incentivize withholding critical care. UnitedHealth defends the program, stating it aims to curb unnecessary and potentially harmful hospitalizations.</p>

          <p>A startup named Neurable is pioneering brain-computer interface technology embedded in everyday wearables, starting with a pair of headphones that can monitor the user's focus. The device uses EEG sensors to collect brainwave data and proprietary algorithms to interpret it, providing real-time feedback to help users maintain concentration. This technology represents a step toward a future where consumer gadgets can offer direct insights into cognitive well-being, potentially tracking brain health and even detecting early signs of neurological conditions without invasive procedures.</p>

          <p>In a narrowly decided vote, the Bank of England has cut its key interest rate from 4.25% to 4.0%, its lowest point since March 2023. The decision, the fifth cut since last August, aims to support a weak economy but comes as the Bank raises its inflation forecast. This move will provide some relief to homeowners with tracker mortgages but will likely result in lower returns for savers, reflecting the delicate balance policymakers are trying to strike between stimulating growth and controlling rising prices.

These alarming findings raise serious questions about the effectiveness of AI safety guardrails and the potential for harm as more young people turn to chatbots for guidance and companionship.</p>
