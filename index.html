          <h2>Trump Blames Biden for Economic Contraction, Cites Tariffs as Future Solution</h2>

          <p>President Trump responded to a Commerce Department report revealing a 0.3% contraction in the U.S. GDP during the first quarter by blaming his predecessor, Joe Biden, for the economic downturn. He defended his tariff policies, asserting they would soon stimulate economic growth as companies relocate to the USA. However, the Commerce Department attributed the GDP decline to a surge in imports made by companies anticipating the tariffs and a decrease in government spending due to contract cancellations. Trump's attempt to deflect responsibility contrasts with his previous efforts to take credit for positive market trends during Biden's term. </p>

          <p>Snap shares experienced a significant drop after the social media company chose not to provide revenue guidance for the second quarter, citing an uncertain macroeconomic environment and its potential impact on advertising demand. Snap's finance chief noted that changes to the de minimis exemption, allowing duty-free shipments under $800, are already affecting some advertisers. The company's decision reflects broader concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariff policies and a potentially weakening economy on advertising spending. Despite these concerns, Snap reported a 9% year-over-year increase in ad revenues, reaching $1.21 billion during the quarter.</p>

          <p>Amidst escalating sectarian violence near Damascus, Israel launched airstrikes targeting what it described as "operatives" attacking Druse civilians. The intervention follows clashes between pro-government fighters and Druse militia, triggered by an audio clip insulting the Prophet Muhammad. The Druse, a religious minority in Syria, have faced increasing persecution since the ouster of Bashar al-Assad by Sunni Islamist rebels. Israel, home to a significant Druse population, has offered protection to Syrian Druse, though many have declined. The airstrikes underscore Israel's concern over the security of the Druse community amidst Syria's ongoing instability.</p>

          <p>Spanish and Portuguese officials are investigating the cause of a widespread power outage that affected tens of millions of people across the Iberian Peninsula for up to 18 hours. Despite collecting extensive data, authorities have not yet determined the cause of the blackout, which disrupted essential services and transportation.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a contraction in the first quarter, declining at an annual rate of 0.3%, largely attributed to the impact of President Trump's trade policies. While underlying economic growth remained solid, the decline was driven by a surge in imports as businesses front-ran tariffs, and by decreased government spending. Experts anticipate further economic slowdown due to rising prices and uncertainty caused by the tariffs. Trump administration officials are downplaying the negative GDP figure, but economists warn of potential damage if current trade policies persist.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After years of increases, drug overdose deaths in the US have significantly declined, with recent data showing a 26% decrease in fatalities. Experts attribute this improvement to factors such as the end of pandemic isolation, increased awareness of fentanyl risks, expanded access to addiction treatments, and the widespread availability of naloxone (Narcan). However, the Trump administration is considering budget cuts that would eliminate programs providing Narcan to health centers and training for first responders. These cuts could jeopardize recent progress in curbing the opioid crisis, potentially leading to a reversal in the downward trend of overdose deaths.</p>

          <p>A recent study suggests a link between phthalates, chemicals found in plastics, and 350,000 heart disease deaths globally in 2018, with most of these deaths occurring in the Middle East and Asia. The research estimates that phthalates may account for 13% of cardiovascular deaths among 55- to 64-year-olds worldwide. While experts acknowledge the harmful effects of phthalates, they caution that the study relies on statistical modeling and assumptions, making it difficult to determine the exact number of deaths attributable to these chemicals. Further research is needed to better understand the relationship between phthalate exposure and heart health.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case concerning the eligibility of a virtual Catholic charter school in Oklahoma, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, for state funding. The central issue is whether the school's religious teachings disqualify it from receiving public funds. Lawyers for the school argued that receiving state funding does not make them a state actor and cited recent Supreme Court precedent in their favor. Justices questioned the school's policies regarding students of different religious backgrounds, particularly concerning mandatory mass attendance and adherence to church teachings.</p>

          <p>Tony Blair's recent criticism of net-zero policies has ignited debate about his progressive credentials, with critics pointing to his alignment with corporate interests and a distaste for grassroots movements. Blair argues that current net-zero policies are "doomed to fail" due to public perception of expense and difficulty. He also advises Labour to distance itself from "woke" mentality, particularly on immigration. Many attribute Blair's stance to his largest donor, Larry Ellison, a Trump-affiliated tech billionaire. The author argues that Blair's positions align with corporate interests rather than genuine progressive values.</p>

          <p>President Emmanuel Macron is attempting to improve his public image by making unannounced visits to local bars, particularly those selling tobacco and handling betting, in an effort to connect with everyday French citizens. Macron, often perceived as remote, aims to address the concerns of an anxious French population and demonstrate a bond with the people. This approach involves dispensing with the press and entourage, allowing for more genuine interactions. Despite criticism, Macron's efforts reflect a broader strategy to project authority and reassure the public amidst global uncertainties.</p>

          <p>The US economy shrank by an unforeseen 0.3% in the first three months of Donald Trump's presidency, according to preliminary data. This contraction, occurring after strong growth in late 2024, has raised worries of a US slowdown amid a global trade war. Trump blamed his predecessor, Joe Biden, for the economic downturn, while analysts attributed the decline to increased imports and decreased government spending. Stock index futures dropped following the release of the GDP figures.</p>
