          <p>Reece Galbraith was sentenced to 14 years in jail after his illegal cannabis factory exploded in a Newcastle flat, resulting in the death of seven-year-old Archie York. The explosion, caused by a build-up of butane during the production of drug-infused sweets, demolished several homes and displaced dozens of residents, costing Newcastle City Council Â£3.7 million. Archie's mother expressed her grief and anger in court, stating that Galbraith's actions had broken her family and that they would never forgive him for the death of her son. The blast also killed Jason Laws, who was working with Galbraith to manufacture the drugs.</p>

          <p>A European court ruled that the European Commission should not have denied a New York Times journalist's request for text messages exchanged between Ursula von der Leyen, president of the commission, and Pfizer's CEO, Dr. Albert Bourla, during Covid-19 vaccine negotiations in 2021. The court stated that the commission must provide credible explanations if it claims not to hold requested documents and cannot dismiss messages on major issues as short-lived or unimportant. The New York Times hailed the decision as a victory for transparency and accountability, emphasizing that public scrutiny should extend to communications like text messages. The case highlights broader concerns about transparency in negotiations involving taxpayer money and public policy.</p>

          <p>Grigory Melkonyants, the head of Russia's only independent election watchdog, Golos, was sentenced to five years in prison after being convicted of working with an "undesirable organization." The charges relate to Golos's past affiliation with the European Network of Election Monitoring Organizations, which Russian authorities deemed undesirable in 2021. Melkonyants pleaded not guilty, and his lawyer plans to appeal, calling the verdict politically motivated. Golos, which documented widespread election fraud, was labeled a "foreign agent" in 2013, and Amnesty International has recognized Melkonyants as a prisoner of conscience.</p>

          <p>Despite increasing involvement of fathers in parenting, many people still assume that mothers are the primary caregivers, leading to frustrating experiences for both parents. Schools, doctors' offices, and even strangers often contact mothers first, regardless of parental preferences or availability. Research shows that principals are more likely to call mothers back than fathers, even when fathers indicate greater availability. This default assumption can disrupt mothers' work lives and reinforce outdated gender roles, while also undermining fathers' active involvement in their children's lives, the article suggests.</p>

          <p>A recent resources deal between the U.S. and Ukraine is expected to pave the way for more "minerals for muscle" agreements, where minerals and geopolitics are closely intertwined. The agreement aims to deepen economic ties and position Ukraine as a supplier of strategically important minerals to the U.S. Experts suggest similar deals could emerge with countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, leveraging their natural resources for security or trade benefits. However, some analysts are skeptical about widespread adoption, citing resource nationalism as a counter trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Raphael Warnock argues that Republican-proposed Medicaid work requirements would negatively impact hardworking individuals, potentially causing them to lose health care coverage.

Warnock contends that providing health care coverage without these requirements encourages people to work and strengthens the economy. A Republican House budget resolution includes $880 billion in spending cuts, with work requirements being considered as eligibility policies.</p>

This approach, along with his past actions regarding the emoluments clause, demonstrates a willingness to prioritize his interests over the spirit of the law.
