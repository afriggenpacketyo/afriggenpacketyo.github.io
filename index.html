          <p>Following the Colorado Buffaloes' first season loss to Georgia Tech, former quarterback Shedeur Sanders voiced his support for the team. The game marked the team's first outing without Sanders and Travis Hunter, who both entered the NFL Draft. Despite the 27-20 defeat, Sanders stated on social media that the team will "figure things out" under the leadership of his father, head coach Deion Sanders. Coach Sanders echoed this sentiment, noting the game was closely contested and that the team needs to capitalize on opportunities moving forward.</p>

          <p>Iran-backed Houthi rebels have announced that an Israeli airstrike in Sanaa, Yemen, killed Ahmed al-Rahawi, the prime minister of their rebel-controlled government. The strike, which occurred on Thursday, also reportedly killed several other ministers during a government workshop. The Israeli military confirmed it conducted a precise strike on a Houthi military target in the area. This event marks a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict, where Houthis have been launching attacks against Israel in what they describe as solidarity with Palestinians.</p>

          <p>The USS Lake Erie, a U.S. guided-missile cruiser, was observed crossing the Panama Canal into the Caribbean, following the deployment of other American warships near Venezuela. The U.S. has stated the naval deployment is part of an anti-drug trafficking operation, amid accusations against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. This move has escalated tensions, with Maduro mobilizing militia members and asserting that an American invasion is impossible. The deployment is part of the Trump administration's broader strategy of applying "maximum pressure" on Venezuela and targeting Latin American drug cartels.</p>

          <p>Andriy Parubiy, a prominent Ukrainian politician and former speaker of the parliament, was shot and killed in the western city of Lviv. Unverified footage suggests the gunman was disguised as a courier and approached Parubiy on the street before fleeing. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack as a "terrible murder," and a major manhunt is underway. Parubiy was a key figure in the 2014 Euromaidan protests and had been actively involved in Ukraine's defense since the 2022 full-scale Russian invasion, making his assassination a significant political event.</p>

          <p>Receding water levels in Iraq's largest reservoir, the Mosul Dam, have revealed 40 ancient tombs believed to be over 2,300 years old. The discovery was made in the Khanke region of Duhok province as a result of a severe, five-year drought that has plagued the country. Archaeologists were able to access the site after water levels dropped to historic lows, allowing for excavation of the Hellenistic-period tombs. While the drought has had devastating effects on agriculture and electricity, it has paradoxically created opportunities for significant archaeological finds in the region.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has reportedly rejected a proposal from Crystal Palace that would have sent defender Joe Gomez to the London club on loan as part of a deal for Marc Guehi. Crystal Palace is exploring options as Guehi has indicated he will not sign a new contract, making a transfer likely to avoid losing him on a free transfer next summer. While Palace was reportedly open to a deal around £30 million plus the Gomez loan, Liverpool is not currently interested in letting Gomez leave. The situation highlights the complex negotiations underway as the transfer window deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old British man has died in the Spanish resort town of Benidorm after going for a swim on Friday evening.

An alarm was raised, and after a search by the coastguard proved unsuccessful, his body was later found on the shoreline.

          <p>A federal appeals court in Washington D.C. has ruled that President Donald Trump exceeded his presidential powers by imposing broad tariffs in April under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The 7-4 decision stated that the law does not grant the president the authority to impose taxes or tariffs, voiding the measures that affected nearly all U.S. trading partners. The court has stayed its ruling until October 14, allowing the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court, which will likely have the final say on the legality of the trade policy.</p>

          <p>The Utah Supreme Court has stayed the execution of Ralph Leroy Menzies, a 67-year-old inmate who was scheduled to be executed by firing squad. His attorneys successfully argued that his severe dementia renders him incompetent to be executed, as he cannot understand the reason for his punishment. Menzies was convicted for the 1986 murder of Maurine Hunsaker. The court's decision sends the case back to a lower court to re-evaluate his competency, acknowledging the legal precedent that executing individuals who cannot comprehend their fate may constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</p>

In response to the widespread criticism and a call from President Trump to "Make Cracker Barrel a WINNER again," the company announced it would restore its classic "Old Timer" logo.

However, councils like Epping Forest and West Northamptonshire argue that using hotels for asylum accommodation creates public safety risks and violates planning laws.

          <p>Photographer Zed Nelson's new book, "The Anthropocene Illusion," examines the paradoxical ways humans interact with the natural world they are actively altering. Instead of focusing on large-scale environmental destruction, Nelson captures curated and artificial versions of nature, from tourists recreating movie scenes in Kenya to elephants chained in a river for Instagram photos. His work highlights how zoos, theme parks, and even national parks can create a false sense of security that nature is being preserved. The project serves as a commentary on the loss of genuine connection to the wild and our tendency to replace it with manufactured experiences.</p>

The author argues that the dehumanization of Palestinians is a deliberate, long-standing project that renders their suffering and testimony unconvincing to Western audiences. The piece criticizes the media for framing the conflict as starting on October 7, 2023, without the broader context of decades of occupation. It concludes that the recent shift in discourse is not due to a moral awakening but rather a calculated response to more "photogenic" forms of suffering like starvation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's efforts to influence the Federal Reserve, including the attempted removal of Governor Lisa Cook, represent a significant challenge to the central bank's long-held political independence. A successful move to gain a voting majority on the Fed's Board of Governors could grant the administration control over key economic levers, including interest rates and bank regulations. While the administration frames its actions as necessary reform, critics and legal scholars warn that politicizing the Fed could undermine the stability of the U.S. financial system and risk long-term economic credibility.

The indictment alleges the workers misled officials about the quantity of fuel leaked months before the contamination crisis, stating 1,618 gallons had leaked instead of the actual 20,000 gallons.

The airline's previous Chapter 11 process, which ended in March, was insufficient to solve its financial issues.

          <p>An opinion article by an attorney who argued key flag-burning cases before the Supreme Court analyzes President Trump's recent executive order targeting the act. The author explains that the Supreme Court has twice affirmed that flag-burning is a form of protected speech under the First Amendment. The executive order's directive to prosecute under general "content-neutral" burning laws is likely to fail, as it provides defendants with a strong "selective prosecution" defense by openly stating the government's message-based motive. The piece concludes the order is an empty threat that will likely encourage more protest-burnings rather than prevent them.</p>

These findings are expected to reshape international treatment guidelines, which have long recommended the drug.
