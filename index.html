            <p>Christian leaders are appealing to the Trump administration to reconsider the deportation of Afghan Christians, citing the risk of persecution under the Taliban. The Department of Homeland Security plans to terminate humanitarian parole for Afghan nationals, affecting approximately 9,000 individuals, including hundreds of Christian converts. Advocates are requesting a 90-day pause on deportations to allow for legal pathways or protections, emphasizing the moral imperative to protect those facing torture or death for their faith. Rev. Franklin Graham indicated a possible extension until July to resolve visa issues.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is escalating its conflict with the judicial branch over the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, defying court orders to facilitate his return. An appeals court warned about the peril of defying court orders, emphasizing the importance of due process. Despite the rulings, the administration has signaled it will not comply, with the White House stating Abrego Garcia is "never coming back." The case raises concerns about the administration's willingness to disregard legal norms and the rights of individuals within the U.S. jurisdiction.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is implementing a rule change to make it easier to fire thousands of federal workers by stripping them of civil service protections. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) proposed a rule reclassifying career civil servants as "at-will" employees, allowing for quicker removal for poor performance or subversion of presidential directives. The White House claims this addresses unaccountable employees who prioritize their interests over the American people. Critics argue the move will erode the merit-based hiring system and undermine the professional civil service.</p>
