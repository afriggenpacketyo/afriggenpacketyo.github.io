            <p>OpenAI has filed a lawsuit against Elon Musk, alleging that he has engaged in an 'unlawful campaign of harassment' against the company. The lawsuit claims Musk has used press attacks, social media campaigns, and legal claims to harm OpenAI, particularly after his rival AI company, xAI, failed to acquire OpenAI. OpenAI seeks punitive damages and an injunction to stop Musk from further interfering with its operations, claiming he could not tolerate seeing the success of OpenAI after abandoning it. The lawsuit highlights the ongoing tensions between Musk and OpenAI, particularly concerning OpenAI's close relationship with Microsoft.</p>

            <p>The Justice Department is seeking to dismiss its case against Henrry Jose Villatoro Santos, a Salvadoran national accused of being an MS-13 leader in Virginia. Despite Attorney General Pam Bondi's prior public statements about Villatoro Santos being a top MS-13 leader, the DOJ now intends to pursue his deportation instead of prosecution. Villatoro Santos' defense attorney is attempting to delay the dismissal, fearing unlawful deportation to El Salvador without due process, citing a previous incident where another Salvadoran man was mistakenly deported. Authorities initially arrested Santos on firearms possession charges following an FBI raid.</p>

            <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has delayed a vote on the Senate-approved GOP budget blueprint, which is designed to fund President Trump's agenda, due to internal disagreements among House Republicans. Johnson aims to resolve the issues before the House enters its two-week April recess, potentially through amendments or a conference with the Senate. The postponement highlights divisions within the Republican caucus, with some members expressing distrust of the Senate's version of the bill. The move could potentially stall Trump's legislative priorities if a compromise is not reached swiftly.</p>

            <p>Consumer prices in China fell by 0.1% year-on-year in March, indicating increasing deflationary pressures, while producer prices experienced a larger-than-expected drop of 2.5%. This contraction in producer prices marks the 29th consecutive month of decline. The data comes as trade tensions between the U.S. and China escalate, with President Trump raising tariffs on Chinese imports. Chinese policymakers are attempting to boost domestic consumption, including doubling subsidies for a consumer trade-in program, to counter deflationary pressures and meet the country's ambitious growth target of around 5% (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>A group of UK MPs is calling for a levy on streaming services' revenue to support British TV production, arguing that the rise of platforms like Netflix and Amazon is threatening the creation of distinctly British content. The Culture, Media and Sport Committee suggests streamers pay 5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund to finance dramas with specific interest to British audiences. Industry bodies like COBA warn the levy could damage streamers' investment in the UK and raise costs for consumers. The call for greater help comes after reports of a significant decrease in domestic high-end TV productions made in the UK.</p>

The White House declined to comment on the private call but criticized McMaster, who has been outspoken about Trump's views on Putin.</p>

Residents in the historically Black area, already burdened by industrial pollution, are concerned about increased cancer and asthma rates.

This shift suggests a focus on addressing what Trump views as unfinished business from his first term, aiming to reshape global trade centered on China. The move is driven by Trump's belief that China's economic rise has hollowed out the American economy, but the long-term impact depends on China's willingness to negotiate and make significant concessions (not investment advice).</p>

Shriner, an author, was allegedly seen holding a handgun and pointing it at officers, who ordered her to drop the weapon before firing. She was transported to a hospital and later booked for attempted murder. The incident occurred after police responded to a hit-and-run on the 134 Freeway, with the suspect found hiding near Shriner's residence.</p>

            <p>A bill requiring voter ID and proof of citizenship to register to vote in California was rejected by lawmakers, prompting Assemblymember Carl DeMaio to announce a campaign to qualify the proposal as a statewide ballot initiative for the 2026 election. The bill failed due to concerns that it would disenfranchise eligible voters and embolden false claims about election security. DeMaio argues that requiring voter ID is a nonpartisan issue and that voters demand more integrity from elections. Opponents claim it amounts to an unconstitutional poll tax and would disenfranchise vulnerable groups.</p>

            <p>Ascent, a 284-foot luxury apartment building in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is the world's tallest timber-concrete hybrid structure, showcasing the potential of mass timber construction. Developers say building with wood offers advantages over steel and concrete, including a lower carbon footprint and easier deconstruction. Mass timber is strong, light, and cheaper to produce than steel and concrete, with pre-fabricated pieces assembled by a small crew in just six months. The project demonstrates the feasibility and safety of mass timber construction, with plans for similar projects across the country.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

However, experts caution against comparing the U.S. to the entire European region, noting disparities in healthcare access and vaccination coverage. While the U.S. currently has more than 600 measles cases this year, most linked to an outbreak in Texas, experts believe the case counts are significantly higher than reported.</p>

A survey indicates that most schools already limit phone use. Dame Rachel emphasized the need for parents to manage children's online habits at home and for technology companies to ensure online safety. While supporting head teachers' autonomy, the report also recommends further research into potential benefits of broader restrictions on children's phone use.</p>
