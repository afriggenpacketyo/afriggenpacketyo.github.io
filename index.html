          <p>An opinion article argues that the world is facing a renewed and escalating nuclear threat, highlighted by Russia's withdrawal from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. The author points to a frantic arms race in Europe and Asia, with leaders like Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump engaging in dangerous rhetoric. The piece notes the significant increase in global spending on nuclear weapons and the deployment of new missile systems by NATO and Russia, viewing them not just as deterrents but as potential offensive weapons. It laments the public's seeming complacency compared to the anti-nuclear protests of the Cold War era.</p>

          <p>A BBC journalist provides a first-person account of a year-long undercover investigation into a violent migrant-smuggling operation in northern France. Posing as a Syrian refugee, the reporter describes the immense personal risks, the intricate planning involved, and the constant fear of having his cover blown while gathering evidence. He details the methods used to gain the trust of a senior gang member, including using multiple phones and fabricated backstories, all while a high-risk advisory team monitored his safety. The investigation, which culminated in a secret meeting in a forest hideout, has already led to one arrest in the UK.</p>

          <p>A shooting in a Baltimore neighborhood on Saturday night left six people wounded, including a five-year-old girl who was struck in the hand. According to the Baltimore Police Commissioner, the incident occurred as a group of people were gathered outside for a crab feast when a suspect opened fire. A 38-year-old man is reported to be in critical condition, while the other victims, including the young girl, sustained non-life-threatening injuries. Police are still investigating the incident and have not yet released information about a suspect or motive for the attack.</p>

          <p>A report details the significant barriers female refugees face when trying to enter the German workforce, where their unemployment rate is much higher than that of their male counterparts. Many women arrive with children and limited childcare options, making it difficult to attend language courses or training programs. Additionally, the complex process of getting foreign qualifications recognized in Germany forces many to start their careers over. The article highlights several publicly funded projects and non-profit organizations that provide counseling, job fairs, and mentorship to help these women overcome these obstacles and achieve economic independence.</p>

          <p>Key European allies, including the UK, France, and Germany, have issued a joint statement insisting that any peace talks between the U.S. and Russia must involve Ukraine. The statement comes as President Donald Trump prepares for a meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, raising concerns that a deal could be made without Kyiv's input. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly rejected any potential agreements made without his country's participation, particularly in response to suggestions of territorial swaps. European leaders emphasized that international borders should not be changed by force and that their support for Ukraine remains steadfast.</p>

          <p>Liu Jianchao, a senior Chinese diplomat and head of the Communist Party's international liaison department, has reportedly been taken in for questioning by authorities. Liu, who was widely considered a leading candidate for China's next foreign minister, was detained after returning to Beijing from an overseas trip in late July. His high-profile diplomatic activities, including meetings with top U.S. officials, had fueled speculation about his ascent within the government. This development marks the most significant probe involving a Chinese diplomat since the ousting of former Foreign Minister Qin Gang in 2023.</p>

This production is part of a broader effort by the Chinese government to counter Western criticism of its policies in Xinjiang and to promote a unified national identity.

A key piece of evidence, a small metal part of the door lock found under Pennig's head, suggested the door was broken down before she was shot.

          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, which experienced a renaissance after the 2008 recession, is now facing a significant slowdown. A combination of post-pandemic economic decline, inflation, and shifting consumer habits has led to a sharp drop in sales growth. The situation is exacerbated by global trade disputes, with potential retaliatory tariffs from the EU and a halt on imports in Canada threatening a key export market. This economic pressure has resulted in an oversupply of bourbon, leading to falling prices and financial distress for some distilleries, with several recent bankruptcies and facility closures.

          <p>Ali Akbar, believed to be the last traditional newspaper hawker in France, is set to receive the National Order of Merit, one of the country's highest honors. For over 50 years, the 72-year-old has been a beloved figure on the streets of Paris's Left Bank, selling copies of Le Monde. Despite the dramatic decline in sales due to the rise of digital media, he continues his work for the joy and independence it brings.

          <p>Four months after a warning from entrepreneur Mark Cuban, major corporations like Procter & Gamble are announcing price hikes on everyday consumer goods, attributing the increases to the financial impact of tariffs. P&G plans to raise prices on about 25% of its products, including well-known brands like Tide and Crest, by an average of 2.5%. This trend is expected to continue across the retail sector, with Walmart already increasing prices on various items. The article notes that these increases will further stretch consumers who are already dealing with economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>
