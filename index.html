          <p>Following U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran launched approximately 30 missiles at Israel, impacting several cities and wounding at least 21 people, some seriously. The missile strikes followed President Trump's announcement that the U.S. had conducted strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites in response to escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. Israel's defense forces are investigating why alert sirens did not activate in Haifa, one of the impacted areas, during the missile barrage. The attacks have resulted in significant damage to buildings and ongoing search and rescue operations for individuals trapped under rubble. The situation remains tense as both sides assess the damage and potential for further escalation.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance clarified that the U.S. military action against Iranian nuclear sites does not constitute a war with Iran itself, but rather a targeted effort against Iran's nuclear program. Vance asserted that the strikes had significantly hindered Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future. He made these remarks in an interview on ABC News' "This Week," emphasizing the precision and limited scope of the operation. The Vice President's comments aim to define the U.S. involvement and reassure the public about the administration's objectives.</p>

          <p>Senior Pentagon officials have disclosed details regarding the U.S. military operation, dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer," which targeted three nuclear sites in Iran. The mission involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers and over 125 U.S. aircraft, employing precision-guided weapons and deception tactics to ensure mission success. According to Gen. Dan Caine, the operation inflicted "extremely severe damage and destruction" on the targeted sites. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth lauded the attack as an "incredible and overwhelming success," emphasizing that the operation did not target Iranian troops or civilians, but rather the Iranian nuclear program.</p>

          <p>The shooting of an Indiana kidney doctor has brought renewed attention to concerns about the dialysis industry and its prioritization of profits over patient care. Tom Mueller, author of "How to Make a Killing: Blood, Death and Dollars in American Medicine," notes similarities to the emotions expressed after a previous shooting related to healthcare issues. The prosecutor in the case expressed concern over growing vigilante violence, while Mueller emphasized the need to address systemic harm within the medical profession. The incident has reignited discussions about the quality of care in for-profit dialysis clinics and the broader issues within the American healthcare system.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, calling them a "spectacular military success." The strikes targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with the objective of destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity.

Iran has pledged to retaliate if the U.S. joined the Israeli assault, which began with airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites and military targets on June 13.

          <p>The Trump administration's efforts to defund and demolish Black arts and culture are rooted in a fear of Black power, not merely a dislike of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. The Black Arts Movement (BAM) demonstrated the political power of culture in the hands of subjugated peoples, challenging the myth of white cultural superiority. Trump's attacks on institutions like the Kennedy Center, Library of Congress, and Smithsonian Institution are aimed at suppressing knowledge and expression deemed anti-white. By reducing Black culture to diversity and inclusion efforts, the true political potential of Black artistry is undermined, playing directly into Trump's agenda.</p>

          <p>South Korea is set to enter the global competition to develop sixth-generation fighter aircraft, according to a senior aerospace executive. Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI) is showcasing technology at the Paris Air Show, including 4.5-generation fighters and unmanned aerial vehicles, which will contribute to the development of sixth-generation fighters. This move aligns South Korea with other nations, such as China and the United States, who are also pursuing advanced fighter programs. KAI's display included the KF-21 Boramae fighter jet, FA-50 light combat aircraft, and next-generation unmanned combat aircraft, highlighting crewed-uncrewed teaming capabilities.</p>

          <p>The United States has launched strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran, escalating the conflict between the U.S., Israel, and Iran. President Trump announced the strikes, stating that the U.S. had hit Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, and that all planes had safely returned. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said that the attack "devastated" and "obliterated" the Iranian nuclear program. The attack involved B-2 bombers dropping "bunker-buster" bombs and a U.S. submarine launching Tomahawk missiles.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has warned of a "risk of escalation" in the Middle East following US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and called for a return to negotiations. The UK government has "taken all necessary measures" to protect UK interests in the region, and is focused on de-escalation. The US said it had carried out strikes on three nuclear facilities in Iran: Natanz, Isfahan and Fordo on Saturday night, and US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes "devastated the Iranian nuclear programme". Iran has claimed its nuclear ambitions are peaceful and recent uranium enrichment to 60% was done as part of a research and development programme.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on nuclear facilities in Iran, the U.S. Defense Secretary claimed that Iran's nuclear program has been "devastated". Digital alerts sounded in Israel, followed by air raid sirens warning of incoming missiles. One Israeli citizen stated, “I think we all waited for Trump to help us. I thought it would take more time, but here they are actually helping us now”. Another Israeli citizen said she feels that this conflict is much more destructive than previous ones with the militant group Hamas in Gaza or the Lebanese group Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that the US has carried out a "successful" bombing attack on three nuclear sites in Iran and said they have been "obliterated". Israel says they were in "full co-ordination" with the US in planning the strikes. The US said it also hit two other nuclear sites - at Natanz and Isfahan. US Gen Dan Caine, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said Operation Midnight Hammer involved 125 US military aircraft including seven B-2 stealth bombers. The Iranian Atomic Energy Organization said the bombing of the three nuclear sites was a "barbaric violation" of international law.</p>

Some analysts believe that striking Iran at this time was the right decision, while others worry about the unilateral nature of the action and its potential impact on US power. The strike has been opposed by some within the Trump administration and in MAGA media. The attack on Iran may be the first time that President Trump has ever done anything Vladimir Putin did not want him to do.</p>

          <p>U.S. military strikes that President Trump said "obliterated" Iran's main nuclear sites will test the view that attacks can delay a nuclear program but not kill a determined push for atom bombs. Many officials and nuclear experts have warned that it is hard to eliminate the knowledge a country has acquired. The Arms Control Association said the strikes will set Iran's program back, but at the cost of strengthening Tehran's resolve to reconstitute its sensitive nuclear activities. The IAEA has not been able to carry out inspections in Iran since the first Israeli strikes nine days ago, but has said it is in contact with the Iranian authorities.</p>

Experts warn that more deaths are likely amid the current administration’s “mass deportation” push. The death occurred as private companies with little to no oversight are increasingly tasked with transporting more immigration detainees across the US. The system is so loaded with people, exacerbating bad conditions – it’s like a ticking time bomb.</p>
