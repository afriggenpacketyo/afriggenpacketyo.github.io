          <p>Despite Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's efforts to avoid direct criticism of Donald Trump during his re-election campaign, Trump's global policies became a factor in the election. Voters, concerned about the rising cost of living, were wary of conservative opposition leader Peter Dutton's alignment with Trump's ideas. Trump's tariff decisions and their impact on retirement accounts influenced voters to support Albanese and the Labor Party, leading to a significant victory. Dutton's defeat in his own parliamentary seat further underscored the repudiation of Trump-like policies in Australia, indicating a preference for sensible, centrist politics.</p>

          <p>A ballistic missile launched by the Houthi militia in Yemen struck near Israel's Ben Gurion Airport, causing a temporary suspension of flights and at least four injuries. The missile evaded Israel's defense systems, marking a significant success for the Houthis and a serious failure for Israel's defenses. Prime Minister Netanyahu convened an emergency security cabinet meeting, and Defense Minister Katz vowed a strong response. The Houthi military claimed responsibility, warning international airlines to avoid the airport.

          <p>Students at Hunan University in China recreated a rice dish from a 2,000-year-old bamboo manuscript called the "Shi Fang." The ancient recipe, using wooden steamers and clay pots, produced rice that was loose yet elastic with a lower sugar content than modern rice. The students soaked the rice for half an hour, steamed it for 20 minutes, cooled it, added water, and steamed it again for 15 minutes. Researchers combined Han-era techniques with modern technology to deepen their appreciation for traditional Chinese culture.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County officials have approved a $4 billion settlement to compensate nearly 7,000 victims of sexual assault in county-run juvenile facilities and foster homes, but some victims say the money will never rectify the system that hurt vulnerable children and protected their abusers. Many of the claims centered around the MacLaren Children's Center, where victims described being drugged and abused by carers. While reforms are planned, some victims emphasize the need for those responsible for the abuse to be held accountable, as the settlement alone does not provide closure.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticized President Trump's proposed budget cuts to Medicaid, Social Security, and veterans' services at a town hall in California. Jeffries vowed that Democrats would do everything they can to stop the reckless and extreme budget, arguing that it would hurt vulnerable Americans and lead to hospital closures. He described the budget as un-American and unconscionable. Rep. Raul Ruiz also expressed concern about the potential impact of the cuts on healthcare access.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as Health and Human Services Secretary, is facing criticism for budget cuts and undermining vaccination science. A leaked budget proposes cutting a program that distributes naloxone kits, and Kennedy has not offered full-throated support for the program. Programs on smoking cessation, diabetes prevention, and cancer screenings have been canceled, and he has hired a vaccine skeptic to conduct a study on whether vaccines and autism are linked. This is a dangerous approach to public health that puts Americans at risk.</p>

          <p>Apple has invested heavily in Hollywood through Apple TV+, aiming to be a haven for original, high-quality content. While it has achieved critical success with shows like "Severance" and "Ted Lasso," its subscriber base remains smaller than competitors like Netflix. Some analysts question whether the quality-over-quantity approach is sustainable, noting that Apple TV+ is reportedly losing $1 billion a year. However, Apple views Apple TV+ as part of a broader strategy to grow its subscription services business and enhance its brand.</p>
