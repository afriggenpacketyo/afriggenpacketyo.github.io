He emphasized the need for Canadians to support each other and fight back against what he views as Trump's betrayal and threats to Canada's sovereignty. Carney's campaign strategy involved portraying himself as the leader best equipped to handle Trump's policies, uniting voters from various political backgrounds, including those concerned about Canada's independence from the United States.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the reinstatement of over 1,000 Voice of America (VoA) employees, following an earlier court ruling that had temporarily stayed Donald Trumpâ€™s executive order to dismantle the US taxpayer-funded news service. The court's decision deferred to the executive branch on employment matters, making it unlikely that the broadcasters will return to work until the case is resolved. This ruling is a setback for the VoA, while the Trump administration's freeze on funding for other publicly funded broadcasters remains in place.</p>

          <p>As Europe commemorates VE Day, there are concerns about the state of transatlantic relations due to President Trump's policies and rhetoric. The article explores how Trump's apparent respect for Putin and threats to close allies have shaken the alliance. While the US helped rebuild Europe after WWII and provided security guarantees, this was also driven by concerns about the spread of communism. Now, with no common enemy, the friendship is fraying, and many Europeans view the White House as a threat to peace and security.</p>

          <p>The Reform party performed well in recent local council elections, securing the most votes and seats, suggesting their success is more than a short-lived protest. The party's support is concentrated among those who voted for Brexit and Boris Johnson, indicating a significant division in British politics. Reform did particularly well in working-class areas with fewer university graduates and a more conservative outlook on immigration. Both the Conservatives and Labour need to appeal to this demographic to recover from their losses.</p>

          <p>Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 for home-schooled students. Democrats argue that the legislation will hurt public schools and primarily benefit wealthier students already in private schools.
