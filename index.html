          <p>The U.S. military conducted another airstrike in the Caribbean targeting a vessel alleged to be involved in drug trafficking. For the first time in this series of strikes, a U.S. official has confirmed there are survivors. This development comes as the Trump administration continues to defend the operations as necessary to combat narcoterrorism, despite criticism and calls for evidence. Venezuela has strongly condemned the strikes, accusing the U.S. of carrying out extrajudicial executions of civilians in international waters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has refused the Trump administration's request to lift an order that prevents the president from deploying National Guard troops within Illinois. The court found that the deployment was a "likely violation" of the Tenth Amendment and that there was insufficient evidence of a "rebellion" to justify such federal action. The ruling maintains the block on deploying federalized Guardsmen, a move President Trump had justified for crime prevention and protecting federal immigration facilities. The judges asserted that political opposition and protests do not constitute a rebellion.</p>

          <p>Following a military coup prompted by youth-led protests, Colonel Michael Randrianirina has been sworn in as the new president of Madagascar. The takeover has drawn international condemnation from both the United Nations and the African Union, which has suspended the country's membership. Former President Andry Rajoelina has fled the country, stating his life was in danger, and was subsequently impeached in absentia by the new military leadership. The political situation in the nation remains unstable.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump to advocate for the provision of long-range Tomahawk missiles. This high-stakes meeting occurs just after Trump announced "great progress" in a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with plans for a face-to-face summit in Hungary. The timing presents a complex diplomatic situation, as Zelensky seeks advanced weaponry to counter Russia while Trump simultaneously pursues renewed dialogue with Putin, creating uncertainty about the future of U.S. support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Pensana, a company developing a rare earths mine in Angola, has scrapped its plans to build a major processing refinery in East Yorkshire, England. The project was intended to give the UK a strategic position in the industry, which is heavily dominated by China. The company cited a lack of sufficient government support, stating that refining in the UK was uneconomic without it, and will now seek investment in the United States instead. This decision is a setback for the UK's critical minerals strategy and efforts to secure its own supply chains.</p>

          <p>The UK Prime Minister has called the decision to prohibit Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters from attending a Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham "wrong." The ban was recommended by the city's Safety Advisory Group and supported by West Midlands Police, who cited public safety concerns and classified the fixture as "high-risk." The move has sparked a political debate about antisemitism and public safety, with critics arguing it sends a shameful message, while a local MP welcomed it due to latent security risks.</p>

          <p>A new scientific study published in the journal Nature highlights the dual environmental threat facing Shanghai, one of several major coastal cities that is both sinking and experiencing rising sea levels. The research indicates that the city's subsidence, or sinking, is largely attributable to human activities. Delta cities like Shanghai are naturally prone to sinking due to being built on soft sediment, but this process is being accelerated. This combination of factors presents a significant long-term risk to the city's infrastructure and population.</p>

          <p>In their only debate, Virginia's incumbent Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares and Democratic challenger Jay Jones clashed over violent text messages sent by Jones. Miyares argued the texts, which included a wish for "two bullets to the head" of a former Republican House Speaker, disqualified Jones from being the state's top prosecutor. Jones apologized for the messages but also criticized Miyares for not holding President Trump accountable for his own extreme rhetoric. The issue has become a central point of contention in the highly competitive statewide race.</p>
