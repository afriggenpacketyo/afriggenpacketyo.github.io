          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from withholding federal grant money from 34 cities and counties with "sanctuary" policies. The ruling by Judge William Orrick protects hundreds of millions of dollars in Housing and Urban Development (HUD) grants that the administration sought to cut as part of its effort to compel local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's broader campaign against sanctuary jurisdictions across the United States.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Defence Secretary has authorized National Guard personnel in Washington D.C. to carry their service weapons as part of the Trump administration's ongoing crime crackdown in the capital. This decision reverses a previous Pentagon statement that the approximately 2,000 deployed troops would be unarmed. While the administration claims the mission has brought "total safety" to the city, the move is deeply unpopular with local residents and has drawn criticism from Mayor Muriel Bowser and other Democratic leaders who fear it could escalate tensions.</p>

          <p>A Florida judge has denied bond for Rajinder Singh, an undocumented immigrant from India accused of causing a fatal crash on the Florida Turnpike that killed three people. The judge ruled that Singh is a substantial flight risk and found probable cause for all six charges against him, including three counts of vehicular homicide and three counts of manslaughter. The crash occurred when Singh allegedly attempted an illegal U-turn in his semi-truck, blocking the highway and causing a minivan to collide with his trailer.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Justice Department has stated it will not defend a federal grant program for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), arguing it is unconstitutional. In a memo to Congress, the department sided with a lawsuit filed by Tennessee and an anti-affirmative action group, which claims the program gives an unfair advantage based on ethnicity. The program, which provides about $350 million annually to over 500 colleges with at least 25% Hispanic undergraduate enrollment, is now being defended in court by the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities.</p>

          <p>Newly released transcripts from a prison interview reveal Ghislaine Maxwell told U.S. officials she never witnessed inappropriate conduct by Donald Trump or Bill Clinton with Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, also claimed that a rumored Epstein "client list" does not exist and called allegations against Prince Andrew "inconceivable." The 300-page document details her statements on various high-profile individuals and events, including her denial that she introduced Prince Andrew to Epstein and her belief that Epstein did not die by suicide.</p>

          <p>Despite not being the newest or most powerful missiles in its arsenal, China's DF-31 series of intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) remains a highly effective nuclear deterrent. These mobile, solid-fuel missiles are capable of reaching the U.S. mainland, providing the People's Liberation Army with a credible second-strike capability. A recent full-range test, the first of its kind since 1980, demonstrated this capacity and sent a significant geopolitical signal about China's strategic military strength and readiness to counter potential threats.</p>

          <p>Some businesses across the U.S. are bringing back "recession specials," offering discounted meals and events that echo promotions from the 2008 financial crisis. This trend, seen in coffee shops, bars, and restaurants from New York to San Francisco, reflects growing economic anxiety among consumers. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index has fallen, driven by concerns over trade policy and expectations of a broader economic slowdown. These marketing tactics tap into public sentiment and may be a reaction to an anticipated pullback in consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the face of increasingly powerful and costly hurricanes, Florida is seeing a shift toward more resilient construction and community planning. The town of Babcock Ranch, designed to be "storm-proof," successfully weathered Hurricane Ian with minimal damage due to features like native landscaping, advanced stormwater systems, and reinforced homes. This has drawn new residents from devastated coastal areas. Meanwhile, nonprofits and city programs in places like Miami are helping low-income residents rebuild or retrofit their homes to be stronger and more resistant to future storms.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers and immigrant rights advocates are calling for the immediate closure of Camp East Montana, a new large-scale immigration detention facility at the Fort Bliss military base in Texas. Critics raise concerns about the lack of oversight, harsh conditions, and limited access to legal services at the sprawling tent facility, which is set to become the largest in the country. The Trump administration intends to use the camp as a short-term processing hub to accelerate mass deportations, but opponents have labeled it a "shameful" and "dangerous misuse of military land."</p>

While two of the animals were euthanized due to age-related health decline, the gorilla's death was sudden.

          <p>A former elementary school teacher in Sacramento, Kim Kenneth Wilson, has been sentenced to 215 years to life in prison after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting numerous students. The 64-year-old used his position as head of the school's broadcast club to lure children into a soundproof room, where he filmed himself assaulting them over several years. A search of his home uncovered disturbing materials and a vast collection of recordings of his crimes. The school district is also facing civil lawsuits from victims' families.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dermatologists are highlighting a key benefit of tinted sunscreens: they protect against visible light, which standard sunscreens do not. Research shows that visible light can contribute to hyperpigmentation and melasma, conditions that are more common in people with darker skin tones. The key ingredient providing this protection is iron oxide, which gives the products their tint. While most sunscreens focus on blocking UV radiation to prevent skin cancer, tinted formulas offer an added layer of defense against these common cosmetic skin concerns.</p>
