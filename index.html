          <p>Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have signed a significant mutual defense agreement, stipulating that aggression against one nation will be considered an act against both. The pact is designed to bolster security cooperation and promote regional peace, with Pakistan's defense minister suggesting its nuclear capabilities could be made available to Saudi Arabia if needed. This formalizes and strengthens a long-standing strategic partnership rooted in shared religious, economic, and security interests. The deal is seen by analysts as a pivotal moment, potentially serving as a hedge against regional threats and reflecting shifting geopolitical alliances in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced a 'demographic mission' to address what he terms a 'conspiracy' of irregular migration, which critics argue is a thinly veiled effort to target Muslim populations. The government claims that migration from Bangladesh poses a national security crisis, leading to demographic shifts and taking jobs from Indian youth. However, opponents and human rights activists contend that the mission is a form of demographic engineering designed to consolidate the ruling party's Hindu nationalist base by creating a climate of fear and disenfranchising communities unlikely to vote for them.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping held a call to finalize an agreement aimed at preventing a U.S. ban on the social media platform TikTok. The discussion follows the establishment of a deal framework earlier in the week to address national security concerns over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. A federal law had mandated that ByteDance divest its U.S. operations or face a shutdown, but President Trump has extended the deadline multiple times, expressing a desire to preserve the platform's value. The call represents a critical step in resolving the high-stakes issue between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>In the practice session for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, leading his teammate Charles Leclerc for a one-two finish. The session was marked by incidents, most notably McLaren's Lando Norris crashing into a wall at Turn Four, which broke his rear suspension and ended his run. His teammate and championship rival, Oscar Piastri, also had a brush with the wall but avoided significant damage. Despite McLaren's messy session, their strong pace in race simulations suggests they remain the team to beat for the weekend's main event.</p>

          <p>The price of gold continues to be a key indicator for investors, widely regarded as a safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation during times of market volatility. As of September 18, 2025, the price stood at $3,671.44 per ounce, though this figure is subject to constant change. Its value is influenced by numerous factors, including global supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability.

          <p>SEC Chairman Paul Atkins announced that the agency will propose a rule change that could allow publicly traded companies to report earnings on a semiannual basis instead of quarterly. The move follows a call from President Donald Trump, who argued the change would save money and encourage a focus on long-term business strategy over short-term results. Atkins stated that if the rule is approved, companies would have the option to choose their reporting frequency. Proponents believe it will foster long-term thinking, while opponents raise concerns about reduced transparency for investors.</p>

          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari stated he supports two more interest rate cuts this year, citing his belief that President Trump's tariffs will have only a minimal long-term impact on inflation. He argues that the tariffs are likely a one-time price shock rather than a persistent inflationary force, creating room for easier monetary policy. Kashkari's dovish position is further supported by a weakening labor market and stable inflation expectations, even as the current consumer price index remains above the Fed's 2% target. He emphasized that the central bank is not content with 3% inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

This strategy, combined with arresting immigrants at courthouses and pressuring judges, has created chaos and fear.

          <p>President Trump's announcement to designate antifa as a 'major terrorist organization' is likely to encounter significant legal and practical hurdles.

Furthermore, such a designation could raise First Amendment concerns regarding free speech and association, as U.S. law does not criminalize belonging to an ideological group.

The guidance clarifies that workers in 'specified service trades or businesses,' such as healthcare, legal, and financial services, will not qualify for the deduction. Additionally, automatic gratuities, such as mandatory service charges for large parties, are not considered qualified tips because they are not voluntary.

          <p>Retail companies are increasingly using a 'B2B2C' (business-to-business-to-consumer) model to reduce the impact of trade war tariffs on consumer prices. This strategy involves routing online consumer purchases through a third-party middleman company that buys the product at a wholesale price from the retailer. The middleman then pays the U.S. tariff on the lower wholesale value before shipping to the consumer, effectively cutting the tariff cost. This form of tariff arbitrage allows retailers to absorb the financial pressure from tariffs without passing the full cost on to customers, though some logistics experts question its long-term scalability.</p>

          <p>Authorities have revealed that a man found dead at the Burning Man festival was killed by a single stab wound to the neck from a kitchen knife. The victim, identified as 37-year-old Vadim Kruglov, was discovered on the night of August 30 during the festival's main effigy-burning event. Despite receiving hundreds of tips from the public, the Pershing County Sheriff's Office in Nevada has not yet identified a suspect in the homicide. The incident appears to be the first reported homicide at the long-running festival, which draws tens of thousands of participants to the Black Rock Desert annually.</p>

          <p>In the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, dozens of individuals across the U.S., including government employees, journalists, and academics, have faced termination or suspension for social media posts deemed to be celebrating or mocking his death. The crackdown follows calls from conservative figures for employers to take action against such individuals, sparking a debate over free speech and the consequences of online expression. Civil liberties groups have warned that this wave of disciplinary measures could chill free expression and infringe on First Amendment rights, as people from various professions face severe repercussions.</p>

The attack on the Abu Shouk camp near El-Fasher resulted in casualty counts ranging from 43 to 75, according to local medical and aid groups. This event is part of an escalating conflict that the UN has described as a 'forgotten war' marked by increasing civilian deaths, ethnic violence, and atrocities. The war between the Sudanese army and the RSF, now in its third year, has created one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are working to repeal several key health protections related to toxic PFAS 'forever chemical' pollution from U.S. military bases. The proposed changes, included in the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), would delay a ban on PFAS-containing firefighting foam, cut cleanup funding by $200 million, and lift a moratorium on its incineration.

          <p>Less than a year after his 2024 election victory, President Trump's support among key voter demographics like Latino, Black, and young Americans may be eroding due to economic pressures. Rising youth unemployment and persistent inflation are contributing to potential 'buyer's remorse,' with polls showing significant disapproval of the president among these groups. While Trump made inroads with these voters in the last election, current economic conditions and controversial policies on immigration could be fraying his coalition. The upcoming midterm elections will be a crucial test of whether these shifts are temporary or represent a lasting realignment.</p>

          <p>Chinese military researchers are proposing the construction of a naval 'Great Wall,' a comprehensive defense system designed to counter potential attacks from large swarms of coordinated drones. A study published by naval experts warns that such attacks could overwhelm traditional warship defenses through sheer numbers and stealth. The proposed countermeasures include a layered defense network utilizing advanced technologies like high-power microwave weapons, ship-mounted lasers, and long-range hypersonic missiles. This theoretical framework aligns with new anti-drone weapon systems recently displayed by China, highlighting the country's focus on future warfare scenarios.</p>
