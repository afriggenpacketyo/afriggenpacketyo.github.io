          <p>Portugal secured a 2-1 victory over Germany in the Nations League semifinal, marking Joshua Kimmich's 100th appearance for the German national team with a loss. Kimmich assisted Florian Wirtz's goal, but Portugal responded with goals from Francisco Conceicao and Cristiano Ronaldo, who played his 220th game for his country, eclipsing Kimmich's milestone. Kimmich acknowledged Germany's shortcomings and lack of energy, while Ronaldo's goal was his 137th for Portugal, setting a record in international football, leading his country to another Nations League final. The match, initially delayed due to a storm, ended with Germany missing a crucial pass, solidifying Portugal's win and dampening Kimmich's celebratory night. The article reflects on Kimmich's career with the German national team, noting both highs and lows, including the Confederations Cup win in 2017 and subsequent disappointing tournaments.</p>

          <p>President Trump issued a proclamation barring most international students from studying at Harvard University, citing concerns about the school's trustworthiness and ties to researchers in China. The order suspends the entry of foreign students unless deemed in the national interest and directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking visas of those already in the U.S. A Harvard spokesperson condemned the order as retaliatory and a violation of the school's First Amendment rights, vowing to protect its international students. This action follows previous attempts by the administration to restrict Harvard's ability to enroll international students, including efforts to revoke its certification in the federal government's student visa database, which were halted by a judge after Harvard sued. The Trump administration has also criticized Harvard's handling of pro-Palestinian protests and alleged failures to address antisemitism on campus.</p>

          <p>UK newspapers highlight Chancellor Rachel Reeves' expected "winter fuel U-turn," restoring payments but clawing them back from wealthier pensioners via higher taxes. Concerns arise over potential chaos as tax officials might pursue bereaved families of dead pensioners to recover the sums. The Daily Express emphasizes support for a full U-turn, while the i Paper reports 1.3 million more people will likely receive the payment. Immigration policies also take center stage, with opposing views from Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch. The Telegraph notes Reeves has been "forced to drop net zero cuts," and the Financial Times reports Trump's tax bill will swell US debt. The Daily Mirror celebrates 500,000 more children receiving free school meals.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has initiated an investigation into Joe Biden’s actions as president, alleging that Biden's aides masked his cognitive decline. The inquiry builds on a Republican-led campaign to discredit the former president and overturn executive actions. GOP lawmakers sought testimony from Biden's top aides regarding his mental and physical faculties. A separate inquiry was launched into clemencies Biden issued in his final days in office. Trump claims Biden's aides usurped presidential authority to cover up his cognitive decline, pointing to Biden's use of an autopen as evidence. Democrats have dismissed the investigations as a distraction from issues with the current administration.</p>

          <p>During a New York City mayoral debate, former Governor Andrew Cuomo dismissed the legitimacy of the Justice Department's investigation into his alleged false congressional testimony about COVID-19 decisions, attributing it to Trump's "MAGA line." Cuomo defended his handling of nursing home deaths during the pandemic, asserting he told Congress the truth and did not undercount deaths. He emphasized his experience challenging Trump's agenda and positioned himself as the candidate Trump would least want as mayor. The debate included other Democratic candidates, with Cuomo as the polling frontrunner. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams is running as an independent.</p>

The partial ban affects people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. Trump linked the ban to a firebombing attack in Boulder, Colorado, although the suspect is from a country not listed in the ban. This new ban is the result of an executive order Trump signed on his first day back in the White House, calling for agencies to identify countries with deficient screening and vetting information.</p>

The development of feathers that generate thrust and lift was essential for the evolution of birds. While modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs lacked the same ability to fly, although some could glide or had powered flight.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that early exposure to beneficial bacteria in newborns can significantly reduce the risk of lung infections requiring hospitalization. The study, which analyzed stool samples from over 1,000 newborns, found that babies with Bifidobacterium longum were less likely to be hospitalized for lung infections. Researchers believe this protective effect is linked to the bacteria's interaction with the immune system and its role in digesting breast milk. The protective bacteria were more commonly found in babies born via vaginal delivery. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms behind this phenomenon.</p>

          <p>A judge has granted a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., halting restart efforts on its onshore pipeline system near Santa Barbara due to environmental concerns. The order, sought by environmental groups, will remain in effect until at least July 18, delaying Sable's targeted restart date to August 1, 2025. The ruling stems from concerns that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without proper environmental review or public input. The legal challenge follows a previous ruling preventing Sable from working in the coastal region until a dispute with the California Coastal Commission is resolved, highlighting ongoing opposition to the project due to the 2015 Refugio oil spill.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the FDA Commissioner review the latest data on mifepristone, commonly known as the abortion pill. The FDA confirmed the review but did not specify the scope or timeline. Concerns about the drug's safety have been raised, fueled by a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center, which claims the pill harms women. Experts, however, argue that these safety concerns are misguided, citing the FDA's thorough review and lack of new safety concerns since its approval in 2000. The Supreme Court previously rejected a challenge targeting the availability of mifepristone in 2024.</p>

Musk previously described the bill as a "disgusting abomination" and hinted at supporting challenges against politicians who voted for it. The non-partisan budget office said on Wednesday that Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill” would decrease federal revenues by $3.67tn while cutting spending by $1.25tn through 2034, as the national debt currently stands at $36tn.</p>

Musk argues the bill would increase the US budget deficit and burden Americans with debt. The White House defends the bill, asserting it improves the fiscal trajectory of the United States. The tech billionaire previously served in the Trump administration for 129 days. Musk's criticism reflects wider tensions among Republicans over the plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A US judge has temporarily halted deportation proceedings against the family of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, accused of a petrol-bomb attack on Jewish demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado. The decision was one of three immigration rulings against Trump by federal judges on Wednesday. Lawyers for the defence accused the government of unfairly targeting the family, who say they were unaware of Mr Soliman's violent plans. The family members include Mr Soliman's wife, Hayam El Gamal, 41, as well as the couple's 17-year-old daughter, two other daughters and two sons. They are being held at an immigration detention centre in Texas, over 900 miles (1,450km) from their home in Colorado.</p>
