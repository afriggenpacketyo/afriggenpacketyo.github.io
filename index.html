          <p>Following two days of trade talks in Geneva, the White House announced a trade deal with China, though specifics remain unclear. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng stated that substantial progress was made and an important consensus was reached, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the talks as productive. A joint statement is expected soon, detailing the agreement and establishing a consultation mechanism for future trade and economic issues. Despite previous tariff increases and warnings from companies about potential price hikes, both sides expressed a desire to avoid a trade war and resolve differences through dialogue.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced plans to meet with airline leaders to address ongoing technological and staffing issues at Newark Liberty International Airport, which have caused significant delays and cancellations. Duffy acknowledged that similar disruptions could occur at other U.S. airports due to antiquated systems and insufficient attention to infrastructure improvements. He assured the public that air travel remains safe despite the recent outages and delays, noting his family's continued use of the airport. The secretary's proposal to modernize air traffic control and extend the retirement age for controllers requires congressional approval, though staffing cuts at the FAA have been made in recent months.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security criticized a Worcester, Massachusetts city council member, Etel Haxhiaj, for allegedly inciting chaos during the arrest of a "violent criminal alien" by ICE agents. DHS stated that Haxhiaj obstructed law enforcement, while the Worcester Police Patrol Officers’ Union accused her of assaulting officers and inciting aggression. The union is calling for an ethics investigation into Haxhiaj’s behavior, asserting that she disrupted the operation and threatened the safety of officers.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a head-to-head clinical trial, Eli Lilly's Zepbound demonstrated superior weight loss results compared to Novo Nordisk's Wegovy, marking the first direct comparison of the two popular obesity drugs. Participants taking Zepbound lost nearly 50% more weight on average than those using Wegovy over a 72-week period. While both drugs target hormones regulating appetite, Zepbound targets two hormones (GLP-1 and GIP) compared to Wegovy's focus on GLP-1 alone. Both drugs showed improvements in health markers, but access and affordability remain key challenges, though manufacturers are implementing cost-cutting programs. CVS Health announced Wegovy as the preferred option on its standard formulary, excluding Zepbound.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CVS Caremark's decision to exclude Zepbound in favor of Wegovy on its formulary has sparked controversy, as research indicates Zepbound results in greater weight loss. The move is attributed to secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), raising concerns about insurance denials and limited treatment options for patients. While Caremark claims the decision aims to lower drug prices, doctors prefer Zepbound for many patients, and some worry about the impact on their health progress. Patients are expressing frustration and considering paying out-of-pocket to stay on Zepbound, highlighting the complexities of prescription drug coverage and access.</p>

The South African government has denied any racially motivated discrimination, viewing the U.S. initiative as politically motivated. The State Department maintains that it is prioritizing the resettlement of Afrikaners facing unjust racial discrimination, despite strained relations between the two countries over domestic and foreign policy issues.</p>

President Zelensky responded by saying he would personally attend negotiations in Turkey, but he called again for Russia to halt hostilities to allow for diplomacy.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has unveiled plans to overhaul the UK's immigration system, proposing stricter English tests for visa applicants and their adult dependents. Migrants will need to wait 10 years, instead of five, to apply for settlement, with a fast-track system for essential workers like nurses and engineers. Labour aims to raise English language requirements across all immigration routes, potentially requiring legislative changes in 2026. Critics warn that the rules may split families, while supporters argue they will promote integration and reduce exploitation. The new rules also aim to end automatic settlement after five years, making it a privilege to be earned.</p>

          <p>Hamas announced that it will release Edan Alexander, the last living American hostage in Gaza, ahead of President Trump's visit to the Middle East. The 21-year-old Israeli-American soldier was kidnapped on October 7, 2023, and his release is scheduled for Tuesday. Israel has been informed by the U.S. of Hamas's intention to release Alexander as a gesture to the Americans, without conditions or anything in exchange, and the release is expected to lead to negotiations for the release of hostages according to the original Witkoff framework, which Israel has already accepted.</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old woman had her bowel removed due to chronic and severe constipation, highlighting the importance of open conversations about bodily functions. Kathryn Nicklas was initially diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and prescribed laxatives, but years of constipation caused lasting damage to her pelvic organs. A leading pelvic health doctor, Julie Cornish, emphasizes early detection and simpler solutions for pelvic health problems. Nicklas now advocates for destigmatizing discussions about bowel health to encourage earlier intervention and prevent severe complications.</p>
