        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Volvo Cars announced a significant cost-cutting plan of 18 billion Swedish krona ($1.87 billion) after reporting a sharp decline in first-quarter operating profit, down to 1.9 billion krona from 4.7 billion krona the previous year. This led to a 10% drop in shares. The company withdrew its financial guidance for 2025 and 2026, citing adverse currency effects, industry turbulence, and tariff pressures. CEO Håkan Samuelsson noted increased price competition and new players in the electric vehicle market as contributing factors, leading the company to focus on cost control measures, including potential redundancies and investment reductions.</p>

          <p>Young Australian voters, now outnumbering baby boomers, are prepared to express their frustration over climate inaction in the upcoming election. Driven by concerns about rising temperatures, wildfires, and extreme weather events, they are advocating for stronger climate policies. The Australian Youth Climate Coalition is demanding a 75% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2035. This 'youthquake' could significantly influence election outcomes, potentially favoring parties with more aggressive climate platforms, as young voters feel current policies are inadequate to address the climate crisis.</p>

          <p>Canada's Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, secured a victory in the recent federal election, marking a turnaround attributed to President Trump's annexation threats and tariff impositions. Carney emphasized the need for Canada to stand up to American pressure and build its own economy with diverse global partnerships. The election saw a record number of Canadians casting their votes, with sovereignty, tariffs, and affordability being key concerns. The results signal a shift in Canada's relationship with the United States, prompting a focus on self-reliance and international alliances.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul and state lawmakers have reached an agreement to add a criminal charge for individuals who wear masks while committing crimes. The legislation, part of a $254 billion budget deal, aims to address concerns about individuals concealing their identities during illegal activities. The additional charge applies to suspects charged with a class A misdemeanor or more serious offenses, and also covers those fleeing crime scenes. The measure reflects an effort to balance public safety with civil liberties, following debates over stricter proposals that raised concerns among Democrat lawmakers and civil liberty advocates.</p>

          <p>Belfast-based rap group Kneecap has issued an apology to the families of murdered MPs Sir David Amess and Jo Cox following the emergence of a video showing a band member seemingly advocating violence against politicians. The group denied inciting violence and stated their words were taken out of context, though the footage is under review by counter-terrorism police. The controversy has led to calls for the revocation of their US work visas and removal from music festivals, and sparked debate over government funding for the arts. The group has also denied supporting Hamas or Hezbollah.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Society of Radiographers (SoR) is advocating for a policy change to allow male health workers to perform mammograms due to critical staffing shortages among female radiographers. Currently, mammograms, X-rays used to detect breast cancer, can only be administered by female staff. While some women express concerns about privacy, others support the change, emphasizing the importance of life-saving screenings regardless of the provider's gender. The SoR argues that expanding the workforce could attract more qualified individuals to the field and improve service delivery, but some politicians believe that most women would prefer a female radiographer for such screenings.</p>

          <p>The UK government is consulting on proposals to extend the sugar tax to pre-packaged milkshakes and lattes, potentially impacting a significant portion of milk-based drinks on the market. This move aims to tackle obesity by incentivizing manufacturers to reduce sugar content in these beverages. While the original sugar tax exempted milk-based drinks due to concerns about calcium consumption, the government now argues that the health benefits do not outweigh the harms from excess sugar. The consultation will run until July, with the government estimating that many drinks will be subject to the levy unless their sugar content is reduced.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has been characterized by authoritarian tendencies and fundamental ineptitude, leading to economic chaos and strained international relations.

          <p>Donald Trump's first 100 days in office have been marked by significant disruptions in US foreign policy, alienating allies and disrupting global trade. Key actions include fraying alliances, cutting aid to Ukraine, and imposing tariffs that could lead to supply chain shocks. Critics argue that the administration's isolationist approach has undermined trust in America and destabilized key foreign policy institutions. The election of Mark Carney in Canada is seen as a direct response to Trump's policies, and the US's shift away from traditional alliances is causing concern among European leaders.</p>

          <p>Economists at Morgan Stanley anticipate that the US and China will engage in trade negotiations and gradually reduce tariffs on Chinese imports to 60% by the end of the second quarter. While trade disruptions may lead to negotiations, tariffs are unlikely to revert to pre-January 2025 levels. More comprehensive talks later in the year could further reduce tariffs to 34% by year's end. Despite these potential reductions, the economic cycle has already suffered damage, and overall growth is expected to remain downward.</p>

Jagmeet Singh, the NDP leader, lost his seat, and the Bloc Québécois maintained a presence primarily in Quebec.

          <p>Cricket and mixed martial arts have been included in the program for the 2026 Asian Games, which will be co-hosted by Aichi Prefecture and Nagoya in Japan. The decision was made following a request from the Olympic Council of Asia, while open water swimming has been excluded from the program. Organizers are seeking a venue for cricket within Aichi Prefecture, and are in talks with municipalities that have existing facilities. Additionally, the number of participating football teams has been set at 16 each for men and women, and Kyoto and Hyogo Prefectures will not host matches.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberals secured a comeback victory in Canada's federal election, largely fueled by anti-Trump sentiment and concerns over US threats. Trump's tariff threats and comments undermining Canada's sovereignty became the defining issues, allowing Carney to position himself as the leader to safeguard Canada's economic survival. The election results highlighted divisions within Canada, with the Liberals largely shut out of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Carney now faces the challenge of uniting Canadians and negotiating a new economic and security relationship with the US.</p>
