A record number of 18-year-olds are projected to secure their first-choice university placements, despite lower GCSE grades for this cohort due to post-pandemic grade deflation efforts. Universities are reportedly keen to enroll domestic students, potentially accepting those who slightly miss offer conditions, to ensure financial stability given uncertainty around international student numbers. This year marks the second year grades have returned to pre-pandemic standards, with less emphasis on comparison to 2019.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer believes a viable chance exists for a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire, preceding a summit between US President Trump and Russian President Putin in Alaska. Starmer emphasized the necessity of protecting Ukraine's territorial integrity and ensuring any ceasefire is lasting, backed by security guarantees. Ukrainian President Zelensky is expected to meet Starmer in London, a coordinated show of support from the UK. US Vice-President JD Vance, also in the UK, stated Trump's mission is to "bring peace to Europe once again," amidst concerns over potential territorial concessions.</p>

          <p>A rising number of business travelers are bringing family members along on work trips, a trend known as "bleisure" travel. A survey reveals over half of business travelers, and 73% of C-suite executives, have included loved ones. Motivations include reclaiming family time, combating loneliness on the road, and significant cost savings by leveraging company-covered travel expenses for the business portion. While common, many employees do not disclose these plans to their companies due to concerns about professionalism or policy grey zones, though some companies quietly permit it if work objectives are met and costs are clearly separated.</p>

          <p>European leaders conveyed cautious optimism after a virtual meeting with Donald Trump, two days before his summit with Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss the war in Ukraine. Trump reportedly aimed for a ceasefire and agreed that Ukraine's territorial issues require Volodymyr Zelensky's involvement, along with security guarantees. Despite being sidelined from the summit, European leaders reiterated the need for Kyiv's inclusion in any final decision, reflecting underlying nervousness about potential territorial concessions. They also stressed increasing pressure on Russia if no concessions are made.</p>

          <p>Anchorage, Alaska, is experiencing a mix of excitement and trepidation as it prepares to host the Trump-Putin summit. Residents express pride in their city being on the world stage but also concern about the implications, particularly after Trump's initial suggestion of meeting "in Russia." A common satirical response among Alaskans is "Please don't sell us back," referencing the 1867 sale of Alaska from Russia to the US. While acknowledging Russia as a neighbor, many residents are wary of Putin, and there's broad dissatisfaction with his visit given his international arrest warrant.</p>

The bullpen's struggles were evident as they squandered a late-game lead, culminating in a 6-5 defeat. This loss pushed the Dodgers out of first place in the National League West for the first time since April. Despite Shohei Ohtani making his first full-length pitching start since surgery and contributing offensively, his efforts weren't enough to secure a victory for the team.</p>

          <p>Singapore, one of the world's most expensive cities, is seeing a growing number of its workers living paycheck to paycheck, reaching 60% in 2024. This trend, higher than regional peers, is attributed to rising costs of living, particularly housing and imports, and a cultural shift prioritizing experiences over long-term savings. While inflation has cooled, real median employment income has fallen post-pandemic, shrinking purchasing power. Experts note a "debt society" where instant gratification and lifestyle signaling outweigh financial prudence, especially among middle-income earners and younger generations who feel less urgency to save for traditional milestones like children.</p>

          <p>The trial concerning President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles concluded, with the judge questioning the limits of presidential authority and the applicability of the Posse Comitatus Act. California's lawsuit challenged the deployment, arguing it violated the act by involving the military in domestic law enforcement, specifically immigration operations. The Justice Department contended the act didn't apply and that the state lacked standing to sue. The judge expressed concern over the apparent "absence of any limits to a national police force" and questioned the continued presence of troops, despite a significant reduction in force.</p>

Younger generations, particularly those aged 18-34, show a stronger inclination to abstain, viewing moderation as harmful. Experts suggest this shift is influenced by greater health knowledge, the growing social acceptability of sobriety, and the rising cost of alcohol. The trend also shows a starker decline in alcohol use among women compared to men, with differing beverage preferences between genders.</p>

          <p>A Menifee police officer, Juan Pesina, has been arrested on suspicion of committing sexual assaults while on duty, following a complaint received by the Menifee Police Department. Investigations revealed alleged on-duty and off-duty sexual assaults in 2023 and 2024. Pesina faces charges including sexual assault, sodomy, and forced oral copulation. The Menifee Police Department requested an independent investigation by the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department, emphasizing commitment to accountability.

          <p>Kumagaya, Japan, was firebombed by nearly 90 US B-29 bombers on August 14-15, 1945, just 12 hours before Emperor Hirohito announced Japan's unconditional surrender. This final fire raid of WWII killed at least 260 people and destroyed almost 75% of the city. Survivors recall the harrowing experience, with one noting the tragedy felt "utterly foolish" given the imminent end of the war. Despite the devastation, residents express no animosity towards America, viewing the event as a tragic consequence of war's momentum. Memorials and personal efforts now aim to preserve the memory and foster peace.</p>

          <p>First lady Melania Trump has demanded that Hunter Biden retract comments linking her to sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, threatening a lawsuit if he fails to comply. Biden, in a recent interview, alleged that Epstein introduced Melania to Donald Trump, a claim the first lady's lawyer deems "false, defamatory and 'extremely salacious.'" The comments, widely disseminated, have allegedly caused "overwhelming financial and reputational harm." The Trumps maintain they were introduced by a modeling agent. This legal threat mirrors President Trump's aggressive use of litigation against critics.</p>

          <p>US National Guard troops have begun appearing in Washington D.C. after President Trump deployed them and took control of the city's police force, citing out-of-control crime. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, condemned the deployment as an "authoritarian push," disputing Trump's crime claims with data showing violent offenses in D.C. at a 30-year low and continuing to fall. While federal agents have made arrests, Bowser emphasizes the need to protect the city's autonomy and home rule.

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reports a significant increase in chikungunya virus cases in the UK, with over 70 infections in the first half of this year—more than double the previous year. All cases are linked to travel, primarily from the Indian Ocean region, particularly India, Sri Lanka, and Mauritius, where an outbreak is ongoing. While rarely fatal, the mosquito-borne virus can cause severe joint pain for months or years. UKHSA advises travelers to high-risk areas to take precautions against mosquito bites, such as using repellent and insecticide-treated bed nets, and to consider vaccination.</p>

Authorities served 26 search warrants, charging 10 individuals with felonies including animal cruelty. The seized birds were euthanized due to their breeding for fighting, as they could not be safely rehabilitated or rehomed. Officials emphasize that cockfighting is often linked to other illicit activities like gambling, firearms, and drug trafficking.

Tindall was arrested on suspicion of illegal sales of psilocybin mushrooms, a felony.

The disease, mainly found in America's Midwest, is spread by fleas and ticks and can also transmit through rabbit-to-rabbit contact, though not to humans or other species. The growths are generally harmless to the bunnies unless they obstruct vital functions, disappearing once the rabbit's immune system fights the virus. This condition is even thought to have inspired the centuries-old myth of the "jackalope."</p>
