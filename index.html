          <p>The offices of Florida Rep. Kat Cammack were evacuated due to what she described as "imminent death threats" against her and her family. The Republican congresswoman stated the threats began after she shared a personal story about her ectopic pregnancy and the challenges she faced under Florida's strict abortion ban. Cammack blamed "pro-abortion activists" for the threats, which she said are being actively investigated by law enforcement, highlighting the intense polarization surrounding the abortion debate.</p>

          <p>An Israeli drone strike targeting a Hamas police unit in a market in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, has killed at least 18 Palestinians, according to a local doctor and eyewitnesses. The police unit was reportedly confronting vendors over price gouging and the sale of looted aid when the strike occurred. This incident underscores the chaotic and dangerous conditions for civilians in Gaza, who are struggling to access food amid rampant price inflation and violence around aid distribution sites.</p>

          <p>An in-depth analysis suggests Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is struggling to reconcile her non-interventionist views with President Trump's more aggressive foreign policy, particularly regarding Iran. After initially testifying that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, she has since shifted her public statements to align with the president's claims that recent U.S. strikes destroyed Iran's program. This has reportedly eroded her credibility within the intelligence community and her influence in the White House.</p>

The analysis of validated voters found that non-voters in 2024 preferred Trump over Kamala Harris, upending the long-held political belief that higher turnout benefits Democrats. The study also highlights a shift in voter coalitions, with Trump's support becoming younger and more ethnically diverse.</p>
