          <p>The European Commission has proposed a new seven-year budget of €2 trillion, featuring a significant fivefold increase in defense and space investment to €131 billion. This shift reflects a response to rising geopolitical concerns, with President von der Leyen declaring Europe is in its "era of rearmament." The plan, which also allocates substantial funds for climate projects and support for Ukraine, relies on new revenue streams to avoid increasing member state contributions but faces potential opposition from nations who find the proposal too high.</p>

          <p>China's Premier Li Qiang is urging tighter price regulation to control the fierce price war in the electric vehicle sector, which is contributing to deflationary pressures on the economy. At a high-level meeting, he called for greater self-discipline from automakers, emphasizing that competitiveness should come from innovation, not just excessive price cuts. This move comes as industrial profits have fallen and concerns about oversupply grow, though economists are cautious that curbing production could hinder economic growth and job security.

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a nearly 61% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter net profit, surpassing market expectations. The record-breaking performance was fueled by sustained strong demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. Advanced chips of 7-nanometers or smaller constituted 74% of the company's wafer revenue, highlighting the industry's shift towards more powerful processors. However, potential U.S. tariffs on Taiwan could present future challenges for the chipmaking giant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's top anti-corruption body, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), is launching a targeted crackdown on the science and technology sector. The initiative aims to eliminate fraud in research funding, such as embezzling funds or accepting bribes in exchange for project approval. Officials plan to use digital tools like big data and AI to identify and expose complex corruption schemes. This campaign seeks to plug regulatory loopholes and ensure that the country's technological development proceeds in a healthy and innovative environment.</p>

          <p>Civil rights and environmental organizations, including the NAACP, are legally challenging a permit granted to Elon Musk's xAI for its supercomputer facility in Memphis. The appeal argues that the natural gas-burning turbines used to power the data center are causing air pollution that disproportionately affects nearby majority-Black communities. The groups contend that the local health department improperly categorized the turbines and ignored residents' health concerns, a claim xAI has dismissed as a "baseless, politically driven appeal."</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has withdrawn the party whip from four Members of Parliament and stripped three others of their trade envoy roles for repeatedly voting against government policy. This disciplinary action, seen by Downing Street as a way to enforce authority and prevent future rebellions, has been criticized by some within the party as "petty" and "vindictive." The move has reportedly lowered morale among some MPs and raises questions about whether it will effectively quell dissent or simply deepen internal divisions within the new government.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. According to sources, she was dismissed under the president's authority as outlined in Article 2 of the Constitution. Comey was a prominent prosecutor who helped lead the cases against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, and more recently, the criminal case against Sean "Diddy" Combs. Her father, James Comey, was famously terminated as FBI director by President Trump in 2017 during the Russia investigation.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports fell by 0.5% in June compared to the previous year, marking the second straight month of contraction and raising concerns that the economy could enter a technical recession. The decline was driven by a sharp 11.4% drop in shipments to the U.S., its major trading partner, as a 25% "reciprocal tariff" looms. Data shows Japanese automakers appear to be absorbing the cost of existing tariffs by cutting prices to maintain market share, a strategy that is squeezing their profit margins and weighing heavily on the export-dependent economy.

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's focus on deporting the "worst of the worst," newly obtained data from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) shows that very few deportees had violent criminal records. Of the roughly 100,000 people deported in the first half of the year, only 0.58% had been convicted of homicide, while a majority of documented infractions were for traffic or immigration offenses. This data suggests the administration's deportation push has primarily affected undocumented immigrants without serious criminal histories, contrary to public messaging that has highlighted violent offenders.</p>

Analysts predict such a move would likely trigger a significant equity selloff and a spike in long-term bond yields. The situation is complicated by legal uncertainty over whether the president has the authority to fire a Fed chair for cause, a question that could ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.

However, authorities later downgraded the alert, stating that the shallow depth of the earthquake meant large, widespread waves were not expected.
