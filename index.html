          <p>Taiwan's Kuomintang (KMT) party is prioritizing a campaign to prevent the recall of its lawmakers by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), even as it prepares for a leadership election. Analysts suggest that failing to address the recall challenge could destabilize the KMT's leadership transition. KMT Chairman Eric Chu Li-luan has indicated his intention to step down after completing his term, suggesting Taichung Mayor Lu Shiow-yen as a potential successor. The KMT plans to announce the party chair race in July, conduct internal voting in September, and install a new leader by October.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's administration is engaging in a broad attack on higher education, particularly targeting Harvard University, by threatening to redirect research funding and reviewing government contracts. These actions, stemming from accusations of antisemitism and bias, are creating palpable concern across American campuses, with some fearing a long-term transformation of the cultural and political landscape. While Harvard is fighting back through the courts, other universities are facing similar funding cuts and investigations, raising questions about the future of academic independence and the role of universities in society.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) warns that the UK government faces "unavoidable" tough choices as it finalizes its spending plans. The IFS suggests that the level of funding allocated to the National Health Service (NHS) will significantly impact other unprotected areas, such as schools and the criminal justice system. While spending increased sharply in 2024, it is not expected to continue at the same rate, given the government's commitments to fiscal responsibility. Chancellor Rachel Reeves's stance on not borrowing more money or raising taxes further intensifies speculation about potential spending cuts.</p>
