          <p>Tesla's board is awarding CEO Elon Musk approximately $29 billion in restricted stock, a move that comes just months after a Delaware judge invalidated his previous, larger pay package. The judge had ruled the original 2018 package was improperly negotiated with a board that lacked independence. This new award requires Musk to pay the exercise price per share from the voided plan. The decision reignites the debate over executive compensation and corporate governance at the electric vehicle company, following a shareholder lawsuit that challenged the initial pay deal as excessive.</p>

          <p>India's information technology sector, a major engine of its economy, is experiencing significant job losses, sparking concerns about its future stability. Companies like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) have announced major layoffs, citing skill mismatches and reduced deployment opportunities. While a global economic slowdown is a primary factor, analysts are closely watching the growing influence of artificial intelligence in automating tasks and transforming roles. The trend poses a major challenge for India, which relies on the IT industry to employ a large portion of its 1.5 million annual engineering graduates. (not investment advice)</p>

Ukrainian officials are supporting the U.S. demand for an immediate ceasefire, viewing the upcoming talks as a critical juncture.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic state lawmakers has left Texas for Illinois in a dramatic move to prevent a vote on a new congressional map they argue is heavily gerrymandered to favor Republicans. By leaving, they deny the Republican-majority legislature the two-thirds quorum required to conduct business during a special session called by the governor. The proposed map, backed by President Trump, could create five new Republican-leaning seats in the U.S. House. The governor has threatened to have the absent lawmakers arrested and removed from office, escalating the political showdown over voting rights and representation.</p>

          <p>A new report published in the Lancet medical journal describes plastic pollution as a "grave, growing and under-recognized danger" to human health, with associated economic costs exceeding $1.5 trillion per year. The review of existing evidence links plastic chemicals to a range of health problems, from impaired reproduction and cognitive function to cancer and cardiovascular disease. Researchers highlight that infants and children are particularly vulnerable. The report calls for urgent action and a strong international treaty to mitigate the crisis, comparing the threat of plastics to that of air and lead pollution.</p>

          <p>An extended riot at a prison in Tuxpan, in the Mexican state of Veracruz, has left seven inmates dead and eleven others injured. The violence, which began on Saturday and continued overnight, required state and military forces to intervene to regain control of the facility. According to local media, the unrest was reportedly sparked by inmates seeking protection from threats made by a violent criminal group operating within the prison. The incident highlights the persistent issues of overcrowding and cartel-related violence that plague Mexico's penitentiary system.</p>

          <p>The Finance and Leasing Association (FLA), the trade body for UK car lenders, has labeled the financial regulator's proposed compensation scheme for mis-sold car finance as "completely impractical." The main concern revolves around the plan's scope, which could cover loans dating back to 2007, a period for which both firms and customers may lack adequate records. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is consulting on the redress plan following a Supreme Court ruling on hidden commissions. The FLA warns that the high costs of the scheme could ultimately make borrowing more expensive for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

The tariffs, including an immediate 50% duty on semi-finished products, are intended to revitalize domestic mining and refining, create American jobs, and secure a critical material for defense and technology sectors.

This article argues that the rise of screen time is not just due to addictive technology, but also because parents increasingly restrict their children's real-world independence out of safety fears. With limited ability to explore their neighborhoods or play unsupervised, children turn to their phones as the one space where they can socialize freely.

The policy was enacted after officials were barred from the Aspen Security Forum, which a DOD spokesperson claimed promotes "globalism" and "hatred for our great president." This article suggests the shift away from engaging with outside thinkers and forums, a long-standing practice for challenging assumptions, risks groupthink and could harm strategic development.

          <p>The UK Home Office has announced an extra £100 million in funding to crack down on illegal people-smuggling gangs operating in the English Channel. The new funds will support up to 300 additional National Crime Agency officers and new technology to help "track the gangs and bring them down." The announcement comes as the number of people crossing the channel in small boats has reached a record high for this point in the year. The government is also pursuing a "one in, one out" returns pilot with France to deter the crossings.</p>

          <p>Some seasonal employees at Yosemite National Park reportedly worked for up to six weeks without pay this year due to significant federal hiring delays. Park supervisors, facing staff shortages from budget cuts and unable to officially onboard new hires, offered prospective workers free housing if they would work as volunteers. The employees, who needed the provided housing, performed their duties for weeks before being put on the payroll, but have not received backpay for their volunteer time. The situation highlights the strain on the National Park Service's resources and its impact on its essential seasonal workforce.</p>

          <p>This economic analysis argues that a recent wave of data indicates the U.S. economy is slowing down significantly, largely due to President Trump's trade and immigration policies. The article points to a sharp, unexpected pullback in hiring, slowing GDP growth, and accelerating inflation as evidence of a weakening outlook. It suggests that tariffs have hurt manufacturing employment and raised consumer prices, while immigration restrictions have shrunk the labor force. The author warns that these trends are pushing the U.S. toward stagflation and increasing the risk of a recession. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book, "Tonight in Jungleland," details the difficult creation of Bruce Springsteen's landmark 1975 album, "Born to Run," which was released 50 years ago. This article highlights five key revelations from the book, including the fact that Springsteen was at risk of being dropped by his record label and initially disliked the finished album, even throwing a copy into a pool. It also explores the pivotal role of producer Jon Landau in shaping the album's sound and Springsteen's own perfectionism, which led to an all-night recording session for Clarence Clemons' iconic saxophone solo.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas experienced a significant 11.3% drop in visitor volume in June compared to the previous year, with data suggesting a decline in its key tourist demographics. Traffic on the I-15 from California was down, and overall air travel also fell, pointing to fewer visitors from Southern California, who make up a large portion of Vegas tourists. The slump is also attributed to a predicted drop in international travel to the U.S., partly due to the Trump administration's trade and foreign policies. Despite fewer visitors, gambling revenue in Clark County actually saw a slight increase.</p>

          <p>This commentary article argues that as streaming services increasingly rely on ad-supported tiers, the viewer experience has become terrible. The author criticizes not just the presence of ads, but their poor quality, frequent repetition, and disruptive placement, which often interrupt scenes mid-dialogue. Because streaming was built on the binge-watching model, this can lead to seeing the same commercial dozens of time in one sitting. The article suggests this clumsy integration, far worse than traditional broadcast television, risks alienating viewers and creating negative associations with the advertised brands.</p>

          <p>Calls are intensifying for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) to reduce its water diversions from creeks that feed Mono Lake. Environmentalists and local officials argue that the lake's water level remains critically low, about 9 feet below a target set by state regulators in 1994 to ensure its ecological health. They point to declining bird populations and exposed lakebed as evidence that the ecosystem is suffering. While the DWP maintains the lake is relatively healthy, city leaders have expressed a long-term goal of ending reliance on water from the Mono Basin.</p>
