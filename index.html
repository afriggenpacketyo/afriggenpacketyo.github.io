          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant measles outbreak, with weekly cases surpassing previous records from 2019, marking the worst outbreak since the 1990s. A large proportion of these cases are linked to an ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states, which is now the largest single outbreak since measles was declared eliminated in 2000. Health officials are closely monitoring the situation, including potential increases related to Easter holiday travel, and acknowledge that the current case count is likely an underestimation due to unreported infections and mild, undiagnosed cases. Canada is also experiencing record outbreaks, highlighting a broader trend of measles resurgence, with hospitalizations and fatalities reported in both countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a period of uncertainty following President Trump's imposition of global tariffs, Wall Street experienced a rebound, driven by positive economic indicators and renewed hopes for trade talks between the U.S. and China. The tech sector led the gains, with companies like Microsoft and Nvidia showing strong growth. A better-than-expected jobs report, indicating the addition of 177,000 new jobs in April, helped to alleviate recession fears. However, some experts caution that the full impact of the tariffs is still uncertain, and the economy's outlook remains volatile, with the potential for further weakening if trade tensions escalate.</p>

          <p>President Trump's latest budget proposal includes a renewed effort to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), along with the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences. This proposal aligns with Trump's broader goal of reducing the size of the federal government. The move has been met with strong opposition from Democrats, who vow to fight the proposed cuts, while Trump's administration has already canceled most of the existing grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and laid off a large portion of their staffs.</p>

          <p>President Trump's defense of his tariffs is facing increasing scrutiny as the economic impact on American consumers becomes more apparent. While acknowledging that tariffs may lead to higher prices and reduced consumption, Trump frames these costs as necessary for confronting China. However, critics argue that Trump's messaging is inconsistent and that his policies contradict his promises to end inflation and lower taxes. The article highlights the challenges Trump faces in convincing Americans to bear the brunt of the economic slowdown resulting from his trade policies.</p>

Critics view this as an attack on the EPA's Office of Research and Development, which provides the scientific basis for environmental and human health protection.

          <p>The number of entries for the 2026 London Marathon ballot has surpassed one million, reflecting the growing popularity of running as a leisure activity in the UK. Inspired by trends in the United States, the jogging boom took off in the mid-late 1970s. An estimated one million people now consider themselves to be runners, taking part in new events from fun runs to marathons. This surge in interest underscores a broader trend towards increased physical activity and a greater awareness of the mental and physical health benefits of running.</p>

          <p>George H. Ryan, the former governor of Illinois who famously imposed a moratorium on capital punishment in 2000 due to concerns about wrongful convictions, has died at the age of 91. Citing a "shameless record of convicting innocent people and putting them on death row," Governor Ryan, a moderate Republican, defended his decision to suspend the death penalty in Illinois on Jan. 31 as an act of conscience. Ryan later commuted the sentences of all death row inmates, a decision that drew both praise and criticism. His legacy is complex, as he also faced corruption charges and served time in prison.</p>

          <p>A 15-year-old philosopher, Benjamin Qin Muji, has gained recognition for his essay exploring the consciousness and rights of artificial intelligence. He argues that AI, with its capacity to process information and synthesize ideas, possesses a form of consciousness. However, he believes that AI cannot feel pain due to the absence of a biological body. Benjamin's work reflects a growing interest in the ethical and legal implications of advanced AI, as society grapples with defining the boundaries of human and machine intelligence.</p>

          <p>The article reviews the film 'April,' which stars Ia Sukhitashvili as Nina, an obstetrician in Georgia who privately performs abortions for women in outlying villages. The movie eschews traditional storytelling to zero in on the oppressive gloom descending on Nina. The film uses tracking shots as hints into its characterâ€™s mindset and the cinematography emphasizes antiseptic hospital hallways and the cold procedural quality of Ninaâ€™s work. With utter naturalism, the director and star dramatize a cruel, sexist reality thatâ€™s as unescapable as that inexplicable creature that repeatedly invades the story.</p>

Critics argue that the move is politically motivated and constitutes viewpoint discrimination.
