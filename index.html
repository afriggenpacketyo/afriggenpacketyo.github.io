          <p>Chinese tourists are returning to Japan in large numbers, surpassing pre-pandemic levels, but with a shift in travel preferences. Instead of large group tours and shopping sprees, they are now seeking immersive experiences related to Japanese cuisine, culture, and scenery. The Japan National Tourism Organization is adapting its marketing strategies to target this new trend, particularly families with young children. However, a Japanese manga predicting a major disaster in Japan this July initially discouraged travel, though recent data suggests its impact is waning.</p>

          <p>A commercial truck carrying an estimated 250 million honeybees overturned in northwestern Washington state, releasing millions of bees. Authorities warned people to avoid the area due to the potential for swarming. Bee experts are assisting with the cleanup, aiming to allow the bees to return to their hives and find their queen. The goal is to save as many bees as possible, recognizing their key role in pollination and food production. Experts attribute the decline of bees and other pollinators to insecticides, parasites, disease, climate change, and lack of diverse food supply.</p>
