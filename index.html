          <p>Bitcoin surged to a new record high, surpassing $118,000, driven by a significant influx of institutional investment into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On Thursday, these ETFs saw their largest single-day inflow of the year, totaling $1.18 billion, which fueled the rally. The momentum was also supported by a broader tech stock rally and speculation about a more dovish future leadership at the Federal Reserve, which has historically been a positive catalyst for the cryptocurrency. This price increase triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further accelerating the upward trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two elderly residents, a woman in her 90s and another in her 80s, have died following an incident where a stolen car crashed into their care home in Sunderland. The crash occurred after a police pursuit of a BMW, which resulted in significant damage to the building and the evacuation of residents. Eight other residents were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, and two 21-year-old men have been rearrested on suspicion of manslaughter. The case has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct due to the preceding police chase.</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to officially enter the Indian market with the launch of an "Experience Center" showroom in Mumbai on July 15. This move marks the electric vehicle giant's first official presence in the country, with plans to begin direct sales to customers. The company faces challenges, including a 70% import duty on electric vehicles, though a reduced rate is available for companies that commit to local manufacturing. Tesla will compete with established players like China's BYD and local manufacturer Tata Motors as it begins its operations and recruitment efforts in India.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee is advancing its investigation into whether former President Joe Biden's aides concealed his alleged cognitive decline. Investigators are set to interview Ashley Williams, a former deputy director of Oval Office Operations, making her the third ex-aide to be summoned in the probe. The inquiry also examines if presidential orders were signed by autopen without Biden's knowledge. This development follows the recent testimony of former White House physician Dr. Kevin O'Connor, who invoked the Fifth Amendment, which committee chair James Comer described as evidence of a cover-up.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed an advanced robot designed to automate the process of cotton topping, a crucial step in boosting crop yields. The machine, currently in pilot testing in Xinjiang, uses solid-state lidar and machine vision to precisely identify and remove the plant's top bud with a high-powered blue laser. This technology aims to overcome the inefficiencies and crop damage associated with manual methods. According to the development team from Xinjiang University, the robot has demonstrated 98.9% accuracy in bud detection and an 82% topping success rate with minimal plant damage.</p>

The decision was made via an emergency motion at the union's conference, where it also announced a re-evaluation of its relationship with the Labour Party. The conflict stems from Rayner urging striking workers to accept a deal from the Labour-run city council, which Unite's general secretary criticized as a disgraceful backing of the council over workers.

This blanket tariff is separate from existing sectoral duties on steel, aluminum, and autos, and Trump warned of even higher levies if Canada retaliates further.

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $15 million in funding for research into PFAS contamination on U.S. farmland, halting studies crucial for understanding how these "forever chemicals" enter the food supply. The research was focused on how PFAS from sources like sewage sludge used as fertilizer accumulates in crops and livestock. The move has been condemned by public health advocates and scientists, who call the research essential for ensuring food safety and protecting farmers. The administration's action is described by one critic as "not just stupid, it's evil," as it could lead to decades more of toxic exposure.</p>

          <p>Iconiq Capital, a wealth management firm with high-profile clients like Mark Zuckerberg, is pioneering a new approach to philanthropy through collaborative funds called "co-labs." These funds pool clients' capital to make multiyear, unrestricted grants to nonprofits focused on specific causes, such as youth mental health or climate equity. The model aims to accelerate charitable giving by making it easier for busy, wealthy individuals to deploy their capital effectively without the bureaucracy of traditional foundations. This approach is seen as increasingly crucial as potential changes in tax policy and federal funding cuts place more pressure on the nonprofit sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reignited its global trade war, threatening new tariffs on numerous countries and creating significant uncertainty for American businesses. Companies reliant on imports are struggling to navigate the unpredictable and often haphazardly announced levies, which have gone as high as 145% for some goods from China. This instability disrupts supply chains, forcing businesses to freeze spending, halt hiring, and raise consumer prices. While large-scale economic impact has been partially buffered by firms absorbing costs, analysts predict inventories will soon be depleted, leading to higher inflation and an average cost increase of $2,400 per household this year.

          <p>This article posits that any Israeli euphoria following its recent military strikes on Iran is premature, as the long-term consequences could be counterproductive. The author argues that while operationally impressive, the attacks may have only strengthened Iran's resolve to develop a nuclear weapon, fitting a historical pattern of escalation. The piece contrasts the intense preparation for the distant Iranian threat with the intelligence failure of October 7, suggesting a misplaced focus that has prolonged the devastating war in Gaza. It concludes that true security challenges remain unresolved, particularly the ongoing conflict and the question of Gaza's future governance.</p>

          <p>Following recent military actions against Iran, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Houthi targets in Yemen, analysts suggest Israel is applying its former Gaza strategy of "mowing the grass" across the entire Middle East. This approach involves periodic, limited military strikes to degrade enemy capabilities and maintain a strategic advantage without committing to full-scale occupation or eradication. While the strikes against Iran were popular in Israel, this multi-front engagement raises questions about its long-term sustainability, economic cost, and impact on diplomatic normalization efforts with Arab nations. The strategy reflects a higher tolerance for risk and a reliance on Israel's own military capabilities.</p>

          <p>A recent study highlights the critical role of scavengers like vultures in maintaining public health, drawing a link between their decline and increased human disease. The near-extinction of vultures in India in the 1990s, caused by a livestock painkiller, led to an estimated 100,000 additional human deaths annually due to proliferating feral dogs and pathogens from uneaten carcasses. Researchers report that a third of all scavenging species are declining, which could lead to similar health crises globally. The study argues that protecting these apex scavengers is essential for ecosystem stability and preventing the spread of diseases.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy unexpectedly shrank by 0.1% in May, marking the second consecutive month of contraction and defying analyst expectations of slight growth. The decline was primarily driven by a drop in the manufacturing and production sectors, alongside weak retail sales, according to the Office for National Statistics. This performance, which Chancellor Rachel Reeves called "disappointing," puts pressure on the government's economic agenda and suggests that the strong growth seen in the first quarter may have been short-lived. The data increases expectations for an interest rate cut by the Bank of England. (not investment advice)</p>

Even with identical PhDs, children of business executives are 17 times more likely to join a top company's board than children from working-class families.

In contrast, subtle or successful procedures are often lauded as empowering status symbols. This cultural dissonance creates a toxic environment where individuals are encouraged to pursue cosmetic enhancements but are harshly criticized if the outcome is not deemed aesthetically perfect, exposing a complicated etiquette around discussing beauty and self-alteration.</p>
