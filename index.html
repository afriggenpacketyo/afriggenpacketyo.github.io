          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson is working to unite House Republicans around a plan to enact President Trump's agenda, following Senate passage of a budget resolution. The Senate version, calling for at least $4 billion in spending cuts, differs from the House's $1.5-2 trillion target, leading to conservative opposition. Johnson insists the Senate bill doesn't impede the House's February-passed version, aiming for a bill on Trump's desk by May. The conflict highlights the challenges in reconciling different GOP factions to advance Trump's priorities through budget reconciliation.</p>

          <p>The rise of optimized morning routines, exemplified by fitness influencer Ashton Hall's strict 3:52 AM regimen, has sparked debate about modern masculinity. Hall's routine, involving ice baths, skincare, and workouts, has drawn both admiration and criticism, with some questioning its impact on men's perceptions of success and gender roles. Critics argue that such content, while seemingly benign, promotes regressive ideas about masculinity and reinforces a new wave of conservatism among Gen-Z men, subtly pushing towards a patriarchal view where women are secondary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists are questioning the formula behind President Trump's proposed "reciprocal" tariffs, arguing it inflates rates due to flawed assumptions about import price elasticity. The Trump administration's formula uses a lower elasticity rate than what economists consider accurate, leading to tariffs exceeding 14% for some countries, while most should be at the baseline of 10%. The Cato Institute also found that the trade-weighted average tariff rates used to justify the reciprocal tariffs are higher than actual rates, highlighting discrepancies in the administration's economic reasoning.</p>

The prosecution details multiple schemes where Santos allegedly misappropriated funds for personal expenses and fabricated a $500,000 personal loan to his campaign.

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on goods from South Korea, including a 25% hike on K-beauty products, are causing concern among skincare enthusiasts. The tariffs will test the strength of the K-beauty brand in the U.S., potentially leading to price increases for popular products. Some companies may consider relocating production to the U.S. to avoid tariffs, while others may shift focus to other markets. Consumers are reacting with concern, fearing the loss of affordable, high-quality skincare options.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is temporarily halting shipments of UK-made cars to the US to assess the impact of President Trump's 25% tariffs on imported cars. The US is a significant market for JLR, accounting for almost a quarter of its sales. This pause raises concerns about the broader impact of tariffs on the British car industry. Britain is focused on securing a trade deal with Washington, and Keir Starmer is engaging with foreign leaders about the potential damage of a trade war.</p>

          <p>While global leaders expressed concern over President Trump's tariffs, Argentina's President Javier Milei reaffirmed his support for Trump, attending an event at Mar-a-Lago. Milei, who has implemented austerity measures in Argentina, has aligned himself with Trump's policies and rhetoric. Despite the alliance, Argentina faces a 10% tariff, which officials framed as preferential treatment. Milei is seeking a $20 billion bailout from the IMF, highlighting the economic challenges facing Argentina.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration argued that a federal judge cannot order the return of a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, claiming it lacks the authority to intervene with a foreign power. Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported despite a 2019 ruling protecting him from deportation due to potential persecution by gangs. The administration insists it has no control over Abrego Garcia and cannot arrange for his return, drawing criticism from advocates who argue the government has failed to rectify its errors.</p>

          <p>Cosmetic surgery in the UK is on the rise, driven by treatments to remove wrinkles and tone the body. Boob jobs remain the most popular treatment, but there's a significant increase in facial rejuvenation and body contouring procedures. The British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS) attributes this to cheaper and easier access to surgery, along with reduced stigma. Non-surgical procedures like Botox and fillers also remain popular, while some trends are linked to the use of weight-loss injections.</p>
