          <h2>UK Retail Sales Experience Significant Surge After Four Years</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 05:09:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK retail sales experienced a substantial increase in the first few months of the year, marking the most significant rise in nearly four years. The Office for National Statistics attributed this growth to warmer weather in March, which boosted sales in garden centers, clothing, and DIY goods. However, food sales, especially in supermarkets, saw a decline. Despite the positive trend, analysts caution that consumer confidence dipped in April, potentially leading to weaker sales in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Arthur L. Jenkins III, a spinal surgeon, highlights the detrimental effects of poor posture, particularly 'tech neck,' on back health. He explains that slouching strains the spine and muscles, leading to conditions like kyphosis and lower back pain. Jenkins recommends standing up frequently, using a standing desk, and engaging core muscles to maintain a healthy posture. Additionally, he advises against bending, lifting, and twisting simultaneously to prevent back pain, and suggests seeking professional help if pain persists. </p>
