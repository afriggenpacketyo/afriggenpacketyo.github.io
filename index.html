        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BRICS member countries are in preliminary discussions about establishing a multilateral investment guarantee mechanism, according to a Brazilian official. This initiative aims to enhance the bloc's role in stabilizing the global economy by offering political risk insurance and credit guarantees, similar to the World Bankâ€™s Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). The proposed mechanism would complement BRICS' existing financial tools, such as the Contingent Reserve Arrangement, and could help attract foreign direct investment to developing countries by mitigating risks like expropriation and currency inconvertibility.</p>

          <p>President Trump's repeated calls for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates may not translate into lower borrowing costs for consumers. Economists suggest that Trump's attacks on the Fed's independence and his tariff policies could actually keep long-term interest rates higher. A less independent Fed may lead to concerns about future inflation, causing investors to demand higher yields on Treasury securities. While the Fed typically cuts rates during economic downturns, market forces largely determine long-term rates on mortgages and auto loans.</p>

          <p>Ryan Coogler's new film, Sinners, had a successful opening weekend, topping the box office and becoming the highest-grossing original feature since the pandemic. Despite this, much of the coverage has focused on the film's high production cost and whether it will be profitable. Some industry insiders have expressed concerns about the deal Coogler secured with Warner Bros., which includes ownership rights after 25 years. The article argues that the conversation should be about the film's artistic and commercial success, rather than financial anxieties.</p>
