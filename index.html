          <p>Several news outlets are covering a proposed peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, with Donald Trump reportedly willing to recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea. The Financial Times notes pressure on Kyiv to concede territory for Trump to claim victory. The IMF has delivered a negative verdict on Trump's tariffs, forecasting a slowdown in global growth, while UK's net-zero ambitions face a setback due to concerns over Chinese slave labor in solar panel supply chains. The death of Pope Francis is also a prominent story, with Prince William expected to attend the funeral. Optimism is limited due to the ongoing conflict and economic concerns.

          <p>More travelers, especially Gen Z and millennials, are utilizing 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) services to finance flights, hotels, and cruises, sometimes with no interest or late fees. BNPL companies like Klarna and Affirm have reported significant increases in travel bookings processed through their platforms. While some users find BNPL easy and convenient for spreading out travel costs, others warn of potential pitfalls such as accumulating debt, inflexible repayment terms, and unexpected fees. Financial advisors recommend using BNPL responsibly and only when you have the funds for the trip, as missed payments can negatively impact credit scores. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell was convicted in Arizona of conspiring to murder her estranged husband, Charles Vallow, in 2019, adding to her previous life sentences for the deaths of her two children. Prosecutors argued that Vallow Daybell sought to benefit from Vallow's life insurance policy and marry Chad Daybell, whose doomsday beliefs influenced her actions. Vallow Daybell, who defended herself, claimed her brother shot Vallow in self-defense, but the jury found her guilty after three hours of deliberation. The case has drawn national attention due to the bizarre religious claims and the tragic deaths of multiple individuals.</p>

          <p>Nassau County, New York, is considering a law that would prohibit individuals from standing within 15 feet of police officers or first responders during emergencies, potentially leading to misdemeanor charges and fines. Supporters argue the measure is necessary to protect first responders from interference, while critics contend it infringes on constitutional rights, particularly the ability to monitor police activity. Similar laws in other states have been struck down by courts for violating due process and First Amendment rights, raising concerns about the bill's potential for abuse and its impact on government transparency.</p>

This slight rise follows a long-term decline that began around 2008 during the Great Recession. However, demographers caution against drawing broad conclusions, citing ongoing economic uncertainty, housing costs, and childcare challenges for US families. The report also indicates a record-low number of teenage births, while births among women aged 40-44 increased, with Hispanic and Asian women showing higher birth rates.</p>

          <p>Recent indications from the White House suggesting a softening stance on tariffs against China may provide Beijing with an opportunity to secure a more favorable trade deal, according to economists. President Donald Trump's comments about reducing tariffs on Chinese goods have been interpreted as a sign of anxiety from the US side. Analysts suggest that China is not displaying the same level of urgency, potentially giving them greater leverage in trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year. HHS and FDA will collaborate with food companies to voluntarily remove the dyes and are looking to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings. The plan hinges on an understanding with major food companies to meet consumer demand by transitioning to natural alternatives. The International Association of Color Manufacturers has questioned the proposed timeline, while the Consumer Brands Association has indicated its members would work with the administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its 2025 GDP growth forecasts for major Asian economies, including China and India, citing trade tensions and high policy uncertainty. Global growth forecasts were also reduced due to the negative impact of tariffs announced by the U.S. and its trading partners. The IMF's forecast aligns with a broader trend of research firms and banks cutting growth projections for Asian economies amid the intensifying U.S.-China trade war. Despite conciliatory efforts from Japan and India, trade tensions continue to weigh on the region's economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New government measures will grant police chiefs the authority to automatically dismiss officers who fail background checks, aiming to boost public confidence in policing. The reforms, prompted by an independent report into the murder of Sarah Everard by a police officer, make passing background checks a legal requirement for all serving officers. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper emphasizes that only officers of the highest standards will be allowed to wear the uniform. The changes address concerns about officers remaining on full pay despite failing vetting checks, and provide clear routes for removing individuals who fall below expected standards.</p>
