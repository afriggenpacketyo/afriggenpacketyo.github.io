This small increase reflects cautious consumer spending due to economic concerns, including stock market volatility and uncertainty surrounding government policies.  The increase was primarily driven by grocery, home improvement, and online sales, while auto, restaurant, and electronics sales declined.</p>

          <p>A £3 billion rescue loan for Thames Water has been approved after an appeal was dismissed. The loan, secured in February, prevents the company from coming under government control.
