          <p>President Vladimir Putin hosted Russia's Victory Day parade in Red Square, commemorating the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany, amid tight security following Ukrainian strikes. The event was attended by over 20 international leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, underscoring Putin's effort to project global leadership despite Western isolation attempts. A unilateral ceasefire was announced, though Ukraine dismissed it as a theatrical show, and both sides exchanged accusations of violations. The presence of leaders from Brazil, Venezuela, and Slovakia highlighted Russia's continued international relationships amidst the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, where Russia has struggled to achieve a decisive victory after three years of war.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security defended the detainment of Ximena Arias-Cristobal, a Georgia college student and Mexican national, after she was arrested for traffic violations and found to be in the U.S. illegally. Arias-Cristobal admitted to being in the U.S. illegally and does not have a pending application with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Her father was also detained at the same ICE facility for similar violations. DHS emphasized that they are not ignoring the rule of law and that the family will be able to return to Mexico together, noting that many people in the U.S. illegally are being given the chance to self-deport via the Customs and Border Protection Home app, which would allow them to return to America in the future through legal avenues.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated following a deadly terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, bringing the two nuclear-armed nations to the brink of war. Both countries have exchanged missile and drone attacks, leading to civilian casualties and heightened security measures, including air raid sirens and airport alerts. The conflict is rooted in a decades-old dispute over the Kashmir region, which both countries claim in full but control only in part. India accuses Pakistan of supporting separatist militants, while Pakistan denies the allegations, and the recent events have raised international concern about the potential for a major conflict in the already-tumultuous region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on certain imports from the U.S., including steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals, on a reciprocal basis. This move signals a potential shift away from India's protectionist trade policies, which have historically relied on high import duties. Experts suggest that a trade deal with the U.S. could boost India's economic growth by attracting foreign investment and expanding its access to global markets. However, some analysts caution that India will need to carefully balance the benefits of a deal with the need to protect its domestic manufacturing industries.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia celebrated his countryâ€™s victory against Nazi Germany with a military parade in Moscow, joined by Chinaâ€™s top leader, Xi Jinping. The event aimed to project Putin as a leader of an emerging alliance of anti-Western states, despite Western efforts to isolate him after the invasion of Ukraine. While over 20 international dignitaries attended, the display of military might contrasted with Russiaâ€™s limited gains in Ukraine and a slowing economy. Putin has attempted to use the Soviet triumph over Nazi Germany to legitimize his invasion of Ukraine, turning a unifying event into a point of division.</p>

          <p>New Chinese government data reveals that while exports to the United States have declined sharply due to President Trump's tariffs, overall exports from China jumped last month, driven by trade to other countries in Southeast Asia. This shift indicates a reordering of global trade flows as Chinese factories redirect goods to avoid U.S. tariffs. Imports into China have fallen as demand continues to weaken, and economists warn that unemployment could spike if declining factory orders force companies to fire workers. U.S. and Chinese trade representatives are scheduled to meet in Geneva to discuss the escalating trade tensions.</p>

          <p>China's exports experienced a surge in April, primarily driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which compensated for a significant drop in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. While overall exports jumped 8.1%, shipments to the U.S. plunged over 21%. The rise in exports to ASEAN countries, particularly Vietnam and Malaysia, indicates a shift in trade patterns. Experts suggest that the surge may be partly due to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced, and they anticipate trade data to weaken in the coming months.</p>

Rising electricity prices in the U.S., relative to global competitors, are leading to smelter closures rather than restarts. The lack of access to competitively priced, long-term power remains the primary barrier to domestic smelting, with U.S. smelters facing significantly higher energy costs compared to those in Canada and the Middle East.</p>

          <p>President Trump abruptly terminated Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, a move that has sparked outrage among congressional Democrats. Hayden, the first woman and African American to hold the position, was notified of her dismissal via email from the White House. The firing follows criticism from a conservative advocacy group accusing her of promoting "radical" content. Democrats have condemned the decision as an unjust assault on libraries and American history, while supporters of Hayden praised her efforts to modernize and make the Library of Congress more accessible.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested that U.S. tariffs on goods from China may decrease as top trade officials from both countries prepare for talks. The statement comes as the U.S. and UK announced a tariffs deal, signaling a potential de-escalation of the trade war. While China's exports to the U.S. have fallen, its overall exports have risen, indicating resilience. Analysts warn that even if tariffs are lifted, significant issues remain, and negotiations are expected to be lengthy.</p>

          <p>China is attempting to improve its relations with Europe, but its close ties with Russia present a significant obstacle. While celebratory events commemorating the 50th anniversary of China-EU diplomatic relations were held in Brussels and Beijing, Xi Jinping's trip to Russia serves as a reminder of the challenges in achieving a meaningful rapprochement. China's charm offensive aims to capitalize on shifts in U.S. policy under President Trump, but concerns about China's support for Russia continue to cast a shadow over these efforts.</p>

          <p>New soil testing by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health revealed high levels of lead and other toxic metals at homesites previously cleaned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers after wildfires.

The county recommends property owners consider soil contamination assessments before rebuilding. The findings highlight the need for comprehensive soil testing after wildfire debris removal, a practice that federal agencies have declined to fund.</p>

          <p>The United States, under President Trump, is showing renewed interest in acquiring Greenland, a territory of Denmark. This interest stems from Greenland's strategic geographic location, which is close to both Russia and Europe. The Arctic's warming climate and Russia's increasing presence in the region are driving factors behind this renewed U.S. attention. While Trump's administration appears to favor a unilateral approach, there are alternative models for cooperation that could address both U.S. interests and concerns among international partners.</p>
