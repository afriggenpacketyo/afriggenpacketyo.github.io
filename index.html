          <p>Shares for the design software company Figma continued to rise in their second day of trading after a highly successful initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock, which was priced at $33, more than tripled on its first day, signaling strong investor confidence in the tech market. This IPO follows a failed $20 billion acquisition attempt by Adobe in 2022, which was blocked by regulators over competition concerns. Figma's strong market entry is a notable event in a period that has seen a recent revival of tech IPOs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida's emergency management agency released a heavily censored draft plan for evacuating a migrant detention center, known as "Alligator Alcatraz," during a hurricane. The 33-page document has large sections blacked out, including the locations of alternate facilities, raising significant concerns among lawmakers and advocates about the safety and transparency of the procedures. Officials maintain the facility is secure against Category 2 winds, but critics, including Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, are demanding a clear, unredacted plan to ensure the well-being of detainees in a major storm.</p>

Favre, who is dealing with his own Parkinson's diagnosis, called Sanders a "grinder" and said he was not surprised that Coach Prime continued to work through his illness. Sanders recently revealed his successful surgery and urged others to get regular health check-ups, noting his cancer was discovered incidentally.

          <p>The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced a rival "Transitional Peace Government" in the Darfur region, a move that threatens to formally split war-torn Sudan. This new administration, led by RSF General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, claims jurisdiction over the entire country, challenging the internationally recognized government in Khartoum. The African Union and the United Nations have condemned the move, warning it will deepen the nation's fragmentation and complicate efforts to end the devastating civil war. The conflict has already created the world's largest displacement crisis and led to over 150,000 deaths.</p>

          <p>The UK's Met Office has officially named Storm Floris, which is forecast to bring strong winds and heavy rain across the country, particularly in northern regions. As the sixth named storm of the season, Floris is expected to cause significant disruption, with potential wind gusts of 60-70 mph and up to 85 mph in exposed coastal areas of Scotland. Authorities warn that the summer storm could impact travel, damage temporary structures, and cause power outages, as trees in full leaf are more vulnerable. This follows a pattern of disruptive August storms in recent years.</p>

          <p>Federal data for the 2024-2025 school year reveals a concerning trend in the United States, with vaccination rates for kindergarteners decreasing for all required vaccines. Simultaneously, the rate of exemptions has climbed to an all-time high of 3.6%, with 17 states reporting exemption rates above 5%. This decline in immunization coverage for diseases like measles, mumps, and rubella has pushed rates below the 95% threshold needed for herd immunity. The trend coincides with the largest measles outbreak in the U.S. in over 30 years, heightening public health concerns.</p>

          <p>In an unusual rock and roll shuffle, the Foo Fighters and Nine Inch Nails have effectively traded drummers. The Foo Fighters have hired Ilan Rubin, who recently departed Nine Inch Nails after a 16-year tenure with the industrial rock band. In a corresponding move, Nine Inch Nails re-hired Josh Freese, who had just been let go by the Foo Fighters and had previously played with NIN from 2005 to 2008. Both bands and drummers have released statements about the changes, with Freese expressing his excitement to return to his former band.</p>

          <p>In her first interview since losing the 2024 presidential election, Kamala Harris stated that she does not currently want to return to what she describes as a "broken" system of American politics. Speaking on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, the former Vice President explained her decision not to run for governor of California, citing a loss of faith in the strength of democratic systems to defend fundamental principles. Harris lamented what she saw as the "capitulation" of many supposed guardians of democracy to the current political climate, expressing a desire to travel the country and listen to people instead of running for office.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has demanded stronger international sanctions against Russia following one of the deadliest attacks on Kyiv since the full-scale invasion began. The assault, involving over 300 drones and multiple cruise missiles, killed at least 31 people, including five children, and collapsed an apartment building. In response to the attack, U.S. President Donald Trump condemned Russia's actions as "disgusting" and suggested new sanctions were forthcoming.

          <p>An NPR profile explores the influence of Twitch streamer Hasan Piker, one of the most prominent progressive voices online, questioning if he serves as a "Joe Rogan of the left." The article discusses how Piker combines "bro culture" interests like video games and working out with leftist political commentary, potentially reaching an audience of young men often targeted by right-wing commentators. Piker himself argues against the idea that masculinity is inherently tied to right-wing politics and asserts that Democrats need better policies, not just charismatic online figures, to win over voters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is developing a pilot program to provide Medicare and Medicaid coverage for popular GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. This five-year experimental plan would allow government health insurance programs for low-income and elderly Americans to voluntarily cover the high-cost medications for weight management purposes. The move aims to address the U.S. obesity crisis but raises significant financial questions due to the drugs' high prices, which can exceed $7,000 per year.
