          <p>U.S. Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna are leading a bipartisan effort to force a vote on releasing the complete Jeffrey Epstein files. Massie suggested the delay may be due to potential embarrassment for powerful political donors and possible connections to intelligence agencies. Both congressmen emphasized that justice for survivors must take precedence over protecting influential individuals from reputational harm. They are confident they have secured the necessary votes for a discharge petition to bring the matter to the House floor for a vote this month.</p>

          <p>Police in the Czech Republic have arrested a 51-year-old man who has been seen driving a red, Ferrari-liveried racing car on public motorways since 2019. The driver, who wore a full racing suit and helmet, was tracked down after a recent sighting and arrested at his home. Previously, authorities were unable to press charges because the helmet obscured the driver's identity. The vehicle is identified as a Dallara GP2/08, not an actual Ferrari F1 car, and the owner now faces fines for driving an unroadworthy vehicle.</p>

          <p>In her first televised interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed criticisms about the Court's perceived rightward shift and its role in checking presidential power. She dismissed political labels, stating her focus is on deciding cases based on the law, not ideology. Regarding the overturning of Roe v. Wade, Barrett asserted that the Dobbs decision returned the issue of abortion to the democratic process in the states. She refrained from commenting on specific pending legal issues, including those related to President Trump's executive orders, emphasizing the need for judicial impartiality.</p>

          <p>A Black man in South Carolina is urging the state to pass a hate crime law after he was the target of a racially motivated shooting. The victim, Jarvis McKenzie, described being shot at and racially threatened by a white man who was later arrested under a local county ordinance. South Carolina and Wyoming are the only two states without a statewide hate crime law, which would allow for more severe penalties. Despite passing the state House in 2021, the proposed legislation has stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate.</p>

          <p>Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth condemned President Trump's social media posts suggesting a military or law enforcement intervention in Chicago, stating it is unacceptable for a president to effectively "declare war" on a major American city. Duckworth confirmed that a local naval base has only been asked to provide office space for ICE, with no indication of troops being deployed. She accused the administration of refusing to coordinate with local officials and using the threats as a distraction from other issues, such as the gathering of U.S. adversaries and criticism from Epstein survivors.</p>

Ukrainian officials reported at least eight civilian deaths nationwide and significant damage to the government building's upper floors. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack as a deliberate crime intended to prolong the war and called for increased international military aid.

While acknowledging that prices will rise, the author contends that the economy can likely absorb the impact as long as consumer income and wealth remain strong.

          <p>This article outlines the key differences and advantages of Roth IRAs and 401(k)s for retirement savings. A Roth IRA offers greater investment flexibility and the ability to withdraw contributions penalty-free, while a 401(k) provides effortless, automated contributions and significantly higher annual contribution limits. The recommended strategy is to first contribute to a 401(k) to receive any employer match, then focus on maxing out a Roth IRA, before returning to the 401(k) if funds allow. This approach combines immediate tax benefits with future tax-free growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Donald Trump's rhetoric reveals a significant and increasing use of phrases like "never seen anything like it" to describe events, policies, and outcomes. This verbal tic is presented as a reflection of his black-and-white worldview, where his successes are historic and the nation's problems are unprecedented crises requiring his intervention. According to a database of presidential remarks, Trump's use of this hyperbole has surged this year compared to previous years in office. The article suggests this linguistic pattern translates into his governance style, framing every situation in extreme terms.</p>

          <p>Over 15,000 protesters gathered in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, urging Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure a deal for the release of hostages held by Hamas and to end the war in Gaza. Families of the hostages expressed anger and fear that an expanded military offensive would further endanger their loved ones. Despite growing domestic and international pressure, the Israeli government appears poised to intensify its military operations, vowing to achieve total victory over Hamas. Of the 48 hostages remaining in Gaza, as many as 20 are believed to still be alive.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick earned his first victory as head coach of the University of North Carolina with a 20-3 win over Charlotte. Following the game, he addressed reports of animosity with his former team, the New England Patriots, confirming he has banned their scouts from UNC practices. Belichick stated that since he feels unwelcome in the Patriots' facility, they are not welcome in his, signaling a clear deterioration in the relationship. The win provided a much-needed morale boost for the Tar Heels after a decisive loss to TCU in Belichick's debut game.</p>

          <p>London's transport network is experiencing significant disruption as Underground staff have begun a five-day strike over pay and working conditions. The RMT union is demanding a 32-hour work week to address fatigue, a proposal Transport for London (TfL) has called unaffordable. The rolling strike action will result in little to no service on most Tube lines through Thursday, with other services like the Elizabeth line and Overground expected to be much busier. The industrial action has already forced the rescheduling of two concerts by the artist Post Malone.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being a world leader in green technology exports, China is also increasing its coal power capacity. This opinion piece argues that this is not a climate policy reversal but a strategic move to ensure grid stability as the country integrates record amounts of renewable energy. With solar and wind power generation surging, existing infrastructure sometimes cannot handle the output, leading to "curtailment" where clean energy is wasted. Coal plants are being used as a shock absorber to prevent blackouts during peak demand or when hydropower is low, providing a reliable backup for the energy transition.</p>

          <p>The United States Tennis Association is facing criticism for its decision to ask broadcast partners not to show any crowd disruptions or negative reactions to President Donald Trump's attendance at the US Open final. Critics call the move a cowardly and hypocritical act of censorship that contradicts the tournament's brand of being unfiltered and democratic. The USTA defended its request as standard policy to avoid showcasing off-court disruptions, but commentators point out the organization has previously televised other protests and disturbances. The decision is seen as an attempt to shield a political figure from public disapproval.</p>

The platform expanded internationally and evolved into the app Vinted, which now has over 16 million users in the UK.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that numerous long-necked sauropod dinosaurs in Brazil were afflicted with osteomyelitis, a destructive bone infection, approximately 80 million years ago. Paleontologists analyzed the fossilized skeletons of six sauropods from the same site and found lesions indicative of the disease, which is caused by bacteria, fungi, or other pathogens. The fact that none of the bones showed signs of healing suggests the infections were active at the time of death and may have been a contributing factor. The swampy, wet environment these dinosaurs inhabited would have been an ideal breeding ground for such pathogens.</p>

His renewed interest coincides with the Trump administration considering the use of private contractors in a postwar Ukraine.

          <p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a statement encouraging public school students to recite the Lord's Prayer, a Christian prayer, following the implementation of a new state law allowing time for religious observance.

Critics accuse Paxton of promoting Christian nationalism and violating the constitutional separation of church and state by endorsing one specific faith. His actions are seen as part of a broader effort to appeal to ultraconservative voters.</p>

          <p>William Pulte, the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), is facing scrutiny for his unusual personal involvement in a criminal referral against Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud.

The referral, which accuses Cook of misrepresenting her primary residence on loan applications, is widely seen as politically motivated, as Trump has sought to remove her from the Fed board to install his own appointees.</p>

An associate professor at Sam Houston State University described the move as part of Trump's broader negotiation strategy with China, aimed at creating a more positive atmosphere before a potential meeting with President Xi Jinping. Analysts caution against interpreting this as a fundamental change, noting that the overall political climate in the U.S. remains skeptical towards China, with no signs of streamlined visa processes.</p>
