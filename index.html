          <p>The Trump administration has deployed 700 Marines from Twentynine Palms, California, to Los Angeles in response to protests against immigration enforcement operations. These Marines, from the 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, are expected to operate in a support role. The mobilization occurred on the same day that California sued the Trump administration over the deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles, arguing that Trump's actions violated the 10th Amendment. Trump stated on Truth Social that Los Angeles would be "completely obliterated" without his deployment of the Guard, and the administration has deployed 2,000 Guard personnel to the city. The Marines' role is to augment and support the protection of Federal functions and property.</p>

          <p>President Trump is sending troops to Los Angeles amidst unrest sparked by his administration's immigration policies. ICE agents conducted workplace raids in Los Angeles, leading to widespread protests and vandalism. In response, Trump announced the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops against the wishes of California's Governor Newsom, followed by the mobilization of 700 Marines. Newsom is suing the administration, arguing that Trump overstepped his authority, and Trump claims emergency powers due to an alleged "invasion" by migrants. This action raises concerns about civil liberties and an expansion of presidential power, as local authorities maintain they can restore order without military force.</p>

HHS noted that the Biden administration appointed all 17 sitting ACIP members, with 13 of those appointments occurring in 2024. Kennedy claimed that the committee was plagued by conflicts of interest and had never recommended against a vaccine, even those later withdrawn for safety reasons, while others have criticized the decision as dangerous.</p>

          <p>California has sued the U.S. Justice Department over its demand that school districts ban transgender athletes from competing in sports. The lawsuit argues that the federal agency has overstepped its authority and violated state and federal law. California Attorney General Rob Bonta stated that the administration is demanding schools discriminate against students and deny their constitutionally protected rights. The lawsuit seeks to uphold the constitutionality of California's antidiscrimination laws protecting transgender athletes and prevent the Trump administration from retaliating against non-compliant school districts.</p>
