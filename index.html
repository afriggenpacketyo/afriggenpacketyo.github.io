          <p>The newly constructed IG Arena in Nagoya is preparing to host its inaugural event, the Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament, set to begin in July. An office has been established in Nagoya to organize the tournament, which will feature around 7,800 seats. The arena, capable of accommodating up to 17,000 spectators, is also slated to host the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final in December and various concerts. Former maegashira Oginohana, now Dewanoumi stablemaster, expressed anticipation for a successful preparation and a large turnout for the event, where Onosato will make his yokozuna debut. The event marks the first time since September 2021 that two yokozuna will simultaneously hold the top rank in sumo. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that dealing with China's President Xi Jinping is "extremely hard" amid ongoing trade disputes.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the trade talks are currently stalled, necessitating intervention from both leaders. </p>

          <p>The United States has doubled its tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%, escalating trade war concerns and casting a shadow over a gathering of OECD ministers. This move, effective midnight EDT, has strained relationships with trading partners and led to negotiations aimed at averting the duties. The OECD has already cut its global growth forecast due to these tariffs, with chief economist Alvaro Pereira warning of significant repercussions for the U.S. economy. While some of Mr. Trump's most sweeping levies face legal challenges, they've been allowed to remain in place for now as an appeals process proceeds. The EU and Canada have expressed strong opposition to the tariffs and are considering retaliatory measures. </p>

          <p>Searches for Madeleine McCann have recommenced in Portugal, 18 years after she disappeared from Praia da Luz. Portuguese and German authorities are focusing on abandoned buildings and wells in the municipality of Lagos, near where Madeleine vanished. Madeleine was three years old when she went missing during a family holiday in 2007, leading to a high-profile missing persons case. The current search, covering a 21 sq km site, will continue until Friday, concentrating on the area between where Madeleine disappeared and where the prime suspect, Christian BrÃ¼ckner, had been staying. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla experienced a significant rebound in Australia during May, with electric vehicle sales reaching their highest level in nearly a year. Vehicle sales jumped to 3,897, primarily driven by strong demand for the revamped Model Y compact SUV, which saw a 122.5% year-over-year increase. Despite this surge, Tesla's total sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the previous year. While this growth is encouraging for Tesla in Australia, analysts caution that it doesn't necessarily indicate a broader global recovery, as the company still faces headwinds in the U.S. and Europe.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to 50%, a move intended to bolster the American steel industry. The increase, which went into effect on Wednesday, has sparked concerns among trading partners and could lead to retaliatory measures. The UK has been granted a carve-out from the measures, with duties remaining at 25% due to ongoing trade discussions with the US. Economists warn that the tariffs could increase prices for American consumers and negatively impact job creation in other sectors. </p>

Senator Bernie Sanders echoed Musk's sentiment, calling the bill an "abomination" due to its tax breaks for the wealthy and cuts to food aid for the impoverished. </p>

The mission, dubbed Operation Spiderâ€™s Web, highlights the vulnerability of even the most advanced militaries to swarms of small, inexpensive drones. The attack, planned by Ukraineâ€™s Security Service, involved smuggling over 100 explosive-laden drones across the border to damage or destroy more than 40 high-value aircraft. This innovative use of technology is likely to inspire similar asymmetric attacks in the future. </p>

          <p>More than 15 former Indiana menâ€™s basketball players have alleged improper sexual conduct by a former team physician, Dr. Bradford Bomba, claiming that university officials, including coach Bobby Knight, were aware of the behavior. The players allege that Dr. Bomba regularly performed unnecessary rectal exams on male athletes during physicals. The players claim that Knight and head athletic trainer Tim Garl instructed players to continue seeing Bomba, despite complaints. An investigation commissioned by Indiana University found that Bomba's exams were performed appropriately, however, Michelle Simpson Tuegel, representing 10 players preparing to file suit, says that two of her clients contradict that finding, with one saying Bomba "fondled his genitalia" during a physical.</p>
