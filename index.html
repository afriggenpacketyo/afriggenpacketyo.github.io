          <p>AppLovin's shares fell significantly following a report that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the company's data-collection methods. The probe was reportedly initiated after a whistleblower complaint and several short-seller reports alleged the company violates user agreements for targeted advertising. AppLovin stated it regularly engages with regulators and would disclose any material developments publicly. This investigation comes after a period of massive stock growth for the company, driven by its AI-powered ad-targeting technology.</p>

          <p>Recently obtained footage shows the perpetrator of the fatal terror attack at a Manchester synagogue moments before he drove his car into worshippers during Yom Kippur. The attack resulted in the deaths of two men, Melvin Cravitz and Adrian Daulby, with the latter believed to have been hit by police gunfire as officers engaged the attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie. Al-Shamie, who was on bail for a sexual assault accusation, was shot and killed by police at the scene. Authorities are continuing their investigation, having detained four individuals on suspicion of terror offenses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The state of Illinois and the city of Chicago have jointly sued the Trump administration to block the planned deployment of federalized National Guard troops. The lawsuit argues the move is an unconstitutional military occupation intended to sow chaos for political reasons, particularly as it is being done over the objections of state and local leaders. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Attorney General Kwame Raoul condemned the action as an "invasion" and a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. The suit seeks a temporary restraining order to halt the deployment of both Illinois and Texas National Guard members to Chicago.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the federal government shutdown continues, both Democratic and Republican politicians are increasingly using social media memes to blame each other, rather than engaging in substantive negotiations. The article highlights examples from New York Governor Kathy Hochul, President Trump's AI-generated videos, and the Democratic Party's official accounts, arguing the trend reflects a disturbing shift toward petty, unproductive rhetoric. This "meme war" serves as a distraction while hundreds of thousands of federal employees are furloughed and essential government services are halted. The analysis suggests these tactics exacerbate political divisions and fail to address the actual crisis at hand.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is beginning a new term with several cases on its docket that could significantly define the limits of presidential power, particularly concerning actions taken by the Trump administration. Key issues include the president's authority to deploy the National Guard domestically against the will of state governors, fire members of independent agencies like the Federal Reserve, and unilaterally impose tariffs. The court's decisions in these cases, along with others involving hot-button social issues, could fundamentally alter the balance of power between the executive branch and other government institutions. The article notes the court's increased use of its "shadow docket" to handle emergency petitions from the administration.</p>

The contribution has drawn scrutiny following the revelation of 2022 text messages in which Jones expressed a desire to shoot a Republican colleague. The texts have led to widespread condemnation and calls for Jones to withdraw from the race, though he has since apologized for the "embarrassing and shameful" remarks. Everytown for Gun Safety, which endorsed Jones in June, has not yet commented on whether it will maintain its support or request the donation be returned.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve recently cutting interest rates, savers are evaluating the best place for their money between certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts. A comparison shows that for a $10,000 deposit, earnings are currently very similar over terms ranging from three to twelve months. However, CDs offer a fixed interest rate, guaranteeing the return, whereas the variable rate on a high-yield savings account is likely to decrease with future Fed cuts. The article suggests that while both options are far superior to traditional savings accounts, the guaranteed return of a CD may be more appealing in a falling-rate environment.

These costs are notably lower than they were a year ago, and they are expected to decrease further with anticipated future rate cuts due to the variable nature of HELOC rates.

The political fallout from failing to pay 1.3 million active-duty service members might be too great for either side to bear. Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe this pressure could lead to at least a temporary funding bill to reopen the government. If this deadline passes without a resolution, however, there are few other clear forcing events on the calendar, raising concerns that the shutdown could become even more prolonged.</p>

          <p>The National Weather Service has upgraded a deadly tornado that struck Enderlin, North Dakota, on June 20 to an EF-5, the highest possible rating. With estimated wind speeds exceeding 210 mph, it is the first tornado in the United States to receive an EF-5 classification in 12 years. The storm resulted in three fatalities and caused extensive destruction, including derailing train cars and completely destroying a farm. The last confirmed EF-5 tornado in the U.S. occurred in Moore, Oklahoma, in May 2013, making this event a rare and exceptionally powerful weather phenomenon.</p>

          <p>Bill Pulte, the Trump-appointed director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), reportedly bypassed his agency's inspector general when making criminal referrals against political opponents like Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. According to sources, Pulte sent accusations of mortgage fraud directly to the Justice Department, circumventing standard procedures designed to prevent politically motivated investigations. This approach has been criticized by ethics experts as a violation of impartiality regulations and an abuse of power. The move is part of a broader pattern by the administration to use federal agencies to target individuals perceived as political adversaries.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For seniors considering a reverse mortgage to supplement retirement income, lenders typically require homeowners to have at least 50% to 60% equity in their property. This means the outstanding mortgage balance should not exceed half of the home's appraised value. The actual amount a senior can borrow is not the full equity amount but is instead calculated based on the borrower's age, current interest rates, and federal lending limits. If a homeowner falls short of the required equity, options include paying down the existing mortgage, waiting for the property value to appreciate further, or exploring alternative financing solutions like a home equity loan.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected Ghislaine Maxwell's appeal of her conviction for sex-trafficking, upholding her 20-year prison sentence. The court declined to hear the case without providing an explanation, exhausting one of Maxwell's key legal avenues for overturning the verdict. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in recruiting and grooming underage girls for abuse by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein. Her legal team expressed deep disappointment but stated they would continue to explore other options to challenge the conviction. Maxwell was recently moved to a minimum-security prison facility in Texas.</p>

Abd–Al-Rahman was convicted on 27 counts for his role in mass killings, sexual violence, and torture carried out between 2003 and 2004 as part of a government-backed campaign to suppress a rebellion.

The administration cited national security as the justification, stating the tariff is necessary to protect U.S. manufacturers like Peterbilt and Freightliner from unfair foreign competition. The move is a significant escalation in trade protectionism and is expected to impact major exporters to the U.S., particularly Mexico, which is the largest source of such vehicle imports. Business groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have opposed the tariffs, arguing that the top import sources are allies and pose no security threat.</p>

The current show addresses topics from labor unions to the war in Ukraine and is staunchly pro-Palestinian.
