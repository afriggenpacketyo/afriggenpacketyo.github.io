          <p>President Trump has reportedly approved a plan for Nippon Steel Corp. to partner with United States Steel Corp., a decision he announced via social media. According to Trump, this partnership will create at least 70,000 jobs and inject $14 billion into the American economy, with a significant portion of the investment expected within the next 14 months. Both steelmakers have expressed support for the decision, though the specific details of the partnership and its impact on American ownership remain unclear, the United Steelworkers union remains wary of the agreement. The deal has seen U.S. Steel's shares jump significantly following the news. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Four top partners at Paul Weiss, including prominent Democratic lawyer Karen Dunn and former Mueller prosecutor Jeannie Rhee, are leaving the firm to start their own law firm. This departure follows Paul Weiss's controversial decision to strike a deal with President Trump to avoid an executive order restricting its business. The agreement, made by firm chairman Brad Karp, drew criticism from associates, other firms, and Democrats, leading to further departures including Jeh Johnson and Steven Banks. Dunn, despite being supportive of the deal initially, is now leaving alongside Rhee and Bill Isaacson, adding to the turmoil within the firm.</p>

          <p>During the search for 10 inmates who escaped from a New Orleans jail, authorities utilized facial recognition cameras operated by Project N.O.L.A., a private organization. This action has ignited a debate over privacy and civil liberties, particularly since the New Orleans Police Department had recently paused automated alerts from the group. Critics, including the ACLU, argue that live facial recognition poses a significant threat to individual rights and raises constitutional issues. Despite these concerns, authorities claim the technology aided in the recapture of one fugitive, while some Republicans and Democrats in Congress have expressed concerns about the unchecked use of facial recognition.</p>

          <p>Following a black-tie gala for top investors in his cryptocurrency meme coin, President Trump invited some of these individuals to tour the White House, raising concerns about potential "pay for play" access. Critics have blasted the event as investors who poured millions into Trump's crypto coin got special access to the president. The White House initially claimed the gala was a personal event separate from official duties, but the subsequent White House tour for crypto investors contradicts this assertion. Justin Sun, a Chinese crypto mogul and top investor in Trumpâ€™s meme coin, posted a video of his White House tour.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is implementing a significant restructuring of the National Security Council (NSC), reducing its staff size considerably. The changes involve reassignments and administrative leave, with some regional teams being dissolved or merged. Andy Baker, Vice President Vance's national security advisor, will take a top role as deputy national security advisor. Some former NSC members express concern that fewer staff will lead to less control over the bureaucracy, while others see it as streamlining the council to better align with President Trump's foreign policy objectives.</p>

          <p>A new study published in Global Change Biology suggests that the prevalence of hummingbird feeders has significantly altered the size and shape of Anna's Hummingbirds' beaks. The study found that beaks have become longer and more slender to better access nectar from feeders, while males' beaks have grown pointier for fighting off competition. This adaptation has also allowed the hummingbirds to expand their range northward, demonstrating the rapid pace of evolution in response to human-influenced food sources. Researchers analyzed museum specimens and newspaper archives to track the changes over approximately ten generations.</p>

          <h2>Brain Disorder Forces Billy Joel to Cancel Concerts</h2>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming concerts due to a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain disorder affecting his hearing, vision, and balance. NPH involves excess cerebrospinal fluid accumulating in the brain, causing difficulty walking, bladder control issues, and memory problems. Treatment typically involves surgery to insert a shunt to drain the fluid, and patients may also undergo physical therapy. Early diagnosis and treatment can often reverse the symptoms, but if left untreated, the condition can lead to irreversible damage.</p>
