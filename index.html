          <p>At least 19 people have died and several are missing after severe flash floods and landslides struck two Indonesian islands, including the popular tourist destination of Bali. National Disaster Mitigation Agency officials confirmed that emergency response efforts are ongoing, with hundreds evacuated to makeshift shelters like schools and mosques. The events highlight the increasing severity of Indonesia's monsoon season, which experts attribute to the effects of climate change causing heavier and more unpredictable rainfall patterns.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has dismissed its Ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson, following the emergence of new details regarding his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. A statement from the Foreign Office indicated that newly revealed emails showed a 'materially different' depth to their connection than was previously known at the time of his appointment. Specifically, Mandelson's suggestion that Epstein's initial conviction was wrongful prompted his immediate withdrawal from the diplomatic post, mindful of the victims of Epstein's crimes.</p>

          <p>In Angola, the Angolan Student Movement (MEA) is increasing pressure on President Joao Lourenco's government, threatening further protests over deteriorating conditions in the education system. Students and teachers cite a lack of basic resources such as desks, books, and school meals, alongside rising tuition fees, as key grievances. Despite the government's claims that the opposition is manipulating the movement, the protests are gaining widespread support, with the national teachers' union also threatening a strike over poor pay and overcrowded classrooms.</p>

          <p>Attendees at the Utah Valley University event where conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot have described scenes of mass panic and confusion immediately following the single gunshot. Witnesses reported hearing a loud bang before seeing Kirk fall from his stool, which prompted the crowd of approximately 3,000 people to scatter and seek cover. Some attendees noted a surprising lack of security measures, such as bag checks, at the large outdoor gathering, which contributed to the vulnerability of the event.</p>

          <p>South Africa's highest court has delivered a landmark ruling declaring that husbands have the right to adopt their wife's surname, a practice previously barred by law. The Constitutional Court found that the existing legislation constituted gender-based discrimination, siding with two couples who had challenged the statute. The decision represents a significant victory for gender equality in the country. Parliament is now required to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect the court's judgment.</p>

It argues that America has already become a country where political disagreements are confronted with violence, a reality that affects everyone regardless of their political stance.</p>

It contrasts the intuitive belief that saving five lives is better than one with the implications of applying this logic to the hundreds of billions of shrimp killed annually, which could suggest their welfare is a paramount issue. The piece profiles the Shrimp Welfare Project, a nonprofit working on humane slaughter methods, highlighting the controversy and ridicule it faces, which reflects a broader societal discomfort with the logical conclusions of utilitarian ethics.</p>

This natural end-of-life phase for female octopuses involves laying eggs and dedicating themselves entirely to their care, forgoing their own needs, which ultimately leads to their death. Although Ghost's eggs are unfertilized as she was not paired with a mate, her instinctual behavior remains the same, a process that also occurs in the wild.</p>

          <p>A decade after the first detection of gravitational waves, scientists have used advanced analysis to confirm a key theory about black holes proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1971. By observing the merger of two black holes, researchers verified Hawking's area theorem, which states that the surface area of a black hole can never decrease. The final, merged black hole was shown to have a larger surface area than the sum of the two initial black holes, providing observational proof for a concept once considered theoretical speculation.</p>

          <p>Each autumn, male brown tarantulas in Colorado undertake a remarkable and dangerous trek in search of female mates. After reaching sexual maturity, they leave their burrows and travel across the landscape, facing predators and fatigue while not eating or drinking. The females, who can live up to 30 years, remain in their dens, and the mating process is a risky affair for the males, who may be eaten by the female afterward. Despite their fearsome reputation, these tarantulas are generally harmless to humans and play a role in controlling pests.</p>

Key recommendations include ensuring total student loan debt does not exceed the expected first-year salary after graduation and practicing 'loud budgeting' by openly discussing money concerns with peers.

Using advancing DNA technology, forensic scientists repeatedly test the thousands of bone fragments recovered from Ground Zero, a challenging task due to the extreme conditions that degraded the remains. Despite these efforts, 40% of the 2,753 victims remain unidentified, but recent identifications have brought renewed hope and a measure of resolution to some families still waiting.</p>

          <p>The Brightline West project, which aims to build the first true high-speed rail line in the U.S. connecting Las Vegas to Southern California, is facing financial challenges and skepticism.

Despite securing significant private and federal funding, rising construction costs and weaker-than-projected performance on its Florida line have led some analysts to question the project's ultimate financial success.

          <p>US pharmaceutical company Merck, known as MSD in Europe, is canceling a planned £1 billion expansion in the UK, which includes a new research site in London. The company cited a lack of government investment in the life sciences industry and the 'undervaluation of innovative medicines' by successive UK governments as reasons for the decision. This move is seen as a significant blow to the UK's pharmaceutical sector, following similar decisions by other major companies like AstraZeneca, and raises concerns about the country's competitiveness in the global market.

          <p>The article contrasts the intense outrage from Trump supporters over the Jeffrey Epstein scandal with their general indifference to other allegations of sexual misconduct against Donald Trump, such as the E. Jean Carroll case. It argues this discrepancy is not about the severity of the crime but about the type of victim deemed worthy of defense. The author suggests that the MAGA movement's misogyny is paired with a selective, sentimental defense of 'fallen girls,' which provides a sense of moral clarity and crusading purpose, while accomplished, adult women who accuse powerful men are dismissed or attacked.</p>

The proposal has been met with skepticism in Europe, which is seen as unlikely to adopt such an aggressive trade strategy and risk alienating key global partners. Analysts suggest the move may be an attempt by the White House to shift responsibility for a stronger response to Europe while avoiding direct damage to U.S. relations with India and China.
