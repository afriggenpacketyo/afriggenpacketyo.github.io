          <p>The Trump administration, through Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, has announced the release of 230,000 previously classified files concerning the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. These documents, now available to the public via the National Archives, cover nearly 60 years of investigation into the 1968 assassination. The files reportedly contain details about the FBI's investigation, internal memos on the case's progress, and information regarding potential leads, including discussions with an informant who was a former cellmate of the convicted assassin, James Earl Ray. The release aims to provide greater transparency on one of the most significant events in American history.</p>

          <h2>Former Obama Administration Officials Face Allegations of Fabricating Intelligence for Trump-Russia Probe</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 16:19:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has declassified documents alleging that Obama-era officials manufactured intelligence to initiate the Trump-Russia collusion probe. The documents reportedly show that intelligence was politicized to create a narrative of Russian interference, contrary to other information available at the time. Gabbard has since sent a criminal referral to the Department of Justice, asserting the actions constituted a 'treasonous conspiracy' to subvert the 2016 election results. The former officials named in the documents, including James Clapper and John Brennan, have not publicly responded to the allegations presented in this article.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo has announced the upcoming launch of Pepsi Prebiotic Cola, a new beverage containing three grams of prebiotic fiber and sweetened with cane sugar. This move comes just months after the company acquired the popular functional soda brand Poppi for $1.95 billion, signaling a strategic pivot towards health-conscious consumers. As traditional soda consumption declines, PepsiCo is aiming to capture a share of the growing market for drinks that claim to offer gut-health benefits. The new product will be available online this fall and will expand to retail stores next year, representing a key effort to innovate amid shifting consumer preferences.</p>

          <p>Community bail funds, which gained significant popularity and funding after the 2020 protests, are now facing increased scrutiny and legislative restrictions from lawmakers, primarily Republicans. These non-profit groups use donations to pay bail for individuals who cannot afford it, aiming to reduce pre-trial detention. However, critics raise public safety concerns, while proponents argue the funds are a crucial lifeline and demonstrate that cash bail is not essential for ensuring court appearances. At least four states have enacted laws to regulate these funds, creating new hurdles for organizations that advocates say provide a vital community service and challenge the for-profit bail bond industry.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has successfully signed Cameroon international winger Bryan Mbeumo from Brentford in a deal reportedly worth an initial £65 million. The 25-year-old has agreed to a five-year contract, becoming the third major signing for manager Ruben Amorim this summer. Mbeumo, who described the move as joining his 'dream club,' was highly productive for Brentford, scoring 20 goals in the Premier League last season. The transfer marks Brentford's largest-ever sale and concludes a lengthy negotiation process, with United ultimately securing one of their primary targets for the upcoming season ahead of several rival clubs.</p>

          <p>Nearly 300 current and former NASA employees, including astronauts, have signed a formal letter titled 'The Voyager Declaration' to protest the Trump administration's sweeping budget cuts to the agency. The letter warns that the indiscriminate cuts to research grants, staffing, and international missions threaten scientific advancement, national security, and personnel safety. It specifically raises alarms about potential changes to NASA's Technical Authority, a safety system established after the 2003 Columbia disaster. The signatories argue that the cuts are politically motivated and undermine NASA's core mission, representing a dangerous departure from lessons learned from past tragedies.</p>

The piece also examines the 1929 Undesirable Aliens Act, which first criminalized unlawful entry and was sponsored by eugenicists to target Mexican immigrants.

          <p>President Donald Trump's second term has been characterized by a heavy reliance on tariffs as a primary tool of foreign policy, creating global economic uncertainty. This article explores how Trump uses tariffs not just for trade protection but also to pressure countries on non-trade issues like immigration and drug trafficking, a role traditionally reserved for sanctions. Unlike sanctions, tariffs can be imposed unilaterally and generate revenue, aligning with Trump's 'America First' agenda. However, this strategy has led to retaliatory measures and concerns among experts about the potential for destabilizing global trade and international relations. (not investment advice)</p>

Johnson argued that the administration should be given space to act before Congress intervenes, dismissing a bipartisan effort to force a vote as a 'political game.'

          <p>The ongoing trade war and tariff uncertainty under the Trump administration are reportedly taking a significant toll on smaller, secondary U.S. ports. Shippers are front-loading imports and rerouting cargo to larger hubs like the Port of Los Angeles to get ahead of tariff deadlines, causing a drop in container volumes at ports such as Oakland, Jacksonville, and New Orleans. This recalibration of supply chains is leading to economic strain and job concerns in the communities reliant on these smaller ports. While larger ports see a temporary bump, the overall trend points to logistical disruption and economic pain for a crucial part of the nation's trade infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has announced it will officially end its long-standing open seating policy, with flights featuring assigned seats set to begin on January 27, 2026. The carrier, which for decades allowed passengers to choose their own seats upon boarding, will begin booking these flights on July 29. This change is part of a broader strategic shift that includes new fare bundles, options for extra legroom seats, and a recently implemented fee for checked bags. The airline is also overhauling its boarding process, replacing the A-C letter groups with numerical groups based on seat location and loyalty status.</p>

          <p>California, along with a coalition of 19 other states and the District of Columbia, is suing the Trump administration over new rules that bar undocumented immigrants from accessing various federally funded 'public benefit' programs. The lawsuit argues that the restrictions, which affect programs like Head Start, homeless shelters, and food banks, are a 'cruel' and unlawful reversal of decades of precedent. State officials contend the new rules primarily harm working mothers and children and will impose significant financial and administrative burdens on states. The Trump administration has defended the policy as necessary to protect resources for American citizens and discourage illegal immigration.</p>

A Pentagon spokesperson stated that the withdrawal was directed due to 'stability returning to Los Angeles,' crediting the Marines' presence with restoring order. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, who had decried the military presence as inappropriate, called the withdrawal 'another win for Los Angeles,' emphasizing that troops should be performing the duties for which they enlisted.</p>

          <p>Paul de Gelder, an Australian Navy diver who lost a hand and a leg in a 2009 shark attack, is sharing safety advice for swimmers amid recent shark sightings. His top three tips for a shark encounter are to remain calm and avoid splashing, maintain eye contact with the animal, and, as a last resort, push firmly on its nose rather than punching it. De Gelder emphasizes that sharks are not malicious and that panicking can escalate a situation. He is demonstrating these survival techniques in a new Discovery Channel special, aiming to educate the public on how to react safely during a potential encounter.</p>

The B-52 was reportedly in the area to conduct a low-altitude flyover for the North Dakota State Fair, located near the airport. The commercial jet, with 76 passengers, landed safely after the harrowing near-miss, and the FAA, Air Force, and airline are all investigating the incident.</p>

The decision follows racist abuse targeted at defender Jess Carter on social media during the current Euro 2025 tournament. The team plans to stand together at kick-off instead, aiming to spark a new conversation and signal that current anti-racism efforts are insufficient.

For dependent undergraduates, the lifetime limit is $31,000, while independent undergraduates can borrow up to $57,500. Graduate students have a higher aggregate limit of $138,500, which includes any loans taken out for their undergraduate education. Since these federal limits may not cover the full cost of attendance, which averages over $38,000 per year, students often need to seek other funding sources, such as private student loans, to bridge the financial gap.
