          <p>Japan has lost its position as the world's largest creditor for the first time in 34 years, with Germany now holding the top spot, according to the Finance Ministry. Despite Japan's net external assets reaching a record high, due in part to a weaker yen, they were surpassed by Germany's larger current account surplus. Japan's gross external assets increased significantly, exceeding 500 trillion yen for the first time, driven by direct investment in the United States by domestic financial institutions and trading houses. The yen's depreciation also played a role, boosting the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets when converted into the local currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD experienced further declines after announcing price cuts on several models. The initial plunge followed a prior session's reversal from a record high, driven by investor concerns over potential competition and a price war in the EV sector. BYD reduced prices on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models until the end of June, with analysts from Citi expecting a surge in dealership footfall due to these reductions. Despite the price cuts, Citi analysts remain optimistic about sales growth for new energy vehicle companies with prices below 200,000 Chinese yuan, citing relatively mild competition.

          <p>Volvo Cars, owned by Chinese group Geely Holding, will cut approximately 3,000 office-based jobs in Sweden as part of a cost-cutting initiative. The layoffs represent about 15% of its white-collar workforce and are attributed to challenges facing the global motor industry, including tariffs, higher material costs, and slower sales. The company's chief executive cited the "challenging period" as the reason for the layoffs, with global sales having fallen by 11% in April compared to the previous year. This decision comes amid increased competition and price cuts from other automakers, including BYD.</p>

Weining Yu from the National Bureau of Statistics noted the industrial sectors' resilience but cautioned that demand and price constraints persist.

          <p>A bill advanced by House Republicans proposes cutting in half a tax write-off for professional sports team owners, potentially impacting the demand and value of teams. The legislation targets the deduction of "intangible assets," such as player contracts and media rights, limiting owners to deducting only half the value over 15 years. While this change would only affect future owners, it could deter potential buyers and slow the growth of team values. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates this measure would generate $991 million in revenue over 10 years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is pressuring retailers like Walmart to absorb the costs of tariffs on goods from China, rather than raise prices for consumers. This demand disregards basic economic principles, as retailers cannot sustain losses by selling goods below cost. While some companies, like Home Depot, may attempt to comply for political reasons, tariffs ultimately function as a tax on imported goods paid by the importer. The article suggests that companies should be transparent about these costs, rather than attempting to obscure them with euphemisms.</p>

          <p>King Charles III is visiting Canada in a move seen as a subtle rebuke to President Trump, who has threatened the country's sovereignty. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited Charles to open Canadaâ€™s Parliament, emphasizing Canadaâ€™s distinct heritage from the United States. This visit marks Charles's first to Canada since becoming king, and is interpreted as a symbolic show of support for Canada's independent identity. The speech King Charles delivers will be written by the Prime Minister's office and will likely emphasize Canada's sovereignty.</p>
