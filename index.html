          <p>The president of the University of Virginia, Jim Ryan, has resigned following pressure from the federal government regarding the school's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Reports indicated the Department of Justice threatened to withhold millions in federal funding unless the university curbed these initiatives. Ryan stated he could not risk the jobs and financial aid of staff and students by fighting the federal government. The resignation is seen by critics as a significant escalation in the political conflict over DEI in higher education and a concerning sign for public universities.</p>

          <p>Iran's Foreign Minister, Abbas Araghchi, has warned the U.S. that it must adopt a more respectful tone toward Iran's supreme leader to facilitate any potential deal. In a social media post, Araghchi stated that continued disrespect could lead Iran to reveal its "Real Capabilities," a clear threat following recent U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The statement comes amid high tensions after a 12-day conflict with Israel, with both sides claiming victory. Araghchi also denied that any new nuclear negotiations with the U.S. were underway, contradicting recent claims from Washington.</p>

          <p>All four giant pandas housed at the Adventure World amusement park in western Japan have left for China, as their loan agreement has expired. The departure of the 24-year-old female Rauhin and her three offspring leaves only two giant pandas remaining in Japan, both of whom are also scheduled to return to China next year. The Wakayama zoo had a successful joint breeding program with a Chinese research base since 1994, raising 17 cubs. Thousands of visitors attended a farewell ceremony, marking a potential end to an era of "panda diplomacy" in the region.</p>

          <p>For the first time in four years, the leaders of Japan and South Korea did not attend the annual NATO summit, sending lower-level representatives instead. This decision, along with Australia's, reflects a growing concern in the Indo-Pacific that conflicts in the Middle East are distracting the United States from the region. According to experts, these absences signal that leaders are prioritizing pressing issues closer to home. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba reportedly canceled his trip after it became clear a meeting with the U.S. president was unlikely, underscoring the shifting geopolitical focus.</p>

          <p>Canadian businesses are struggling with uncertainty as the trade war with the United States continues, marked by shifting tariffs on Canadian products. Business owners express that the lack of predictable rules makes it impossible to plan for the future, with some small companies facing punitive costs. Canada's economy, which sends 75% of its exports to the U.S., has slowed significantly due to the instability. The conflict escalated recently when the U.S. terminated trade talks over Canada's digital services tax, leaving businesses hoping for any deal that can provide a stable operating environment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a Supreme Court decision that limited nationwide injunctions, the practical implementation of the executive order to end birthright citizenship remains unclear. While the court did not rule on the order's constitutionality, it allows the administration to plan its enforcement in states not covered by narrowed court orders. Legal challenges to the policy's core validity will continue, and groups have already filed new class-action lawsuits to protect noncitizen pregnant women. The ruling immediately changes the legal landscape, leaving the future of a long-standing citizenship guarantee in question as litigation proceeds.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate voted against a resolution that would have restricted the president's ability to take further military action against Iran without congressional approval. The measure failed in a 47-53 vote, largely along party lines, despite a recent 12-day conflict that included U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Proponents argued for congressional oversight in decisions of war, while opponents contended the president acted within his authority.

          <p>A new study from Tulane University reveals that parts of New Orleans' concrete flood protection system are sinking at a rate of nearly two inches per year. This subsidence is faster than sea-level rise, reducing the capacity of the walls to block storm surges and increasing flood risk in some neighborhoods. The research, which used satellite radar data, identified sinking hotspots around industrial sites and new developments. The findings serve as a wake-up call for ongoing monitoring and maintenance of the city's critical infrastructure, which was heavily reinforced after Hurricane Katrina 20 years ago.</p>

The meeting was characterized by questions and hypotheses challenging the established safety and efficacy of vaccines, a stark departure from the committee's traditional evidence-based approach.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has significantly limited the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions that block government policies. In a 6-3 decision related to a challenge against an executive order on birthright citizenship, the majority opinion stated that such broad orders likely exceed the authority granted to federal courts. While the ruling narrows the scope of injunctions against the birthright citizenship policy, it did not decide on the constitutionality of the order itself.

He warned the cuts could also force rural hospitals to close and drive up insurance premiums for others.

The research assessed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables. The findings suggest certain foods in the diet, such as those containing folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, may contribute to improved mental well-being by assisting in the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is suing Fox News for at least $787 million, alleging the network defamed him by falsely claiming he lied about a phone call with the president. The lawsuit centers on comments made by anchor Jesse Watters, who accused Newsom of dishonesty regarding the timing and content of a conversation with the White House. Newsom's legal team claims Fox News willfully distorted the facts to curry favor with the president and has offered to drop the suit in exchange for a retraction and on-air apology. Fox News has dismissed the lawsuit as a frivolous publicity stunt.</p>

          <p>A science correspondent has highlighted the potential of phage therapy by successfully finding a bacteria-eating virus, or bacteriophage, in a sample from his own toilet. At a University of Southampton lab, the discovered phage was shown to effectively kill a persistent bacterial infection collected from a hospital patient. This century-old science is gaining renewed interest as a potential solution to the growing crisis of antibiotic resistance. While research is still in early stages for modern applications, the experiment demonstrates the promise of using these natural viruses to treat incurable superbug infections.</p>

          <p>The European Space Agency's new Biomass satellite is providing the first-ever views beneath the dense canopies of the world's rainforests. Using a specific radar frequency, the satellite can penetrate clouds and foliage to measure the woody material in tree trunks, where most carbon is stored. The initial images have already revealed previously hidden wetlands and concealed deforestation, offering unprecedented data for scientists. This pioneering technology will help create a global 3D map of forests, enabling more accurate estimates of their role in mitigating climate change and helping authorities monitor illegal logging.</p>

          <p>A new trade report from the Japanese government indicates that the effective U.S. tariff rate on all imports has risen to 25.9%, a level not seen since the Great Depression era. The report highlights that recent tariff measures, including those on Chinese goods, have reached a "historic scale." The Japanese trade ministry noted that the frequent and unpredictable changes in U.S. trade policy are creating significant uncertainty for the global economy. This data provides a stark measure of the current protectionist environment and its potential impact on international trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Molly Schafer, a quiet 18-year-old high school senior in Waunakee, Wisconsin, found a unique way to reconnect with her classmates after years of social anxiety. She spent approximately 600 hours painting detailed portraits of 44 students she had known since elementary school but had grown distant from. Schafer then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with amazement and some regret from her peers for not having paid more attention to her. Her project served as a powerful gesture of connection, bridging the social gaps that had formed over the years.</p>

          <p>A contemporary furniture store in Merriam, Kansas, is liquidating its inventory and closing after four years, with the owner citing the U.S. trade war as the primary cause. The owner, Henrik Svendsen, stated that tariffs have made his imported furniture, much of which comes from China, unaffordable for both his business and his customers. He has paid approximately $162,000 in tariffs and can no longer absorb the costs within his slim profit margins. The closure will result in the layoffs of his 10 employees, illustrating the direct impact of trade policy on small American businesses.</p>

          <p>A fourth federal judge has permanently blocked a presidential executive order aimed at punishing an elite law firm, declaring it unconstitutional. The ruling against the order targeting Susman Godfrey follows three similar decisions, with judges finding the actions violate the First and Fifth Amendments and represent an assault on the legal system. The series of executive orders has targeted prominent law firms for representing clients or causes opposed by the administration. While some firms have made deals to avoid being targeted, the consistent judicial rebukes represent a significant check on executive power.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has performed a major U-turn on its plan to cut disability benefits, following a significant backlash from within its own party. The planned changes to Personal Independence Payments (Pip) were intended to generate large savings quickly but were criticized as a cost-cutting exercise rather than a genuine reform. The reversal raises questions about the government's long-term strategy and its ability to manage complex policy changes. The compromise will spare most current claimants, but it leaves a multi-billion-pound hole in the budget that may require future tax rises or spending cuts.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a measure to more than double the state's annual tax incentives for film and television production, raising the total to $750 million. This move, supported by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to combat the exodus of productions to other locations offering more generous financial benefits. Industry unions and advocates have warned that California has been losing thousands of jobs and was at risk of a major decline. The expanded tax credit is seen as a crucial step to encourage studios to keep filming in Hollywood's home state and support its local economy.</p>
