          <p>The NHS app is set to become the primary communication method for millions of patients in England, with a Â£50 million investment aimed at modernizing healthcare interactions. This move will allow patients to receive test results, screening invitations, and appointment reminders directly on their smartphones, reducing reliance on traditional letters. The government anticipates saving Â£200 million over three years by digitizing these processes, freeing up NHS phone lines and resources for frontline services. While acknowledging concerns about access for elderly patients, the Department of Health and Social Care assures that those unable to use the app will receive text messages and letters as a last resort, ensuring comprehensive coverage. This digital upgrade seeks to streamline healthcare management for patients and improve efficiency within the NHS.</p>

          <p>Significant progress has been made in the fight against cancer, with the age-adjusted death rate in the US declining by about a third since 1991, and this has resulted in over 4 million fewer cancer deaths. Breakthroughs in treatments like stem-cell harvesting and CAR-T therapy have transformed cancer from a death sentence to a more manageable condition. The decline in smoking has contributed to this trend, but advancements in screening and treatment for non-lung cancers and childhood cancers have also played a crucial role. Immunotherapies, such as CAR-T therapy, are showing promising results, turning a patient's own T-cells into guided missiles to combat cancer, and people are living longer due to these advancements.</p>

          <p>Kristi Noem, formerly the governor of South Dakota, now serves as the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the Trump administration, spearheading the largest deportation campaign in American history. Noem has reversed several Biden-era policies, expanded deportation operations, and played a prominent role in legal clashes related to immigration. She has embraced a high-profile surrogate role, touring the southern border and engaging in international diplomacy, and her approach has drawn both praise and criticism for its theatrical style and potential legal implications. Critics argue that her leadership marks a departure from past secretaries, prioritizing political theater over competence and constitutional rights.</p>

          <p>The "Bitcoin Family," known for selling all possessions to invest in Bitcoin, has revamped its security after a series of kidnappings targeting cryptocurrency executives. The family now employs a hybrid analog-digital system, encrypting and splitting seed phrases across multiple continents. They have abandoned hardware wallets due to security concerns, opting for encrypted paper and steel backups, and the family is also avoiding travel to France after a series of disturbing messages from strangers. The family's new system involves splitting a single 24-word Bitcoin seed phrase into four sets of six words, each stored in a different geographic location, and this makes it so that even if someone finds 18 of the 24 words, they can't do anything.</p>

          <p>Slate Auto, an electric vehicle startup supported by Jeff Bezos, has emerged from stealth mode to produce affordable, modular EVs in a suburban Detroit facility. The company is focused on building a simplified, two-seat electric pickup truck that can be converted into different SUV body styles. Slate aims to keep costs down through simplified manufacturing, injected-molded composite exteriors, and optional features, targeting a starting price under $20,000. The company has garnered over 100,000 reservations and is preparing to build a full production facility in Warsaw, Indiana, and it is a long shot to see if the company succeeds given other bankruptcies in the EV startup space.</p>

          <p>Television's increasing preoccupation with wealth is reshaping our collective psyche, and this is building a shared sense of wealth as the only marker of a significant life. Many shows now depict rich people in aspirational settings, often glossing over the struggles and realities of average Americans, and this is making it harder for shows to have narrative stakes. This trend, which began in the early 2000s with shows like *The O.C.* and *Real Housewives*, has led to a lack of representation for the majority of the population and the complex lives of average people, and the obsession with wealth may be making TV boring.</p>

          <p>Ncuti Gatwa's brief tenure as the Doctor in *Doctor Who* represented a welcome departure from the show's previous direction, and he was the first Black, openly queer, and African-born actor to play the role. Gatwa's Doctor brought a bracing, unapologetic queerness to the series, and he was more emotionally available than previous incarnations. His casting allowed the series to explore the ramifications of the Doctor's ability to look like anyone, and this is something that had not been done before.</p>
