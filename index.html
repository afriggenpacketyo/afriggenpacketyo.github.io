          <p>President Trump convened his national security team to discuss potential responses to the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel, including the possibility of a military strike. The administration is also preparing for the evacuation of American citizens from Israel. Trump stated that he has not yet decided on a course of action, while Iran threatened "irreparable damage" if the U.S. intervenes militarily against its nuclear facilities. The International Atomic Energy Agency reported that two nuclear centrifuge production facilities in Iran were hit during recent attacks.</p>

          <p>AstroAI has issued a recall for approximately 249,100 mini-fridges due to a potential fire and burn hazard. The electrical switch in these compact refrigerators can short circuit, posing a significant risk. The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has received numerous reports of these mini-fridges emitting smoke, melting, or catching fire, with two fires causing over $360,000 in property damage. Consumers are advised to immediately cease using the recalled mini-fridges and contact AstroAI for a replacement, while disposing of the units according to local waste disposal procedures. The model number for the recalled minifridges is LY0204A, which is printed on a label on the back of the product.</p>

          <p>Social Security's trust funds are now projected to be depleted by 2034, a year earlier than previously forecast, potentially leading to a 19% reduction in benefits. The Social Security Fairness Act, which expanded benefits for millions of retirees, contributed to this accelerated timeline. Advocacy groups are urging Congress to take swift action to shore up the program, either by raising revenue or cutting benefits. Changes to Social Security this year include the Social Security Fairness Act, which went into effect on January 5, and Americans are also filing for Social Security benefits at a record rate this year.

          <p>Hurricane Erick has rapidly intensified into a Category 2 storm and is projected to become a major hurricane as it approaches southern Mexico.

          <p>During a preliminary hearing, federal authorities testified that Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder, Colorado Molotov cocktail attack, allegedly used Israeli flags to identify and target victims. Soliman is charged with multiple counts, including attempted first-degree murder and hate crimes. FBI special agent Timothy Chan testified that Soliman's targets were those he considered Zionists and that Soliman intended to kill Zionists. The case raises a legal question of how the term Zionism can be defined, questioning if it is a political movement or type of national origin.</p>

          <p>The British government is expanding the Warm Home Discount program, providing £150 off energy bills to millions more households. The changes remove property size and energy score qualifications, benefiting an additional 2.7 million homes, including nearly a million with children. Energy companies will fund the expansion, potentially leading to a slight increase in bills for all customers through the Standing Charge. While debt charities and energy groups have welcomed the move, some say the scheme still leaves out some of those most at risk, including those on non-means tested benefits.</p>

The jury also acquitted her of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene of the collision, but convicted her of operating under the influence of liquor. The judge immediately sentenced her to one-year probation, which is standard for a first-time offense.

          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to hold its benchmark interest rate steady, maintaining a "wait-and-see" approach as it evaluates the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies. While the central bank anticipates inflation to rise, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited solid labor market conditions and continued economic growth but acknowledged uncertainty due to the Trump administration's new tariffs, which are likely to drive up inflation and slow down growth. The central bank will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. (not investment advice)</p>

Such a strike could trigger retaliation from Iran, potentially escalating the conflict and drawing the U.S. more deeply into a regional war. The International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed that Iran is producing highly enriched uranium at Fordo, which means a powerful strike on the facility could release radioactive material into the area around it.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injection, for HIV prevention. Clinical trial data suggests that this drug provides near-complete protection against HIV infection. This new treatment offers a more convenient alternative to the current standard of care, which is a daily pill called Truvada. The cost of the drug, however, could be a barrier to access for many, and cuts to foreign aid could limit its reach in countries with the highest HIV burden.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder in the death of her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe. The jury also acquitted her of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene of the collision, but she was convicted of operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol. The case garnered national attention, and Read's defense argued that she was being framed for O'Keefe's death. Prosecutors and Ms Read's attorneys agreed to a one-year probation order for the intoxication charge.</p>

Black Americans account for 39% of new HIV diagnoses but only 14% of PrEP users, while Hispanic people represent 31% of new diagnoses but just 18% of PrEP users, according to AIDSVu.</p>

          <p>The possibility of U.S. involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict has exposed divisions among President Trump's supporters, pitting the isolationist and hawkish wings of his party against each other.

Critics of potential U.S. involvement point to Trump's promise to keep the U.S. out of "forever wars," while others argue that Iran cannot be allowed to acquire a nuclear weapon.</p>

          <p>As the conflict between Israel and Iran escalates, the U.S. is considering the use of "bunker buster" bombs, specifically the GBU-57 MOP, to target Iran's underground nuclear facilities. These bombs are designed to penetrate deep below the surface before exploding. Only the U.S. possesses the GBU-57 and the B-2 stealth bomber required to deploy it, meaning Israel cannot conduct such a strike without U.S. involvement. Experts say that while the GBU-57 could cause significant damage, it may not be enough to stop Iran's nuclear program entirely.</p>

The letter follows a review of the festival, which attracts about two million people, that identified "critical public safety concerns" that needed additional funding to address. Limited resourcing has restricted the police service's ability to respond to growing operational pressures. Increased investment in stewarding and crowd management was "now essential to allow the police to focus on their primary role of crime prevention and public protection".</p>
