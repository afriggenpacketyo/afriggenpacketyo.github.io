          <p>Former NFL quarterback Brett Favre has publicly supported Jon Gruden as a candidate for the head coaching job at the University of Arkansas. Favre praised Gruden's sharp football mind, passion, and energy as a perfect fit for the competitive SEC conference. Gruden, who has been out of coaching since an email scandal led to his departure from the Las Vegas Raiders, has recently expressed a strong desire to return to coaching, specifically mentioning he would "die to coach in the SEC." The endorsement comes after Arkansas fired its previous coach, Sam Pittman.</p>

          <p>This opinion article draws a parallel between the current regulatory scrutiny faced by TikTok and the historical challenges of Univision, the largest Spanish-language TV network in the U.S. The author argues that both platforms achieved significant cultural influence within specific demographics—TikTok with young Americans and Univision with the Hispanic community—before facing governmental pressure. Just as Univision's ownership was a point of contention, TikTok's Chinese parent company has made it a target for Washington, suggesting a pattern of how the U.S. government responds to foreign-owned media with pervasive cultural impact.</p>

          <p>While Hurricane Humberto is weakening over the Atlantic, the National Hurricane Center warns it will likely generate dangerous surf and life-threatening rip currents for several days. The hazardous conditions are expected to affect beaches along much of the U.S. East Coast, as well as Bermuda, the Bahamas, and the northern Caribbean. Currently a Category 2 storm, Humberto had previously reached Category 5 strength before beginning to lose intensity. It is one of two storm systems being monitored, with Hurricane Imelda also active in the region but moving away from the U.S.</p>

          <p>American colleges and universities are confronting a severe financial crisis, described as a "perfect storm" of negative factors. Institutions are grappling with falling domestic enrollment due to a shrinking college-age population, higher operating costs, and new restrictions on international student visas that threaten a crucial revenue stream. Experts warn that while elite universities with large endowments are largely insulated, many small and mid-tier tuition-dependent schools are extremely vulnerable. This financial pressure could lead to program cuts, campus closures, and reduced financial aid, ultimately limiting educational opportunities.</p>

          <p>The rapid expansion of AI data centers, driven by tech giants like OpenAI, Meta, and Alphabet, is facing a significant bottleneck due to a shortage of skilled labor. The U.S. construction, manufacturing, and electrical trades are experiencing a dearth of talent as older workers retire without sufficient replacements. This labor scarcity is already causing project delays and budget overruns for these complex, multi-billion dollar facilities.

This deportation is described as the first phase of a deal that could see up to 400 Iranians returned.

          <p>CNBC is now accepting nominations for its 2026 Changemakers list, which honors women who are transforming business and philanthropy. The article highlights the continued importance of recognizing female leaders, citing recent data showing a decline in female representation on S&P 500 boards and in leadership teams for the first time in years. As some firms roll back diversity initiatives, the piece argues it is more crucial than ever to feature women who are innovating and driving change. The list aims to showcase leaders from organizations with significant revenue or enterprise value.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has stated he is prepared to declare a state of emergency, citing the threat of U.S. military "aggression." The announcement follows recent deadly U.S. strikes on suspected Venezuelan drug boats in the Caribbean, part of a major American military deployment in the region. Maduro's government has placed the country on high alert, denouncing the U.S. naval presence as a criminal threat. Declaring a state of emergency would grant Maduro special powers and allow for the temporary suspension of citizens' basic rights.</p>

          <p>President Trump has renewed his call for a 100% tariff on movies made outside the United States, arguing that the filmmaking business has been "stolen" by other countries. The threat comes as Hollywood studios increasingly film overseas to take advantage of tax incentives and lower labor costs, a trend that has moved thousands of jobs away from California. It remains unclear how such a tariff on a service like film production would be implemented. Industry experts and politicians express concern that it could cause chaos and invite retaliation from other countries that are crucial for international box office revenue.</p>

The Indian High Commission condemned the act as a "shameful" and "violent attack on the idea of non-violence," demanding immediate action from UK authorities.

          <p>This interview with Forbes senior writer Emily Baker-White explores why TikTok has become such a powerful and influential platform. Its algorithm excels at predicting user preferences without explicit input, creating a frictionless and addictive experience that has shifted social media toward content from professional creators rather than personal acquaintances. The platform's Chinese ownership by ByteDance remains a major concern for lawmakers due to the potential for data misuse and ideological manipulation. The discussion also covers the latest developments in the deal to create a U.S.-based entity to manage the app.</p>

          <p>YouTube has agreed to a $24.5 million settlement in a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump after the platform suspended his account following the January 6, 2021, Capitol riots. The court filing states the settlement is not an admission of liability or fault by the company. This follows similar settlements Trump reached with Meta and X (formerly Twitter) earlier in the year after they also suspended his accounts. The move had been anticipated by some Democratic senators, who previously expressed concern that such a settlement could represent a quid-pro-quo arrangement.</p>
