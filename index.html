        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article posits that Indonesian President-elect Prabowo Subianto is positioned to introduce a new global diplomatic approach centered on "constructive pragmatism." As international institutions like the United Nations face paralysis from competing interests, Indonesia's status as an economic power with ties to various ideological camps allows it to act as a bridge. The author argues that Prabowo's leadership could provide a practical roadmap for a new world order that emphasizes cooperation over confrontation. This approach is presented as a necessary corrective for a dysfunctional international system, focusing on actionable solutions rather than revolutionary rhetoric.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed a largely symbolic executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights amid concerns of a potential deployment of federal agents. The order seeks to prevent Chicago police from cooperating with federal enforcement actions and demands that any federal agents operating in the city be clearly identifiable and not wear masks. While the city's legal authority to enforce these rules on federal personnel is unclear, the mayor stated the city would use all available tools, including the courts, to counter potential federal overreach. The move highlights escalating tensions between some city governments and the Trump administration over law enforcement jurisdiction.</p>

          <p>Verizon customers across the United States experienced a significant service outage, with many phones being limited to "SOS mode" for several hours. The company acknowledged a "software issue" was impacting wireless service and stated that its engineers were actively working to resolve the problem. Reports of the outage, tracked by DownDetector, peaked with nearly 23,000 complaints from coast to coast, beginning shortly after noon Eastern Time. In SOS mode, phones can still make emergency calls by connecting to other available networks, but regular call and data services are unavailable, causing widespread disruption for users.</p>

          <p>During a college football game between Syracuse and No. 23 Tennessee, a Syracuse defender's sudden injury drew sharp criticism from the game's announcers, who suggested it was a deliberate tactic to stop the clock. The incident occurred in the second quarter as Tennessee was rapidly advancing down the field, with defender Demetres Samuels Jr. falling to the turf after a big play. Commentators called the moment "suspicious" and "blatant," noting that officials are trying to crack down on faking injuries for strategic advantage. Despite the apparent tactic, Tennessee proceeded to score a touchdown on the drive and ultimately won the game 45-26.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of "Frankenstein" has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as his creation. Del Toro described the project as a decades-long dream, aiming for a grand scale and a different interpretation that humanizes the creature. The nearly two-and-a-half-hour film has received a mixed critical reception; some have praised it as one of del Toro's finest works for its epic scope and artistry, while others found it visually impressive but lacking in substance.

          <p>Ahead of the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, this article examines how remembering the shared history of Sino-American cooperation during World War II could serve as a foundation for improving current bilateral relations. The piece highlights a forgotten history of collaboration, including the efforts of Chinese villagers who risked their lives to protect American airmen from the Japanese army. By focusing on these historical moments of mutual support and shared sacrifice, the article suggests that a ground-up approach extolling this past alliance could offer a formula for rebuilding trust. This historical perspective is presented as a potential antidote to contemporary geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Latvian tennis player Jelena Ostapenko has issued an apology for comments made to her opponent, Taylor Townsend, following their second-round match at the US Open. After her loss, Ostapenko confronted Townsend at the net, accusing her of having "no education" and "no class," apparently upset over a perceived lack of an apology for a net cord winner. In a statement, Ostapenko explained that English is not her first language and she was referring to tennis etiquette, but acknowledged her words could have been offensive. The incident had drawn criticism, with Naomi Osaka calling the remarks particularly hurtful.</p>

          <p>A new investigation by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has concluded that famed McNairy County Sheriff Buford Pusser, who inspired the movie "Walking Tall," likely murdered his wife, Pauline, in 1967. For decades, it was believed she was killed in an ambush intended for him, but modern forensic analysis of the exhumed body and crime scene evidence revealed inconsistencies with Pusser's account. Investigators now believe the crime scene was staged and that a gunshot wound to Pusser's own cheek was likely self-inflicted. The district attorney stated that if Pusser, who died in 1974, were alive today, there would be enough evidence for a murder indictment.</p>

A group of employees who sued to block the agency's dismantling called the continued attacks "abhorrent" and vowed to continue their legal fight.

Produced with collaborators like Jack Antonoff, the album blends '70s AM-radio pop with disco and country influences.

          <p>Recent Premier League matches have reignited fierce debate over the use of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system, with several controversial calls dominating post-match discussions. Burnley manager Scott Parker criticized the technology for making football "sterile" after his team lost to a late, VAR-awarded penalty against Manchester United. In another game, Fulham manager Marco Silva was incensed after a goal was disallowed for a minor foul in the build-up. Critics, including former players, argue that the forensic re-refereeing of games is detracting from the sport's enjoyment and that the interpretation of rules by VAR officials is often inconsistent and bizarre.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's broad "reciprocal tariffs" imposed on most countries are illegal, stating he overstepped his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This decision, if upheld by the Supreme Court, would invalidate levies affecting a significant portion of U.S. imports, including those recently placed on China, Canada, and Mexico. However, the ruling does not affect sector-specific tariffs, such as those on steel and aluminum, which were imposed under a different law. The administration is expected to appeal the decision, creating significant uncertainty for its aggressive trade agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Experts Provide Guidelines on Safe Screen Time for Children at Different Developmental Stages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 15:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a lack of uniform international rules, a consensus among health experts offers precautionary guidelines for children's screen time based on developmental stages. For toddlers, the recommendation is to be screen-free until age three to encourage exploration of the physical world and development of self-controlled attention. As children grow, limited and supervised screen time is advised to ensure it doesn't replace crucial activities like physical play, social interaction, and imaginative development. While acknowledging the unrealistic nature of completely eliminating screens for adolescents, experts stress the importance of monitoring content, maintaining open communication, and setting clear family rules to foster healthy media habits.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson has raised concerns that President Trump's efforts to influence the Federal Reserve, such as his calls to fire Governor Lisa Cook, could threaten the central bank's independence. Patterson warns that politicizing the Fed could erode its legitimacy, potentially leading to negative long-term economic consequences like higher inflation, weaker stock market performance, and a depreciated currency. While markets might initially react positively to politically motivated interest rate cuts, she argues the sustained damage to institutional integrity would ultimately harm the U.S. economy and its global standing.

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders has publicly called for the resignation of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., accusing him of endangering public health through his anti-vaccine stance and promotion of conspiracy theories. In an op-ed, Sanders criticized Kennedy's long-standing crusade against vaccines, which he argues is now being implemented as dangerous policy, citing the recent firing and resignations of top CDC officials. Sanders warned that Kennedy's actions are dismantling the nation's public health infrastructure and creating a "war on science." The call for resignation adds to growing bipartisan pushback against the health secretary's leadership and controversial claims.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK are proceeding with legal action to block the housing of asylum seekers in local hotels, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling that overturned a similar injunction in Epping. The ruling was seen as a setback for councils arguing that using hotels for this purpose constitutes an unauthorized change of use and creates public safety risks. However, some councils, supported by figures like Kemi Badenoch and the Reform UK party, remain determined to pursue their cases. The situation has been accompanied by protests and counter-demonstrations across the country, highlighting the contentious nature of the government's asylum accommodation policy.</p>

This comes as a federal judge dealt a blow to his administration's immigration agenda by blocking the expanded use of "expedited removal." The judge ruled the process, which allows for rapid deportation of migrants found in the country's interior with little due process, is unlawful as currently applied. The ruling curtails the administration's ability to quickly remove immigrants whose cases are dismissed in court, affirming their right to due process.</p>
