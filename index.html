          <p>Following a deadly attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India has taken decisive action against Pakistan, including closing a border, downgrading diplomatic ties, and suspending the Indus Waters Treaty. The treaty, negotiated by the World Bank in 1960, governs water usage from six rivers flowing through both countries. India's foreign secretary stated the treaty's suspension will remain until Pakistan ceases its support for cross-border terrorism. Analysts suggest the attack highlights security and political failures in the region, where tensions between India and Pakistan over Kashmir have persisted since 1947. The little-known militant group Kashmir Resistance claimed responsibility for the attack, citing retaliation for demographic changes in the valley since 2019.</p>

          <p>Viewership of the 2024 Oscar-winning film “Conclave,” which explores the process of selecting a new pope, has significantly increased after the death of Pope Francis. Streaming minutes for the film jumped dramatically this week, with Luminate reporting a 3,200 percent increase in week-over-week viewership. The surge in viewership was influenced both by the Pope's death and Amazon Prime Video making the film available to subscribers at no extra cost. Netflix's 2019 film 'The Two Popes' also experienced a rise in viewership.</p>

          <p>A Federal Reserve report indicates that businesses are attempting to pass tariff-related cost increases onto consumers. Companies are reporting notices from suppliers about rising costs and are seeking ways to avoid absorbing the increases, though uncertainty remains about the ability to pass them on to customers. The report characterizes economic growth as "little changed," but notes pervasive uncertainty surrounding international trade policy.

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism for allegedly rewriting American history on government websites, including removing references to transgender people from the Stonewall National Monument page. Other changes include altering language about the Underground Railroad and Jackie Robinson's Army service. Historians like Yale professor David W. Blight are raising concerns about these revisions, viewing them as an attempt to erase or distort the past to fit a particular narrative. Blight argues that this is not the first time America has attempted to rewrite its own history.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion to delay auto tariffs to allow automakers to increase U.S. production faces challenges. An additional 25% auto parts tariff is scheduled to take effect, raising vehicle costs even if assembled domestically. Relocating production lines is a complex process that can take years and be costly. Experts suggest that the fastest way to increase U.S. production is to utilize existing facilities, as Nissan is planning to do, rather than constructing new assembly plants.</p>
