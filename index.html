          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado, the city of Denver, and several local leaders, challenging their "sanctuary" policies that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The lawsuit alleges that these policies obstruct the federal government's efforts to enforce immigration law, citing concerns over the presence of criminal elements, such as the Tren de Aragua gang, in the state. Local officials have defended their policies, asserting that they comply with all applicable laws and prioritize community safety. The lawsuit seeks to invalidate these state and city laws, arguing that they violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Optimism score: 40</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods entering the United States is poised to significantly impact advertising revenue for major tech platforms like Meta and Alphabet. The growth of low-cost online retailers such as Temu and Shein, which relied heavily on aggressive digital advertising to attract American shoppers, was spurred by this loophole. With President Trump's decision to eliminate the exemption, these retailers now face tariffs as high as 145 percent, leading to a reduction in their advertising spending. This shift is already being felt by Meta and Snap, which have reported a decrease in advertising revenue from Asian e-commerce companies. Optimism score: 55</p>

          <p>Ghana's ambitious project to build a national cathedral, envisioned as a symbol of unity and gratitude, has become mired in controversy and economic hardship. The project, championed by former President Nana Akufo-Addo, has stalled due to financial constraints and accusations of corruption, with approximately $58 million of public funds already spent on the unfinished structure. Critics argue that the cathedral is an unnecessary expense for a country facing economic challenges, while supporters defend it as a potential tourist attraction and a testament to Ghana's faith. The new government has halted funding for the project and launched an anticorruption initiative, leaving the future of the cathedral uncertain. Optimism score: 30</p>

The tariffs, intended to incentivize domestic production, could disrupt the auto industry, which relies heavily on foreign-made components. While some exemptions have been made for parts from Canada and Mexico, automakers and suppliers are concerned about the long-term impact of the tariffs on their businesses.
