          <p>Republicans in Congress are divided over repealing Biden-era clean energy tax credits, which are vital for some of their constituents. In Noatak, Alaska, residents rely on diesel for heating, facing high electricity bills. Clean energy projects, supported by the tax credits, aim to provide local electricity and reduce costs. However, efforts to defund the law have created uncertainty and stalled projects, leaving Alaskans unsure of their energy future.

          <p>Donald Trump's proposed 100% tariff on movies made outside the US is viewed as a sign of xenophobia and ignorance, according to The Guardian.

It criticizes the idea that US productions shooting overseas are a threat to national security. The piece also suggests that Trump's policy promotes a narrow view of the world, dismissing other countries as objects of cultural fascination.</p>
