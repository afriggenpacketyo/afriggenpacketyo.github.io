          <p>Joby Aviation is partnering with defense firm L3Harris to develop a military aircraft capable of both piloted and autonomous flight. The new hybrid vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) vehicle will be based on Joby's commercial S4 air taxi but will utilize a gas turbine. This collaboration aims to create a smaller, more adaptable, and cost-effective craft for low-altitude military operations, reflecting a strategic shift influenced by modern conflicts. Testing is scheduled to begin this fall, with operational demonstrations anticipated by 2026 as the companies move quickly toward deployability.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed signs of weakness as only 73,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added in July, falling short of the 100,000 estimate. Compounding the concern, job numbers for May and June were revised downward by a combined 258,000, indicating a much cooler employment situation than previously reported. The unemployment rate also increased slightly to 4.2%, aligning with forecasts but raising potential trouble signs for the economy.

          <p>The White House has unexpectedly imposed a 39% tariff rate on Switzerland, a move that has stunned the nation's business and political leaders. This rate is significantly higher than the 10% to 15% that was anticipated and among the highest levied on any country, threatening to impact the one-sixth of Swiss exports destined for the U.S. While the pharmaceutical sector may be exempt, manufacturing associations warn of dire consequences, with one director calling the decision arbitrary and a risk to tens of thousands of jobs. A new deadline of August 7 provides a small window for further negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

This was his latest act of defiance against a special counsel probe into allegations of influence-peddling involving his wife. Investigators, who had a warrant to forcibly retrieve him, refrained from using physical force due to safety concerns but warned they would execute it next time. Yoon's lawyers claim he is unable to participate due to serious health issues, while critics view his actions as an attempt to obstruct justice.</p>

The Swedish international is reportedly valued by Newcastle at around £150 million, with Liverpool's bid, said to be £110 million plus add-ons, falling short of this figure. Isak has expressed a desire to explore a move and was left out of Newcastle's pre-season tour, currently training alone. Despite Newcastle's public stance that he is not for sale, Liverpool manager Arne Slot is keen to add the striker to his squad ahead of the new season.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the "Happy Gilmore" film series, including the new sequel, transcends simple comedy to deliver a conservative message about the primacy of family. In the original film, Happy's motivation for playing golf was to save his grandmother's house. In the sequel, a retired and struggling Happy returns to the sport to fund his daughter's dream of attending a prestigious ballet school in Paris. The author argues that both narratives champion altruism and familial obligation over self-interest, portraying a life of purpose as one lived in service to older and younger generations.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 08:08:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the phenomenon of "anticipatory silence" among international aid organizations whose funding has been dramatically cut by the Trump administration. Many groups, reliant on U.S. government contracts, choose not to publicly criticize the cuts for fear of further retaliation or to avoid jeopardizing behind-the-scenes negotiations. This strategy has sparked intense internal debate, with some advocating for vocal resistance while others believe quiet diplomacy is more effective. The silence allows the administration to control the narrative, but speaking out carries the risk of being targeted in what some describe as an "atmosphere of fear."</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman have publicly explained their recent dissenting votes against holding interest rates steady. Both argued for a quarter-point rate cut, stating that delaying policy easing threatens the U.S. labor market and overall economic growth. They believe the inflationary impact of tariffs is temporary and that the Fed's cautious "wait and see" approach is overly risky.

In Arizona, the Dragon Bravo Fire on the Grand Canyon's North Rim has become a "megafire," charring over 164 square miles. A large fire in Monroe, Utah, has also produced a treacherous pyrocumulonimbus cloud, a fire-fueled thunderstorm that generates erratic and powerful downdrafts.

          <p>Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has stated that the top flight of English football will not be reduced from 20 to 18 clubs. This declaration comes amid growing tensions with FIFA over an increasingly congested international and club calendar, which includes an expanded Club World Cup and World Cup. Masters criticized FIFA for a lack of proper dialogue with stakeholders, arguing that domestic competitions are being forced to redesign their schedules to accommodate global expansion. He emphasized that while he supports the growth of the game, it should not come at the expense of domestic football.</p>

          <p>A new poll reveals that a majority of Americans blame the Trump administration for the rising cost of living and their personal financial struggles. Six in ten respondents said the administration drove up their living costs, with 63% citing a negative impact on grocery prices. The poll, conducted for the Century Foundation, also found widespread financial anxiety, with 83% concerned about grocery costs and nearly half believing they would struggle to afford an unexpected $500 bill. The findings also show that majorities blame corporations and billionaires for making life more difficult for average people. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Low-wage workers and anti-poverty advocates are bracing for the impact of significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) under the Trump administration. Changes in the federal budget are set to shift more administrative costs to states and impose stricter work requirements, which could cause millions of families to lose benefits. With food prices having risen over 23% since 2020, many low-income families are already struggling to afford groceries. Experts warn that these unprecedented cuts will dismantle a key safety net, leading to a rise in poverty and hunger across the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new peer-reviewed study suggests that a mass die-off of monarch butterflies in Southern California in January 2024 was likely caused by pesticide exposure. Researchers tested deceased butterflies found near an overwintering site and discovered an average of seven different pesticides in each, with some at levels known to be lethal. The findings provide rare, direct evidence of pesticide impact on wild monarch populations, which have seen dramatic declines in recent decades. The study points to pyrethroids, commonly used in residential applications, as a likely source, underscoring the threat that chemical runoff poses to these insects.</p>

          <p>China has introduced a new anti-money-laundering regulation targeting the trade of precious metals and gems to close a significant loophole. Under the new rule, dealers must report any cash transactions totaling 100,000 yuan (about $13,870) or more within a single day to the nation's financial crime watchdog. The regulation also mandates reporting any transaction, regardless of amount, if there are reasonable grounds to suspect money laundering. This marks the first time China's anti-money-laundering supervision has expanded beyond traditional financial institutions to a specific non-financial sector, aiming to curb illicit financial flows.</p>

According to a new report, nearly two-thirds of investment-focused family offices now use these plans, moving away from informal "handshake agreements." This trend is boosting executive pay, with median total compensation for CEOs at larger firms exceeding $1.2 million. Popular incentives include co-investment opportunities, carried interest, and phantom equity, which align executive pay more closely with investment performance and long-term success.</p>

          <p>While President Trump's approval rating among Gen Z voters has dropped significantly since the start of his term, this cohort is not necessarily swinging back to the Democratic party. Polling data suggests that while young voters may be experiencing "buyers' remorse," they remain more evenly split between the two parties than in previous years. This trend points to a broader disillusionment and pessimism about politics among the youngest electorate. Analysts suggest that Gen Z's lack of strong partisan affiliation makes them a volatile and unpredictable voting bloc, posing a challenge for both Republicans and Democrats.</p>

          <p>The escalating trade war, marked by the U.S. increasing tariffs on Canadian imports to 35%, is directly impacting Canadian consumers with higher prices on everyday goods.

The automotive sector is also heavily affected, with new and used car prices rising due to tariffs on vehicles and metals. Experts note that these price increases are already evident and will likely continue to rise, affecting household budgets across Canada. (not investment advice)</p>
