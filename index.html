This legal setback for the administration came as President Trump announced a separate diplomatic initiative: a peace summit at the White House with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan. The president stated that the summit aims to finalize a historic peace agreement between the two nations, which have been in conflict for many years, and will also involve new bilateral economic deals with the United States.</p>

          <p>The Southern Small White butterfly, a species traditionally found in Southern Europe, has been officially sighted in the United Kingdom for the first time. The discovery was made by a volunteer at the Landguard Nature Reserve in Suffolk, confirming the species' rapid northward expansion across Europe over the past two decades. While a warming climate is considered a contributing factor to this migration, experts note the butterfly's movement has been faster than predicted. The species' long-term establishment in the UK remains uncertain due to the limited availability of its primary food source.</p>

The incident began when the suspect, 61-year-old Carmine Faino, shot and killed his 57-year-old neighbor, Lori Wasko. When troopers arrived, Faino opened fire with a rifle, wounding both officers before they were evacuated by colleagues. The suspect was later killed by a police Special Emergency Response Team after a standoff, during which he also shot down a police drone.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 20:51:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed the Department of Commerce to develop a new census methodology that would exclude undocumented immigrants from the population count used for congressional apportionment. This move revives a similar effort from his first term, which was blocked by the Supreme Court, although the court left the door open for future attempts. The Constitution mandates a decennial "actual enumeration" of all persons, and changing this long-standing practice would have significant repercussions on the distribution of congressional seats and federal funding among states. The process of redesigning the census is complex and typically takes years of planning.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly called for the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, claiming he is "highly conflicted" in a move that caused the company's stock to drop. The demand follows a letter from Senator Tom Cotton that raised concerns about Tan's alleged investments and business ties to Chinese companies, some of which are reportedly linked to the Chinese military. The senator's letter specifically referenced Tan's tenure as CEO of Cadence Design Systems, which recently pleaded guilty to illegally exporting technology to a Chinese military university. Intel stated its board is committed to US national security interests.</p>

          <p>Records from Las Vegas police reveal that Shane Tamura, the man who killed four people in New York City, had a history of mental illness and two emergency psychiatric evaluations. Despite his mother reporting him as suicidal and diagnosed with bipolar disorder, these incidents did not legally prevent him from purchasing firearms, including the AR-15-style rifle used in the attack. According to experts, Nevada law does not automatically report temporary mental health holds to the national background check system. This case highlights a gap in gun control legislation, as so-called "red flag" laws that could have blocked the purchase were not utilized.</p>

The consumption rate is even higher among young people aged 1 to 18, who derive nearly 62% of their calories from these sources.

Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the new bounty, accusing Maduro of being a major narco-trafficker who works with cartels to import fentanyl-laced cocaine into the U.S. Maduro was first indicted on narco-terrorism charges in 2020 during Trump's first term. The move represents a significant escalation in pressure against the Venezuelan leader, whom the U.S. does not recognize as the country's legitimate president.</p>

          <p>A rapidly spreading wildfire, dubbed the Canyon fire, has triggered evacuation orders and warnings near the border of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. The fire, which started Thursday afternoon near Piru, quickly grew to over 1,000 acres, threatening communities around the Lake Piru Recreation Area and Castaic. Authorities have issued mandatory evacuation orders for the Lake Piru area and parts of Hasley and Romero Canyons. An evacuation shelter has been established at the College of the Canyons, with additional facilities available for both large and small animals.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to lift a lower court's ban on the use of "roving patrols" by immigration enforcement agents in Southern California. A federal judge had previously restricted the tactic, finding it likely violated the 4th Amendment by apprehending people based on factors like race and location without reasonable suspicion. In its appeal, the administration argues that the injunction severely hampers its ability to enforce immigration laws in the nation's most populous judicial district. Civil rights groups contend that lifting the ban would effectively authorize indiscriminate, unconstitutional arrests of Latinos.</p>

          <p>Travel companies in the United Kingdom are observing a new trend where Britons are booking shorter holidays, closer to home, and with less advance notice. Firms like Booking.com and Pitchup.com report a significant increase in last-minute searches and bookings for UK-based trips, a shift attributed to both cost-saving measures and a desire to take advantage of favorable weather. Holiday parks and cottage rental agencies have noted that the gap between booking and travel has shortened, with many travelers embracing more spontaneous getaways. This trend reflects a revival in domestic tourism and camping as affordable alternatives to international travel.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced plans to construct a large migrant detention facility at the Fort Bliss military base in Texas, which could eventually hold up to 5,000 people. The facility, consisting of short-term tent-like structures, is set to become the largest of its kind in the United States. This development is part of President Trump's broader strategy to increase the detention and rapid deportation of undocumented migrants. The use of military bases for housing detainees marks a significant expansion of the administration's immigration enforcement infrastructure, as the number of migrants in ICE custody reaches record levels.</p>

The clinic specifically targets fishermen, a community that often struggles to access traditional healthcare services due to their demanding work schedules. By bringing GPs, nurses, and physiotherapists directly to the docks, the initiative focuses on preventative care and early diagnosis, aligning with the NHS's long-term plan to shift focus from hospitals to community-based services. The model has successfully identified and treated conditions that might have otherwise become more serious.</p>

          <p>According to a research note from investment group CLSA, China's leading semiconductor manufacturers, like SMIC and Hua Hong Semiconductor, are not expected to be significantly impacted by President Trump's proposed 100% tariff on imported chips. The analysis suggests the direct impact will be small, partly because Chinese firms have been diversifying their exports to other regions, such as Southeast Asia. The tariffs are designed to exempt companies that manufacture or have pledged to invest in the U.S., a list that includes major global players but not the top Chinese foundries.

However, some market observers argue that the sell-off has unfairly dragged down other cybersecurity companies like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks, which have different business models.

The Texas effort, encouraged by President Trump, aims to add five GOP seats, while California's potential response could eliminate up to five of the state's nine Republican-held seats. This standoff puts several California Republican representatives in jeopardy, as a new map could drastically alter their districts' voter demographics. Governor Gavin Newsom has stated California's plan would only be triggered if Texas moves forward with its own redistricting.</p>
