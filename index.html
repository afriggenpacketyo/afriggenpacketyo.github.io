          <p>A 113-year-old wooden church in Kiruna, Sweden, is being moved 5 kilometers to a new location to protect it from ground subsidence caused by over a century of iron ore mining. The entire 672-tonne structure is being transported on rolling platforms in a complex, two-day journey. This move is a key part of the broader relocation of the city, funded by the mining company LKAB. For residents, it's an emotional event, preserving a building that has served as a spiritual and community hub for generations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly discussing a proposal to take a significant equity stake, potentially around 10%, in semiconductor manufacturer Intel. The plan involves converting grants from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act into company shares, which could make the U.S. government a top shareholder. This move is part of a broader national effort to revitalize the American chip industry and bolster national security, as Intel has struggled to keep pace with global competitors. The discussions are ongoing, and it remains uncertain if the plan will be finalized. (not investment advice)</p>

The deal will see actor and investor Ashton Kutcher join the company's board. Soho House, known as a popular venue for celebrities, has faced financial struggles and a decline in share value since its 2021 stock market listing amid concerns it was losing its exclusive appeal. The acquisition aims to put the company on more stable financial footing away from the pressures of public markets.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled images of a new crewed tilt-rotor aircraft prototype, marking a significant step in its military aviation development. The aircraft combines the vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities of a helicopter with the higher speed and range of a fixed-wing airplane, similar to the US V-22 Osprey. While this technology offers enhanced versatility for military operations, it is also known for its mechanical complexity, high costs, and historical safety concerns. The development indicates China's ambition to advance its military transport and assault capabilities with sophisticated modern hardware.</p>

The article highlights the collapse of infrastructure, the scarcity of cash, and the daily fight for basic sustenance, describing the situation as a deliberate policy of deprivation. Despite these extreme hardships, continuing to teach and research is presented as an act of resistance against erasure and a refusal to be silenced.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's government has summoned the senior diplomats from the United Kingdom and Australia to protest their decisions to grant asylum to two pro-democracy activists. Former lawmaker Ted Hui received asylum in Australia, while student leader Tony Chung was granted refugee status in the UK. Hong Kong's Chief Secretary accused the countries of "harbouring offenders" and insisted that arrests in the city are based on evidence, not political stance. The move highlights the ongoing diplomatic tensions surrounding the city's national security law, which critics argue is used to suppress dissent.</p>

          <p>The US Open has introduced a revamped mixed doubles event, attracting top singles players like Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek with large cash prizes and a shorter format. The move by the United States Tennis Association (USTA) is intended to generate more fan interest and elevate the event's profile. However, the new format has drawn criticism from some, including doubles specialists like Jamie Murray, who argue it devalues the Grand Slam title and becomes more of a "glorified exhibition." The debate centers on whether the change is a positive promotion for tennis or a move that sidelines dedicated doubles players.</p>

          <p>Researchers have utilized artificial intelligence to create facial reconstructions of Welsh convicts who were transported to Australia in the 19th century. A team of volunteers traced the lives of 60 individuals from Anglesey, who were deported for crimes ranging from theft to minor offenses like trampling turnips. The AI generated the faces using detailed prisoner records, historical sketches, and in some cases, photos of modern-day descendants. The project sheds new light on the individuals behind the statistics of the estimated 162,000 convicts sent to Australia, a history that is now often seen as a "badge of honour" by their descendants.</p>

A 1996 law allows UK courts to prosecute such crimes, but the compensation scheme was never updated to include them.

Key moments, such as Trump's sudden reversal on the need for a pre-negotiation ceasefire, appear to align with Moscow's preferred strategy of settling terms while fighting continues. The article notes that Trump interrupted his meeting with European leaders to take a phone call with Putin, further indicating the Kremlin's sway. This dynamic suggests that any forthcoming peace proposal may be heavily shaped by Russian interests, with the White House facilitating a plan largely authored by Moscow.</p>

Offensive lineman DJ Wingfield and wide receiver Kaedin Robinson had sued the NCAA, arguing its "Five-Year Rule" violated antitrust laws by unfairly limiting their eligibility and NIL earning potential. However, the judge ruled that the eligibility rule was not "commercial in nature" and therefore not subject to antitrust scrutiny.

          <h2>Analysis of White House Summit Shows Zelenskyy Navigated Tense Dynamics to Secure Time</h2>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent meeting with President Trump at the White House appeared far less confrontational than their previous encounter, with Zelenskyy successfully navigating the delicate diplomacy. While major differences remain, particularly on the necessity of a ceasefire before peace talks, the discussions focused on potential U.S. security guarantees and the prospect of a direct meeting with Vladimir Putin. Zelenskyy presented a map to Trump to counter claims of Russian territorial gains, which reportedly improved the mood of the talks. The primary outcome seems to be that Ukraine has bought more time without any catastrophic diplomatic breakdowns.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has handed a partial victory to the Trump administration and Florida in a lawsuit concerning the "Alligator Alcatraz" temporary immigrant detention center. The judge dismissed a claim that the government violated detainees' rights by not clarifying which court had jurisdiction, ruling the issue is now moot since a court has been designated. However, claims that the facility is violating the First Amendment by impeding confidential access to lawyers are still active. The judge transferred the case to a different federal district, leaving the core issue of attorney access unresolved for now.</p>

          <p>Seattle's Police Chief, Shon Barnes, was reportedly having lunch just yards away from a jewelry store as it was being robbed in a brazen daylight heist. Four masked individuals smashed their way into Menashe & Sons Jewelers, threatening staff with bear spray and stealing an estimated $2 million worth of merchandise in under two minutes. A police source confirmed the chief and his plainclothes security detail were at a nearby business and were unaware of the crime until responding units arrived with lights and sirens. No arrests have been made in connection with the rapid and high-value robbery.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to ban mail-in voting before the 2026 midterm elections, stating that an executive order is currently being drafted. During a meeting, he reiterated his unsubstantiated claims that the practice is "corrupt" and susceptible to widespread fraud. However, the U.S. Constitution grants states, not the president, the authority to regulate elections, a power that can only be altered by Congress. Legal experts and election officials have noted that an executive order to this effect would almost certainly be unconstitutional and that mail-in voting has been a secure practice for decades.</p>

          <p>Recently released investigation documents show that Bryan Kohberger, convicted of murdering four University of Idaho students, exhibited alarming behavior while he was a doctoral student at Washington State University. Fellow students and faculty described him as "creepy" and "sexist," with one professor warning colleagues that he showed predatory tendencies. The documents detail multiple complaints about his unsettling interactions with female students, including physically blocking doorways and stalking. This new information provides a disturbing context to his actions in the months leading up to the November 2022 killings.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin has strengthened into a powerful Category 4 storm in the Atlantic, and it is expected to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast this week. While the storm is not forecast to make direct landfall in the U.S., its outer bands are already bringing heavy rain to the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Authorities in North Carolina's Outer Banks have issued mandatory evacuation orders for some areas, fearing coastal flooding and high winds. The storm is forecast to remain a large and dangerous hurricane as it moves between Bermuda and the U.S. coast.</p>

          <p>Japanese investment firm SoftBank is set to purchase a $2 billion stake in Intel, a move that caused the U.S. chipmaker's shares to rise over 5% in after-hours trading. This major investment is seen as a vote of confidence in Intel's efforts to revitalize its manufacturing capabilities and regain its competitive edge. The announcement comes amid reports that the Trump administration is also considering taking an equity stake in the company to support its domestic production goals. The dual investment interests from private and public sectors highlight the strategic importance of strengthening the U.S. semiconductor industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report from S&P indicates that China's exports to the Global South have doubled since 2015, with a significant acceleration following the U.S.-China trade war. In the last five years alone, these exports have grown by 65%, far outpacing the growth of exports to the U.S. and Western Europe. Chinese firms are increasingly redirecting trade and investment toward developing nations in response to U.S. tariffs and a domestic economic slowdown. This trend suggests a potential reordering of global commerce, with "South-South" trade becoming a new center of gravity. (not investment advice)</p>

His appointment continues the Trump administration's trend of selecting deputy leaders from outside the FBI's career ranks.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India, the world's second-largest supplier of maritime crews, has the highest number of sailors abandoned by shipowners, according to the International Transport Workers' Federation. In 2024, nearly 900 of the 3,133 abandoned seafarers globally were Indian nationals. The crisis occurs when owners sever ties, leaving crews stranded on vessels without pay, provisions, or a way home. A primary cause is the use of "flags of convenience," where ships are registered in countries with lax regulations, obscuring true ownership and allowing unscrupulous operators to evade responsibility.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Warns Against Hong Kong's Growing Reliance on Mainland China for Healthcare</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article raises concerns about the increasing trend of Hong Kong residents seeking medical treatment in mainland China, particularly in Shenzhen. While mainland facilities may offer quicker appointments and clearer pricing, the author argues this shift constitutes an unofficial outsourcing of healthcare that could hollow out Hong Kong's own system. A long-term reliance on the mainland could undermine local capacity for medical innovation, talent development, and clinical trials. The piece calls for strengthening Hong Kong's public healthcare system to prevent a dependency that could erode its well-established medical infrastructure.</p>
