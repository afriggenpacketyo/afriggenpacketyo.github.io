          <p>US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth addressed the Shangri-la Dialogue in Singapore, asserting that China poses an "imminent" threat to Taiwan and advocating for increased defense spending among Asian nations. Hegseth emphasized that the US does not seek to control China but will defend its allies against intimidation. China responded by accusing the US of being the primary disruptor of regional peace, citing US military activities in the South China Sea. Hegseth also encouraged Asian countries to avoid economic dependence on China to prevent Beijing from using it as leverage. The US aims to foster a strong deterrent alongside allies to prevent conflict, and urges Asian nations to upgrade their defenses and become partners rather than dependents on the US. Optimism surrounding the stability of the region is tempered by the potential for conflict.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to invest Â£1.5 billion in at least six new munitions and explosives factories to enhance its defense capabilities and deter adversaries. This initiative, part of the upcoming strategic defense review, aims to create approximately 1,800 new jobs and support the production of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons. Defence Secretary John Healey emphasized the need to strengthen the UK's industrial base in light of the war in Ukraine, which has highlighted deficiencies in Western weapons production. The government aims for an "always on" munitions production capacity that can be rapidly scaled up, increasing the UK's munitions spending to Â£6 billion during this parliament.</p>

Harvard is fighting back in court, challenging the administration's attempts to restrict foreign students and terminate federal grants.

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) cautions that the government faces "unavoidable" tough choices as it finalizes spending plans for various sectors, including healthcare, defense, and education. The level of NHS spending will significantly impact funding for other unprotected areas, with potential cuts needed to meet government commitments. Despite increased funding in 2024, spending is projected to slow down, requiring difficult decisions on resource allocation. Chancellor Rachel Reeves' stance on avoiding additional borrowing and tax increases intensifies speculation about impending spending cuts, particularly affecting areas outside of healthcare and defense.</p>

This measure prohibits shops and supermarkets from stocking disposable vapes, while still allowing the sale of rechargeable and refillable devices. Disposable vapes have been identified as a significant factor in the rise of youth vaping, and millions of these devices are discarded annually.

          <p>A Singapore-based scientist, Alexander Miller, has warned that China's quantum satellite, Micius, could be susceptible to hacking due to slight delays between its onboard lasers. These delays could provide eavesdroppers with opportunities to exploit the system, compromising the security of quantum key distribution (QKD). Miller's analysis of communication data between a ground station and Micius suggests that the distribution of quantum keys from the satellite is insecure. The revelation raises concerns about the integrity of China's quantum communication network and the effectiveness of QKD devices in real-world applications.</p>
