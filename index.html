          <h2>Lesotho Faces Economic Hardship Due to High US Tariffs</h2>

          <p>President Trump imposed a 50% tariff on Lesotho's imports, significantly impacting its $2 billion GDP heavily reliant on textile exports to the US.  Lesotho's government is seeking to diversify its trade relationships to mitigate the economic fallout from these unexpected tariffs. The White House's justification for these tariffs has been questioned by economists and foreign governments, raising concerns about fairness and accuracy in trade imbalance calculations.</p>
