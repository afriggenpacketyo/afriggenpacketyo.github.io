        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Jack Reed has expressed his dismay at President Trump's rejection of his own intelligence chief's assessment that Iran is not currently developing nuclear weapons. Reed suggests Trump's stance may be politically motivated, particularly as the president contemplates potential military action against Iran. He emphasizes that if the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, made a false statement during her testimony, there would be an obligation to correct the record immediately. Reed's comments highlight the growing tension between the Trump administration and the intelligence community regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities. The senator's remarks underscore the seriousness of the situation as the US considers its next steps. Optimism score cannot be put into the summary of the article.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from implementing significant cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation. The ruling prevents a policy change that could have deprived universities of millions of dollars in research funding, which the universities argued would threaten critical work in areas like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Judge Talwani deemed the change, which capped indirect costs at 15%, as arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. This decision follows similar blocks against the Trump administration's attempts to cap grants from the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health, protecting vital research projects. The judge's decision protects critical research funding.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance visited Los Angeles to meet with law enforcement and stated that the Trump administration believes the National Guard's presence is still necessary due to ongoing protests over ICE raids. Vance accused California Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass of inciting violence during the protests. He also mistakenly referred to Senator Alex Padilla as "José Padilla," drawing criticism from Bass and Newsom. The administration has been prioritizing deportations in Democratic-run cities, leading to increased tensions and legal challenges from California. Vance's visit underscores the ongoing conflict between the federal government and local authorities over immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist, has been released from ICE detention after a federal judge ruled he was not a threat or flight risk. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained for over 100 days as the Trump administration sought his deportation due to his pro-Palestinian activism, which they deemed detrimental to foreign policy interests. Upon his arrival in New Jersey, Khalil stated that his activism would continue despite the attempts to suppress it. The judge's decision allows Khalil to remain free while his deportation proceedings continue, marking a victory for free speech advocates. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez greeted Khalil at the airport, calling his detainment a violation of his First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>The suspect in the Minnesota lawmaker shootings, Vance Boelter, was identified by the FBI as a doomsday "prepper." Boelter is accused of fatally shooting Democratic House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and seriously wounding Democratic State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. His wife told investigators that the family was among a small group of Americans who "prepare for major or catastrophic incidents." Police captured Boelter after a two-day manhunt, and his wife was stopped with cash, passports, and guns, indicating a planned escape. The shootings have been described as an act of targeted political violence, with evidence suggesting Boelter planned to target others.</p>

          <p>A hot air balloon caught fire and crashed in Santa Catarina, Brazil, resulting in the deaths of at least eight people and injuries to thirteen others. The balloon had 21 people on board, including the pilot. According to the pilot, a fire started inside the basket, prompting him to lower the balloon and instruct passengers to jump. Some passengers were unable to jump, and the balloon subsequently crashed. The governor of Santa Catarina has ordered a task force to the scene, and President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has offered federal support. The crash occurred in Praia Grande, a popular destination for hot air ballooning.</p>

The discovery was made after researchers identified an unusual antibody in a blood sample taken from the patient in 2011.

Scientists used high-throughput DNA sequencing to unravel the mystery, highlighting a genetic mutation. The patient is the only known carrier of this blood type, and scientists hope to find others with the same blood group to improve care for patients with rare blood types.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that global population data may significantly underestimate rural populations, potentially by 53% to 84%. Researchers from Aalto University analyzed data from 300 rural dam projects across 35 countries and found discrepancies with existing population datasets. This underreporting could have consequences for resource allocation within countries. However, some experts remain skeptical, arguing that such a large undercount is unlikely given the extensive data collection efforts over the years.
