            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-16 22:32:19 EDT</div>

            <p>Leading UK business organizations have jointly appealed for modifications to the government's Employment Rights Bill, expressing concerns that the proposed legislation could hinder economic growth during an uncertain period. The bill aims to enhance workers' rights from day one of employment, including sick pay and protection from unfair dismissal, and restrict 'fire-and-rehire' practices. Business groups support the bill's core objectives but fear it could discourage hiring and increase administrative costs. A government spokesperson defended the bill, emphasizing its potential to significantly upgrade workers' rights and highlighting extensive consultations with businesses.</p>

            <p>During the first televised debate of the Canadian election campaign, leaders of the four major federal parties debated their strategies for dealing with U.S. President Donald Trump and addressed issues like energy and housing. Liberal leader Mark Carney, Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet, and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh participated in the debate, which was moderated by Radio-Canada journalist Patrice Roy. The debate centered on how each party would handle the trade war with the U.S. and Trump's remarks about Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state, with leaders offering differing approaches to the complex relationship.</p>

            <p>Puerto Rico experienced a complete island-wide blackout, impacting 1.4 million clients and forcing hospitals to rely on generators, as the island prepared for Easter weekend. The outage was attributed to a failure in the protection system and vegetation on a transmission line, with restoration efforts expected to take 48-72 hours. The incident sparked outrage among residents, with calls to cancel contracts with Luma Energy and Genera PR, the companies overseeing power transmission and generation. This latest blackout adds to Puerto Rico's history of chronic power issues since Hurricane Maria in 2017, highlighting the fragility of the island's infrastructure.</p>

Van Hollen met with American Embassy officials, human rights groups, and the Vice President of El Salvador to advocate for Abrego Garcia's return. He stated that the Salvadoran government could not provide evidence that Abrego Garcia was involved with MS-13, contradicting claims made by the Trump administration. Van Hollen emphasized his commitment to fighting MS-13 and ensuring justice for all victims of crime through the court system.</p>

            <p>Despite Elon Musk's pledge to rectify cuts to foreign aid, the Trump administration has canceled upcoming orders for emergency therapeutic food, impacting approximately 3 million children in countries like Bangladesh and Somalia. This decision reverses an earlier reinstatement of contracts for companies producing the lifesaving peanut paste, Plumpy'Nut, and leaves existing food supplies stuck in the United States due to a lack of shipping contracts. Experts warn that without intervention, many of these children face death or severe disabilities within months. The situation highlights the critical role of USAID in providing emergency food and the devastating consequences of disrupted aid programs.</p>

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. addressed the increasing rates of autism diagnoses, disputing the notion that better diagnoses are the sole cause and directing the National Institute of Health to investigate environmental factors. Kennedy emphasized the need to identify environmental exposures contributing to the rise in autism and called for a move away from the idea that increased prevalence is solely due to diagnostic improvements. While experts agree that environmental factors could play a role, they also attribute much of the increase to the broadening definition of autism and increased awareness. Kennedy's comments have drawn criticism from autism advocacy groups.</p>

            <p>A Maryland judge is demanding the return of Kilmar Ábrego García, a man mistakenly deported to a mega-prison in El Salvador by the Trump administration. Ábrego García, who came to the U.S. illegally in 2011, had been granted protection from deportation due to potential persecution in El Salvador. The Trump administration claims his deportation was an 'administrative error' but alleges ties to the MS-13 gang, a claim disputed by Judge Xinis. El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has stated he will not allow Ábrego García to return to the US, further complicating the situation.</p>

            <p>A new study reveals a shift in American religious practices, with fewer people attending church services or identifying with a religion, but many still maintaining personal faith through prayer and meditation. The decadelong research project tracked teenagers into adulthood, finding that weekly church attendance dropped significantly, and religious affiliation declined. However, belief in God remained relatively stable, and the practice of meditation nearly doubled. This 'individualization' of faith reflects a move away from formal institutions towards personal expressions of spirituality, often driven by conflicts with political values within organized religion.</p>

            <p>Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw made his first rehabilitation appearance in triple-A Oklahoma City, pitching three scoreless innings as he recovers from offseason knee and foot surgery. Kershaw's fastball velocity averaged 87.5 mph, slightly lower than his usual average, but he expressed satisfaction with his health and the performance overall. Manager Dave Roberts emphasized that the focus is on Kershaw's toe recovery, and pitching coach Mark Prior praised his performance. Kershaw's return is expected to complicate the Dodgers' starting rotation, with other pitchers also returning from injury.</p>

Powell reiterated that the tariffs are "significantly larger than anticipated" and will likely result in higher inflation and slower growth. He said the Federal Reserve can remain patient and monitor the impact of policy changes before adjusting interest rates. Economists have lowered their expectations for U.S. economic growth and forecast higher inflation due to the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>An investigation by the BBC World Service and BBC Verify has traced the flow of weapons from the US to Haiti, revealing how lax laws, absent checks, and suspected corruption are used by traffickers to bypass a UN embargo. The investigation focused on a shipment of assault rifles and pistols seized by Haitian police in April 2024, which originated in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The report highlights the role of 'straw buyers' and 'ant trafficking' in acquiring and transporting the weapons, as well as the challenges in inspecting outgoing cargo from the US. The influx of weapons is fueling gang violence and instability in Haiti, where a record number of people have been killed and displaced.</p>

            <p>Emily Ley, a small stationery business owner in Florida, has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration over tariffs, alleging the illegal use of emergency powers to enact the fees. Ley, who produces her planners in China, argues that the tariffs are unsustainable and will force her to raise prices or reduce salaries and eliminate positions. She claims that the tariffs have cost her business nearly $1.2 million since Mr. Trump's first term and are facing between $830,000 and $1 million in payments this year alone under the administration's new tariffs. The White House maintains that the president has broad authority to impose tariffs.</p>
