          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre is calling for Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, to be stripped of her royal title. This demand follows the emergence of a 2011 email in which the Duchess referred to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as a "supreme friend," seemingly contradicting her public statements. In the wake of this revelation, seven charities have severed ties with Ferguson, who has stated the email was written under duress to prevent a lawsuit from Epstein. Giuffre, who had accused Prince Andrew of sexual assault, died by suicide earlier this year.</p>

          <p>The terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, known as Mo Chara from the rap group Kneecap, has been dismissed due to a technical error in how the charge was filed. He was accused of displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah, a proscribed organization in the UK, during a concert in London. The judge ruled the charge was "unlawful" and "null," leading to applause in the courtroom. Outside the court, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was not about terrorism but was an attempt to silence his advocacy regarding the conflict in Gaza, a sentiment echoed by First Minister Michelle O'Neill.</p>

          <p>China is significantly expanding its soft power across Africa by promoting its language and culture through a growing network of Confucius Institutes, which now operate in 49 African countries. While these government-run centers offer scholarships and language skills that can lead to jobs, critics raise concerns about their role in promoting Beijing's political ideology and potentially undermining academic freedom at host universities. Experts argue that this cultural expansion is linked to China's economic interests, including access to Africa's natural resources. There are calls for African nations to establish clearer rules of engagement to ensure their own cultural and political agency is not diminished.</p>

In politics, he was renowned as the party's foreign affairs spokesman and a prominent critic of the Iraq war.

          <p>A submersible expedition in Germany's Luebeck Bay has discovered that unexploded Nazi-era bombs on the seafloor are teeming with marine life. Scientists were surprised to find dense populations of organisms, including worms, crabs, and starfish, colonizing the munitions left over from World War II. In a particularly unusual observation, dozens of starfish were seen gathered directly on an exposed block of TNT.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 06:05:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 2,000 commercial properties in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, are facing potential tax hikes after a revaluation led to an average 22% increase in their assessed values. This adjustment aims to correct an imbalance where commercial lots were assessed at only 85% of their market value, following a significant rise in residential property values last year. While higher valuations could lead to higher taxes, the final impact will depend on the city's new mill rate, which could potentially decrease due to the expanded tax base. The revaluation is part of the city's effort to create a more equitable and stable tax system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Interpol-coordinated operation across 14 African countries has resulted in the arrest of 260 individuals suspected of involvement in romance scams and 'sextortion' schemes. The sting, funded by the UK, targeted criminal networks that exploit victims online, causing an estimated financial loss of nearly $2.8 million. During the crackdown, authorities seized numerous devices and dismantled 81 cyber-crime groups across the continent. Officials noted a sharp increase in such digital-enabled crimes, which cause both significant financial and psychological harm to victims, who are often emotionally manipulated by the perpetrators.</p>

          <p>In her new memoir, "107 Days," Kamala Harris recounts her reaction to the aftermath of Joe Biden's challenging debate performance against Donald Trump in June 2024. The article highlights an excerpt where Harris expresses frustration, reportedly throwing down talking points that declared "JOE BIDEN WON" and telling campaign staff not to "feed me bulls--t." The book describes the debate as a turning point, filled with Biden stumbling over words and losing his train of thought, which intensified public concern over his fitness for office. Harris's account provides an inside perspective on the internal turmoil within the Biden campaign during a critical moment.</p>

          <p>In response to escalating external trade tensions, particularly with the United States, Beijing has developed a diverse set of policy tools to protect its domestic industries. This article outlines several key measures China can deploy, moving beyond traditional anti-dumping investigations. These include the "Unreliable Entity List," which targets foreign firms deemed to harm China's national interests by restricting their trade and investment activities. Another significant tool is the implementation of stringent export controls on dual-use items, which are goods that have both civilian and potential military applications, requiring special licenses for their shipment.</p>

          <p>At least 16 individuals have died in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) since January, a significant increase that is raising concerns among lawmakers and immigrant rights advocates. This spike in fatalities coincides with a record number of people being held in ICE detention, which surpassed 60,000 in August. Citing "horrendous conditions," groups like the Detention Watch Network are sounding the alarm, while Democratic senators have demanded information from the Department of Homeland Security about the deaths. Despite the rising death toll, ICE maintains that it provides comprehensive medical care and ensures humane conditions for all detainees.</p>

          <p>The potential sale of TikTok's U.S. assets to a group of American billionaires, including Larry Ellison and Rupert Murdoch, is intensifying concerns about the concentration of media ownership in the hands of the ultra-rich. This article argues that as platforms like TikTok become major news sources, especially for young adults, their control by a few powerful individuals poses a threat to unbiased information. The author points to recent changes at the Washington Post and Los Angeles Times, also owned by billionaires, as examples of how owners' political and business interests can influence editorial direction. The trend suggests a future where critical public discourse is increasingly shaped by a small oligarchy.</p>

          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has proposed creating a network of city-owned grocery stores to combat high food prices by operating without a profit motive. The idea has found support among many likely voters but has drawn sharp criticism from private grocery chain owners, who argue it is an unrealistic and naive approach to a complex business. While there are some successful examples of municipal grocery stores in small towns across the U.S., such as in St. Paul, Kansas, there are also notable failures.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article challenges the Trump administration's justification for using lethal force against suspected drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean, arguing there is no evidence that fentanyl is transported via these maritime routes. While the administration claims the strikes are necessary to stop fentanyl from reaching the U.S., data from the Coast Guard and other agencies show that seizures in the region consist almost exclusively of cocaine and marijuana. The author suggests that invoking the fentanyl crisis is a pretext to justify aggressive military actions, potentially as a prelude to operations against Venezuela or as a test for future strikes in Mexico, where fentanyl production is concentrated.</p>

McRaven emphasizes the importance of supporting allies and democratic ideals, using Ukraine as an example of a nation whose values align with America's.

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, currently in the Atlantic, has the potential to interact with another developing storm system nearby, which could lead to a rare meteorological event known as the Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon occurs when two tropical cyclones get close enough to orbit a common center, potentially merging or altering each other's paths and intensity. While forecasters consider this outcome unlikely, it highlights the complexity of storm dynamics during an active hurricane season. The interaction depends on the relative strength and size of the two systems, with various possible outcomes ranging from a brief "dance" to the absorption of the weaker storm.</p>

          <p>The recent fatal shooting at a Dallas ICE facility is part of a disturbing trend of sniper-style attacks across the United States, according to law enforcement experts. Since the attempted assassination of President Trump in July 2024, there have been at least seven similar incidents involving long-range rifle attacks on public figures and law enforcement. The Dallas shooter, who killed one detainee and wounded two others before taking his own life, reportedly planned the ambush-style attack for months. Experts suggest these events represent a new chapter in public violence, presenting a significant challenge for law enforcement to prevent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Welsh word 'poody,' meaning to sulk, is one of ten new Welsh words added to the Oxford English Dictionary in its latest update. The word gained widespread attention after contestants on the BBC show 'Race Across the World' used it, baffling the show's producers. 'Poody' is considered a 'boomerang word,' having originated from the English word 'pout,' been adopted into Welsh as 'pwdu,' and now re-borrowed back into English. Other Welsh additions include 'nobbling' (freezing cold) and 'scram' (to scratch), reflecting the evolving nature of the English language and its regional influences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As autumn begins, health officials are warning of a potential seasonal increase in both flu and Covid-19 cases, creating confusion for those trying to distinguish between the two illnesses. While both can cause fever and fatigue, the flu often arrives more suddenly with significant body aches, whereas a hoarse throat has become a hallmark symptom of recent Covid variants. The UK Health Security Agency has noted a rise in coronavirus cases, and experts stress the importance of vaccination for both viruses to protect vulnerable populations. Getting vaccinated remains the most effective way to prevent severe illness and reduce strain on healthcare systems.</p>

          <p>A senior German lawmaker has warned against a "false sense of security" at the nation's airports, citing an increasing threat from hybrid attacks such as drone incursions and cyberattacks. The alert comes after a series of drone sightings at airports in Denmark, which some officials have linked to Russia. The head of the Bundestag's intelligence oversight panel urged for faster response mechanisms and greater resilience to protect critical infrastructure. This concern is echoed by other officials who are calling for upgraded drone defenses and a more unified national security strategy to counter these evolving threats.</p>

          <p>The European Union is reportedly preparing to launch approximately 20 new anti-dumping investigations against China in the coming weeks, according to a former trade commissioner. This move reflects growing frustration in Brussels over Beijing's trade practices, including industrial overcapacity and the perceived "weaponisation" of its dominance in critical raw materials. The potential for trade diversion, where Chinese goods are rerouted to Europe at lower prices due to U.S. tariffs, has amplified these concerns. The investigations would target a variety of sectors and signal a more assertive trade stance from the EU towards China.</p>

          <p>Animal rights advocates are questioning the Trump administration's commitment to reducing animal testing after discovering that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has approved millions in new funding for primate experiments. Despite promises to scale back such research, documents show about $91 million has recently been allocated to over 70 projects involving animals. One notable project involves kidney transplant studies on nearly 100 monkeys sourced from a controversial South Carolina primate farm. The spending highlights a discrepancy between the administration's public statements on phasing out animal research and its current funding practices, fueling criticism from advocacy groups.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent warning for pregnant women to use Tylenol sparingly due to a supposed link to autism has been strongly refuted by medical experts, who state no causal relationship has been established. Medical scholars and historians note that this rhetoric follows a long and damaging history of blaming mothers for their children's autism, from the discredited "refrigerator mom" theory of the mid-20th century to the debunked claims about vaccines. Experts worry that such misinformation places an undue burden of guilt on mothers and could lead pregnant women to avoid necessary pain relief, which poses its own health risks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two of the three competing federal education budget proposals for fiscal year 2026 would result in significant funding cuts for the nation's most disadvantaged students and schools. The proposals from the White House and House Republicans would slash funding for programs supporting low-income communities, English language learners, and students experiencing homelessness. An analysis by researchers indicates these cuts would disproportionately harm high-poverty school districts and those serving predominantly students of color. In contrast, the Senate's proposal would largely maintain current funding levels, highlighting a sharp partisan divide over the federal government's role in education spending.</p>

Attendees included veterans, current law enforcement, and even some federal workers who were previously laid off, traveling from across the country for the opportunity.

          <p>The Trump administration's practice of extracting payments and equity from private companies in exchange for favorable deals is drawing criticism from finance and history experts, who label it a "shake-down scheme" and a form of crony capitalism. The article highlights the recent demand for a multi-billion dollar payment from the U.S. investors taking over TikTok, as well as the government taking stakes in companies like Intel and U.S. Steel. Critics argue this approach undermines free-market principles, shifting business focus from innovation to currying political favor.

The company, which competes with payment giants like Stripe and Adyen, stated it is on track for strong revenue growth this year.

The move is part of his broader protectionist trade policy aimed at boosting domestic manufacturing, despite calls from U.S. businesses to avoid further tariffs.
