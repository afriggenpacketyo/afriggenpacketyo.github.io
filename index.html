          <p>Following the killing of right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk, Donald Trump and his allies have been accused by legal scholars and historians of using the event to launch broad attacks against political opponents. This response includes initiating investigations into liberal donor George Soros, threatening media outlets, and labeling critics as an "enemy within." Experts describe these actions as authoritarian tactics aimed at suppressing dissent and weakening civil society organizations. The administration's rhetoric has intensified, with Trump suggesting the military could be used as a "training ground" in Democratic-led cities to combat crime.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Choate, a 27-year-old new mother, is sharing her story of surviving an amniotic fluid embolism, a rare and often fatal complication during childbirth. Shortly before her due date, Choate's heart stopped during induced labor, but she was successfully resuscitated and her daughter was delivered safely via C-section. The condition, which occurs in about 1 in 40,000 U.S. births, causes a catastrophic shutdown of the mother's organs and has a high mortality rate. Despite the traumatic experience, Choate made a remarkable recovery without long-term complications, driven by the desire to be with her newborn daughter.</p>

          <p>A Chinese military-focused magazine reported that China's electronic warfare (EW) forces successfully tricked a foreign spy plane in the South China Sea. The EW system allegedly simulated the radar signals of a super-large vessel, like an aircraft carrier, from up to 300km away. This action may have caused the reconnaissance aircraft to track a non-existent target or divert its course toward an incorrect location. The report highlights a rare public disclosure of a Chinese EW combat operation, showcasing the country's growing capabilities in non-conventional military tactics and deception.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has stated his support for President Trump and suggested deploying the National Guard to address crime in San Francisco, citing insufficient local police presence for his company's Dreamforce conference. His comments have drawn sharp criticism from California Democrats, including the San Francisco District Attorney and State Senator Scott Wiener, who called the idea an "illegal military occupation." Despite Benioff's history of donating to liberal causes, his recent remarks align with the President's suggestions to use the military in cities with Democratic leadership.

          <p>In his new book, "The Art of Spending Money," author Morgan Housel argues that financial decisions are highly personal and subjective, emphasizing that true wealth is a balance between what one has and what one wants. He cautions against spending based on external benchmarks like social status, suggesting that people should focus on internal values that genuinely bring happiness, such as time with family and friends. Housel advises that building wealth is a long-term endeavor achieved through consistent, average returns over time, rather than chasing quick riches, which can lead to dangerous financial behaviors driven by fear of missing out.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on President Trump's reaction to not winning the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado. The author suggests that the response from Trump and his supporters, who dismissed the award's legitimacy, is part of a broader pattern of denying unfavorable outcomes. This worldview, where the system is seen as rigged and personal grievances are amplified, has proven popular but becomes tiresome when focused on personal slights. The author satirically contrasts the president's complaints with his own desire for recognition, critiquing the self-centered nature of modern political discourse.</p>

The move comes as many states and cities have shifted to celebrating Indigenous Peoples' Day to acknowledge the devastating impact of Columbus's arrival on Native American populations. The proclamation accuses "left-wing arsonists" of trying to tarnish Columbus's memory and does not mention Indigenous Peoples' Day.

          <p>An analysis of the Trump administration's plan for TikTok's U.S. operations raises significant questions about potential cronyism and a lack of transparency. The deal appears to value TikTok's U.S. business at a surprisingly low $14 billion, potentially creating a massive windfall for a handpicked group of Trump-allied investors. Concerns are also raised about how much control the new owners will have over the platform's content algorithm and whether the deal adequately addresses national security concerns regarding user data.

          <p>The extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies has become a central point of contention in the ongoing federal government shutdown. These subsidies, which lower insurance premiums for millions of Americans, are set to expire at the end of the year, just as open enrollment begins. Democrats are refusing to fund the government without securing an extension, warning of dramatic premium increases for families. Republicans argue the issue can be addressed later and are pushing for a temporary spending bill, creating a stalemate that threatens both government operations and healthcare affordability for many.</p>

          <p>Germany's top trade unions are accusing the government of implementing policies that harm workers and have warned employers against making staff bear the costs of economic difficulties. Yasmin Fahimi, chair of the German Trade Union Confederation (DGB), cautioned that if companies continue to pursue wage cuts or layoffs to cover for management failures, it could lead to "major social conflict." The article also covers other German news, including a possible new trial related to the Madeleine McCann case involving charges of sexual assault, and the discovery of a 2,000-year-old Roman silver treasure.</p>

          <p>Human rights groups report that India has forcibly deported over 1,500 people, including Indian Muslim citizens and Rohingya refugees, to Bangladesh and Myanmar without due process. The crackdown reportedly intensified after a militant attack on tourists in Kashmir in April, with the government ordering the deportation of "illegal immigrants." One Indian citizen, Mustafa Kamal Sheikh, described being detained in Mumbai and forced across the border into Bangladesh by security forces despite having valid Indian identification. Critics allege the deportations are a politically motivated effort to distract from security failures and target Muslims, a claim the government denies.</p>

The online campaign against her included calls for her employer to fire her and threats that revealed her personal information, forcing her to leave her home out of fear for her safety.

          <p>The practice of scattering loved ones' ashes in scenic natural locations is facing scrutiny due to its environmental impact on fragile ecosystems. Hillwalkers in Scotland have reported an increasing number of ash piles on popular summits, prompting conservation groups like the John Muir Trust to discourage the practice on their lands, including Ben Nevis. The high mineral content in cremated ashes can alter the nutrient balance of sensitive alpine soils and harm rare flora. Organizations are now encouraging people to consider alternative locations away from popular peaks or to bury ashes to minimize their ecological footprint.</p>

While the path to Scottish independence remains a central, though challenging, issue for the party, recent polls show the SNP with a lead over a slumping Labour party.

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose a new 100% tariff on all Chinese imports by November 1, escalating trade tensions between the two largest economies. The threat came in response to China's new export controls on rare earth minerals, which are critical for many U.S. technologies. Trump also suggested placing U.S. export controls on "any and all critical software" and expressed uncertainty about a planned meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The announcement caused the S&P 500 to fall sharply amid fears of rekindling a global trade war. (not investment advice)</p>
