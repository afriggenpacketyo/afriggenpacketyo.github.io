          <p>A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of endangering safety on the railway after a train struck a tractor and trailer at a level crossing near Leominster, Herefordshire. The incident, which occurred around 10:45 BST, resulted in injuries to two people, one of whom was airlifted to a hospital. Fifty-six passengers were on board the 08:30 train from Manchester Piccadilly to Cardiff when the crash happened, causing significant disruption to rail services between Hereford and Craven Arms. Investigations are ongoing to determine the circumstances leading up to the crash, which involved a user-worked crossing on a farm track.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from terminating the legal status of thousands of international students, citing the administration's "Student Criminal Alien Initiative." The judge found that the students were likely to succeed in challenging the terminations, as they did not pose an immediate threat to safety or national security. The nationwide injunction prevents immigration authorities from arresting or jailing the students and bars the administration from reversing its reinstatement of certain students' legal status. The judge criticized the Trump administration for abruptly changing course to satisfy courts' concerns and warned against skirting mandatory regulations.</p>

The 51-44 vote, largely driven by Republicans, challenges California's authority to set environmental rules tougher than national standards. Governor Newsom has promised to challenge the Senate vote, arguing that repealing the policies would hinder the state's economy, health, and global competitiveness. The vote also prevents California from requiring half of all new trucks sold in the state to be electric by 2035, sparking a legal battle over the state's Clean Air Act waivers.</p>

          <p>Solar stocks experienced a significant downturn after House Republicans passed a tax bill that terminates key clean energy credits. Sunrun plummeted 37% due to the bill ending tax credits for installers that lease equipment. Enphase and SolarEdge also saw declines, as sales of their inverters are expected to decrease due to lower demand for rooftop solar. The bill ends investment and electricity production credits for clean energy facilities, impacting utility-scale solar projects. First Solar fell less, as the manufacturing tax credit remained relatively untouched. (not investment advice)</p>
