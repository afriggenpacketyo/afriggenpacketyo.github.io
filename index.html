          <p>Assata Shakur, a prominent Black liberation activist who was on the FBI's "most wanted terrorists" list, has died in Cuba at the age of 78. Known formally as Joanne Byron, Shakur had been living in exile since escaping from a U.S. prison in 1979, where she was serving a sentence for the killing of a police officer. The Cuban government announced her death was due to health conditions and advanced age. Shakur and her supporters always maintained her innocence in the killing for which she was convicted.</p>

          <p>The New York City medical examiner has confirmed that Shane Tamura, who killed four people at the NFL's headquarters before taking his own life, had Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). This finding aligns with a note found on Tamura, in which he blamed the NFL for concealing brain injury risks and requested his brain be studied. The diagnosis confirmed low-stage CTE, a condition linked to repeated head trauma, though the report does not state whether it directly motivated the attack. The victims included a security guard, a police officer, a Blackstone executive, and a management company employee.</p>

Higashi was last seen on Tuesday afternoon near Hanalei, and his truck was later found unattended, prompting the search operation. Authorities believe he may have vanished while freediving. The search involves multiple Coast Guard assets, including a response boat, helicopter, and airplane, alongside local fire and police departments.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has indicted former FBI Director James Comey on charges of making false statements and obstruction of justice. The charges stem from his 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding his handling of investigations into Hillary Clinton's emails and Russian election interference. Prosecutors allege Comey misled the Senate about authorizing leaks to the media, a claim potentially contradicted by his former deputy, Andrew McCabe. The indictment comes shortly before the statute of limitations would have expired and has intensified accusations of political weaponization of the Justice Department.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a UN inquiry's findings, there are increasing calls for UEFA to suspend Israel from international soccer competitions due to the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Several national football federations are reportedly pushing for a vote on the matter, which could happen as soon as next week. The article explains that a simple majority of UEFA's 20-member executive committee is needed for a ban, a decision that would also require ratification by FIFA. The situation is politically complex, with the U.S. opposing a ban ahead of the World Cup it will co-host.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government is facing a potential shutdown as Congress has only days left to agree on a funding bill before the deadline. Republicans are pushing for a temporary extension, while Democrats want the bill to include extensions of enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits. A shutdown would furlough hundreds of thousands of non-essential federal employees, close national parks and museums, and delay the release of critical economic data, including the monthly jobs report. The political standoff continues as both parties appear entrenched in their positions.</p>

          <p>Nick Clegg, the former head of global affairs at Meta, stated that technology companies should maintain a respectful distance from politics, expressing unease about their intervention in the public sphere. Speaking about the recent U.S. deal to restructure TikTok, Clegg highlighted the complexities that arise when political interests drive technology policy. He specifically pointed to the safety of American data and the ownership of TikTok's algorithm as key concerns. Clegg warned that government efforts to silo data, as seen in countries like India, could erode the open data flows that underpin the internet.</p>

          <p>Local officials in Russia's western Leningrad region have reported at least 19 deaths this month due to suspected alcohol poisoning. Laboratory tests have confirmed that at least eight of the deaths were caused by consuming methanol, a toxic alcohol substitute. Authorities have opened a criminal investigation and detained two individuals in connection with the sale of counterfeit alcohol. Such incidents are a recurring problem in Russia, where cheap, illicitly produced spirits remain accessible, especially in rural areas, leading to periodic mass poisonings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis frames the federal indictment of former FBI Director James Comey as a key example of President Trump's use of the Justice Department for political retribution. The article argues that the charges are motivated by Trump's long-standing desire for revenge over the FBI's 2016 investigation into his campaign's contacts with Russia. It places the indictment within a broader pattern of the administration targeting political opponents, a strategy signposted during the campaign as a "retribution presidency." The case is seen as a new frontier in the alleged weaponization of the U.S. legal system.</p>

          <p>An Alabama woman is sharing her story after surviving an infection from Vibrio vulnificus, a flesh-eating bacteria she contracted after cutting her feet in coastal waters on Labor Day. Summerlin Skipworth, 30, underwent emergency surgery and now requires a yearlong regimen of daily antibiotics, including a mobile IV treatment she carries with her. The incident is part of a rise in Vibrio infections along the Gulf and East Coasts, linked to warmer ocean temperatures.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to advance a deal that will allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure involving American investors like Oracle. The order officially designates the agreement as a "qualified divestiture," satisfying a law that required the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell or face a ban. Under the deal, ByteDance's ownership will be less than 20%, and a new U.S.-based joint venture will be established to oversee American user data and the app's algorithm, which will be retrained on U.S. data.</p>
