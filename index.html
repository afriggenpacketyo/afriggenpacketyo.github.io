          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is ending its use of the Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS), a critical tool for forecasting hurricanes. This system allows meteorologists to see through cloud cover and analyze a storm's internal structure, which is vital for predicting intensity changes, especially overnight. The decision, stemming from the U.S. Navy ending its data processing, has alarmed scientists who warn it will degrade forecast accuracy and could endanger coastal communities by reducing warning times for rapidly intensifying storms.</p>

          <p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced plans to use a procedural rule to force a complete, word-for-word reading of a 940-page Republican spending bill on the Senate floor. This maneuver is intended to delay the legislative process by up to 15 hours, giving Democrats more time to scrutinize the massive bill and publicly highlight their opposition. While the tactic is designed to be disruptive and draw attention to the bill's contents, it is not expected to ultimately prevent a final vote on the legislation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has once again denied Donald Trump's motion to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed against him by the men known as the 'Exonerated Five.' The men, who were wrongfully convicted in the 1989 Central Park jogger case, are suing Trump for statements he made suggesting their guilt long after they were exonerated. The judge rejected Trump's argument, ruling that a Pennsylvania state law designed to protect against strategic lawsuits does not apply in federal court, allowing the case to proceed.</p>

Experts suggest that the increased use of plainclothes and masks by actual Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents may be making it easier for imposters to deceive the public and commit crimes. These incidents, which have included cases of kidnapping and sexual assault, pose a significant public safety threat and erode trust in law enforcement amid heightened immigration enforcement operations.</p>

The government was compelled to soften its proposed changes, which would have made it harder to claim disability benefits, after facing a potential defeat in the Commons from its own MPs. Despite the concessions, some Labour MPs and the Unite union continue to push for the proposal to be dropped entirely.</p>

This evidence, combined with findings of more elaborate grave goods for females, points to a social structure where women held a central and respected role.</p>

The modification, which replaces the vehicle's original 25mm Bushmaster cannon, was likely done to address the lack of compatible ammunition for the captured Western hardware. While it is unclear if this is for operational use or propaganda, it highlights the ad-hoc battlefield innovations occurring in the war in Ukraine, though its strategic impact is likely minimal.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, openly defying a government ban and the risk of significant fines. The march challenged a controversial law passed by Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n's government that restricts events deemed to be promoting homosexuality to minors. The massive turnout, which included supporters and European officials, was widely seen as a powerful rebuke of the government's crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights and a strong demonstration in support of democratic freedoms in Hungary.</p>
