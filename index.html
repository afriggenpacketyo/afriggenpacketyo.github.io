          <p>Leaders from Thailand and Cambodia are scheduled to meet in Malaysia for peace talks aimed at ending deadly border clashes that have killed at least 34 people and displaced around 200,000. The negotiations, mediated by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, follow pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who threatened tariffs if the fighting continued. Despite the planned talks, artillery exchanges were still reported along the contested border, with both nations accusing the other of initiating the latest aggressions and undermining peace efforts.</p>

          <p>Russia has initiated a regular commercial air route between Moscow and Pyongyang, signaling strengthening ties between the two nations. The first flight, operated by Russian carrier Nordwind, transported over 400 passengers, with the service planned to run monthly to accommodate demand. This development aligns with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's encouragement for tourism to North Korea's new Wonsan-Kalma beach resort, supporting leader Kim Jong Un's efforts to boost the country's economy through international tourism as it gradually eases pandemic-related border restrictions.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Michigan are seeking to file terrorism charges against a 42-year-old man accused of stabbing eleven people at a Walmart in Traverse City. The suspect, Bradford James Gille, allegedly used a folding knife in what officials described as a random attack. He was confronted and detained by multiple citizens, including one who was armed, before law enforcement arrived. The conditions of the victims, who range in age from 21 to 84, are reportedly improving, with most now in fair condition.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have announced a significant trade deal, averting a potential trade war. The agreement establishes a 15% baseline tariff on most EU exports to the U.S., a lower rate than the 30% previously threatened by President Trump. As part of the deal, the EU will purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and invest $600 billion in the American economy, though punitive 50% tariffs on steel will remain, creating complex implications for industries on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

          <p>A 30-year-old Virginia man, Joshua Corbett Coleman, has been arrested and charged with two counts of first-degree murder after allegedly killing his wife and another man.

He then allegedly sought out and killed 68-year-old William Leroy Morey, telling authorities he did so because he “knew he was going to jail.” The couple's two young children were found safe in the suspect's vehicle at the time of his arrest.</p>

When one battery is low, the robot proceeds to a charging station, removes the depleted power source, and inserts a fresh one in a process that takes about three minutes. This innovation, tested in automotive factories, aims to significantly increase the operational uptime for robots in manufacturing and other industries. The development is part of China's broader investment in robotics and AI to advance its position in global manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Following tense negotiations, the U.S. and European Union have finalized a trade agreement, setting a 15 percent tariff on most EU goods, thus avoiding a threatened 30 percent rate. The deal was announced by President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after a meeting in Scotland. Key components include a commitment from the EU to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and invest an additional $600 billion in the U.S. The agreement represents a de-escalation in transatlantic trade tensions, though some specific tariffs, like those on steel, will remain high.</p>

          <p>An active-duty IDF reservist has provided an account of a chaotic and violent incident at a humanitarian aid distribution site in Gaza, challenging international reports that Israeli soldiers fired on starving civilians. The soldier described the event not as a food line but as a coordinated stampede by a crowd of adult men attempting to loot aid trucks, which included gunfire from behind the crowd. He claims his unit fired only after warning shots and other non-lethal measures failed to deter the advancing mob. This testimony presents a starkly different narrative, suggesting the incident was a violent confrontation rather than an unprovoked attack.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an analysis by Ezra Klein, the ongoing controversy surrounding Jeffrey Epstein presents a unique political challenge for Donald Trump. Having built his political brand on exposing alleged "deep state" conspiracies, Trump now presides over the government and its secrets, yet has not provided the transparency his base expects on the Epstein matter. This creates a dilemma where any attempt to deflect or distract only deepens suspicion among a public already primed to believe in cover-ups. The article suggests this situation could be particularly damaging for Trump, as it pits his anti-establishment narrative against his current position of power.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has weakened his country's democratic progress by signing a law that undermines the independence of anti-corruption agencies. The move came as these agencies were reportedly investigating some of his close allies, and it was justified with claims of a conspiracy. Although public protests forced Zelensky to introduce a bill to reverse the law, the author contends that this episode reflects a broader global trend where the push for good governance has diminished. The article suggests Zelensky has seized an opportunity in an era where anti-corruption is no longer a foreign policy priority for key global powers.</p>

          <p>A group of 21 Democratic senators, led by Chris Van Hollen, is urging the Trump administration to stop funding the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). In a letter to the Secretary of State, the senators expressed grave concerns over GHF's operations, which use armed contractors and have been linked to civilian deaths at distribution sites. They are calling for the U.S. to resume support for established UN-led aid mechanisms instead, citing the deepening humanitarian crisis and reports of starvation in Gaza. This move reflects growing international and domestic pressure over the methods of aid delivery in the region.</p>

          <p>Megan Horneman, CIO of Verdence Capital Advisors, has issued a warning that the stock market, trading at record highs, is demonstrating complacency and may be pricing in a perfect scenario. She cites potential trouble from the upcoming August 1 trade tariff deadline, uncertainty about Federal Reserve policy, and technical indicators showing overbought conditions in growth stocks. While maintaining a long-term bullish outlook, Horneman suggests that a valuation correction could occur if rate cuts are taken off the table and advises investors to ensure their portfolios are appropriately allocated.

          <p>Israel's military has initiated a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in parts of Gaza to create secure corridors for humanitarian aid distribution. This move comes amid intense international pressure and mounting concerns over mass starvation in the territory. While aid convoys and airdrops from Jordan and the UAE have begun, the situation remains dire, with medics reporting new fatalities from Israeli fire near an aid route. The UN has welcomed the pause but continues to call for a full ceasefire as the only sustainable solution to the humanitarian catastrophe.</p>

The attackers also looted and burned nearby shops and businesses. The ADF, originally from Uganda, is now primarily based in DR Congo and frequently targets civilians in the region.</p>
