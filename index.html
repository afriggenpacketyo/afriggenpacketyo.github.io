          <p>More than 30 Palestinians were killed and scores wounded in an Israeli attack near a food aid distribution center in Gaza, according to Gaza health officials and witnesses. Witnesses report fire coming from multiple directions, including naval warships, tanks, and drones. The Israeli army stated they are currently unaware of injuries caused by their fire within the aid distribution site and are reviewing the matter. The incident occurred as ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas falter, with each side blaming the other for the lack of progress, while the U.S. continues to push for a ceasefire agreement. Optimism remains low as the conflict continues to impact civilians and humanitarian efforts in the region.</p>

          <p>Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is on trial in absentia, accused of crimes against humanity during a crackdown on protests against her rule last year. Prosecutors claim Hasina directed a violent crackdown, resulting in the death of a student protester and other offenses. Hasina, currently in India, maintains the charges are politically motivated, while her party, the Awami League, is banned pending the trial's outcome. The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), initially established by Hasina to investigate crimes from Bangladesh's 1971 war, is overseeing the trial, with officials vowing impartiality.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is set to halt penny production, marking the potential end of an era for the humble coin. While pennies are economically inefficient, costing more to produce than their face value, Faith Salie reflects on their cultural significance. Pennies have historical value, featuring Lady Liberty on early versions and later President Lincoln, designed by a Jewish immigrant. Salie suggests that despite their impracticality, pennies hold sentimental value and a promise of luck, especially in a digital world dominated by cryptocurrency. The article encourages readers to appreciate the small, tangible reminders of history and luck that pennies represent.</p>

This comes after U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth urged Indo-Pacific allies to increase military spending and cooperation to counter China's threat. However, an observer noted that ASEAN nations may not fully endorse Hegseth's views due to economic uncertainties from U.S. tariffs and the desire to diversify trade ties.</p>

          <p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated that the Trump administration is confident that its tariff agenda will continue despite recent legal challenges. An appeals court reinstated President Trump's tariffs after a previous court order blocked them. The original injunction argued that the administration's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act did not grant the president unlimited tariff-setting authority. The White House maintains that the court order could harm its progress in ongoing trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

The U.S.'s unpredictable approach to international students has led some to explore alternatives closer to home or in other Western nations. Recent measures include revoking visas for students with ties to the Communist Party or those studying in critical fields, and stricter vetting measures involving social media screening.
