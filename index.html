            <h2>Details of Yemen Strike Shared by Defense Secretary Hegseth in Second Signal Chat</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-21 03:05:18 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly shared details of impending U.S. airstrikes in Yemen with a private Signal group, including his wife, brother, and personal attorney. The messages included flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets tasked with striking Houthi targets. This occurred around the same time Hegseth inadvertently shared similar details with The Atlantic's editor-in-chief. The Pentagon's inspector general is evaluating Hegseth's use of Signal to determine compliance with DoD policies, as this incident raises concerns about handling sensitive military information. Optimism is somewhat tempered due to the potential security risks associated with unapproved communication channels.</p>

            <p>An Israeli Defense Forces inquiry found that 'professional failures' led to the deaths of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month, citing an 'operational misunderstanding' and a 'breach of orders.' The inquiry resulted in the dismissal of a unit's deputy commander and a reprimand for another commanding officer. The IDF maintains that six of the casualties were Hamas members, a claim disputed by the Palestine Red Crescent Society. This incident, which occurred in a 'hostile and dangerous combat zone' amidst poor visibility, has sparked criticism and calls for an independent investigation.</p>

            <p>A Boeing 737 MAX jet intended for China's Xiamen Airlines has been returned to Boeing's Seattle production hub due to the increased costs from tariffs imposed by both the U.S. and China. This action highlights the impact of the ongoing trade war, with China imposing a 125% tariff on U.S. goods in retaliation for the U.S. raising tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%. The move could potentially leave many aircraft deliveries in limbo, as airlines may defer deliveries rather than pay the duties. This situation underscores the complex challenges faced by global businesses amidst escalating trade tensions.</p>

            <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, has kept its loan prime rates unchanged, focusing on stabilizing the yuan amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. The decision to maintain the 1-year LPR at 3.1% and the 5-year LPR at 3.6% comes as China reported stronger-than-expected economic data for the first quarter. This move suggests that the PBOC is prioritizing currency stability over further economic stimulus for the time being. The Chinese onshore yuan appreciated slightly following the announcement, reflecting market confidence in the PBOC's approach.</p>

            <p>As the U.S. tightens controls on Nvidia's chip sales to China, domestic AI chipmakers like Huawei stand to benefit, according to analysts. The Commerce Department's recent restrictions on Nvidia's H20 GPUs are expected to increase demand for local alternatives. While Huawei remains a generation behind Nvidia in chip technology, it is making significant progress with its Ascend series. However, export controls also hinder China's ability to produce advanced GPUs at the same scale as Nvidia due to limitations on accessing advanced chipmaking equipment.</p>

            <p>American-style restaurants in Beijing are replacing U.S. beef with Australian beef due to the U.S.-China trade war. Beijing's retaliatory tariffs of 125% on U.S. goods, added to the existing 22%, have made American beef unaffordable. Home Plate BBQ, a popular restaurant chain, is switching to Australian M5 beef and Canadian pork ribs. This shift reflects the broader impact of the trade war on businesses and consumers, with suppliers seeking alternative sources to mitigate rising costs.</p>

            <p>Patrick Crusius, the gunman who killed 23 people in a racist attack at an El Paso Walmart in 2019, is expected to plead guilty in state court to avoid the death penalty.

Texas prosecutors declined to pursue the death penalty at the request of a majority of the victims' families. Crusius has already been sentenced to 90 consecutive life terms at the federal level for hate crimes and weapons charges.</p>

            <p>Approximately 60,000 families and individuals across the U.S. are at risk of losing their rental assistance due to the Emergency Housing Vouchers program running out of funds. The program, launched in 2021, helped people fleeing homelessness and domestic violence secure housing. The Department of Housing and Urban Development expects the funding to be depleted by the end of next year. This loss of assistance could lead to a significant increase in evictions and homelessness, as the program's future rests with Congress, which could decide to add more funding.</p>
