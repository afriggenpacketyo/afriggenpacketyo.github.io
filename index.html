          <p>Nicole Daedone and Rachel Cherwitz, leaders of the 'Orgasmic Meditation' group, have been convicted on coercion charges related to their sexual wellness company, OneTaste. The charges stem from a forced labor conspiracy, alleging that members were pressured into participating in practices against their will. The case highlights the potential for exploitation within self-help and wellness communities, raising questions about consent and power dynamics. The legal proceedings underscore the importance of protecting individuals from coercion and abuse within organizations that promote alternative practices.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The move has been met with disappointment from outside medical groups, who view it as bypassing the established advisory process.

          <p>Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins criticized rioters in Los Angeles after a VA clinic had to temporarily close due to violence following ICE deportation raids. Collins stated that the rioters' actions were interfering with veterans' healthcare and accused California leaders of prioritizing the interests of illegal immigrants over those of hardworking citizens. The LA Ambulatory Care Center was closed for safety reasons, with veterans offered rescheduling or telehealth options. This situation highlights the impact of civil unrest on essential services and the ongoing debate surrounding immigration enforcement.

          <p>About 700 U.S. Marines have been mobilized to support the California National Guard in Los Angeles due to protests over federal immigration enforcement actions. President Trump said he would support arresting California Governor Gavin Newsom for allegedly obstructing these actions, leading Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta to sue Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The lawsuit claims Trump's federalization of the National Guard is unconstitutional and exceeds his authority. The situation reflects escalating tensions between the federal government and California over immigration policy and the use of military force in response to civil unrest.</p>

          <p>Amid protests in Los Angeles over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, legal questions arise regarding the potential invocation of the Insurrection Act. This act, dating back to 1807, allows the president to deploy federal troops on U.S. soil under specific circumstances, such as an insurrection or the inability to enforce federal laws. While Trump has mobilized the National Guard under Title 10 of the U.S. Code, he has not yet invoked the Insurrection Act, though he hasn't ruled out sending active-duty Marines. The situation underscores the escalating tensions between the federal government and California over immigration policy and the potential for the use of military force in response to civil unrest.</p>
