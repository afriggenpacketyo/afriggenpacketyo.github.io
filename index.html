          <p>President Trump asserted that U.S.-Israeli strikes had "totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear program, contradicting an early Pentagon analysis suggesting limited damage. Trump insisted the program was set back "basically decades," while Defense Secretary Hegseth supported Trump's assessment, attributing any conflicting reports to political motives and leaked preliminary intelligence. Democratic Senators Shaheen and Coons emphasized the need for answers and a return to negotiations, highlighting the potential for increased nuclear tensions. Trump also expressed optimism about future U.S.-Iran relations, stating a ceasefire was in place and likening the U.S. strikes to the atomic bombings of Japan to end World War II. The efficacy of the strikes remains a point of contention, but the president believes the war is over and Iran's nuclear ambitions are severely curtailed. Optimism regarding the long-term effects of the strikes and the future of U.S.-Iran relations remains cautious. </p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have remained relatively stable, hovering around 7% since early April, despite economic uncertainty and overseas conflicts. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased slightly to 6.88% last week. This stability has done little to incentivize homebuyers, who continue to face high house prices and limited housing supply. While purchase demand is up 11% from last year, overall mortgage application volumes remain historically low, reflecting a cautious market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japanese pop group Tokio, formerly part of Johnny & Associates Inc., announced its disbandment following member Taichi Kokubun's hiatus due to a misconduct scandal. The group, known for its support for Fukushima Prefecture after the 2011 nuclear crisis, stated it would be difficult to regain trust and continue receiving support. Kokubun's hiatus stems from behavior considered sexual harassment, though details remain undisclosed. This comes amid a series of scandals involving former Johnny & Associates members, including Masahiro Nakai and Tatsuya Yamaguchi, highlighting ongoing issues within the industry.</p>

          <p>The European Union's General Court dismissed a lawsuit by Ryanair against German state aid granted to Condor airline during the COVID-19 pandemic. The case concerned â‚¬400 million in loans provided by the state development bank KfW, which were approved by the European Commission in July 2021. Ryanair challenged this approval, arguing it discriminated against other airlines, but the court found the Commission acted lawfully. The judges found no evidence that the aid violated freedom of establishment or the free provision of services, though Ryanair may still appeal the decision to the European Court of Justice.</p>

          <p>Households in the UK are struggling with billions in unpaid council tax, with total arrears exceeding Â£8 billion. Figures show that Â£6.6bn is owed to local authorities in England, with an extra Â£642m added in the year to April. The government is proposing changes to debt collection rules, but the Treasury also anticipates council tax will rise by 5% annually in the future. Campaigners are advocating for a more sympathetic approach to debt collection, rather than the use of bailiffs, as many in arrears are low-income individuals living in poverty.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are considering massive Medicaid cuts as part of a budget bill that could lead to millions of Americans losing their health insurance. The legislation would cut Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years, potentially reversing recent gains in reducing the number of uninsured adults. Analysis suggests that these coverage losses could lead to thousands of additional deaths annually, along with fewer preventive health screenings and a decline in overall health. The proposed changes include new work requirements for Medicaid recipients and limits on state financing tools, which are expected to disproportionately affect low-income and minority populations.</p>

This downward trend is attributed to rising competition from traditional automakers and the increasing popularity of cheaper Chinese electric vehicles.

          <p>NATO is set to release a joint statement on a collective defense spending increase, aiming to raise expenditure from 2% to 5% of each member nation's GDP by 2035. Despite some members struggling to meet the current 2% target, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte expressed conviction that allies recognize the necessity of increased spending given the threat from Russia. However, Spain has deemed the 5% target "unreasonable," seeking an opt-out, while Italy has questioned the point of the alliance. Other leaders hope for unity, emphasizing the importance of getting serious on defense in the face of international security challenges.</p>

          <p>The recent U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites have led to a cease-fire between Iran and Israel, though without a formal agreement. While Israel demonstrated its intelligence capabilities by targeting high-ranking military leaders, it failed to fully destroy Iranâ€™s nuclear program. Iran's regime proved resilient but suffered damage and humiliation, losing control of its airspace. A factional battle continues within the Iranian political elite, with some seeking normalization with the West while others remain committed to rejectionism. The U.S. and Israel may seek to bring a weakened Iran back into talks about limiting its nuclear program.</p>

For North Korea, the lesson is that a working nuclear deterrent is the only guarantor of security. The strike also makes it more difficult to negotiate terms for denuclearization. Military cooperation between North Korea and Iran, dating back to the 1980s, is likely to accelerate.</p>

          <p>The recent ceasefire between Israel and Iran has slightly reduced the immediate threat of a larger conflict, but many Americans remain concerned about potential terrorist attacks. Experts suggest that moments of anxiety can lead to increased domestic power for authoritarians, as people may willingly give up freedoms for perceived safety. The situation with Iran and Trump's immigration policy are closely intertwined, particularly in California. Concerns are rising that civil rights could be eroded in the name of national security, mirroring historical events.</p>

          <h2>California Residents Express Fear Amid Immigration Raids</h2>

          <p>Residents in California, particularly those of Latino descent, are expressing heightened fear and anxiety due to increased immigration raids. The Department of Homeland Security denies racial profiling, but concerns persist that darker-skinned individuals are more likely to be targeted. Latino parents are warning their U.S. citizen children to be cautious, and some are carrying their passports. Studies show that skin color has long affected the lives of Latinos in the U.S., leading to income disparities, lower socioeconomic status, and more health problems.</p>
