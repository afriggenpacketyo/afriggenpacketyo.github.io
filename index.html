          <p>Irish language hip-hop artist Liam Ã“g Ã“ hAnnaidh, known as Mo Chara from the group Kneecap, was granted unconditional bail after appearing in a London court on a terror charge. The charge stems from allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah at a London performance. Supporters gathered outside the court to applaud the band, who wore "Free Mo Chara" T-shirts, while others displayed "Free Speech, Free Palestine" flags. The next hearing for Mr. Ã“ hAnnaidh is scheduled for August 20.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's 50+1 rule, in place since 1999, ensures that club members retain control over professional football clubs by holding at least 50% plus one vote in the club's spun-off company. The rule aims to prevent external investors from gaining complete control and prioritizing financial interests over fan interests, promoting equality among clubs. Exceptions exist for investors with over 20 years of continuous support, such as Bayer Leverkusen and VfL Wolfsburg, though RB Leipzig faces criticism for allegedly circumventing the rule. Critics argue that the rule puts German clubs at a financial disadvantage compared to other countries, while supporters in other nations advocate for similar regulations to protect club identity and fan involvement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK inflation remained at 3.4% in May, the highest in over a year, while chocolate prices rose at a record pace of 17.7% due to bad weather in cocoa-producing regions and government mismanagement. Food prices have risen for three consecutive months, leading to speculation that businesses are passing on increased employer National Insurance contributions to consumers. Rising food inflation was partially offset by cheaper travel prices in May, as the cost of plane tickets fell compared to last year. Retailers have warned that costs from the chancellor's Budget could not be fully absorbed and would inevitably lead to higher prices for shoppers.</p>

He acknowledged Meta's competitiveness but questioned its innovation capabilities, drawing a comparison to Google's failed attempt to rival Facebook. OpenAI is investing heavily in data centers to power AI development, and Altman expresses confidence in OpenAI's ability to achieve superintelligence.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel criticized former FBI director James Comey's Instagram post for allegedly inspiring threats against President Donald Trump, citing the arrest of Peter Stinson, a former Coast Guard officer, who made graphic threats against Trump. Patel claimed that Comey's post, which featured shells arranged with the number "86 47," prompted numerous copycats and diverted FBI resources. Stinson, identified as an Antifa member, had previously made threats against Trump, including references to an assassination attempt.

          <p>Donald Trump's foreign policy approach is characterized by impulsiveness and a lack of a systematic grand strategy, resulting in incoherent and contradictory policies. While there is a bitter foreign policy fight between GOP hawks and the "America First" crowd, Trump's instincts about interests, deals, and strength guide his decisions, often leading to volatility. His policies have shifted between interventionism and isolationism, influenced by his own instincts and the advice of those around him. This inconsistency, coupled with the broad powers presidents have over foreign policy, creates a chaotic and unpredictable approach to international relations.</p>

Boelter's projects included a book called "Revoformation" and proposals to end American hunger, expressing frustration with what he saw as unjust suffering. Kalech noted that Boelter's fervent personality and grand-scale projects never fully materialized, with Boelter's last project being a collection of corporations to help businesses in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The legality of Israel's attack on Iran is under intense debate, with arguments focusing on whether it constitutes self-defense under international law. While Israel claims it was a preemptive strike to prevent a nuclear threat, experts argue it may be a prohibited act of self-defense, requiring an imminent attack. Some argue that the attack should be seen as part of a larger conflict, while others emphasize the importance of exhausting all other options before resorting to force. Legal experts also highlight the need to adhere to the laws of combat, protecting civilians and minimizing harm, but also worry about the implicit state support for Israel's potentially illegal definition of self-defense.</p>

          <p>Dan Evans and Petra Kvitova have been granted wildcards for the Wimbledon main draws. Evans, a former British number one, recently regained his place in the world's top 200. Kvitova, a two-time Wimbledon champion, is the only non-British player to receive a wildcard in the initial announcement. Teenagers Mika Stojsavljevic and Hannah Klugman have also been given entry into the main draw. The tournament is set to begin at the All England Club on June 30th.</p>
