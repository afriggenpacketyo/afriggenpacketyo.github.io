          <p>Hundreds of thousands gathered in Tehran for the state funerals of top military commanders and nuclear scientists killed during a recent 12-day conflict with Israel. The ceremonies honored figures like Revolutionary Guard chief Gen. Hossein Salami, who died in what Israel described as a campaign to dismantle Iran's nuclear program. The event was marked by anti-American and anti-Israeli chants, reflecting public anger and defiance following a ceasefire. Iran's Supreme Leader was notably absent, while other high-ranking officials attended, some showing injuries from the conflict.</p>

          <p>This opinion article from Fox News contends that the idea of the "transgender child" is a dangerous concept manufactured by a combination of psychiatry, endocrinology, and political activism. The author traces the concept's origins to psychiatric studies in the 1960s and its formalization in the DSM-III in 1980, arguing it pathologized childhood gender nonconformity. The piece asserts that most of these children would otherwise grow up to be gay or lesbian and are now being steered toward medicalization. It concludes that society is abandoning reason for ideology, harming children in the process.</p>

          <p>Following a significant U-turn on welfare cuts forced by a backbench revolt, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has declared that fixing the country's "broken" benefits system is a moral necessity. Speaking at a Labour Party conference, he stated the system is failing people and trapping those who want to work, though he assured that the safety net for the vulnerable would remain. The government had to revise its plans to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payments (Pip) after facing opposition. Despite the concessions, some MPs and unions are pushing for more substantial changes or a complete overhaul of the proposed reforms.</p>

The House plan aims to address a $2.7 billion shortfall by tightening eligibility, which could disqualify nearly 10% of recipients and reduce aid for most others. University leaders argue these changes pose an "existential threat" to student access, forcing more students to take on debt or drop out. They are supporting the Senate's less restrictive alternative, which they see as more favorable to the over 6 million low- and middle-income students who rely on the grant.

While not suggesting the conflict should be ignored, the piece reflects on how the media's focus on war can sideline important national issues and provide a ratings-driven boost to a president, a dynamic dating back to the era of yellow journalism.</p>

          <p>An investigation by the nonprofit Earthsight has implicated several luxury fashion brands, including Coach, Fendi, and Hugo Boss, in supply chains linked to illegal deforestation in Brazil's Para state. The report details how leather from cattle raised on illegally cleared land, some within Indigenous territories, makes its way to Italian tanneries that supply these high-end companies. The process often involves "cattle laundering," where animals from illegal farms are moved to legal ones before sale, obscuring their true origin. While most of the accused brands have denied the specific allegations, the findings highlight significant gaps in supply chain transparency.</p>

          <p>State and local health departments across the U.S. are facing a crisis as expected grant funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has been delayed for months without explanation. The funding slowdown has forced some departments to lay off staff, such as disease investigators, and halt critical services like HIV testing and cancer screening programs. According to internal CDC sources, the agency has not received its full fiscal year budget and is operating on short-term increments, preventing it from issuing the necessary grants. This administrative bottleneck threatens to grind public health initiatives to a halt nationwide.</p>

          <p>During the first round of the LIV Golf event in Dallas, five-time major champion Brooks Koepka withdrew after an outburst on the ninth hole. Following a poor tee shot, Koepka slammed his club into the ground and then hit a tee box marker, sending it flying towards a small group of spectators, though it did not appear to strike anyone. He was six over par through eight holes at the time of the incident. LIV Golf officials later stated that Koepka's withdrawal was due to an illness, reporting that he had been feeling unwell throughout the week.</p>

In a joint statement, Israeli leaders called the article "blood libel" and "malicious falsehoods."

          <p>In a significant policy shift, Germany is planning a massive increase in defense spending with the goal of building the most powerful military in Europe. This historic move, spurred by a new Trump presidency and the war in Ukraine, involves a constitutional change to allow for increased borrowing for defense. The government plans to spend 3.5% of its GDP on its military, a dramatic increase for a country that has long been hesitant to expand its armed forces due to its history. The decision reflects a new sense of urgency among Germany's leaders to meet NATO commitments and respond to geopolitical threats. (not investment advice)</p>

Senators Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, along with Representative Thomas Massie, have frequently opposed Trump on issues ranging from war powers and tariffs to his major spending bill. This has angered many of Trump's diehard supporters in the state and prompted the president to call for a primary challenge against Massie.

          <p>A new play, "The Reservoir," which recently opened at the Geffen Playhouse, explores a family's struggle with addiction through the eyes of its protagonist, a queer Jewish theater student in recovery. The review describes the play as relying on familiar theatrical tropes, with "characters" who deliver laugh lines and moral lessons rather than speak authentically. While acknowledging the unique framing of using four grandparents as a sort of Greek chorus, the critic finds the play's approach to be formulaic and its humor too easy. The performances are noted, but the writing is critiqued for not delving deep enough into its serious subject matter.</p>

Key evidence, including the fact that the state's star witness was a police informant, was hidden from the defense for decades.

          <p>A private funeral was held for Melissa Hortman, the former Minnesota House speaker who was shot and killed in her home earlier this month in an act of political violence. Hortman and her husband were killed in what law enforcement describes as a planned series of attacks targeting Democratic officials. The suspected gunman also shot and wounded another state senator and his wife. The assassination is one of several recent attacks on political figures, highlighting a spike in threats and political polarization in the United States.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Use of an Expletive When Discussing Iran-Israel Conflict Seen as Unprecedented and Authentic</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 05:00:19 EDT</div>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on President Trump's recent use of an expletive while publicly discussing the long-standing conflict between Israel and Iran. The author notes that while it may be the first time a president has deliberately used the F-word in such a public forum, the moment came across as authentic and reflected a frustration shared by many. The article suggests that in an era of scripted political spin, such moments of raw, unpolished language can paradoxically make a leader seem more human and trustworthy. It argues that judicious use of such language can be a powerful tool for communication.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Tariffs on Chinese Goods May Lead to More Expensive and Scarce July 4th Fireworks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Americans may face higher prices and potential shortages for fireworks this Fourth of July due to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports. The U.S. sources nearly all of its consumer and professional pyrotechnics from China, and these products were hit with significant tariffs this spring. Importers have struggled with the new costs, with some halting deliveries, which could lead to less variety for consumers. The industry is particularly concerned about 2026, the nation's 250th birthday, as the unpredictable trade policy makes it difficult to plan for the major celebration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Postpones Ruling on Louisiana Case with Major Implications for the Voting Rights Act</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has unexpectedly decided to postpone a ruling in a Louisiana congressional redistricting case, scheduling it for re-argument in its next term. The case, which could significantly impact the Voting Rights Act of 1965, centers on whether a new map with a second majority-Black district constitutes an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The court's decision to delay has puzzled legal experts, fueling speculation about a deep internal debate over the future of legal protections against racial discrimination in elections. The outcome could make it harder to challenge voting maps that dilute the power of minority voters.</p>

          <p>President Trump is navigating a momentous week, balancing major domestic policy pushes with significant foreign policy developments. At home, his "one big beautiful bill," a massive tax and spending package, faces a crucial test in the Senate. Abroad, his administration is managing the aftermath of U.S. strikes on Iran and a subsequent ceasefire, while also facing a deadline on numerous trade deals. The week was also marked by a favorable Supreme Court ruling that limits the power of lower courts to block his executive actions, capping a period of wins and unresolved challenges for his presidency.
