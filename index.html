          <p>Political analyst Charles M. Blow reflects on the shifting mood of the country regarding racial justice, noting a decline in support for pluralism and an increase in efforts to erase Black history and symbols. He recounts a visit to Emancipation Park in Houston, where sponsors have become hesitant to support Juneteenth-related activities. Blow highlights instances of the "Great Blackout," such as the dismantling of the Black Lives Matter Plaza street mural in Washington, D.C., and the removal of Harriet Tubman's image from a National Park Service page. Blow observes that several cities have canceled Juneteenth celebrations, indicating that the holiday is now caught in the crossfire of America's culture wars.</p>

          <p>Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has stated that Israel will prevent an aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg, Liam Cunningham, and other activists from reaching Gaza, citing the need to maintain its naval blockade to prevent Hamas from importing arms. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, operating the vessel, accused Israel of jamming their communications as they approached Gaza. This comes as humanitarian workers warn of famine in Gaza, despite Israel allowing some aid into the territory after a three-month total blockade. The article also notes that Palestinians say five people were killed by Israeli fire near aid distribution points run by an Israeli and U.S.-backed group.</p>

          <p>Protests have broken out in Los Angeles following citywide Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations, leading to calls for "mass mobilization." President Trump has ordered the deployment of at least 2,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles County after clashes between immigration authorities and demonstrators. The protests began after ICE officers executed search warrants at multiple locations, including outside a clothing warehouse in the Fashion District, and reports of detentions outside Home Depot and Dale's Donuts stores. The Department of Homeland Security said the ICE operations resulted in the arrests of 118 immigrants this week, including 44 people in Friday's operations.</p>

The hubs are set up inside Israeli military zones and are run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a new group of mainly American contractors, and experts warned earlier this year that Gaza was at critical risk of famine if Israel did not lift its blockade and halt its military campaign.</p>

          <p>Psychologist Mark Travers identifies the most common reasons couples fight, including tone of voice/attitude, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. He explains that a sour tone often signals contempt, while arguments about family reflect fundamental misalignments. Uneven distribution of labor and ineffective communication styles also contribute to conflict. Travers offers strategies for resolving these issues, such as naming the effect of a condescending tone and reassuring one another about family relations.</p>
