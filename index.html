            <p>Lawyers for Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil are challenging the government's attempt to deport him, arguing that the evidence presented doesn't demonstrate an adverse foreign policy consequence as alleged by the Trump administration. The government entered a memo signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, asserting Khalil's presence compromises U.S. foreign policy due to his alleged role in antisemitic protests, fostering a hostile environment for Jewish students. Khalil's attorneys plan to request to depose Rubio to understand the grounds for his determination, arguing the case could set a dangerous precedent silencing critics. The immigration judge will make a finding on Khalil's removability, with further litigation possible.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld a judge's order requiring the Trump administration to help Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man wrongly deported to El Salvador, return to the United States. While the court agreed that the administration must "facilitate" his return, it asked the lower court to clarify the extent to which the administration must "effectuate" it, respecting executive power in foreign affairs. Abrego Garcia, who has a work permit and family in the U.S., was deported despite a prior order protecting him from removal to El Salvador.</p>
