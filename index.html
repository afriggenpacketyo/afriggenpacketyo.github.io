            <p>A shooting at Florida State University resulted in two fatalities and six injuries, with the suspect, identified as 20-year-old Phoenix Ikner, an FSU student and the son of a Leon County deputy sheriff, now in custody after being shot by police. The incident occurred near the student union, prompting a campus lockdown and a multi-agency response, including the FBI and FDLE. Ikner allegedly used his mother's former service weapon in the shooting, raising questions about access to firearms and security on campus. Classes and university events have been canceled through Sunday, and counseling services are being offered to students and staff. Optimism score reflects the tragedy, but the quick response of law enforcement and the availability of counseling services mitigate total panic.</p>

            <p>Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University graduate student from Turkey, has been denied bond by an immigration judge after her visa was revoked following her co-authorship of an op-ed criticizing the university's response to pro-Palestine activism. Her lawyers argue that her detention violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights and are seeking her release or transfer. The Department of Homeland Security cited a State Department memo claiming Öztürk was involved with associations undermining U.S. foreign policy. The judge deemed her a flight risk and a danger to the community based on this assessment, prompting legal challenges from her attorneys. This is a developing situation raising concerns about academic freedom and immigration enforcement.</p>

            <p>The FDA is reportedly considering a plan to end most of its routine food safety inspections, delegating this responsibility to state and local authorities, a move that could free up resources for higher-priority and foreign inspections. The plan, which is not yet finalized and may require congressional approval, has been under discussion for years. Some argue that states can conduct inspections more cost-effectively while maintaining standards, while others express concern about the potential impact on food safety oversight, especially in states without existing FDA contracts. This shift raises questions about the future of food safety regulation and the FDA's role in ensuring a safe food supply.</p>

            <p>President Trump expressed his approval of the Supreme Court's decision to hear arguments regarding birthright citizenship, claiming the case is fundamentally about slavery. He argued that the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to those born in the U.S., was enacted in the context of the Civil War and its aftermath. Trump stated that viewing the issue through the lens of slavery makes the case easier to win. The Supreme Court agreed to expedite oral arguments on Trump's request to roll back injunctions against his executive order to end birthright citizenship.</p>

Etsy anticipates benefiting from tariffs and restrictions due to its lower dependence on Chinese products. However, American shoppers may still face higher prices as U.S. businesses pass on costs from tariffs on imported components.</p>

            <p>President Trump addressed the deadly shooting at Florida State University, calling it "terrible" but suggesting he is unlikely to support new gun control measures. He reiterated his support for the Second Amendment, stating that "the gun doesn't do the shooting, the people do." Trump has generally opposed new gun control measures and recently signed an executive order to review Biden-era gun regulations. This response indicates a continuation of the Trump administration's stance on gun control, despite the recent tragedy.</p>

            <p>The IRS is considering revoking Harvard University's tax-exempt status after President Trump suggested the school could lose its exemption. This move follows Harvard's rejection of the Trump administration's demands to change its policies and leadership. Experts say that stripping an organization of its tax-exempt status is unusual, especially for an institution like Harvard. The IRS could argue that Harvard is violating public policy, but legal challenges are likely. Losing tax-exempt status could impact Harvard's finances and donations, but the university maintains that such a decision would be illegal.</p>
