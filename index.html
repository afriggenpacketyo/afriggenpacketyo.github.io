          <p>Craig Steinley, the vice president of the Appraisal Institute, was ousted from his position after The New York Times reported allegations of improper touching from multiple women. The national board voted to remove Steinley following an emergency meeting, after which Steinley denied the accusations and claimed the decision was retaliatory. The Appraisal Institute had previously paid $412,000 to settle a sexual harassment claim against him. The organization is now facing multiple lawsuits related to Steinley's alleged conduct, including claims of wrongful termination and sexual harassment from former employees and executives. The removal of Steinley is seen as a first step toward accountability within the organization.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed there is a "genocide" against white farmers in South Africa during a meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. Ramaphosa and a South African court have denied the existence of a white genocide in the country. Trump's claims are supported by Elon Musk, who has voiced similar allegations. The White House released a statement doubling down on the administration's unfounded claims of genocide. Despite the claims, South African crime statistics do not differentiate between the races of victims, and there is no indication that murders are race-driven.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston ruled that the Trump administration violated an order barring officials from deporting people to countries not their own without sufficient time to object. The ruling came after eight migrants were deported on a flight that landed in Djibouti, with lawyers claiming they were told they were being sent to South Sudan. The judge criticized the government for providing insufficient notice and raised the possibility of criminal contempt penalties. The flight carrying the deportees was operated by a private jet company that has worked for the U.S. government, and flight-tracking data confirmed its route.</p>

Amazon will begin sourcing a wider range of Nike products directly to expand its selection for U.S. customers.
