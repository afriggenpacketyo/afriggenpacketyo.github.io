          <p>China is rapidly advancing its military capabilities through an ambitious modernization program for the People's Liberation Army (PLA), positioning the nation to become a military superpower. This progress is expected to be showcased during a major military parade in Beijing, where some of the PLA's newest weaponry will be displayed. The article is part of a series examining the significant strides China's military has made in recent years. This development reflects a strategic push to enhance its global influence and defense posture.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the Flanders region of Belgium, cities like Mechelen are turning to wetland restoration as a crucial strategy to combat increasingly severe flooding and drought caused by climate change. Urban sprawl and aging sewer systems have exacerbated the problem, leaving residents vulnerable. The regional Sigma Plan, which combines traditional infrastructure like dikes with nature-based solutions such as controlled flood zones, serves as a model for climate adaptation. Despite initial resistance, these projects are gaining community support by providing recreational spaces and demonstrating effective water management.</p>

          <p>Air Canada's flight attendants have ended their strike after their union, the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), reached a tentative agreement with the airline. The walkout, which began over the weekend, had disrupted travel for approximately 130,000 passengers daily during the peak summer season. The strike was declared illegal by the Canada Industrial Relations Board, but the union had initially defied the back-to-work order. The new agreement resolves a contract dispute centered on pay and compensation for work performed while planes are on the ground.</p>

          <p>A 38-year-old Florida man has been found guilty of second-degree murder for fatally stabbing a friend during a 2022 argument about former President Donald Trump's business history. The altercation began over a disagreement on whether Trump's businesses had gone bankrupt, escalating into a physical fight where the victim was stabbed in the chest. The convicted man, Donald Jamesbrown Henry, claimed self-defense, but investigators found insufficient evidence to support his claim of needing to use deadly force. He now faces a sentence of at least 16 years to life in prison.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue fell slightly short of Wall Street expectations, marking the second consecutive quarter the company has missed earnings targets. Despite this, the home improvement retailer is maintaining its full-year forecast, anticipating a 2.8% growth in total sales. The company noted a continued "deferral mindset" among homeowners but also saw positive signs, such as a 2.6% increase in transactions over $1,000. Home Depot's outlook does not factor in potential interest rate cuts, which could stimulate more home improvement activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Societal Rudeness Debated as Experts Point to Stress and Distraction</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Pew Research survey suggests nearly half of Americans believe people are more impolite now than before the pandemic, sparking a debate about a potential crisis of rudeness. Etiquette experts and sociologists attribute this perception to increased stress, overwhelming feelings, and constant digital distractions that reduce awareness of others. While rudeness is subjective and varies across generations and cultures, its effects, such as decreased cooperation and mood, are well-documented. Experts suggest that breaking this cycle involves modeling polite behavior, setting clear social expectations, and being mindful of one's impact on others.</p>

          <p>A 113-year-old wooden church in Kiruna, Sweden, is being moved 5 kilometers to a new location in a carefully orchestrated two-day journey. The relocation is necessary because the ground under the city's old center has become unstable due to over a century of iron ore mining. The 672-tonne structure, once voted Sweden's most beautiful building, was lifted onto giant trailers to be moved in one piece. This event is a key part of a larger project to relocate the entire city, funded by the mining company LKAB, to ensure the safety of its infrastructure and residents.</p>

The UK's perspective is that Trump's pledge of U.S. involvement in "cast iron" security guarantees provides Ukraine with greater flexibility in future negotiations.

Certain versions of these toxic steroids are still prescribed today to treat congestive heart failure, demonstrating a fascinating intersection of evolutionary biology and pharmacology.

Experts explain that crime trends can appear differently depending on the chosen time frame, and while D.C. has a chronic issue, it is not the most violent city of its size.

          <p>Pierre Poilievre, the leader of Canada's Conservative Party, is projected to win a by-election in the Alberta riding of Battle River-Crowfoot, securing his return to the House of Commons. Poilievre had lost his long-held Ottawa-area seat in the last general election four months prior. The special election was initiated after the incumbent Conservative MP stepped down to create a vacancy for the party leader. Despite facing a record 214 candidates, many from a protest group, Poilievre's victory in the Conservative stronghold was widely expected and allows him to lead his party from within Parliament.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is initiating a review of the Smithsonian Institution's exhibitions and materials to align them with a directive to celebrate "American exceptionalism" and remove what it deems divisive, race-centered ideologies. President Trump has criticized the museum group for promoting narratives that portray American values as oppressive. In response, the White House aims to ensure the taxpayer-funded institution presents a more patriotic view of the nation's history ahead of the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Critics, including historical associations, argue this move undermines scholarly independence and risks presenting an incomplete version of the American past.</p>

          <p>As the new school year approaches, many families are shopping earlier and focusing on essential items to manage rising costs, according to the National Retail Federation. Concerns over U.S. tariffs on imported goods like electronics and clothing, combined with general inflation, are driving this trend. The average family is expected to spend over $850 on school-related items this year, a significant increase from 2019. To save money, shopping experts recommend comparing prices online and in-store, considering refurbished electronics, buying store-brand supplies, and waiting for post-school-start sales on clothing.

Analysts note that rising prices, concerns about quality, and the increasing ubiquity of high-end brands may be diminishing their exclusivity and appeal. While the long-term outlook is buoyed by projections of rising global wealth, brands must adapt to a more challenging immediate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

As part of the EU's "Vision Zero" program, the city has also invested in redesigning infrastructure for pedestrian and cyclist safety, improving public transport, and using data to identify and fix dangerous intersections.

The article explains that a car's performance differs between qualifying and a race because peak tire grip in a single lap can mask underlying balance issues that cause faster degradation over a long stint.
