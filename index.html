          <p>A Mexican Navy sailboat, the Cuauhtemoc, carrying 277 people, crashed into the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday evening, resulting in two deaths and numerous injuries. According to authorities, the collision occurred around 8:30 p.m. when the ship, disembarking from Pier 17 and heading to Iceland, lost power and mechanical function, causing it to drift into the bridge's pillar. Cellphone videos captured the dramatic moment of impact, showing crew members dangling from the masts, but no one fell into the water. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident, with preliminary information suggesting a mechanical issue with the sailboat as the likely cause.</p>

          <p>A series of severe storms, including tornadoes, have swept through the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions since Friday, resulting in at least 27 deaths and numerous injuries. Kentucky and Missouri have been particularly hard-hit, facing widespread destruction and ongoing rescue efforts. According to the article, the storm system consisted of supercells that spawned tornadoes, with preliminary counts indicating 26 touchdowns primarily in Indiana and Kentucky. The inclement weather has compounded existing challenges for communities still recovering from similar storms in April, straining federal weather and emergency management resources amidst recent workforce cuts. Despite the devastation, Kentucky's governor praised the White House and FEMA for their response.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Moodyâ€™s has downgraded the US credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns over rising government debt and a widening budget deficit. This action marks Moodyâ€™s as the last of the major credit agencies to lower the US rating, intensifying worries about the country's fiscal path. The agency criticized successive administrations and Congress for failing to address large annual deficits and increasing interest costs. While some investors anticipate limited market impact, the downgrade could increase pressure on US government debt, potentially leading to higher yields on Treasury bills. The White House has criticized Moodyâ€™s decision, while others argue the US's ability to issue its own currency mitigates default risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 48-year-old disabled mother is hesitant to move in with her adult child due to concerns about losing or having her Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits reduced. The confusion arises from the strict rules governing SSI, a needs-based program for individuals with limited income and assets, as opposed to Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), which is not income-tested. According to the Social Security Administration (SSA), living arrangements can directly impact SSI benefits, and if someone else provides free shelter or pays rent, the monthly SSI payment may be reduced by up to one-third of the federal benefit rate.</p>

          <p>Historians and archivists are expressing concerns that the Trump administration's record-keeping practices could result in a significantly incomplete historical record compared to previous presidencies. Actions such as scrubbing government websites, using auto-delete apps, and discouraging note-taking at meetings raise fears of a sanitized and edited version of events. While the administration claims to be transparent, critics argue that the lack of proper documentation hinders accountability and the ability to understand the inner workings of the government. Legal obligations to preserve records are being questioned amid reports of mishandling and concealing information.</p>

          <p>Boeing's new 777X aircraft will not feature engine chevrons, the shark-toothed designs previously used to reduce jet engine noise. Instead, the 777X utilizes advanced engine designs, such as the General Electric GE9X, which incorporate new materials and nozzle designs to minimize noise without sacrificing thrust. This shift reflects progress in aviation technology, as Airbus never used chevrons. While chevrons reduce noise by creating more vortices, they also decrease engine thrust. The GE9X engine's compact exhaust stream and honeycomb architecture disrupt sound waves, resulting in a quieter and more fuel-efficient flight.</p>

          <p>A new study from the CDC indicates a dramatic decline in RSV hospitalizations among babies, linked to the widespread availability of a vaccine given during pregnancy and a monoclonal antibody treatment for infants. Compared to pre-pandemic seasons, RSV hospitalizations in babies under seven months have decreased by as much as 56%, with newborns experiencing a drop of up to 71%. The study suggests that these preventative measures are highly effective in protecting young infants from severe illness, even amid a more severe RSV season. Researchers anticipate even larger reductions in RSV hospitalizations with increased use of these products.</p>

While orchid sellers glamorized their hunters' deaths, the focus shifted to environmental concerns as orchids became too common.

The Constitution includes provisions prohibiting presidents from receiving domestic or foreign gifts without congressional consent, aimed at preventing undue influence. Trump's actions, such as intending to accept a Qatari jet and auctioning off dinner opportunities, reflect a disregard for these principles.

          <p>President Donald Trump's frequent use of national emergency declarations is raising concerns about the expansion of presidential power. Since taking office for his second term, Trump has declared eight emergencies on issues ranging from border security to trade, unlocking special authorities typically reserved for situations that cannot wait for congressional action. Experts argue that many of these situations do not meet the legal standard for an emergency and that Congress has made a mistake in granting the president such broad powers. The use of these powers could potentially lead to abuses, including control over communications facilities and the freezing of assets.</p>

          <p>Efty Sharony, former ombudswoman for the state Office of Youth and Community Restoration, alleges she was fired after reporting deplorable conditions at an L.A. County juvenile hall, where a teen later died of a drug overdose. Sharony claims her supervisors told her to stop investigating juvenile halls after she sounded the alarm, and that the state prioritized political relationships over addressing the issues. This follows concerns about flagging efforts to improve conditions at L.A.â€™s juvenile halls and the lack of enforcement of a court settlement mandating reforms.</p>
