          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 01:15:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that the United States is not pursuing specific currency exchange rates during trade negotiations with Japan, despite previous accusations from President Trump regarding currency devaluation. Bessent emphasized that the U.S. expects Japan to adhere to the G7 agreement on currency valuation, which should reflect economic fundamentals. The Trump administration is prioritizing negotiations with Japan to address trade imbalances, non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, and government subsidies. The meeting is part of bilateral tariff negotiations that formally kicked off last week.</p>

          <p>The WHO, UNICEF, and Gavi vaccine alliance have jointly warned of a concerning global increase in outbreaks of diseases such as measles, meningitis, and yellow fever, with measles cases rising by 20% in a year. Funding cuts to global health initiatives, misinformation campaigns, and ongoing humanitarian crises are exacerbating the problem, hindering efforts to vaccinate vulnerable children, especially in conflict-affected regions. Gavi is seeking significant funding to protect 500 million children and save millions of lives over the next few years, as the US President Donald Trump has drastically cut humanitarian aid to various agencies since taking office this year.</p>

          <p>Victims of serious crimes, including murder and stalking, are campaigning for a change in the justice system where perpetrators are restricted to specific zones after release from prison to ensure victim safety and freedom. They argue that current exclusion zones around victims' homes are insufficient and place undue restrictions on the victims themselves. While some experts raise concerns about potential breaches of perpetrators' human rights, victims' advocates insist the focus should shift to prioritizing the safety and well-being of those affected by violent crimes.</p>

Despite goals from Leon Draisaitl and Viktor Arvidsson for the Oilers, the Kings' strong offense and solid defense proved too much to overcome, as the series now shifts to Edmonton for Games 3 and 4.</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Frankel, a Harvard professor, analyzes various economic indicators to assess the probability of a U.S. recession, highlighting the unreliability of the inverted yield curve and the significance of consumer and business confidence surveys, which have shown recent declines. Prediction markets are pricing in a high chance of recession in the coming year, while real-time GDP estimates are also indicating a slowdown. Frankel concludes that based on current information, the odds of a U.S. recession are as high as 60% for the coming year, and even higher for the next four years.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military's campaign against Houthi attacks in the Red Sea is proving to be costly and potentially escalating into a wider conflict with Iran. Despite the military's efforts, regular traffic through the sea lane has not been restored, and the operation is consuming significant resources, including aircraft carrier strike groups and expensive munitions. A recent U.S. bombing of an oil terminal resulted in numerous casualties, and the Houthis have successfully shot down multiple U.S. drones, indicating that the U.S. has yet to establish air dominance.</p>

          <p>A recent Fox News poll indicates that President Trump's approval rating is declining, falling behind the approval ratings of his 21st-century predecessors at a similar point in their presidencies. The poll attributes this decline to economic issues, with only 38% of respondents approving of Trump's handling of the economy, and even lower approval ratings for his policies on inflation and tariffs. Other polls, such as those from Reuters/Ipsos and Pew, also show a drop in Trump's approval rating.</p>
