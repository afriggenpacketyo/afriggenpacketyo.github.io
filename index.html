          <p>The remote Heard and McDonald Islands, an uninhabited Australian territory, are unexpectedly included in President Trump's new tariff list.  The islands, home to a large penguin and seal population, haven't seen human visitors in almost a decade.  The inclusion highlights the broad scope of the tariffs and raises questions about their rationale, given the lack of significant exports from the islands.</p>
