          <p>This article examines Donald Trump's use of executive orders during his second term, noting their unprecedented volume and scope, with over a quarter facing legal challenges. It highlights how Trump's policies align with Project 2025, a conservative manifesto, and explores the legal avenues to overturn these orders, including intervention by Congress, the courts, and future presidents. The article suggests Trump's reliance on executive orders stems from personal preference and a desire for quick policy changes, even if their legality is questionable.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal party has won Canada's federal election, defeating Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre, though it remains unclear if they will secure a majority. The election was heavily influenced by Donald Trump's threats of tariffs and suggestions of annexing Canada, which boosted Carney's popularity and hurt the Conservatives. The New Democrats Party performed poorly, and their leader plans to step down. Carney called the snap election shortly after replacing Justin Trudeau to seek a stronger mandate.</p>

          <p>This article argues that the EU needs to shed its Eurocentric worldviews and double standards to become a credible global player, particularly in light of Donald Trump's disruptive policies. It suggests the EU has an opportunity to upgrade relations with the global south but must overhaul its old rules of engagement and address issues like racism and Islamophobia. The author emphasizes the need for the EU to listen more and lecture less to forge stronger partnerships.</p>

          <p>China's military is rapidly deploying low-cost, AI-powered drones, including a micro drone designed for infantry units. The micro drone features a coaxial dual-rotor system for superior lift, can carry up to three grenades, and uses AI-powered targeting. This expansion is part of a "phased leap" towards unmanned combat teams, which the PLA Daily describes as vital for gaining an edge in intelligent warfare.</p>
