        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Commission has fined Google €2.95 billion for violating competition laws by favoring its own advertising technology services. Regulators found that Google's "self-preferencing" practices harmed rival ad exchanges and publishers, leading to higher costs and reduced revenues. Google has stated it will appeal the decision, calling it "wrong" and arguing that its services are not anti-competitive. The EU has given the company 60 days to detail its corrective measures, warning that a failure to comply could result in structural remedies, such as selling parts of its ad tech business.</p>

          <p>Following the European Union's multi-billion euro fine against Google, former President Donald Trump has threatened to launch a trade investigation. Labeling the penalties against Google and Apple as "discriminatory," Trump stated he might use a Section 301 proceeding to nullify what he considers unfair charges against American companies. He argued that these fines divert money that would otherwise be invested in the U.S. economy and jobs. The statement escalates trade tensions between the U.S. and the EU over the regulation of major technology firms.</p>

          <p>U.S. immigration authorities have arrested nearly 500 people in a major workplace raid at a Hyundai electric vehicle factory in Georgia. A majority of those detained are South Korean nationals, prompting an expression of "concern and regret" from the South Korean government. Homeland Security officials described the operation as the culmination of a multi-month criminal investigation into unlawful employment practices, not simply an immigration sweep. The raid highlights a potential conflict between the administration's goals of boosting domestic manufacturing and enforcing strict immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The sudden resignation of Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Kugler has raised questions, compounded by a review of her real estate records showing inconsistencies about her primary residence. While Kugler attributed the discrepancy to a county error, the situation has drawn attention in the context of the Trump administration's pressure on the Federal Reserve. Her departure provides an opportunity for President Trump to appoint a successor, potentially shifting the balance on the board. The mystery deepens amid a separate campaign by a Trump ally to force another Fed governor, Lisa Cook, to resign over similar real estate allegations.</p>

          <p>Shares of Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, dropped significantly following reports that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to release a report linking the use of Tylenol during pregnancy to autism. The anticipated report has caused alarm in the financial and medical communities, despite Kenvue's insistence that no causal link exists. The Food and Drug Administration and major medical organizations have previously affirmed the safety of acetaminophen when used as directed during pregnancy. This development reflects a broader trend of the HHS under Kennedy challenging established medical consensus on various public health issues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage saw a significant drop, falling to its lowest point since October of the previous year. This decline, the largest in over a year, was a direct reaction to a weaker-than-expected August employment report, which eased concerns about inflationary pressures. For potential homebuyers, this rate reduction could translate into considerable monthly savings, potentially reigniting a housing market that has been sluggish. However, it remains uncertain if this drop will be substantial enough to overcome persistent affordability challenges and draw buyers back in large numbers. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts suggest the hostility stems from her influential position, her gender, and her strong, pro-Ukraine policies, which are seen as a direct challenge to the Kremlin.

This move is seen as an attempt to seize control of the political narrative and re-energize a government facing declining approval ratings and a resurgent Reform UK party.

The ruling noted that the time spent was not "excessive," the company had no clear policy against such use, and the business owner herself used a work computer for personal reasons.

          <p>Tensions have flared between Israel and Egypt, with Prime Minister Netanyahu's office accusing Egypt of "imprisoning" Gaza residents who wish to flee the war zone. This statement came in response to the Egyptian Foreign Minister reiterating that the displacement of Palestinians is a "red line" and accusing Israel of committing genocide. The diplomatic clash occurs as the Israeli military continues its offensive in Gaza City, urging residents to evacuate. Egypt, along with other regional actors, has strongly opposed any mass displacement, viewing it as an attempt to liquidate the Palestinian cause.</p>

          <p>President Trump has increased the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This move partially reverses the $10,000 cap instituted by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which had limited a previously unlimited deduction. The change is a significant win for taxpayers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California, who were disproportionately affected by the lower cap. However, critics point to the fiscal impact, with estimates suggesting the change will add over $142 billion to the national debt over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actions by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are dismantling the nation's centralized vaccine infrastructure, leading states like California, Washington, and Oregon to form their own coalitions to issue vaccine recommendations. Kennedy has dismissed the entire expert advisory committee (ACIP) and is reportedly stocking it with anti-vaccine figures, causing a loss of faith in the CDC's scientific credibility. Public health experts warn this is creating a state of "vaccine anarchy," where guidance will vary by state, potentially weakening national defense against infectious diseases.

          <p>President Donald Trump is planning to sign an executive order to rename the Department of Defense as the "Department of War," arguing the original name has a "stronger sound." The current name was adopted in 1947 when the departments of War and the Navy were unified, a move intended to integrate military planning and deter future conflicts in the nuclear age. Critics of the proposed change worry that it signals a more bellicose foreign policy. Some supporters argue it simply reflects the reality of the Pentagon's role over the past 80 years.</p>

A genealogist then identified McNulty, who died by suicide in 1997, as a potential suspect.
