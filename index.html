          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has strongly condemned reports of potential White House interference in the city's election, calling it a direct "affront to our democracy." The New York Times reported that President Trump's advisers discussed offering administration jobs to incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa. This move was allegedly intended to clear the political field and orchestrate a head-to-head race between Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani emphasized that such backroom deals undermine the principle that New Yorkers should choose their own leaders, while both the Adams and Sliwa campaigns publicly denied being contacted about any such offers.</p>

          <p>China's leading electric vehicle manufacturers, including prominent start-ups like Nio, Xpeng, and Zeekr, are under immense pressure to dramatically increase their delivery volumes to achieve their ambitious break-even targets by 2025. While these companies managed to narrow their financial losses in the second quarter, they are navigating a brutal price war in the world's largest auto market, which is severely squeezing their profit margins and making it difficult to secure fresh investment. For instance, Nio's CEO stated the company must double its second-quarter sales to deliver 50,000 vehicles per month to stay on track. Analysts warn that failure to control losses could lead to some firms being forced out of the highly competitive market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities in Argentina have successfully recovered "Portrait of a Lady," an 18th-century Italian painting by Giuseppe Ghislandi that was looted by the Nazis during World War II. The long-lost artwork, which had not been seen publicly for 80 years, was shockingly rediscovered after it appeared in an online real estate listing posted by the daughter of the Nazi officer accused of its theft. The painting originally belonged to the prominent Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker, whose heirs have been seeking to recover his extensive stolen collection for decades. The officer's daughter and her husband have since been placed under house arrest pending further investigation.</p>

          <p>The mother of Jocelyn Nungaray, a 12-year-old Houston girl allegedly murdered by two Venezuelan nationals, has voiced strong support for President Trump's military crackdown on narco-terrorist groups like Tren de Aragua (TdA). Alexis Nungary stated that the recent U.S. military strike against a TdA drug boat demonstrates real strength and that she hopes such actions continue until the groups are eliminated. The two men charged in her daughter's death were identified as illegal immigrants with alleged ties to the TdA gang who had been released into the U.S. earlier in the year under the previous administration's policies. Nungary credits the current administration with taking decisive action to improve citizen safety.</p>

The event, which President Trump confirmed he was watching, displayed futuristic weaponry and coincided with warming relations between China, Russia, and India, potentially as a response to Trump's disruptive "America first" trade policies. Analysts suggest that these tariff-driven policies, while intended to protect U.S. industry, may be inadvertently fostering new international alliances that challenge the existing American-backed global order. The display of military strength serves as a clear signal of China's rising influence on the world stage.</p>

Key indices in Japan, Australia, and South Korea all posted gains, buoyed by positive sentiment from the U.S. market. This optimism was largely fueled by a federal court decision in an Alphabet antitrust case, which suggested major tech companies could successfully weather regulatory threats. Despite the equity gains, underlying concerns about the broader global economy and persistent pressure on bond markets continue to create a cautious atmosphere among investors.

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has issued a ruling that blocks the Trump administration from utilizing the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. The administration had invoked the obscure wartime law by claiming that the influx of migrants associated with the Tren de Aragua gang constituted an "invasion or predatory incursion." The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected this argument, finding that the situation does not meet the legal definition of an invasion and that encouraging illegal entry is not equivalent to sending an armed force. This decision represents a significant legal setback for the administration's aggressive deportation strategy.</p>

This policy highlights the challenge local officials face in trying to stimulate spending while adhering to national anti-corruption campaigns that discourage extravagance.

The frozen funds support over 900 vital research projects, including studies on Alzheimer's, cancer, and heart disease.

An internal CDC document confirmed the appointments, which include a semi-retired transplant surgeon, an emergency medicine specialist, and a pediatric neurologist, among others. The restructuring of this key panel, which provides recommendations on vaccine use for the public, has been a central part of Kennedy's overhaul of federal health agencies.</p>

          <p>An Afghan family, including a father and his two younger children, is being held in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention, caught in a bureaucratic impasse between the United States and Canada. The family is eligible for asylum in Canada, where they have close relatives, but they can only make their claim at a land border crossing. However, U.S. officials will only release them if they can enter Canada by air, which requires a visa they do not have. Their lawyers argue this situation places them in an impossible limbo, facing potential deportation back to Afghanistan, where the father could be targeted by the Taliban for his past work with U.S. troops.</p>

          <p>In Vladivostok, a Russian port city over 4,000 miles from the front lines, the consequences of the war in Ukraine are deeply felt despite the physical distance. The city's cemeteries contain rows of fresh graves for soldiers killed in the conflict, and memorials to the "Special Military Operation" are prominent. The war has also reshaped lives in unexpected ways, such as for Dmitry Afanasyev, a soldier who lost his leg in a mine explosion and now trains with a local Para ice hockey team of fellow veterans. While daily life continues, conversations with residents reveal a mix of concern, resignation, and patriotic support for the government, illustrating the war's far-reaching impact across Russia.</p>

          <p>Parents and health charities in the UK are raising alarms about a lack of adequate services for children suffering from constipation, a condition that led to over 44,000 hospital admissions for those under 16 last year, a 10-year high. One mother described how her son's severe, untreated constipation was not taken seriously until he reached a crisis point, with a significant portion of his body weight estimated to be stool. Experts argue that a disparity in dedicated children's continence services across the country means many families cannot get the community-based help they need, leading to preventable hospitalizations. They call for the issue to be made a national health priority.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 270,000 Venezuelan migrants, ending their legal residency and work permits. This affects a group of Venezuelans covered by a TPS program established in 2021 by the previous administration. Homeland Security officials stated the program's continuation was not in the country's best interest, arguing it acts as a magnet for illegal immigration. Those who lose their status and have no other legal means to remain in the U.S. will face potential deportation and are being urged by the government to self-deport using a smartphone app. This action is the latest in a series of moves to revoke humanitarian protections for various immigrant groups.</p>

          <p>The public affairs network C-SPAN has reached agreements to be carried on two major streaming platforms, YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, significantly expanding its audience reach. This move comes after the nonprofit organization faced financial deficits due to the shrinking number of traditional pay-TV subscribers, which it relies on for licensing fees. The decline in revenue prompted the U.S. Senate to pass a resolution urging streaming services to carry the network, which provides unfiltered, gavel-to-gavel coverage of Congress.

          <p>An analysis piece from The Atlantic argues that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is taking a "victory lap" after a dramatic overhaul at the CDC, which has seen the ousting of its director and the resignation of senior leaders. Kennedy recently touted his response to a measles outbreak in Texas as a success, claiming his approach was guided by science and free from ideology. However, the article contends this is misleading, pointing out that the outbreak was the nation's worst since 1992 and that Kennedy undermined vaccination efforts by promoting unproven remedies. His recent firing and replacement of the CDC's vaccine advisory panel with contrarian figures further signals his success in reshaping the agency.</p>

For member states like Iran, which faces the threat of renewed international sanctions, integration into an alternative financial framework is viewed as essential for economic survival.
