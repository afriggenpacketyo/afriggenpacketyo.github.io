          <p>President Trump announced that the United States launched strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, citing it as a "spectacular military success." The strikes targeted Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, with the aim of destroying Iran's nuclear enrichment capabilities and preventing further nuclear threats. The president warned Iran to pursue peace or face more significant consequences, while also stating that all U.S. planes safely exited Iranian airspace. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to provide further details at a Pentagon briefing, marking a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran.</p>

          <p>Jon Jones has officially retired from UFC, leading to Tom Aspinall being upgraded to undisputed heavyweight champion. Dana White announced the decision after a UFC Fight Night in Azerbaijan, ending months of uncertainty in the heavyweight division. Aspinall, now the third Briton to become a UFC champion, expressed his eagerness to get the heavyweight division moving with an active champion. He is expected to defend his title this summer or early autumn, likely against number-one contender Ciryl Gane, as White has promised to make up for Aspinall's lost time and earnings during the uncertainty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The number of Turkish citizens obtaining German citizenship has doubled in 2024, making Turkey second only to Syria in this regard. This increase is attributed to factors like Germany's attractive living and working conditions, as well as recent citizenship reforms allowing dual citizenship. Many Turks seek German citizenship for practical reasons, such as easier bureaucracy and visa-free travel, while still maintaining ties to their home country. Political repression and economic challenges in Turkey have also contributed to this trend.</p>

It questions whether the strikes will be effective in ending Iran's nuclear program and explores potential consequences, including Iranian retaliation and the impact on nonproliferation efforts. The author suggests that Trump's actions may have been influenced by a desire to appear strong and decisive, potentially leading to a prolonged conflict. The analysis also considers the possibility of Iran resorting to asymmetric warfare and the challenges of containing the situation.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States has entered the war between Israel and Iran, with U.S. airstrikes targeting three key Iranian nuclear facilities. The strikes, which Trump described as a "spectacular military success," aim to destroy Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity and prevent further nuclear threats. The U.S. used B-2 stealth bombers and bunker-buster munitions in the operation, prompting concerns about escalating tensions and potential retaliation. The decision marks a significant shift from Trump's previous stance on avoiding involvement in Middle Eastern conflicts.</p>
