CBS News is providing a searchable version of this data, which DOGE refers to as the "Wall of Receipts," though the agency's methodology for calculating savings has been criticized by federal contracting experts. DOGE's valuation of contracts is based on total potential value rather than realistic spending estimates, and CBS News and other outlets have identified numerous errors in DOGE's accounting.

          <p>A 19-year-old former Michigan Army National Guard member, Ammar Abdulmajid-Mohamed Said, has been arrested for allegedly planning a mass shooting at a U.S. military base in Warren, Michigan, on behalf of ISIS. Said reportedly shared his plans with undercover officers, providing ammunition and instructions on how to enter the base and build Molotov cocktails. Officials arrested Said on the day of the planned attack after he launched a drone near the base. He faces charges of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and distributing information related to a destructive device, potentially leading to a 20-year prison sentence.</p>

          <p>Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced new measures to alleviate prison overcrowding in the UK, including limiting the time some offenders spend back in prison for breaching their licenses. Under the new plans, offenders recalled for minor breaches will be released after a fixed 28-day period, bypassing lengthy parole board assessments. Mahmood cautioned that building new prisons alone would not solve the crisis, and the changes will not apply to those who commit serious offenses or pose a high risk. The reforms aim to manage the prison population more effectively while prioritizing public safety.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Beginning Wednesday, shipments arriving in the United States from China and Hong Kong worth less than $800 now face 54 percent tariffs, a result of President Trump closing a loophole that allowed inexpensive Chinese goods to enter the U.S. without import duties. This change, described in a White House executive order, impacts Chinese companies like Shein and Temu, which built their businesses around this de minimis exemption. The tariffs are disrupting global trade, leading to fewer orders for Chinese factories and potential business closures, while also creating challenges for China's export-driven economic growth. It is likely that much of the extra cost resulting from the new tariffs will fall on shoppers.</p>

          <p>Credit card balances in the U.S. have decreased to $1.18 trillion in the first quarter of 2025, offering a slight reprieve for cardholders facing high interest rates. Experts recommend several strategies for reducing credit card debt, including negotiating debt settlements, consolidating multiple debts into a personal loan or home equity loan, and transferring balances to a 0% APR credit card. Credit counseling can also provide assistance in managing debt and lowering interest rates. The article emphasizes that the best approach is one that aligns with individual circumstances and can be consistently followed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>David H. Souter, who has died at 85, was appointed to the US Supreme Court in 1990 with the expectation he would be a reliable conservative vote, particularly on abortion rights. However, Souter often sided with the court's liberal justices, notably in the 1992 Planned Parenthood v Casey case, which preserved the right to abortion. This led to disillusionment among conservatives and prompted a focus on ideological purity in future Republican judicial nominees. Souter, a Harvard Law graduate and Rhodes scholar, served on the court until 2009, when he retired to allow Barack Obama to appoint a liberal successor.</p>

          <p>Nissan is set to reduce its global workforce by approximately 15%, or 20,000 employees, following a reported loss for the fiscal year, attributed to declining sales in China and other regions, as well as significant restructuring expenses. The Japanese automaker plans to decrease its number of auto plants from 17 to 10 as part of its recovery plan to align production with demand and enhance performance. CEO Ivan Espinosa emphasized the challenges ahead, stating the company aims to return to profitability by fiscal year 2026, while also noting the impact of President Trump's tariffs on auto imports.</p>

          <p>California's insurance regulator has approved State Farm's request for a 17% premium increase for homeowners to rebuild capital following the Los Angeles wildfires. The increase, impacting roughly 1 million homeowners, aims to prevent a financial crisis that could lead to policy drops. State Farm initially sought a 22% increase but revised it during hearings. The decision comes amid efforts to stabilize California's insurance market, with State Farm receiving a $400 million cash infusion and agreeing to halt some non-renewals. Consumer advocates criticize the decision, arguing it burdens consumers while delaying State Farm's justification of its financial condition.</p>

          <p>Massive federal layoffs, spearheaded by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), are forcing tough decisions on former federal employees and raising concerns about economic retrenchment. Hundreds of thousands of workers have lost their jobs, leading to yard sales, relocations, and a slowdown in real estate and hospitality sectors, particularly around Washington DC. Experts warn that these cuts, combined with tariffs and other economic factors, could trigger a recession, especially in regions heavily reliant on government jobs. Affected individuals express uncertainty about their future, struggling to find alternative employment that aligns with their expertise in fields like international development.</p>

          <p>A panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has restricted the enforcement of the Voting Rights Act in seven Midwestern states by ruling that private individuals and groups cannot sue under Section 2 of the Act using Section 1983. This decision reverses decades of precedent, limiting enforcement to the Justice Department, which has stepped away from some cases under the current administration. The ruling stems from a North Dakota redistricting lawsuit by Native American tribes, who argued that the state's legislative voting districts diluted their voting power.

          <p>The European Commission has proposed weakening environmental conditions tied to subsidies for farmers, aiming to alleviate administrative burdens and boost competitiveness. The proposal comes after months of farmer protests across the European Union over issues including EU regulations and cheap imports. The changes could save farmers up to ‚Ç¨1.58 billion per year and limit on-site checks on farms to once per year. Smaller farmers would be exempted from conditions tying subsidies to environmental regulations, while certified organic farms would be considered as automatically meeting certain environmental regulations.</p>

          <p>U.S. drug overdose deaths dropped sharply in 2024, with 30,000 fewer deaths compared to the previous year, marking the largest one-year decline ever recorded. Provisional CDC data indicates an estimated 80,000 overdose deaths last year, a 27% decrease from 110,000 in 2023. Experts attribute the decline to increased availability of naloxone, expanded addiction treatment, shifts in drug use patterns, and the impact of opioid lawsuit settlement money.
