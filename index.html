          <p>A veterinary hospital in Wilmington, North Carolina, exploded after a hit-and-run driver crashed into a gas line, rupturing it. The explosion occurred approximately 20 minutes after the initial crash while firefighters were inside searching the evacuated building. Three firefighters were hospitalized as a result of the blast, one with severe burns, though no veterinary staff or animals were harmed as the facility was not yet open. The driver, who appeared impaired, was later apprehended by police.</p>

The Department of Justice had sent letters to Boston and other cities, threatening legal action and loss of federal funds if they did not assist with federal immigration enforcement. Wu countered that Boston follows the law and criticized the administration for attacking cities to distract from its own failures.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to sign an executive order to end mail-in voting, a method he has long claimed, without evidence, is corrupt. This article examines the legality of such a move, clarifying that the U.S. Constitution gives state legislatures, not the president, the authority to determine the "times, places and manner" of holding elections. Legal experts assert that the president cannot unilaterally change state voting laws, making the proposed executive order constitutionally dubious.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced the discovery of a new, tiny moon orbiting the planet Uranus, provisionally designated S/2025 U1. The satellite, which measures approximately six miles in diameter, was identified using the James Webb Space Telescope. Its small size is likely why it was not detected by previous missions like Voyager 2. This finding brings the total number of known Uranian moons to 29 and suggests that more small satellites may be awaiting discovery around the ice giant.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that he is directing his lawyers to combat what he calls "woke" content in the nation's museums, including the Smithsonian Institution. He stated that the process will mirror the one used against colleges and universities, where his administration has threatened or withheld federal funding to force policy changes. Trump criticized museums for focusing on topics like slavery and called for them to promote a more positive and successful narrative of the country.</p>

The author posits that Vladimir Putin's apparent concessions are a delaying tactic and that Ukrainian society will reject any deal involving significant territorial losses. For the peace effort to succeed, the article argues, Trump must reinforce U.S. security commitments to Ukraine and maintain the threat of further sanctions on Russia.</p>
