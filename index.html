          <p>Israel attacked Iranian state television and warned Tehran residents to evacuate following accusations that Iran targeted civilians, escalating the conflict between the two nations. The Israeli strike on Iranian state TV disrupted a live broadcast, causing chaos in the studio. In response to the attacks, the U.S. State Department raised its travel advisory for Israel to the highest level, and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth directed the deployment of additional capabilities to the United States Central Command Area of Responsibility. The fighting led to the cancellation of talks on Iran's nuclear program, and Israel claims the strikes have significantly set back Iran's nuclear ambitions.</p>

          <p>G7 leaders issued a joint statement affirming support for Israel's right to self-defense and condemning Iran as the principal source of regional instability and terror. They called for de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza, emphasizing that Iran must never possess a nuclear weapon. The statement came as U.S. President Donald Trump cut short his attendance at the summit due to escalating tensions in the region. The G7 nations' stance contrasted with China's, which condemned Israel's attack on Iran while offering to play a peacemaking role.</p>

          <p>Gold has outperformed traditional safe-haven assets like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys, driven by concerns over fiscal sustainability and geopolitical instability. Experts at the Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference highlighted gold's appeal as it is not a liability of any government, unlike sovereign bonds and currencies. The dollar index has weakened, and U.S. Treasurys faced a sell-off after tariff rollouts and a credit rating downgrade, compromising their safe-haven status. Gold's demand has been fueled by uncertainty, particularly with developments in the Middle East, making it a sought-after asset.</p>

Meanwhile, the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran is also a major focus, with the Financial Times reporting Israel's claim of control over Tehran's airspace.

          <p>Prime Minister Starmer secured a tariffs deal with the US, announced alongside President Trump at the G7 summit. The agreement removes tariffs completely for the aerospace industry and imposes a 10% levy on the car industry, preventing significant job losses. While Britain is exempt from the global tariff of 50% on steel and aluminum, a 25% tariff remains due to technicalities regarding proof of UK-made steel. The deal also includes reciprocal access to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef being sold each way, ensuring British farmers can export beef to the US.</p>

          <p>China has hinted that its most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, may soon be commissioned based on new images and state media reports. Satellite images revealed 36 newly painted spaces on the flight deck for warplanes, indicating a higher capacity than Chinaâ€™s existing carriers. The new markings suggest that the Fujian is getting prepared to be commissioned, and it will then enter trial service to continue testing its adaptability and coordination with aircraft. The Fujian could formally enter service by the end of the year after further sea trials.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament are set to vote on decriminalizing abortion, with two Labour MPs proposing rival amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill.

Tonia Antoniazzi's amendment aims to prevent women from being investigated, arrested, or prosecuted for terminating their own pregnancies, while maintaining punishments for medical professionals and violent partners. The debate comes amid concerns about investigations into women who end their own pregnancies outside of the existing law.</p>

In 2024, over 140,000 older Americans were homeless, a number projected to triple by 2030, with factors such as death of a spouse, job loss, and medical issues contributing to the crisis. Many older homeless individuals lack health insurance and face complex chronic medical conditions, leading to high rates of hospitalization.

Approximately 4% of children in this age group have tried a nicotine pouch, prompting calls for the government to prioritize the Tobacco and Vapes Bill to ban their marketing and sale to under 18s. Nicotine pouches are small, tea-bag-like rectangles that release nicotine into the bloodstream and are considered less harmful than smoking, but are highly addictive and not recommended for teenagers or non-smokers.</p>
