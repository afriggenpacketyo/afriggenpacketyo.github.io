          <p>Paramount has agreed to a $16 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump concerning a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris. The funds will be allocated to Trump's future presidential library and legal fees, with no direct payment to Trump or his co-plaintiff. The settlement does not include an apology from Paramount, but the company has agreed to release transcripts of future interviews with presidential candidates. The lawsuit, widely seen by legal experts as an attack on the First Amendment, was settled amid departures of key CBS executives and ongoing FCC review of the Paramount-Skydance merger.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Oliver "Ollie" Tarvet, ranked 733rd in the world, is set to play defending champion Carlos Alcaraz on Wimbledon's Centre Court after a successful debut. The 21-year-old US college student has captured public attention with his underdog run through the qualifying rounds and a first-round victory. Despite the monumental challenge, Tarvet expresses quiet confidence, focusing on "playing the ball, not the player," and viewing the match as an opportunity rather than just an experience. His journey highlights a growing trend of British players developing their skills through the competitive American college tennis system before turning professional.</p>

          <p>At least 180 current and former UK armed forces aircrew are pursuing legal action against the Ministry of Defence, claiming their cancer diagnoses were caused by exposure to toxic fumes in military helicopters. The claims relate to aircraft like the Sea King, Puma, and Chinook, with diagnoses including rare blood, lung, and testicular cancers. The case of RAF flight sergeant Zach Stubbings, who died at 47, is highlighted as one of six who received an out-of-court settlement, though the MoD has not admitted liability. Veterans' groups are now urging the MoD to implement cancer screening programs and raise awareness among service members.</p>

          <p>President Trump's extensive legislative package, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill," has passed the House Rules Committee, setting it up for a full chamber vote. The more than 900-page bill, which combines Trump's priorities on taxes, border security, and defense, faced opposition from two conservative Republicans and all Democrats on the panel. Democrats criticized the measure for extending 2017 tax cuts, which they argue primarily benefits the wealthy and adds trillions to the national debt. Republicans defended the bill, highlighting provisions like tax deductions for tipped wages and an increased child tax credit as direct relief for working-class families.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new G7 agreement that exempts American companies from the global minimum tax rules established under the OECD's Pillar Two framework is drawing sharp criticism. Authored by prominent economists, this article argues this decision undermines years of international efforts to curb corporate tax avoidance and creates an unfair advantage for U.S. multinationals. The move is seen as a capitulation to pressure from the Trump administration, effectively gutting a deal meant to stop a "race to the bottom" on corporate tax rates. The authors contend this harms developing nations and citizens of G7 countries, urging for a stronger, UN-led international tax system. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that individuals diagnosed with psychopathy exhibit shared structural differences in their brains compared to the general population. Researchers found that men with high scores for impulsive and antisocial behavior had significant volume reductions in brain regions associated with behavioral control, emotional processing, and decision-making, such as the pons and thalamus. On average, the brains of psychopathic subjects were found to be about 1.45 percent smaller than those of the control group. These neurological findings could provide a crucial basis for better understanding the biological underpinnings of psychopathy and potentially developing future treatments for the personality disorder.</p>

The threat comes after a 90-day pause on broader global tariffs, which Trump says he is not planning to extend. The president also expressed doubt that a deal with Tokyo could be reached, specifically criticizing Japan over its policies on U.S. rice imports, while Japan's government has stated it will not make concessions that harm its agricultural sector.

          <p>Jared Wise, a former FBI agent who was facing trial for his role in the January 6 Capitol riot before being pardoned by President Trump, is now serving in the Department of Justice. Sources confirm Wise has been appointed as an investigator and counselor within the "Weaponization Working Group." During the riot, prosecutors alleged that Wise encouraged rioters to attack police and unlawfully entered the Capitol building. His appointment places him as an advisor to Ed Martin, the former interim D.C. U.S. Attorney whose own permanent nomination was previously rejected by Republican senators over his advocacy for Jan. 6 rioters.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters, including nurses and healthcare advocates, gathered outside the office of Republican Rep. Young Kim to oppose her support for President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill." The legislation, which narrowly passed the Senate, proposes significant cuts to federal programs like Medicaid while extending tax cuts. Critics at the protest labeled the bill "harmful" and "cruel," highlighting that over one-fifth of Kim's constituents rely on Medicaid. The demonstration underscores the deep divisions over the bill, which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates would cause nearly 12 million Americans to lose health insurance and add trillions to the national deficit.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants living in the U.S. The administration had planned to revoke their legal status and work permits in September, years ahead of a previously established 2026 deadline. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan determined that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation in this manner. The ruling prevents the immediate threat of deportation for hundreds of thousands who have established lives in the U.S., though the White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

The move is also reportedly based on concerns that U.S. military stockpiles of certain munitions have fallen too low. While the specific systems were not officially named, reports suggest air defense missiles and precision munitions are affected. This development represents a significant shift in U.S. policy and comes as Russia intensifies its aerial attacks on Ukraine.

The proposed shift would involve halting the marketing of its 18A chipmaking process to external customers, a technology that has cost billions to develop and faced delays. Instead, the company may focus its resources on the next-generation 14A process, where it believes it can better compete with rival TSMC for major clients like Apple and Nvidia. This potential pivot, which could result in a substantial financial write-off, is being considered to revive the struggling U.S. chipmaker. (not investment advice)</p>

The chaotic episode has weakened the Prime Minister, drawing comparisons to the most fraught moments of previous, less stable governments.
