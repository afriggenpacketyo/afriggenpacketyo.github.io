          <p>India announced that its armed forces conducted strikes against Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, targeting what it described as "terrorist infrastructure" in response to a militant attack in Pahalgam. The Indian Ministry of Defence stated that the actions were focused, measured, and non-escalatory, with no Pakistani military facilities targeted. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the strikes as an act of war, while the country's foreign ministry reported that the Indian Air Force carried out the strikes from within Indian airspace. International reactions included calls for restraint and de-escalation from the United Nations and the United States. Optimism Score: 20</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to transport a group of immigrants to Libya on a U.S. military plane, marking an escalation in its deportation program, according to U.S. officials.

Atkinson highlighted specific plays where he felt the Pacers' actions were excessive and resulted in non-calls that contributed to the injuries. Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle defended his team, stating that Atkinson was merely protecting his players and that disagreements are common in heated playoff series.

          <p>A plant in China's Shanxi province is being upgraded with French technology that will enable it to produce aluminum from low-grade ore previously unusable. The technology, developed by French chemist Yves Ocello from IB2, neutralizes silica and sulfur in low-grade bauxite, allowing it to be refined using the Bayer process. In 2023, IB2 signed a 22-year agreement with Chinese firm Liulin Senze Coal & Aluminum to implement the technology. This development aligns with Beijing's plan for a greener aluminum industry and could reduce China's reliance on imported aluminum ore. Optimism Score: 75</p>
