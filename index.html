          <h2>Trump Administration to Seek Release of Epstein Grand Jury Records</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 23:31:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to request the unsealing of grand jury testimony related to Jeffrey Epstein, a move that requires court approval. This follows pressure on the administration to disclose more information and comes amid criticism from some of his own supporters over the handling of the Epstein files. The action is unusual for a sitting president, and legal experts note the process could be lengthy and face objections from various parties involved in the original case. The scope of the potential release is currently unknown.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate slowed to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, aligning with economists' expectations. The easing was partly attributed to a drop in rice prices after the government released stockpiles, though inflation remains above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the 39th consecutive month. Despite this, economists express concern over persistent inflationary pressures and the potential impact of U.S. tariffs, which could hinder economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," questioning CBS's stated "purely financial" reasoning. It posits the decision may be part of a pattern of capitulation to President Trump, given Colbert's role as a prominent critic and the network's recent settlement of a lawsuit filed by Trump. The piece contextualizes the move within the pending Skydance-Paramount merger and a series of other network decisions that appear to appease the administration, suggesting a sacrifice of journalistic and editorial independence.</p>

          <p>Fox News host Jesse Watters acknowledged on-air that his program made a mistake in its reporting about a phone call between California Governor Gavin Newsom and President Trump. The admission follows a $787-million defamation lawsuit filed by Newsom, who alleged Watters' show distorted the timeline of the call to falsely claim the governor had lied. While Watters stated "I'm sorry," he maintained a snarky tone, claiming Newsom's social media post was "confusing and unclear." Newsom's office indicated the lawsuit will proceed.</p>

          <p>Veteran MP Diane Abbott has been suspended from the Labour Party after stating in a BBC interview that she did not regret comments she made in 2023 about racism. The original comments, which led to a previous year-long suspension, appeared to downplay antisemitism by comparing it to prejudice against redheads. In the new interview, Abbott reiterated her view that racism based on skin color is distinct from other forms of prejudice, prompting the party to launch another investigation and remove the whip.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to sue The Wall Street Journal, its parent company News Corp, and Rupert Murdoch over an article about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. The report claims that a 2003 birthday book for Epstein contained a letter signed by Trump that included a crude drawing and a joking reference to "secrets." Trump vehemently denied the story on Truth Social, calling the letter a "FAKE" and asserting the newspaper was warned against publishing the "false, malicious, and defamatory" story.</p>

The Federal Reserve is designed to operate independently to manage monetary policy, with a dual mandate of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices. While a president firing a Fed chair is legally untested and could destabilize markets, Trump continues to publicly pressure the institution.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Colchester, Essex, has fully immersed himself in the culture and style of the 1940s, an era he fell in love with after learning about the World Wars. The teenager, named Lincoln, dresses exclusively in period clothing, listens to music from the time, and even cycles on a 1939 bike. His passion extends to his job at a 1940s-themed tea room and his desire to remember the sacrifices of the wartime generation, expressing a belief that people today should show more care for that history.</p>

          <p>Relentless immigration raids under the Trump administration have profoundly impacted life in Southern California, home to an estimated 1.4 million undocumented immigrants. The crackdowns have forced many into hiding, afraid to work or go to school, leading to deserted public spaces and canceled community events. While the administration highlights the arrest of serious criminals, the operations have also swept up long-term residents with no criminal records, sparking a fierce backlash from activists and community members who accuse the government of instilling terror and disrupting the regional economy.</p>

          <p>An ice core, potentially the oldest ever recovered at 1.5 million years old, has been transported from Antarctica to a specialized lab in the UK. Scientists at the British Antarctic Survey will melt the ice to analyze its contents, including trapped dust, ash, and ancient air bubbles. This research aims to unlock crucial information about Earth's climate history from a previously unknown period, particularly a mysterious shift in glacial cycles. The findings could revolutionize our understanding of climate change and help predict how the planet will respond to current warming.</p>

          <p>New UK regulations coming into force next July will require "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) providers like Klarna and Clearpay to conduct stricter affordability checks on shoppers. The move, overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority, aims to protect consumers from accumulating excessive debt and will bring the largely unregulated sector in line with other forms of credit. As a result, some shoppers may be refused credit, and users will gain rights to complain to the Financial Ombudsman and receive clearer information on terms and fees.</p>

A physician's note confirmed the diagnosis, adding there was no evidence of more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis, and reiterated that the 79-year-old president remains in "excellent health."</p>

This practice has drawn alarm from human rights groups, given Eswatini's own poor human rights record, which includes reports of torture and extrajudicial killings.

          <p>This political analysis argues that the Labour Party had little choice but to suspend MP Diane Abbott again to maintain consistency in its stance against antisemitism. Abbott's recent statement that she did not regret the 2023 comments that led to her first suspension—in which she appeared to downplay antisemitism—forced the party's hand. Given leader Keir Starmer's pledge to eradicate antisemitism from the party after the Corbyn era, any perceived leniency would have undermined his leadership, making the suspension a politically necessary, if difficult, decision.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced it will cancel "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in May 2026, ending the franchise after more than three decades on the air. The network cited the move as a "purely financial decision" due to a challenging advertising market and a dramatic shift in how younger audiences consume media, preferring short clips online over traditional late-night shows. Despite being the top-rated late-night broadcast show for nine seasons, the program was reportedly losing money. Colbert, who was informed of the decision recently, will not be replaced.</p>
