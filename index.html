          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to temporarily suspend most tariffs on each other's goods, signaling a significant thawing of trade tensions between the world's two largest economies. Reciprocal tariffs will be reduced from 125% to 10%, although the U.S.' 20% duties on Chinese imports related to fentanyl will remain, bringing total tariffs on China to 30%. This breakthrough follows high-stakes talks in Switzerland, with both sides committing to further discussions on economic and trade policy. The pause, set to begin Wednesday, aims to foster a more positive environment for ongoing negotiations. Optimism in the market has followed this news.</p>

          <p>Crude oil futures experienced a 4% jump on Monday, fueled by optimism that a temporary U.S.-China trade agreement will spur economic growth. The agreement involves slashing tariff rates by 115% for 90 days as both nations continue negotiations. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent anticipates further meetings to achieve a more comprehensive agreement, signaling a positive outlook for future trade relations. This surge comes after oil prices had plummeted to a four-year low due to concerns over President Trump's global tariff regime and increased OPEC+ supply.</p>

          <p>As President Trump visits the Middle East, his administration is expected to leverage America's dominance in artificial intelligence chips to secure strategic bonds with oil-rich governments. Countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the U.A.E. are eager to invest billions in data centers but require U.S. approval to purchase American-designed AI chips. While the Biden administration had been cautious about such sales, the Trump administration appears more willing to use AI chips as a bargaining chip in trade talks and other negotiations. The article highlights the potential for significant deals involving companies like Nvidia, AMD, Microsoft, Google, and OpenAI during the trip.</p>

This incident could jeopardize the ongoing detente between Beijing and Delhi, which have been working to restore relations after a military standoff.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's budget proposal seeks to significantly increase funding for Homeland Security and the Department of Defense while cutting $163 billion from social programs, impacting education, housing, and health. The cuts primarily target programs assisting lower-income Americans, such as youth job training and Federal Work-Study, while avoiding major overhauls to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The proposal aims to change how aid is distributed, notably by reducing funding for rental assistance programs and converting them into block grants, potentially diverting funds away from direct assistance to renters. This approach mirrors welfare reform in the 1990s, which saw states redirect funds from basic cash assistance.</p>

The recent agreement involves both countries lowering their baseline tariff rate by 115 percentage points to 10%, with the U.S. maintaining a 20% fentanyl-related tariff, resulting in a 30% rate on most Chinese goods. Bessent also highlighted a "very long and in-depth sidebar" regarding fentanyl, indicating China's commitment to assisting the U.S. in stopping the flow of precursor drugs.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has announced its long-awaited immigration plans, aiming for a "controlled, selective, and fair" system. Key measures include tightening work visa requirements by generally requiring a degree-level qualification, doubling the residency period for indefinite stay applications to 10 years, and scrapping the dedicated visa for social care providers. At the same time, the government says it wants to expand eligibility for the existing "high potential individual" visa, by doubling the number of universities from which applicants can hold a qualifying degree. The party aims to reduce net migration without setting an overall cap, focusing on stricter rules for students and higher English language requirements.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' trial for sex trafficking and racketeering is set to begin, with the hip-hop mogul accused of running a criminal enterprise that manipulated women into commercial sex acts. The first week of the trial is expected to include testimony from an FBI analyst, a male escort, and singer Cassie Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend. Ventura, who accused Combs of sexual assault and physical abuse, is a key figure in the case, with security video of Combs attacking her in a hotel hallway expected to be a crucial piece of evidence. Combs has denied all allegations through his lawyers.</p>

          <p>The White House is in discussions with the Qatari royal family to potentially receive a luxury jumbo jet for use as Air Force One.
