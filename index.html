          <p>Following a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Trump suggested that both Ukraine and Russia should declare victory in the ongoing conflict, leaving the ultimate judgment to history. During their discussions, the leaders opted not to publicly address the potential supply of U.S. long-range weapons, such as Tomahawks, to avoid further escalation. Trump had previously expressed interest in exchanging Tomahawks for Ukrainian drones and indicated plans for an upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin to broker a peace deal. Zelenskyy, while acknowledging a Middle East ceasefire, conveyed skepticism about Putin's readiness to end the war with Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Richard Kenneth Djerf, 55, was executed by lethal injection in Arizona for the 1993 murders of four members of the Luna family in Phoenix. Djerf, who spent over 29 years on death row, declined clemency for the revenge killings, which included sexually assaulting and slashing the throat of Rochelle Luna, beating and stabbing Albert Luna Sr., and fatally shooting Patricia and Damien Luna. Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes emphasized that the victims deserved justice and closure, while the execution process itself faced scrutiny over the time taken to insert IV lines. This marked Arizona's second execution this year and the 39th nationally.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced the commutation of former New York Congressman George Santos' prison sentence for fraud, asserting that Santos was "horribly mistreated" in prison and should be released immediately. Santos had commenced a more than seven-year sentence in federal prison in New Jersey on July 25 after pleading guilty to wire fraud and identity theft charges. This presidential action intervenes in a prominent legal case, drawing immediate attention to the executive's power regarding judicial outcomes. The decision has sparked various reactions across the political spectrum regarding justice and executive clemency, highlighting ongoing debates about the fairness of the legal system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent "shock tactics," including blame games, tit-for-tat threats, and fluctuating tariff swings between the U.S. and China, are raising concerns about the prospects of ending their trade war. Analysts and former government officials attribute this escalating tension to a disregard for established diplomatic norms, with both nations reportedly misinterpreting each other's intentions and reactions. The current cycle of escalation was initiated by Beijing's expanded export controls on strategic rare earth minerals, which followed Washington's increased sanctions on blacklisted firms. Experts warn that this persistent lack of clear communication is significantly hindering any potential for resolution.</p>

          <p>President Trump confirmed reports that Venezuelan officials offered significant stakes in their country's oil and natural resources to ease U.S. sanctions, stating that President Nicolás Maduro "has offered everything" because "he doesn't want to f*** around with the United States." These remarks were made during a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, shortly after Trump acknowledged authorizing covert CIA operations in Venezuela, citing concerns about drug trafficking and the release of prisoners into the U.S. The U.S. has also conducted deadly strikes off Venezuela's coast against suspected drug trafficking vessels, intensifying pressure on the Maduro government and highlighting a confrontational foreign policy stance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to permit the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, following lower court decisions that blocked the action. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that these troops are essential in the Chicago area to safeguard federal agents from "ongoing and intolerable risks to their lives and safety." President Trump has consistently characterized Chicago and several other Democratic-led cities as lawless, advocating for military intervention to quell protests and protect federal immigration facilities. This appeal highlights a significant federal-state conflict over authority regarding public order and the use of military forces domestically.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have reduced a felony charge to a misdemeanor against David Huerta, president of Service Employees International Union California, who was arrested for obstructing federal agents during immigration raids in Los Angeles. Initially accused of felony conspiracy to impede an officer, he now faces a lesser charge of "obstruction resistance or opposition of a federal officer," carrying a maximum one-year prison sentence. Huerta's attorneys assert he is being targeted for his lifelong advocacy for workers and outspoken criticism of immigration policies, claiming his actions were an exercise of First Amendment rights. The case underscores persistent tensions between immigration enforcement, civil liberties, and the right to protest in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals "exciting results" for the Galleri blood test, capable of detecting over 50 types of cancer, many of which currently lack existing screening programs. Trials in North America involving 25,000 adults demonstrated that the test identified more than half of confirmed cancers at an early, more treatable stage, and correctly ruled out cancer in over 99% of negative cases. The test works by detecting cancerous DNA fragments in the blood and accurately identified the origin of cancer in 9 out of 10 cases. While these results are impressive, scientists emphasize the need for further randomized studies to definitively confirm if earlier detection translates into reduced cancer deaths, with NHS trials in England anticipated next year.</p>

Royal sources indicated a "tipping point" had been reached, as his ongoing scandals continued to overshadow the work and reputation of the wider Royal Family.

          <p>President Trump expressed interest in a Russian proposal for Elon Musk's Boring Company to construct an undersea rail tunnel through the Bering Strait, connecting Russia and Alaska. Russian investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev suggested the project, estimated at $65 billion but potentially reduced to $8 billion by Boring Company technology, would symbolize unity between the nations. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, however, reacted negatively to the idea. This pitch follows a recent call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss possible resolutions to the Ukraine War, with high-level advisors set to meet before a future Trump-Putin summit in Budapest.</p>

          <p>CBS News has ended its over 60-year presence at the Pentagon, closing its workspace after declining to sign new press requirements that many news organizations, including nearly every major outlet, view as infringing on First Amendment rights. The Pentagon's new policy mandates formal authorization to publish even unclassified information, aiming to control press leaks. Veteran CBS News correspondent David Martin, who covered the Pentagon for 40 years, emphasized the critical importance of physical presence for building trust and breaking stories. This move, which impacts other major news outlets and their ability to report directly from the Defense Department, raises significant concerns about press freedom and government transparency.</p>

          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has apologized for his controversial comments suggesting President Trump should deploy the National Guard to San Francisco to address crime. His initial remarks, made to The New York Times, sparked immediate backlash from local politicians and prominent Silicon Valley figures, including investor Ron Conway, who resigned from the Salesforce Foundation board citing misaligned values. Benioff clarified on X that he no longer believes the National Guard is needed, attributing his earlier comment to "an abundance of caution" for the Dreamforce conference. The incident highlights significant political divisions, ongoing debates over urban safety, and the contentious issue of federal intervention in local matters.</p>

          <p>President Trump claimed Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro offered "everything" to ease U.S. tensions, using an expletive to emphasize Maduro's perceived reluctance to challenge the United States. This assertion follows reports that Maduro offered stakes in Venezuela’s oil and other mineral wealth to stave off mounting U.S. pressure. The article also details a recent U.S. military strike on a suspected "drug-carrying submarine" off Venezuela, which for the first time yielded two survivors—a first in a series of deadly strikes that have killed at least 27 people. Human rights experts criticize these strikes as illegal and amounting to extrajudicial executions, raising serious concerns about adherence to international law.</p>

These digital prints, created starting in 2011 after Hockney relocated from Beverly Hills to Bridlington, depict the picturesque Yorkshire Wolds and were conceived when traditional plein air painting proved challenging in winter conditions. The sale, which more than doubled the collection's initial estimate, marked the largest group of Hockney's innovative iPad drawings to enter the market. The full series was previously unveiled as part of a major exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts in 2012, solidifying their artistic significance.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a freeze on an additional $11 billion worth of infrastructure projects in Democratic-led states, attributing the action to the ongoing government shutdown. White House budget director Russell Vought stated that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers would pause "low priority" projects in cities such as New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Baltimore, with the possibility of eventual cancellation. This action follows an earlier freeze of $28 billion in transportation and energy projects, intensifying pressure on Congress to end the shutdown. The administration explicitly targets states that voted against Trump and "sanctuary jurisdictions," highlighting a politically motivated use of federal funding to inflict pain on political opposition.</p>

Jack in the Box plans to use the proceeds from the sale to pay down debt as part of its "Jack on Track" revamp strategy, aimed at strengthening its balance sheet and lightening its asset load. Del Taco has recently faced challenges, including the temporary closure of numerous Colorado locations. Yadav Enterprises, already a major franchisee for various brands, will now take over the Mexican fast-food chain. (not investment advice)</p>

This update expands existing restrictions, now hiding posts on "certain risky stunts" and "strong language" from teens' recommendations. While Meta states this reassures parents by offering an easily understood guideline, content moderation experts express skepticism. They call the PG-13 label simplistic and worry it could inadvertently stifle creative expression and valuable discussions for older teens. The move signifies Instagram's evolving approach to content moderation, raising questions about context-sensitive filtering in the age of AI.</p>

While Oracle announced new cloud deals with Meta and substantial commitments, analysts like RBC Capital Markets' Rishi Jaluria suggested the stock might pause as investors assess the achievability of these lofty figures.

          <p>The remnant of Typhoon Halong caused widespread devastation across Western Alaska's Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, bringing hurricane-force winds and record flooding to numerous Alaska Native villages. The storm displaced over a thousand people, destroying homes, uprooting boardwalks, and resulting in at least one fatality and two missing individuals. Coastal villages like Kipnuk and Kwigillingok were severely impacted, requiring near-total evacuation. The remoteness of the region, with damaged runways and limited infrastructure, significantly complicated rescue efforts. This event underscores the region's extreme vulnerability to climate change, with thawing permafrost and low-lying terrain exacerbating storm-driven erosion and flood damage, posing long-term relocation challenges for indigenous communities.</p>
