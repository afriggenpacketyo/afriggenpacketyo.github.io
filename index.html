          <p>This article highlights the pervasive issue of unexploded bombs and ordnance from past conflicts across the globe. In Cologne, Germany, the defusing of three WWII bombs led to a large-scale evacuation, disrupting daily life and weddings. The problem extends far beyond Germany, affecting countries like Vietnam, Laos, Ukraine, and Gaza, where unexploded ordnance continues to cause fatalities and hinder economic development. The article underscores the immense logistical and financial challenges associated with ordnance disposal, as well as the evolving technologies used to mitigate the risks, and the defusing of bombs in Cologne serves as a stark reminder of war's enduring destructive legacy.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to raise tariffs on aluminum and steel to 50% is expected to increase costs for various consumer products. Industries such as automobile manufacturing, sports equipment, and canned goods may face higher expenses, potentially leading to price increases for consumers. While some businesses might absorb these costs, others are likely to pass them on to customers, impacting affordability. Experts warn that these tariffs could hurt industries relying on these metals and pressure consumers through higher prices (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new study using artificial intelligence (AI) suggests that some Dead Sea Scrolls may be older than previously believed. The AI program, trained to analyze handwriting styles, cross-referenced data with radiocarbon dating to estimate the age of ancient texts more accurately.

          <p>According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), President Trump's proposed tariff plan would reduce deficits by $2.8 trillion over a decade but would also shrink the economy, increase inflation, and reduce household purchasing power.

The tariffs would also reduce the rate of the gross domestic product by 0.06 percentage points per year (not investment advice).</p>
