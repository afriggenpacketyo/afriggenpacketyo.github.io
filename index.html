            <p>Sami Sheen, Charlie Sheen's daughter, publicly addressed the reasons behind their estrangement, citing his past struggles with drug addiction as a significant factor. In a TikTok video, Sami used audio from a 2011 interview with her father to illustrate the issues she has with him. Sami revealed that they haven't spoken on the phone in almost a year and haven't texted in over six months, expressing uncertainty about his sobriety. Denise Richards, Sami's mother, admitted to shielding her daughters from Sheen's behavior to preserve their relationship with him.</p>

            <p>The Texas House has approved a controversial bill that would allocate public funds for eligible families to use towards private school tuition, following nearly 11 hours of debate. The bill proposes providing $10,000 annually to students attending private schools, with increased amounts for disabled and home-schooled students. Republican leaders, including Governor Greg Abbott, hailed the bill as a victory for parental choice, while Democrats criticized it as "welfare for the rich" that could harm public school funding. The bill now moves to the Texas Senate for further consideration.</p>

            <p>Both Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating a 30-hour "Easter truce" that was announced by Vladimir Putin. Volodymyr Zelensky claimed Russian troops had violated the ceasefire "more than 2,000 times" since the start of Sunday. Russia's defence ministry said it had "repelled" assaults by Ukraine and accused Kyiv of launching hundreds of drones and shells. Despite the agreed-upon ceasefire, both sides reported continued attacks and shelling, raising doubts about the prospects for a lasting peace. US President Donald Trump said that "hopefully Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week", without giving further details.</p>

            <p>Senator Amy Klobuchar has called for the Supreme Court to hold Trump administration officials in contempt for ignoring a court order related to the deportation of Kilmar Ábrego García. She argued that the US is nearing a constitutional crisis, highlighting the importance of the courts and Congress standing up for democracy. Klobuchar suggested appointing a special prosecutor to charge officials responsible for the deportation or for refusing to facilitate Ábrego García’s return. The comments follow a dissenting opinion from Justice Samuel Alito regarding a decision to block deportations of Venezuelans.</p>

            <p>An Israel Defense Forces (IDF) inquiry has found that "professional failures" led to the killing of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month. The investigation cited an "operational misunderstanding" and a "breach of orders" as contributing factors. The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed, and another commanding officer will receive a reprimand. However, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has dismissed the report as invalid, arguing that it shifts responsibility to a personal error rather than addressing systemic issues. The incident occurred on March 23 when a convoy of ambulances and a UN vehicle came under fire by the Israeli military.</p>

            <p>The stock market is experiencing volatility due to concerns about tariffs and comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Nvidia's stock drop also pressured the market. The biggest gainer last week was Eli Lilly due to a successful trial for a Type 2 diabetes drug. This week, Jim Cramer retired his "own it, don't trade it" mantra for both Nvidia and Apple, given the realities of Trump's trade war with China.

Of the moves against colleges, Healey said: “It’s bad for patients, it’s bad for science, and it’s really bad for American competitiveness.
