          <p>Lee Jae-myung of South Korea's Democratic Party has begun his five-year presidential term, succeeding Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted after imposing martial law. Lee narrowly defeated Yoon in 2022 and has pledged to tighten martial law legislation and boost the economy. He aims to strengthen ties with the United States and Japan to counter North Korea, while also seeking improved relations with China and Russia. Lee's victory comes after Yoon's impeachment and subsequent removal from office by the Constitutional Court, marking a significant shift in South Korean politics, and he is expected to navigate complex trade negotiations with the U.S. The Kospi index experienced a surge following Lee's election, indicating positive market sentiment. </p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass will not testify in a federal court hearing concerning the city's homelessness programs, which could have determined whether the city's homelessness programs are placed in receivership. The L.A. Alliance for Human Rights withdrew subpoenas issued to Bass and two City Councilmembers, citing potential delays caused by legal challenges. The alliance sued the city in 2020 over its response to the homelessness crisis, arguing the city has failed to meet the milestones of a settlement agreement requiring the provision of 12,915 beds by June 2027, and the city contends that it intends to comply by the deadline. The city's lawyers argued that the milestones are not mandatory and that the alliance is ignoring the terms of the agreement.</p>

          <p>U.S. immigration authorities have detained the family of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who is accused of attacking a Colorado rally for Israeli hostages using a flamethrower. Soliman, an Egyptian national, was in the U.S. on an expired tourist visa and had applied for asylum in 2022. The Trump administration has seized on Soliman’s immigration status to push its mass deportation agenda, and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced that immigration agents were taking Soliman’s wife and five children into custody. Republicans have politicized the events, blaming Democrats for the attempted murders, and Soliman faces numerous state and federal charges, including attempted murder and a federal hate crime charge.</p>

          <p>Dawn Staley, the head coach of the South Carolina women's basketball team, disclosed in her new book that Alabama offered her a coaching position in 2005, which she declined. Staley, who was coaching at Temple University at the time, visited the campus and liked the athletic director but felt that South Carolina was a better fit for her family and career. She was drawn to the SEC's storied legacy in women's basketball and the opportunity to compete with legendary coaches. Staley has since become a beloved figure in Columbia, South Carolina, with the city recently unveiling a statue in her honor.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has rescinded the Biden-era guidance that used the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) to require hospitals to perform abortions in emergency situations. The 2022 guidance stated that doctors must perform abortions in emergency departments, even in states where the procedure is illegal, if it serves as a stabilizing medical treatment. HHS and CMS rescinded the guidance, stating that they "do not reflect the policy of this Administration," and abortion rights groups have criticized the move. A federal appeals court previously ruled that Texas hospitals and doctors are not required to perform emergency abortions despite the guidance.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is moving to the Senate after passing the House, drawing criticism for potentially rolling back aspects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Critics argue the bill would lead to millions losing Medicaid coverage and make ACA health plan enrollment more difficult. Republicans, however, claim it targets waste and fraud in government health programs, and Democrats frame it as an assault on healthcare. The bill is projected to leave nearly 9 million more people without health insurance by 2034, and it includes changes to ACA enrollment processes and Medicaid eligibility requirements.

          <p>Controversies are emerging in sports as athletes push boundaries with new technologies and techniques, sparking debate over fairness and tradition. Recently, climbers used xenon gas to rapidly acclimatize to Mount Everest's altitude, while a runner aims to break the four-minute mile with advanced support. Critics argue that these innovations create unfair advantages and undermine the spirit of competition. Historical examples, like the use of oxygen on Everest and paced runs, show how perceptions of acceptable innovation evolve over time, but this is an opinion piece and it does not appear to be based on the author's speculation but instead on the author's summary of a range of different arguments and observations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed an interim step in Iran nuclear talks that would allow Iran to continue enriching uranium at low levels. This would occur while a broader arrangement is worked out to block the country's path to a nuclear weapon. The proposal represents a potential shift in strategy, aiming to achieve a limited agreement while pursuing a more comprehensive solution.</p>

          <p>Blake Lively is withdrawing two claims of emotional distress in her lawsuit against Justin Baldoni, but the actor wanted to keep the right to re-file those emotional distress claims at a later time. Baldoni's lawyer had requested that Lively identify her medical and mental health care providers, signing a HIPAA release to open up access to her therapy notes and pertinent medical info. Lively initially filed a sexual harassment and retaliation complaint in September, accusing Baldoni of orchestrating a smear campaign against her after she reported on-set sexual harassment. Lively sought to dismiss a defamation countersuit from Baldoni, citing a California law that prohibits “weaponizing defamation lawsuits” against those who have filed suit or “spoken out about sexual harassment and retaliation.”</p>

The storms are a rare occurrence as the Southland typically sees the bulk of its thunderstorms in August and September, and the storms are forecast to continue rolling through Southern California on Tuesday evening before gradually exiting the region about 10 p.m.</p>

The Boulder attack occurred weeks after a shooting outside the Capitol Jewish Museum in Washington, DC, and an arson incident at the residence of Pennsylvania's Jewish governor.
