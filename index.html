This was the 23-year-old's first major final, where she narrowly beat Jamaican sprinter Shericka Jackson for second place. The victory marked Great Britain's second medal of the championships, following Jake Wightman's silver in the men's 1500m.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's announcement to designate antifa as a "major terrorist organization" is expected to encounter significant legal challenges. Experts note that the president lacks the legal authority to designate domestic groups in this manner, partly due to First Amendment concerns about criminalizing an ideology. Antifa is described as a decentralized movement without a formal structure, making an organizational designation difficult. While the administration could prioritize investigations into individuals associated with the movement, a formal designation as a domestic terrorist organization is not currently possible under U.S. law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fact-check investigation has determined that claims circulating on Chinese social media that Poland officially deployed troops to Ukraine are false. The narrative appears to have originated from a misinterpretation of remarks by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy regarding military cooperation on drone defense. The Polish Ministry of Defense clarified that any joint training activities would occur exclusively on Polish territory. The disinformation was amplified by content farms using sensationalist headlines, reflecting a broader strategy to create informational chaos regarding the conflict and NATO's role.</p>

The finding has been met with calls for further federal investigation from civil rights advocates and the student's family, who cite Mississippi's history of racial violence. While initial investigations found no evidence of foul play, the family's attorney, Ben Crump, stated they cannot accept vague conclusions. The Cleveland Police Department has turned over all investigative materials to the FBI for review.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia and nuclear-armed Pakistan have signed a mutual defense pact, significantly strengthening their security partnership. The agreement stipulates that an act of aggression against one nation will be considered an attack on both, aiming to enhance joint deterrence. Pakistan's defense minister stated that the country's nuclear capabilities would be made available to Saudi Arabia if needed under the pact. This development marks a pivotal moment in their long-standing strategic relationship, occurring amid growing regional tensions and concerns over the reliability of the United States as a security partner.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced a "high-powered demography mission" to address what his government terms a "conspiracy" of irregular migration, particularly from Bangladesh. The initiative has drawn criticism from opponents who argue it is a tactic to target Muslim populations and other perceived outsiders under the guise of national security. Critics suggest the mission aims to engineer the electorate by questioning the citizenship of communities unlikely to support the ruling BJP party. The government maintains the policy is necessary to protect jobs and land rights for Indian citizens.</p>

Kashkari believes a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations justify further rate reductions to support the economy, even with core inflation currently running above the Fed's 2% target.

          <p>Retail companies are increasingly using a supply chain strategy known as "tariff hacking" or B2B2C (business-to-business-to-consumer) to reduce the impact of trade war tariffs on consumer prices. This model involves routing online sales through a third-party middleman company, which purchases the product at a wholesale price and pays the U.S. tariff on that lower value. This allows retailers to significantly cut their tariff costs without raising prices for customers. While effective in the short term, some logistics experts warn that this practice is not a sustainable solution for long-term supply chain challenges.</p>

          <p>In the week following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, dozens of individuals across the U.S. have been fired, suspended, or disciplined for social media posts deemed to be celebrating or mocking his death. The crackdown has affected government employees, journalists, academics, and airline pilots, among others, often after pressure campaigns from conservative activists. This wave of professional consequences has raised alarms among civil liberties groups, who warn of a chilling effect on free expression and potential infringements on First Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>Apple has launched its new iPhone 17 series worldwide, with new models drawing crowds in major cities from Beijing to London. The global launch is a critical test for the company as it faces intensified competition in key markets like China from local brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi. While initial preorder data appears positive, Apple is also under pressure to deliver on its artificial intelligence promises after a previously underwhelming rollout. The success of the iPhone 17 will be crucial in reassuring investors and maintaining its market position.</p>

After months of campaigning by advocates, the students received support from the UK government to leave and are now in a third country for visa processing before traveling to the UK.

          <p>A drone strike by Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has killed dozens of people at a mosque in a camp for displaced persons in Darfur. The attack on the Abu Shouk camp outside El-Fasher resulted in casualty counts ranging from 43 to 75, according to medical and volunteer groups. The incident is part of an escalating conflict that the UN has described as a "forgotten war" where atrocity crimes are being committed. A recent UN report highlighted a sharp increase in civilian deaths and ethnic violence in 2025.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are attempting to roll back several health protections related to toxic PFAS "forever chemical" pollution from U.S. military bases. Provisions included in the National Defense Authorization Act would delay a ban on PFAS-laden firefighting foam, cut cleanup funding, and lift a moratorium on incinerating the foam. These moves would reverse protections passed over the last five years to address widespread water contamination that has affected service members and communities around hundreds of bases. Environmental advocates have condemned the proposed repeals as a threat to public health.</p>

          <p>Less than a year after his 2024 election victory, signs of weakening support for President Donald Trump are emerging, particularly among key demographics that shifted in his favor. Polling data indicates significant disapproval among Latino and Black voters, with economic pressures like rising unemployment and persistent inflation potentially causing "buyers' remorse." While the Democratic party remains in disarray, the president's approval ratings are underwater. The analysis suggests that the economic discontent that helped Trump win may now be eroding his support ahead of the midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Chinese military researchers are proposing the construction of a comprehensive naval defense system, likened to a 'Great Wall,' to counter potential attacks from large-scale drone swarms. A recent study warns that coordinated drone attacks could overwhelm traditional warship defenses through stealth and numerical superiority. The proposed countermeasures include a layered defense network of advanced weapon systems, such as high-power microwaves, ship-mounted lasers, and hypersonic cruise missiles. This theoretical framework aligns with new anti-drone technologies recently displayed by the Chinese military, indicating a focus on future warfare capabilities.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old boy named Stephen has become what is believed to be the youngest known stem cell donor at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to save his father's life. His father, Nick Mondek, an anesthesiologist, was dying from a relapse of acute myeloid leukemia and had no other matching donors. Stephen agreed to the procedure, which was more complex due to his age, and successfully donated his stem cells in July. The donation provides his father with a new immune system and hope for recovery, showcasing a powerful story of familial love and medical bravery.</p>
