          <p>Construction on the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's JFK International Airport is advancing, with the structure now weather-tight and key interior systems being installed. This new terminal, set to be JFK's largest, will exclusively serve international travelers and is part of a broader $19 billion airport overhaul. The first phase, featuring 14 wide-body gates and a light-filled design, is scheduled to open in mid-2026, ahead of the World Cup. The project also boasts its own resilient microgrid and unique duty-free shopping options.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer explained that newly imposed tariffs on approximately 70 countries are largely set and unlikely to be negotiated down soon. He stated the administration's goal is to reduce the trade deficit and reshore manufacturing, sometimes prioritizing tariffs over trade deals to achieve these aims. Greer also addressed the use of tariffs for geopolitical leverage, such as with Canada and Brazil, asserting this is a legitimate, albeit softer, use of economic power compared to sanctions.

          <p>Germany's fertility rate has fallen to 1.35 children per woman, one of the lowest in its history, sparking debate about societal pressures and economic uncertainty. Experts point to multiple crises, including the pandemic and inflation, as factors discouraging young people from having children, a trend seen globally. While some criticize childlessness as selfish, others argue that the risk of poverty and lack of support for mothers are significant deterrents. Analysts suggest that improving the work-life balance and reliable childcare is crucial to closing the "fertility gap" between desired and actual birth rates.</p>

          <p>The UK Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for most of Scotland ahead of Storm Floris, which is expected to bring unusually strong winds on Monday. Gusts could reach 70-90 mph in exposed areas, posing a danger to life and threatening damage to buildings and widespread travel disruption. A yellow warning is also in place for northern England, north Wales, and Northern Ireland. Officials are urging the public, including holiday travelers, to plan ahead and avoid unnecessary risks as transport services anticipate significant delays and cancellations.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a compensation scheme that could cost up to £18 billion for drivers affected by the mis-selling of car loans. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while not deeming all hidden commissions unlawful, found that excessively large commissions could be considered unfair. The FCA will consult on the details of the scheme, which could see most eligible individuals receive under £950 in compensation. Payouts are not expected to begin until the following year, pending the finalization of the program's structure. (not investment advice)</p>

Coach Javier Mascherano confirmed Messi felt a "pull" and will undergo tests to determine the injury's severity. This incident raises concerns about his availability for upcoming matches, adding to a season where his workload and fatigue have been carefully managed.</p>

Debris from a drone reportedly struck a fuel tank, igniting a blaze that required over 100 firefighters to extinguish. This attack was part of a wider wave of 93 drones that Russia claims to have intercepted overnight across several regions. The strike continues Ukraine's strategy of targeting Russian energy infrastructure in response to Moscow's ongoing bombardment of Ukrainian cities and power grids.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has dismissed star defender Micah Parsons' recent social media trade request as "negotiation talk," insisting fans shouldn't lose sleep over it. The dispute stems from a breakdown in contract extension talks, with Parsons seeking a deal that would make him the highest-paid defender in the NFL. Jones maintains that a framework for an agreement was established in the spring, a claim Parsons seems to dispute. Despite the public disagreement, several Cowboys teammates have voiced their support for Parsons, urging the team to pay him.</p>

          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, effective handling of tantrums involves connection rather than control. The article suggests using calming phrases that validate a child's feelings, such as "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you," instead of issuing punishments. This approach helps de-escalate a child's distressed nervous system by making them feel safe and understood. By modeling compassionate boundaries and reassurance, parents can help children learn to regulate their emotions, leading to fewer and less intense meltdowns over time.</p>

The incident, which occurred Saturday afternoon, caused the boat to nearly capsize and sent a passenger overboard, though the person was recovered safely. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after it was found resting on a shallow sandbar. Due to tidal conditions, a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death will be conducted after the carcass is moved to a nearby state park on Monday.</p>

          <p>Health authorities in China's southern Guangdong province are implementing "decisive" measures to control a growing outbreak of chikungunya fever, with nearly 2,900 new cases reported last week. The majority of infections of the mosquito-borne viral disease, which causes high fever and severe joint pain, are concentrated in the city of Foshan. While no severe or fatal cases have been recorded, national and provincial officials are urging swift action to contain the spread. The virus is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and cannot be passed directly between people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The use of AI to automatically detect and bill for damages, as recently implemented by car rental companies, may soon become common across the travel industry. Experts predict hotels and other service businesses will adopt similar "algorithmic auditing" to identify and monetize issues like in-room smoking or property damage. While this technology can increase operational efficiency, it also raises concerns about customer trust, fairness, and the erosion of human judgment. The key challenge for businesses will be balancing automation with maintaining a positive and equitable customer experience.</p>

          <p>An American woman has been sentenced to eight years in prison for her part in a sophisticated scheme that helped thousands of North Korean IT workers secure remote jobs at hundreds of U.S. companies. The woman acted as a U.S.-based facilitator, managing "laptop farms" and validating stolen identities to make the workers appear to be American citizens. This operation generated millions of dollars for the North Korean government, which uses the funds to support its sanctioned weapons programs. The case highlights a growing cybersecurity threat exacerbated by the rise of remote work.</p>

          <p>While the Trump administration has been slow to release documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, ongoing legal cases could compel their disclosure. A Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by a news outlet is currently on appeal, challenging the FBI's refusal to release thousands of pages from its Epstein file. Additionally, a federal appeals court has ordered a lower court to reconsider unsealing more documents from a civil case involving an Epstein accuser. These legal pressures may provide a path to transparency, potentially revealing more about Epstein's criminal network and powerful connections.</p>
