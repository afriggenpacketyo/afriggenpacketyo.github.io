            <p>Actress Aimee Lou Wood criticized a Saturday Night Live (SNL) sketch that parodied her role in 'The White Lotus,' specifically targeting the exaggerated prosthetic teeth used to mimic her. Wood, known for her role in 'Sex Education,' felt the sketch was "mean and unfunny," and that it "punched down" on her character, Chelsea, while the rest of the skit was "punching up." She clarified that her issue wasn't with Sarah Sherman, the actress portraying her, but with the concept of the sketch itself, particularly the focus on her teeth. Wood also criticized Sherman's accent and expressed disappointment that the conversation surrounding her appearance overshadowed her work.</p>

            <p>Following a deadly helicopter crash on the Hudson River that killed a family of five from Spain and the pilot, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced that New York Helicopter Tours is immediately ceasing operations. The FAA will conduct a review of the tour operator's license and safety record and is launching a helicopter safety panel to analyze airplane/helicopter hotspots nationwide. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had previously called for a pause on all flights by the company during the NTSB investigation. The crash has renewed safety concerns about sightseeing excursions in New York City, prompting calls for stricter regulations and potential bans on nonessential helicopter flights.</p>

            <p>Mario Vargas Llosa, a towering figure in Latin American literature and Nobel laureate, has died at the age of 89 in his native Peru. Known for his depictions of authoritarianism, violence, and machismo, Vargas Llosa was a key figure in the Latin American Boom literary movement. His works, including 'The Time of the Hero' and 'Conversations in the Cathedral,' often reflected the political turmoil and social issues of the region. Initially sympathetic to left-wing ideas, he later shifted to the center-right and unsuccessfully ran for the Peruvian presidency in 1990. </p>

            <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) is opposing a motion for relief filed by attorneys for Kilmer Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man deported to El Salvador, arguing that federal courts lack the authority to direct the executive branch in foreign relations. Abrego Garcia's attorneys are requesting the court to order the DOJ to demand the El Salvadoran government return him and send personnel to extract him. The DOJ contends that these requests involve interactions with a foreign sovereign and potential violations of that sovereignty, exceeding the court's authority.</p>

US President Donald Trump described the attack as a "horrible thing," while Germany's chancellor-in-waiting, Friedrich Merz, accused Russia of committing a war crime, but stated Trump said they "made a mistake" in the attack. Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky has urged Trump to visit Ukraine and see for himself the devastation brought by Russia's invasion.</p>

            <p>China's exports experienced a significant jump of 12.4% in March, exceeding expectations, as businesses accelerated shipments to avoid impending U.S. tariffs, while imports declined by 4.3% due to sluggish domestic demand. This comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has imposed a cumulative 145% in tariffs on all imports from China, including a 20% duty related to Beijing's role in fentanyl trade. China has retaliated with tariff increases, including levies of up to 15% targeting select American goods and across-the-board tariffs of 125%. Despite the trade tensions, China aims to achieve an annual growth target of "around 5%" this year.</p>

His left-wing challenger, Luisa González, has disputed the results and alleged fraud, though she has not provided evidence.

Despite a star-studded lineup and a strong start to the season, the Dodgers have averaged barely three runs per game over their last nine games. Manager Dave Roberts attributes the struggles to a lack of quality team at-bats and a tendency to chase pitches out of the zone. Pitcher Tyler Glasnow had a strong outing, but two solo home runs contributed to the loss.</p>

            <p>Singapore has eased its monetary policy for the second consecutive time, reducing the rate of appreciation of its policy band, known as the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate (S$NEER). This decision comes as the city-state reported lower-than-expected GDP growth of 3.8% for the first quarter. The Ministry of Trade and Industry has downgraded its GDP forecast for 2025 to 0%-2%, citing declines in manufacturing and some services sectors and expecting the growth outlook for both the U.S. and China will deteriorate due to tariffs.</p>

            <h2>China's Electronics Firms Face Confusion Amid US Tariff Exemptions</h2>

            <p>Washington's plans to exempt some electronic devices from its 125 per cent so-called "reciprocal" tariffs has provided a glimmer of hope for Chinese suppliers serving major US multinationals such as Apple and Tesla, but the road ahead for China’s vast electronics sector still appears tough, analysts and industry insiders say. Many smaller Chinese electronics firms will not be covered by the exemptions – and the administration of US President Donald Trump is now adding further uncertainty by warning it plans to roll out new “sectoral tariffs” targeting the industry.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's tariff policies have caused confusion after top officials indicated new levies on semiconductors, crucial components in electronic goods, shortly after exempting computers and smartphones from reciprocal tariffs. Trump has said that the tariff exemption on several electronic devices was just temporary and that new duties would come in "a month or two". Ray Dalio, a billionaire investor, voiced concerns that the US may face "worse than a recession" due to Trump's trade policies. Peter Navarro, a top trade adviser to Trump, downplayed Elon Musk's criticism of Trump's tariff proposals.</p>

            <p>Rory McIlroy reflected on the lifting of a “burden” lasting more than a decade after winning the Masters in dramatic fashion at Augusta National, defeating Justin Rose on the first sudden death hole. McIlroy needed the Masters to complete his set of majors since winning the US PGA Championship of 2014, and had not added to his major tally since. He described the win as a dream come true, and credited his caddie and long-time friend, Harry Diamond, for his support.</p>

            <p>A CBS News poll reveals that Americans are divided on President Trump's trade and tariff policy, with most believing tariffs will raise prices in both the short and long term. While Republicans generally support Trump's goals and believe the tariffs will lead to more U.S. manufacturing jobs, the public overall is concerned about the potential impact on prices and their financial well-being. The poll also indicates that a majority of Americans now consider the economy to be Donald Trump's responsibility.</p>

            <p>As U.S. treasury bond yields surge and investors question the role of bonds in a diversified portfolio, a bond ladder strategy can provide exposure to treasury bonds without the worry of short-term swings. This involves investing in a wide range of treasury maturities, holding them to maturity, and providing regular income through principal and interest. ETFs like the LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) offer a similar approach, investing in treasuries from 30-day issues to 10-year bonds and distributing fixed monthly income. A U.S. treasury default is the only reason to worry about a bond ladder strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite TfL's efforts to raise awareness, a survey indicated that many passengers in priority seats are unaware of their meaning or are not paying attention to others who might need a seat. TfL encourages passengers to offer seats to those who ask, even without a badge.</p>
