          <p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, stated that any potential full takeover of the Gaza Strip is a decision solely for the Israeli government. In an interview, Huckabee emphasized that while the U.S. could offer advice, it would not dictate Israel's actions, noting that negotiations with Hamas have completely broken down. The ambassador also addressed the deaths of American citizens in the West Bank, promising a full investigation, and discussed the challenges of delivering humanitarian aid into Gaza, where he alleged aid is being stolen by Hamas. He remained noncommittal on a two-state solution, describing it as an aspirational goal with few specific details.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its experimental oral weight-loss drug, orforglipron, successfully helped adults with obesity achieve significant weight loss in a late-stage trial. The pill, a GLP-1 therapy similar to the company's injectable drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, led to an average weight loss of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks. Common side effects included nausea and diarrhea, causing about 10% of participants on the highest dose to discontinue the trial. Eli Lilly plans to submit the drug for regulatory approval later this year, potentially making a more accessible and affordable pill-based option available by 2026.</p>

The suspect, a sergeant at the base, used his personal weapon and is now in custody. Six soldiers were awarded the Meritorious Service Medal for their bravery, with officials stating their quick actions and first-aid training saved lives by stopping severe bleeding before medical help arrived. Three of the five wounded soldiers have been released from the hospital, and the other two are expected to make a full recovery.</p>

          <p>With President Trump's sweeping new tariffs now in effect, economists predict American companies will face lower profits and consumers will see higher prices. The new duties, which apply to imports from dozens of countries, have raised the average tariff rate to its highest point in decades, and experts believe businesses cannot absorb these costs indefinitely. Major companies like Toyota, General Motors, and Ford have already reported or projected significant profit reductions due to the tariffs. While the administration argues foreign exporters will bear the cost, most economists assert that U.S. importers and consumers will ultimately pay for the new levies. (not investment advice)</p>

Carano had sued for wrongful termination and discrimination, alleging she was fired for expressing her political opinions on social media, which included controversial posts comparing the U.S. political climate to Nazi Germany. While details of the settlement were not disclosed, both parties expressed a desire for healing and moving forward. A Lucasfilm spokesperson noted Carano's professionalism and stated the company looks forward to potential future collaborations, a significant shift from its original statement condemning her posts.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning legislation that would confine serious sexual and violent offenders to specific geographical zones upon their release from prison. This new approach would replace current exclusion zones, which only bar offenders from certain areas, by instead defining the areas where they are permitted to be. The Ministry of Justice states this will provide victims with greater peace of mind, using enhanced GPS tagging and monitoring to enforce the restrictions. However, probation officers have raised concerns that the new system will increase their already heavy workload, despite government promises to hire more staff and utilize technology.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to expand investment options in 401(k) retirement accounts to include alternative assets like cryptocurrency and private equity. While the changes are not immediate and require regulatory updates, the move could grant the private equity and crypto industries access to trillions of dollars in retirement savings. Proponents, including investment firms like TIAA and BlackRock, argue this will provide workers with more diverse investment strategies. Critics, however, point to the higher risk and volatility associated with these assets, which had previously been discouraged for retirement savings by regulators. (not investment advice)</p>

The administration argues the ban irreparably harms its ability to enforce immigration laws in a region with a large population of undocumented immigrants.

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams was eliminated in the first round of the Cincinnati Open, falling to 22-year-old Spanish player Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in a competitive 6-4, 6-4 match. The 45-year-old Williams fought back from an early deficit in the first set but was ultimately outlasted by her in-form opponent's consistency and composure. Despite the loss, Williams expressed satisfaction with her performance, stating she felt good about her aggressive play and recognized the need for more match experience. She is next scheduled to compete in the mixed doubles tournament at the U.S. Open.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily stopped construction at a new immigration detention facility in Florida's Everglades, dubbed 'Alligator Alcatraz' by critics. The order was issued in response to a lawsuit from environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, who argue the facility's construction violates federal law by proceeding without an environmental impact statement. Judge Kathleen Williams issued the 14-day restraining order after learning construction was still ongoing despite the legal challenge. Environmental experts testified that the facility would harm water quality and threaten the habitat of the endangered Florida panther, while immigration detention operations at the site will continue.</p>

          <p>This week's major film releases include "Freakier Friday," a sequel to the 2003 body-swap comedy that reunites stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan. While the film delivers on nostalgia and the chemistry between its leads, the plot becomes convoluted by adding a new generation of characters into the body-swapping chaos. In the horror genre, "Weapons," from "Barbarian" director Zach Cregger, offers an original and ambitious story about the mysterious disappearance of schoolchildren, praised for its sharp script and strong performances, particularly from Julia Garner. Also opening is "Shaman," an independent horror film set in Ecuador that explores themes of cultural and religious conflict.</p>

          <p>The Stanford Daily, the student newspaper of Stanford University, has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, claiming that threats to deport foreign students for their political speech are chilling free expression on campus. The lawsuit alleges that the administration's stance, particularly regarding pro-Palestinian activism, has hampered the newspaper's ability to cover protests, as some foreign student writers fear deportation and have declined assignments or asked for their work to be removed. The suit accuses top officials of prioritizing their authority to revoke visas over the First Amendment, a claim the Department of Homeland Security has called "baseless."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's latest wave of tariffs, which took effect overnight, functions as a significant backdoor tax increase for American consumers, according to a policy analysis. The tariffs apply to over 90 countries, raising the average rate on imported goods to 18.6%, the highest in nearly a century. While the government collects revenue from these duties, companies are expected to pass the increased costs on to consumers, leading to higher prices for a wide range of products. This policy is being implemented as the U.S. economy shows signs of weakness, and it could face a legal challenge in federal court. (not investment advice)</p>

In her resignation letter, Ali insisted she had followed all legal requirements but stated that remaining in her role would be a "distraction."

Prominent scientists have condemned the move, with one comparing it to Stalinist revisionism, arguing it aims to replace scientific evidence with misinformation to downplay the climate crisis.

          <p>The ongoing partisan fight over mid-decade redistricting, sparked by Republicans in Texas and met with retaliatory threats from Democrats, represents a troubling escalation of "total politics." This analytical article argues that such opportunistic gerrymandering damages democracy by making representatives less accountable to the general electorate and more beholden to primary voters, thus fueling polarization. The piece explores the legal and historical context, noting the Supreme Court's reluctance to intervene in partisan gerrymandering and the potential erosion of the Voting Rights Act. It frames the conflict as a dangerous game that threatens to strip the right to vote of its meaning.</p>
