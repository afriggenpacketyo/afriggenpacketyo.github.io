        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales saw a greater-than-anticipated decrease of 0.9% in May, according to the Commerce Department, reversing April's slight decline. This downturn in consumer spending is driven by reduced gas sales and growing economic uncertainty regarding tariffs and geopolitical issues. This decline in retail activity is a notable shift, indicating potential challenges for the economy as consumers become more cautious with their spending habits. The Federal Reserve will be closely watching these figures as they consider future monetary policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a DW interview, William Figueroa, an expert on China-Middle East relations, discusses China's stance on the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel. Figueroa notes that China tends to focus on blaming Israel and calling for dialogue rather than military action. He also points out China's limited capacity for power projection in the region, with its strength lying in economic relationships and diplomatic bridging. Figueroa believes China will maintain its current approach, facilitating regionally initiated efforts, as direct involvement in the conflict carries high costs and low potential gains.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain its benchmark interest rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5% during its upcoming meeting, signaling a continuation of its cautious approach. The decision reflects ongoing uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs and their potential economic impact, as well as a slight uptick in inflation. While some members have expressed concerns about slowing growth, the labor market remains relatively strong. Experts suggest that the Fed's decision will likely keep credit card rates, auto loans, and mortgages at elevated levels, benefiting savers while posing challenges for borrowers.

          <p>President Trump stated that his early departure from the G7 summit was due to more significant matters than the Israel-Iran conflict, urging people to "immediately evacuate Tehran." The G7 leaders affirmed support for Israel while calling for a resolution to the escalating tensions. Trump's social media post followed comments by French President Macron about a potential ceasefire offer. The G7 condemned Iran for regional instability and reiterated that Iran can never have a nuclear weapon, contrasting with China's stance which condemned Israel's attack on Iran while seeking to play a peacemaking role.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical companies are making strides in developing antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as targeted cancer therapies that could potentially replace chemotherapy in some cases. ADCs are designed to deliver potent chemotherapy directly to cancer cells while sparing surrounding healthy cells, unlike traditional chemotherapy. Companies like AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck have invested billions in developing ADCs, with some showing the ability to replace chemotherapy in certain settings. While challenges remain in refining these treatments, experts believe ADCs represent a significant step towards precision-based cancer care with improved efficacy and safety profiles.</p>

          <p>President Trump denied reports of contacting Iranian leaders, stating he had not reached out about a potential ceasefire and was "not too much in the mood" to negotiate with Iran. Trump asserted that if Iran strikes U.S. troops or assets, the U.S. would retaliate forcefully. He also dismissed claims that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, despite earlier testimony from Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. These comments came as Trump returned early to the White House to convene his national security staff after departing the G7 summit in Canada.</p>

          <h2>Debate Arises Over McLaren's Team Strategy in Canadian Grand Prix</h2>

          <p>An F1 Q&A article discusses whether McLaren should have allowed Lando Norris to pass teammate Oscar Piastri during the Canadian Grand Prix. While Piastri has had a better season overall, the article argues that there is little difference in outright performance between the two drivers. Norris's mistakes have cost him points, but McLaren does not typically prioritize one driver over the other except in specific circumstances. The team is currently leading the championship, making it difficult to justify prioritizing Piastri at this time.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Britons are stranded in Israel due to the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel, with airspace closures and grounded flights causing significant disruption. British nationals report sleepless nights, frequent trips to bomb shelters, and uncertainty about returning home. Many are urging the UK government to provide more assistance, although there are currently no plans for evacuation. Some are considering leaving via land crossings to neighboring countries, while others are unable to travel due to various constraints.

          <p>G7 leaders have urged a "de-escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, including a ceasefire in Gaza," but did not call for a ceasefire between Israel and Iran during their summit in Canada. The joint statement, signed by President Trump before his early departure, affirmed Israel's right to defend itself and condemned Iran as a source of terror. Trump dismissed French President Macron's suggestion that he was working on a ceasefire. The summit was overshadowed by the Middle East conflict, with divisions emerging over conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Iran.</p>

          <p>As space exploration shifts towards long-duration missions, like those to Mars, the qualities of the ideal astronaut are changing. The current focus on engineers and pilots may need to expand to include individuals with experience in extreme environments and small-group dynamics, such as outdoor explorers. NASA is considering skills like autonomy and the ability to cope with isolation as increasingly important for future missions. While terrestrial explorers are rarely hired, their experiences with survival, navigation, and problem-solving in challenging conditions could prove invaluable for deep-space travel.</p>

          <p>A culture writer examines the recent trend of criticizing women who are perceived as being too sexually forward or appealing to men, labeling them as "pick-me" or "male-centered." This criticism is seen as a response to cultural misogyny and a potential shift towards more conservative attitudes about sex. The discourse highlights concerns about gender, power, and the influence of online platforms, particularly in light of the #MeToo movement and rising anti-women sentiments. The writer suggests that these online conversations often focus on individual women rather than addressing structural issues.</p>

The lack of local manufacturing capabilities and the cost of establishing such facilities in the U.S. make it impractical to produce the phone domestically.
