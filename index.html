          <p>An Army helicopter flight near the Pentagon caused two commercial jets to abort landings at a Washington airport after air traffic controllers lost contact with the Black Hawk for approximately 20 seconds. The article explains that the incident stemmed from a temporary antenna setup during control tower construction. The Army stated that the Black Hawk's location was continuously broadcast, and the aborted landings were taken out of caution, but the NTSB expressed disappointment at not being briefed on the Army's findings first. The incident has raised concerns about air safety near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport following a deadly collision earlier in the year.</p>
