          <p>President Trump teased a potential "major trade deal" with a "big, and highly respected, country," leading to reports that the US and UK are on the verge of an agreement. The specifics remain unclear, but talks have been ongoing for weeks, focusing on reducing British tariffs on US cars and agricultural products, and lowering taxes on US tech companies. The UK Prime Minister has stated that reducing food production standards is not a priority, and analysts are unsure if this will be a finalized deal or a framework for negotiation. The announcement is expected to occur at a news conference in Washington DC.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that deporting migrants to Libya would violate his existing court order, following reports that the White House considered such plans. Lawyers representing the migrants filed an emergency motion to prevent deportations to Libya or Saudi Arabia, citing safety concerns. The judge clarified that any removals to countries like Libya or Saudi Arabia would violate the preliminary injunction he issued last month, which barred the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens to any country other than their place of origin without due process. The lawyers also provided evidence that some migrants were being coerced into signing documents agreeing to the deportations.</p>

The ruling ordered Apple to stop imposing commissions on in-app purchases made through web links inside its apps and prevents it from restricting app developers from choosing the language or placement of those links. Apple claims that non-party developers are already seizing upon the Order to reduce consumer choice and damage Apple's business. The motion cites a previous order in the case that found that new linking policies would cost Apple "hundreds of millions to billions" of dollars annually.</p>

          <p>An idle Southern California Edison transmission tower, suspected of playing a role in the Eaton fire, has been dismantled and removed for testing. The tower, known as Tower 208, has been the focus of investigators after video showed initial flames burning underneath it. The utility company stated that the idle line it carried somehow became reenergized the day the fire began, possibly through induction. The tower will be examined and tested in a laboratory setting by fire investigators and experts to determine the cause of the fire.</p>

Trump's policies and rhetoric are accelerating the unraveling of the Western world order, echoing the mistakes of past rulers whose unwise actions led to irreversible decline. Trump's tariffs, imposed even on America’s closest allies, have undermined the fundamentals of US and Western economic dominance.

          <p>Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins testified that the USDA is actively recruiting to fill key positions after offering buyouts to over 15,000 employees. The agency used the deferred resignation program to downsize the federal workforce, leading to questions about the need to refill positions so soon after letting people go. Rollins stated that the 15,000 employees represent less than 15% of the USDA's workforce and that the department loses 8,000 to 10,000 employees every year through attrition.</p>

Boise's mayor issued a proclamation making the pride flag an official city flag. These measures aim to show support for diversity, equity, and inclusion despite state-level restrictions.</p>

The overall death toll had risen to at least 31 people, according to Pakistani officials. India said it had struck infrastructure used by militants linked to last month's massacre of tourists in the Indian-administered portion of Kashmir, a disputed mountainous region that the nuclear-armed neighbors have fought two previous wars over. Pakistan claimed it shot down several Indian aircraft in retaliation, including three top-line fighter jets.</p>
