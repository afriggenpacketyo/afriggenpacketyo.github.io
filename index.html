        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Health Security Agency has reported the first fatal case of whooping cough this year, involving an infant whose mother was not vaccinated during pregnancy. This tragic event underscores government warnings about declining vaccine uptake, which has fallen below the 95% target for main childhood vaccines in England. Health officials emphasize that vaccination during pregnancy is crucial for protecting newborns in their first weeks of life, noting that 27 of the 33 infant deaths since 2013 involved mothers who had not received the jab.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global craze for matcha, fueled by its reputation as a superfood and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, has led to soaring prices and supply shortages. Japanese exports of green tea have quadrupled in a decade, with prices for the raw tea leaves used for matcha jumping 170% at a recent auction. The surge in demand is straining Japan's aging farming communities and production capabilities, leading retailers to ration supplies and major distributors like Ito En to create new divisions to manage the intense competition for the popular green powder.</p>

          <p>As children in the UK return to school, the education secretary has issued a warning to parents about the critical importance of attendance in the first week of term. New data reveals that over half of pupils who missed some of the first week in 2024 later became persistently absent, a significantly higher rate than those with full attendance. While attendance has improved since the pandemic, it remains a major concern, prompting calls for schools and parents to work together to prevent long-term negative impacts on students' education.</p>

          <p>An order from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis to remove approximately 400 'non-standard' street art installations has ignited a statewide controversy, viewed by critics as an extension of his 'war on woke'. The directive has targeted LGBTQ+ pride-themed rainbow crosswalks, memorials, and even student-designed safety art at schools, which had previously received state approval. While the state cites a need to keep roads free of political ideologies, several municipalities are vowing to fight the order, setting up a potential legal battle over local control and free speech.</p>

          <p>In a rare contract for the North American market, Beijing-based CAS Space has successfully launched two tiny satellites for ThumbSat, a startup from Tijuana, Mexico. The 'femtosatellites,' each weighing less than 100 grams, represent Mexico's first commercial mission to low Earth orbit and aim to prove the viability of smaller, more accessible satellite technology. This mission is being hailed as a milestone for China's efforts to expand its role in the global commercial launch market, showcasing its balance of cost and reliability.</p>

          <p>The FBI is investigating a coordinated wave of 'swatting' incidents, where false reports of active shooters are made to terrorize college campuses across the United States. At least six universities experienced these hoaxes on a single day, causing mass panic, lockdowns, and significant diversions of law enforcement resources. Officials warn that these are serious crimes, not pranks, as they put innocent people at risk and create a lasting psychological impact on students, staff, and parents even after the threats are proven to be unfounded.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that a Confederate memorial will be returned to Arlington National Cemetery, part of a broader Trump administration effort to restore monuments and names honoring the Confederacy. Hegseth stated the move was to 'honor' American history and push back against 'woke lemmings,' a decision that critics argue glorifies a treasonous cause founded on slavery. The article's author, a U.S. Army veteran, draws a parallel to his grandfather who fought for Mussolini, arguing one can respect ancestors' sacrifices without venerating their wrongful causes.</p>

          <p>This opinion article posits that the historical struggle of Black Americans against systemic racism offers a crucial framework for understanding and combating the rise of fascism today. Drawing on the analysis of author Toni Morrison, it argues that American racism is a precursor to fascism and that the enduring tools of Black resistance—including profound belief in democratic ideals, diverse forms of protest, and deep-seated faith—provide a powerful model for defending democracy against current authoritarian threats. The author suggests this history teaches resilience and hope in the face of seemingly impossible odds.</p>

          <p>With U.S. mortgage rates for 30-year loans falling to around 6.5% and housing inventory increasing, prospective homebuyers face a difficult decision. Some may be tempted to wait for rates to drop further, but market experts caution against trying to time the market perfectly. They argue that falling rates often lead to increased buyer competition and higher home prices, potentially negating any savings. The prevailing advice is to focus on purchasing a home that fits one's current budget and needs, with the option to refinance later. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England and Chelsea defender Millie Bright has described her decision to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad as the 'best decision I have ever made.' The 32-year-old, who captained the Lionesses to the World Cup final, realized she was on the verge of a mental and physical breakdown after a grueling season. By prioritizing her well-being, she has since had successful knee surgery and started counseling, stating she now feels 'back to life' and ready for the new season.</p>

          <h2>Nottinghamshire Council's Ban on Local Newspaper Draws Comparisons to Trump's Anti-Press Tactics</h2>

          <p>The Reform-led county council in Nottinghamshire, UK, has banned the Nottingham Post and its affiliated reporters, a move critics are calling a 'massive attack on local democracy.' This action is being compared to the anti-press tactics of Donald Trump, reflecting a broader trend of some right-wing politicians shutting out media outlets whose coverage they dislike. While the council claims it is combating 'misinformation,' the ban is seen as an attempt to avoid scrutiny and control the public narrative, raising concerns about press freedom.</p>

          <p>Manchester United claimed a dramatic 3-2 victory over Burnley thanks to a stoppage-time penalty, but the result did little to mask the team's urgent problems. Manager Ruben Amorim noted that the team is in a moment where any possession near their box feels like a scoring threat for the opposition. This vulnerability has been highlighted by recent critical errors from both goalkeepers, Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana, raising questions about the team's stability in a key position early in the season.</p>

          <p>UCLA's football season began with a disappointing 43-10 blowout loss to Utah at the Rose Bowl, exposing significant weaknesses on both sides of the ball. The defense struggled with missed tackles and was unable to contain Utah's quarterback, who dominated the game. Offensively, new quarterback Nico Iamaleava and the running game failed to establish consistent momentum, leading to a lopsided defeat that raises serious concerns for the Bruins as they look ahead to the rest of their season.</p>

          <p>This week marks ten years since former German Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, 'wir schaffen das' ('we can do it'), as she opened the country's borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees. The 2015 decision profoundly reshaped German society, culture, and politics, and a decade later, the nation continues to grapple with its legacy. The anniversary has prompted widespread reflection on both the successes in integration, such as employment rates among refugees, and the persistent challenges that continue to fuel political debate.</p>

          <p>Protests by anti-asylum groups at hotels in West Drayton, London, resulted in five arrests after a group of masked men damaged fences and attempted to enter a hotel housing asylum seekers.

This incident was part of a series of similar protests and counter-demonstrations occurring across the UK regarding the government's policy of using hotels to accommodate migrants.</p>

The drones are equipped with speakers that blast sounds like the AC/DC song 'Thunderstruck,' movie dialogue, and live human voices to scare the predators. This non-lethal method is part of an ongoing experiment to reduce wolf-rancher conflicts as wolf populations recover, offering a creative and potentially effective tool for promoting coexistence between humans and wildlife.</p>
