        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio has introduced a new visa policy aimed at foreign officials who censor protected speech in the United States, asserting that it's unacceptable for them to issue arrest warrants or demand censorship on American soil. The policy intends to target officials from countries known for targeting dual nationals who criticize their governments on social media. Rubio emphasized that free speech is a fundamental American right over which foreign governments have no authority, reinforcing the U.S. commitment to protecting online expression. The exact implementation and scope of this new policy remain to be seen, but it signals a firm stance against foreign interference in American free speech rights.</p>

          <p>Amid the Trump administration's ban on Harvard enrolling international students, college expert Jamie Beaton advises students to remain steadfast in their goal of attending the university. Beaton suggests that the political strife could create an advantage for Harvard hopefuls, especially those from abroad, as some applicants may turn to other schools. Despite the federal government's actions, Beaton believes Harvard's brand remains strong and resilient, and students should not be deterred from applying. He notes that Harvard's acceptance rate is under 4%, with roughly 18% of the Class of 2028 coming from abroad.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued a full pardon to Todd and Julie Chrisley, the reality TV stars convicted of bank and tax fraud offenses in 2022. The couple had been serving prison sentences after being found guilty of conspiring to defraud banks and evading federal income taxes. Trump's decision was influenced by appeals from their daughter, Savannah, who claimed her parents were unfairly targeted due to their conservative beliefs. The pardon corrects a deep injustice and restores two devoted parents to their family and community, according to their attorney. The Chrisleys' prosecution was tainted by multiple constitutional violations and political bias, as claimed by their lawyer.</p>

          <p>New research from Vanguard indicates that having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is the top predictor of financial well-being, surpassing income and assets. The survey of over 12,000 Vanguard investors revealed that $2,000 in savings increased financial well-being by 21%, while a $500,000 income increased it by 12%, and $1 million in assets boosted it by 18%. This suggests that preparedness for unplanned expenses is more critical for financial security than accumulating wealth. The median cost of an emergency is around $2,000, providing individuals with the confidence to handle unexpected financial stressors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Oklahoma, a military simulation company called MilSim West stages fake battles between NATO and Russian forces, drawing hundreds of participants who pay to engage in a realistic, albeit trauma-free, war experience. The events, which involve plastic pellet guns, blank ammunition, and night-vision goggles, are not intended to be about current events but rather exist in the realm of fantasy. However, many participants use the Russian invasion of Ukraine as a reference point for their uniforms and equipment, sometimes purchasing gear from military surplus stores that source merchandise directly from Ukraine's battlefields.

It suggests that the court is wary of provoking direct defiance from the president, particularly given the current political climate. The article criticizes the court for sometimes appearing to prioritize avoiding conflict over upholding legal principles, potentially emboldening the president to push the boundaries of executive authority. The author argues that the court must stand firm in defending the constitution and the rule of law, even if it means risking confrontation.</p>

The alliance aims to raise the total number of brigades provided by its members to between 120 and 130, a significant increase from the current target of around 80 brigades. These new targets do not yet account for potential U.S. troop drawdowns in Europe, which has raised concerns among European allies.</p>

          <p>A French court sentenced surgeon Joel Le Scouarnec to the maximum 20-year jail term for sexually assaulting hundreds of patients, mostly children, over two decades. Le Scouarnec, already imprisoned for previous sexual assault convictions, was found guilty of aggravated sexual assault against 299 patients, many of whom were under anesthesia. The court also rejected a demand from prosecutors to hold him in a treatment center after his release, citing his desire to make amends. The case has highlighted systemic failures that allowed Le Scouarnec to continue practicing medicine despite a prior conviction for possessing child sexual abuse material.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its conflict with Harvard University, urging federal agencies to find alternative institutions for government contracts currently held by Harvard. The administration cites concerns about professor bias, safety for Jewish students, and the use of "diversity" in admissions. This has led to funding cuts, investigations, and threats to the university's tax-exempt status, with the administration asserting its authority to influence curriculum, employment, and admissions policies. Harvard has sued the administration, arguing that these actions threaten academic freedom and long-held tenets of American culture.</p>

Germany will also continue to finance a significant part of the Starlink satellite communications system for Ukraine.

The Super Heavy first stage suffered a catastrophic failure upon engine reignition, while the Starship upper stage reached its planned suborbital trajectory but experienced a door failure and propellant leak. Despite these setbacks, SpaceX founder Elon Musk noted significant improvements over previous flights and emphasized the collection of valuable data.

Governor Josh Green emphasized that other states and nations will need to implement similar measures to tackle climate disasters. The measure adds 0.75% to the daily room rate tax and levies an 11% tax on cruise ship bills, aligning them with land-based accommodations.</p>

          <p>The AI industrial trade has regained momentum, with GE Vernova outperforming its peers, as its shares closed at an all-time high for the sixth consecutive session. While other data center-linked plays, like Eaton and Vertiv, have also rallied, they have yet to reach pre-DeepSeek levels and set new records. One potential reason for GE Vernova's success is that it is earlier in a potential upcycle for revenue and orders compared to Eaton and Vertiv, offering more revenue upside. However, the Club downgraded the stock to a hold-equivalent 2 rating due to this parabolic move higher. (not investment advice)</p>
