          <p>A Chinese scientific team has deployed a new, all-in-one research buoy in the South China Sea, anchored 3,500 meters below the surface. The system is designed for synchronized, multi-layered observations of both the ocean and the atmosphere, powered by a hybrid of solar, wind, and wave energy. Engineered to withstand extreme marine conditions, the buoy is equipped with advanced instruments like oceanic quantum lidar for a wide range of data collection. This deployment marks a significant step in China's deep-sea research capabilities, contributing to global oceanographic study efforts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China reported a significant 9.1% year-on-year drop in industrial profits for May, a downturn attributed to weak domestic demand and the ongoing trade dispute with the United States. Data from the National Bureau of Statistics highlighted particularly steep declines in the mining and automotive sectors. This decrease reflects broader economic challenges facing the nation, including falling prices and insufficient consumer spending, which are impacting the profitability of its core industrial base. The overall profits for the first five months of the year were down 1.1% from the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent surge in U.S. solar panel manufacturing, largely spurred by incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, is now at risk. Congressional Republicans are considering an early phase-out of key tax credits that encourage the use of American-made solar products. Industry leaders warn that removing these incentives prematurely would make it difficult for U.S. factories to compete with cheaper imports, jeopardizing tens of billions in investments and tens of thousands of potential jobs. The move could undermine the decade-long push to onshore the clean energy supply chain and challenge China's market dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

This sharp increase is driven by soaring domestic rice prices and supply shortages, which have spurred private companies to seek cheaper alternatives from countries like the United States and Taiwan. While government intervention through the sale of stockpiled rice may temporarily ease the situation, experts warn that import demand could rise again if the price of newly harvested domestic rice remains high.

          <p>As part of China's extensive anti-corruption campaign targeting its military and defense sectors, two more high-profile figures have been removed from their posts. Vice Admiral Li Hanjun, the chief of staff for the People's Liberation Army Navy, and Liu Shipeng, a top nuclear scientist, have been expelled from the National People's Congress. This action, announced by the NPC Standing Committee, underscores the sweeping nature of the crackdown that has seen numerous generals and defense executives implicated in recent months.</p>

          <p>Japan has carried out its first execution since July 2022, hanging Takahiro Shiraishi, who was convicted of the serial murders of nine people in 2017. Shiraishi, dubbed the "Twitter killer," lured victims who had expressed suicidal thoughts on social media to his apartment, where he murdered, dismembered, and stored their bodies. The execution has reignited the national debate over Japan's use of capital punishment, particularly following the recent high-profile exoneration of a man who spent more than four decades on death row.</p>

          <p>Following a series of recent technical outages, staffing shortages, and a fatal midair collision, the debate over privatizing the U.S. air traffic control system has re-emerged. Proponents point to models like Canada's privatized system as potentially more efficient and flexible for technology investments. However, opponents argue that the U.S. airspace is far too large and complex for such a model and that it could disadvantage smaller airports. For now, the current administration appears focused on modernizing the existing FAA-run system rather than pursuing the divisive issue of privatization.</p>

          <p>SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son has emphatically declared his company's full commitment to OpenAI, revealing planned investments totaling approximately $33.2 billion. Son stated his firm belief that OpenAI will eventually become the world's most valuable company and is central to his ambitious vision of developing "artificial superintelligence." He also revealed that he had wanted to be OpenAI's primary backer before Microsoft secured the role, and he now plans to deepen the partnership regardless of OpenAI's relationship with Microsoft.

          <p>President Trump's intensified crackdown on immigration is causing significant concern among U.S. businesses that rely heavily on immigrant labor. Companies in sectors like cleaning, caregiving, and construction are reporting the loss of authorized workers and facing severe difficulties in finding replacements. With nearly one in five U.S. workers being an immigrant, business leaders warn that the deportation drive threatens to choke off a critical component of the American workforce, which could slow economic growth and fuel inflation across the country.</p>
