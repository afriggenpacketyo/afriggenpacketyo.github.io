        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting is under fire after his department reduced ringfenced funding for maternity safety improvements. Campaigners, including Rhiannon Davies, who lost her daughter due to poor care, have called the decision a betrayal. The Royal College of Midwives has described the funding decision as taking a wrecking ball to maternity safety. While the Department of Health claims local health leaders will have more flexibility in allocating funds, critics fear maternity budgets will be cut, reversing years of progress.</p>

          <p>Defense attorneys for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are seeking to dismiss the state murder indictment. They argue that concurrent state and federal prosecutions violate double jeopardy and due process clauses.

Additionally, they seek to suppress statements Mangione made to authorities in Pennsylvania, claiming he was not properly advised of his Miranda rights.</p>

          <p>President Trump is closing a duty-free loophole for low-value packages, which is expected to increase prices for US customers of online retailers like Shein and Temu. The "de minimis" exemption allowed retailers to ship packages worth less than $800 to the US without paying duties or taxes. The move aims to tackle the illegal importation of synthetic opioids and protect American businesses. The suspension of the exemption will subject packages from mainland China and Hong Kong to import duties, potentially impacting online shoppers.</p>

Medical professionals have criticized the report, arguing that it misrepresents the current medical consensus and relies on select perspectives and data. The report mirrors the Cass Review published in the U.K. last year, which also questioned the benefits of gender-affirming care.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board argues that President Trump's first 100 days of his second term have damaged American democracy, as he attempts to create a presidency unconstrained by Congress or the courts. The board asserts that Trump has attacked pillars of democracy such as the separation of powers, due process, equal justice under law, and freedom of speech and the press. They call for a coalition of Americans across the political spectrum to oppose Trump's undemocratic actions and defend constitutional processes.</p>

          <p>The Chamber of Commerce has requested the Trump administration grant an "automatic exclusion" from new tariffs for U.S. small businesses that import goods from abroad. The Chamber warns that tariffs could cause "irreparable harm" to the small business community and increase the chances of a recession. Small businesses lack the financial resources to withstand the increase in tariff rates. Senator Ed Markey has also called on the Small Business Administration to grant tariff exemptions to Main Street enterprises.</p>
