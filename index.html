          <p>A widespread phishing scam is targeting users with emails disguised as official Microsoft security alerts. These messages create a sense of urgency, prompting victims to click on links that appear legitimate, often leading to Google Docs or SharePoint pages. However, these pages redirect to a fraudulent Microsoft login portal designed to steal user credentials. The article advises users to be vigilant by checking sender addresses, avoiding suspicious links, and using robust antivirus software to protect their personal information from such deceptive attacks.</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that US President Donald Trump is considering a diplomatic trip to China in the autumn, with a potential September visit now ruled out. Discussions between Washington and Beijing are ongoing to arrange the visit for either October or November. One possibility involves Trump meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping around the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in South Korea. Recent talks between the two nations' foreign ministers have been described as positive, suggesting a mutual desire to facilitate a leader-level summit later this year.</p>

          <p>The dating safety app "Tea," which allows women to vet potential partners, has suffered a significant data breach. The company confirmed that unauthorized access led to the theft of 72,000 images, some of which were used for identity verification and were supposed to have been deleted. An additional 59,000 images of posts, comments, and messages were also compromised. The app, which has 1.6 million users and has faced criticism for being anti-men, stated the breach affected members who signed up before February 2024 and is now working with cybersecurity experts to address the issue.</p>

          <p>Irina Krynina, a Russian mother, moved to Ukraine in 2023 to find her partner, a Russian soldier who had been captured. Although their relationship ended, she remained in Ukraine and founded "Our Way Out," a project that helps relatives of Russian POWs make contact and provides them with support. The initiative, which has gained a large online following, also documents the experiences of prisoners and aims to show Russians the reality of the war. Krynina's work highlights the human complexities of the conflict, as she advocates for prisoner exchanges to bring both Russian and Ukrainian soldiers home.</p>

          <p>China has launched a global action plan for artificial intelligence, emphasizing international cooperation just days after the U.S. announced its own AI strategy. Premier Li Qiang proposed a global AI cooperation organization, positioning China as a leader in multilateral tech development, particularly for nations in the Global South. This move highlights the growing tech race, with analysts suggesting the formation of two distinct camps: a U.S.-led alliance and a China-centric one. Despite U.S. restrictions on advanced chip access, China continues to develop its own formidable AI capabilities.</p>

          <p>A significant security operation is underway in South Ayrshire, Scotland, for U.S. President Donald Trump's four-day private visit to his Trump Turnberry golf resort. The visit includes plans for Trump to meet with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney. While hundreds gathered for protests in Aberdeen and Edinburgh, security around the resort remains tight, with road closures, a large perimeter fence, and police patrols. The visit has raised questions about security costs and coincides with the Scottish government announcing funding for a golf tournament at another of Trump's courses.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise album "Swag" has delivered a potential song of the summer with its No. 2 hit, "Daisies." The article suggests that the album's downtempo, R&B-influenced, and emotionally resonant sound is connecting with a public mood that favors soothing and introspective music over upbeat party anthems. Departing from his previous pop style, Bieber's new music is described as aqueous and gentle, reflecting a broader cultural trend towards more reserved and melancholic sounds. This shift is seen as a fitting soundtrack for a period marked by widespread unease and a collective desire for comfort.</p>

          <p>The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) narrowly avoided a $400 million funding cut after the Senate rejected the Trump administration's rescission proposal. While advocates for the global HIV/AIDS program are relieved, its long-term future remains precarious due to proposed cuts for the next fiscal year and the expiration of its congressional authorization. The program, credited with saving 26 million lives since 2003, has already faced significant disruptions, impacting HIV treatment and prevention services in several countries. Experts warn that without renewed authorization and stable funding, the global fight against AIDS is at risk.</p>

          <h2>Recall Effort Against China-Friendly Lawmakers in Taiwan Fails</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwanese voters have rejected an unprecedented attempt to recall two dozen lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to gain a majority in the legislature. The recall was initiated by supporters of the DPP who were angered by the opposition's blocking of key legislation, including defense budgets, and passing laws seen as favoring Beijing. The failure of the recall means President Lai Ching-te's administration will likely continue to face significant legislative resistance from the China-friendly opposition bloc.</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has blacklisted the Aerospace Information Research Institute (AIR) for procurement activities due to bid rigging and collusion. The suspension, which is for an unspecified duration, bars the prominent research body from participating in military contracts for goods and services. AIR, part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is a critical institution involved in research on communications, remote sensing, and electronic countermeasure systems, all closely tied to military applications. This is the second time this year the institute has been placed on a military procurement suspension list.</p>

          <p>Despite CEO Elon Musk's ambitious promises about driverless cars and robotaxis, Tesla investors are showing signs of concern as the company faces immediate challenges. The electric vehicle maker reported a 16% year-over-year decline in automotive sales, thinning profits, and faces the loss of regulatory credit revenue. The stock fell significantly after the latest earnings report, indicating that investors are now focusing more on current financial performance rather than futuristic visions. Increased competition from lower-cost rivals and a political backlash against Musk are compounding the pressure on the company's near-term outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's authority to impose widespread tariffs is facing a critical legal test in a federal appeals court. The lawsuit challenges his use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify duties on numerous countries, a power he has used for most of his major trade actions. A lower court previously ruled that Trump exceeded his authority, though that decision was paused pending appeal. Experts believe the case is destined for the Supreme Court and that a loss for the administration could invalidate nearly all of Trump's recent trade deals and tariff implementations.

From his troubled youth and founding of the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath to his dismissal for substance abuse and subsequent successful solo career, Osbourne's journey was tumultuous. He later reinvented himself as a beloved, bumbling television father on the reality show "The Osbournes." The author remembers him as both the "Prince of Darkness" and a "court jester," a man who, as his own lyrics stated, refused to die an ordinary man.</p>

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted Niger's democratically elected president, conditions in the country have reportedly worsened. The junta, which cited insecurity and economic hardship as justification for its takeover, has cracked down on civil liberties, forced NGOs to cease operations, and deepened the nation's political isolation by withdrawing from ECOWAS. Citizens who have lost jobs and human rights groups report a deteriorating situation, with arbitrary detentions and suppression of the media. The military leader's recent swearing-in for a five-year term suggests a return to civilian rule is unlikely in the near future.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing a significant rise in loneliness, with young people being particularly affected. Experts attribute this trend to the lingering social effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the pervasive influence of social media. Studies show that one in five teenagers feel lonely, and sociologists warn this can make them more susceptible to authoritarian thinking and political extremism. The problem is not confined to the young, as surveys indicate that a majority of Germans experience loneliness, a trend correlated with the rise of single-person households and exacerbated by factors like unemployment and poverty.</p>

However, the recent revelations of his cruelty and abuse have tainted that legacy, turning a figure of aspiration into a symbol of betrayal.

          <p>As climate change leads to hotter and more frequent heat waves, Americans are spending more time indoors to escape the heat, which may be contributing to a form of seasonal affective disorder (SAD). This "summer SAD" is characterized by symptoms like insomnia and restlessness, and experts believe it could be linked not only to the direct effects of heat but also to the social isolation and lack of sunlight from staying inside. While summer SAD is rarer and less studied than its winter counterpart, there is growing concern about the long-term mental health impacts of increasingly extreme summer temperatures.</p>
