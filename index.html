          <p>A gunman drove his truck into a Michigan church during Sunday services, opening fire and killing four people while wounding eight, before setting the building ablaze. The suspect was subsequently killed in a shootout with police, and the FBI has taken the lead on the investigation, classifying it as an act of targeted violence. The fire caused a partial collapse of the structure, and authorities are actively working to determine the motive behind the attack, including any potential connections to the church or recent events. The incident prompted multiple bomb threats in the area.</p>

          <p>The article explores the concept of 'energy vampires' in friendships, individuals who deplete one's emotional and mental reserves through constant self-absorption, complaints, or a lack of genuine interest. Psychologists and journalists highlight common signs, such as an excessive need for attention or subtle mood-chipping comments. Practical advice includes engaging in honest conversations to express feelings, establishing clear boundaries to protect personal space, and altering shared activities to prevent their dominance. The goal is to safeguard one's well-being while navigating challenging social dynamics.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has announced his withdrawal from the mayoral reelection race, citing persistent media speculation about his future and the Campaign Finance Board's decision to withhold millions in funds. This move sets the stage for a three-way contest between Zohran Mamdani, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, and Curtis Sliwa. Adams' tenure has been marked by a federal corruption scandal and scrutiny over his relationship with the Trump administration, which reportedly dismissed his bribery case. Despite suspending his campaign, his name will still appear on the November ballot.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than 100,000 federal workers are anticipated to formally resign on Tuesday, marking the largest mass resignation in US history, as part of a Trump administration initiative to significantly reduce the federal workforce. This unprecedented event coincides with a congressional deadline for funding, with the White House directing agencies to prepare for extensive firings if a budget agreement is not reached. Employees describe a climate of 'fear and intimidation,' feeling compelled to leave due to job insecurity and a perceived undermining of their agency's mission. The situation highlights deep partisan divisions.</p>

          <p>CM Energy President Wang Yongxin emphasized that developing a reliable green methanol supply chain is crucial for Hong Kong to achieve its goals in sustainable marine fuels. While liquefied natural gas and biodiesel operations are already established, securing tax-free mainland-produced methanol is essential for future growth. The company's new dual-fuel vessel, CM Hong Kong, currently uses a quarter green methanol, which is significantly more expensive than traditional fuels. However, increased usage is projected from 2027 due to Europe's carbon emissions-based import tariff regime.</p>

The unit recently closed due to low referrals, and its co-located dementia unit also faced temporary admission halts over safety concerns.

          <p>President Trump's administration is pushing for an expedited Supreme Court review of his executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship, despite two federal courts having already blocked its enforcement. The government argues for restricting American citizenship to those lawfully entitled, challenging over a century of legal precedent interpreting the 14th Amendment. Critics, including the ACLU, denounce the order as illegal and cruel, warning of profound societal impact if the Supreme Court rules in Trump's favor.

          <p>Oregon is suing the Trump administration to prevent the deployment of 200 National Guard troops to Portland, arguing the move is 'unlawful' and risks inciting public outcry. President Trump authorized the deployment to protect federal property from 'Antifa and other domestic terrorists,' labeling Portland 'War ravaged.' Governor Tina Kotek maintains there is no national security threat and local law enforcement is capable. This action expands federal troop deployments amid a wider crackdown on illegal immigration, raising concerns about civil liberties and potential federal overreach, echoing previous incidents in 2020.</p>

          <p>The picturesque Dutch village of Zaanse Schans, renowned for its historic windmills, plans to implement a €17.50 entry fee for tourists starting next spring. This measure aims to combat overtourism, as the village, with a population of just 100, received 2.6 million visitors last year, leading to privacy intrusions for residents. The fee will include admission to the museum and windmills, with anticipated revenues funding maintenance and new infrastructure. While some tourists find the cost steep, others support the initiative to preserve the village's unique charm.</p>

          <p>Weight-loss injections, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, are increasingly creating a two-tier system where access is largely dictated by wealth, despite some NHS availability. Thousands of NHS patients are reportedly missing out due to a 'postcode lottery' in eligibility criteria, while private costs can range from £100-£350 monthly. Price increases, like Eli Lilly's Mounjaro, further exacerbate concerns that health inequalities could worsen, especially in deprived areas with higher obesity rates.

          <p>Indian authorities in Pune successfully dismantled an ambergris smuggling operation, seizing two kilograms of the highly sought-after substance, also known as whale vomit, with an estimated value exceeding $225,000. Ambergris is designated as a protected item under the Wildlife Protection Act, making its possession or trade a serious offense. While it can be obtained without harming sperm whales, its use in luxury perfumes often perpetuates animal exploitation. Three individuals have been taken into custody, and experts advocate for the use of synthetic alternatives to protect marine wildlife.</p>
