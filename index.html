          <p>The Trump administration's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" may miss its self-imposed July Fourth deadline, according to House Speaker Mike Johnson. The legislative process has been complicated by a Senate parliamentarian's rejection of a key Medicaid provision, a setback for Republicans. President Trump suggested Democrats are blocking the bill for political reasons, despite what he frames as its benefits, including border security. He expressed hope that some Democrats, like Senator John Fetterman, might support the legislation.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has scheduled further arguments regarding Louisiana's new congressional map, which includes a second majority-Black district. This decision temporarily keeps the new map, created to comply with the Voting Rights Act, in place for now. The case originated after the state's Republican-led legislature redrew the map, which was then challenged as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The outcome of this protracted legal battle could significantly influence the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives in future elections.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the authority of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which block the enforcement of government policies across the entire country. The 6-3 ruling stemmed from challenges to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the order itself, it stated that such broad injunctions likely exceed the power granted to federal courts. This decision significantly curtails a tool frequently used to halt policies from both Republican and Democratic administrations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy is showing signs of strain from trade tariffs, with recent data indicating a larger-than-expected rise in inflation.

Simultaneously, retailers and manufacturers are reducing their inventory levels in response to trade uncertainty and concerns about consumer spending. This combination of rising prices and lower inventory suggests a potentially challenging economic period ahead, with a milder holiday shopping season expected. (not investment advice)</p>

A large plume of smoke has spread over the city center, leading authorities to close roads and advise residents to keep windows and doors shut.

          <p>The third and final season of "Squid Game" shifts its focus from a sharp critique of capitalism to a broader, more shallow examination of human cruelty. The article argues that by centering the cartoonishly villainous "VIPs" and introducing more contrived, deadly games, the show abandons the nuanced social commentary that defined its first season. While still compulsively watchable with impressive set pieces, the new season's focus on simple good-versus-evil dynamics, including a bizarre plot involving a newborn contestant, ultimately flattens the characters and themes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed a Texas law requiring pornography websites to verify the age of their users, typically through a government ID or face scan. The 6-3 decision rejected arguments from adult entertainment companies, who contended the law unconstitutionally burdens adults' free speech and creates privacy risks. The court, however, sided with Texas, which argued the law is a necessary measure to protect minors from harmful content. This ruling sets a significant precedent for the more than a dozen other states that have enacted similar age-verification laws.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt at a record high, many consumers are exploring debt settlement as a relief option. This article explains that while there is no official cap, settlement becomes less effective for debts exceeding approximately $100,000. For such large amounts, creditors are more likely to pursue legal action, the required lump-sum payments become unrealistic for many, and fees from relief companies can be substantial. The piece suggests that settlement is most viable for debts between $7,500 and $75,000 and outlines alternatives like consolidation loans.</p>

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court sided with a group of Maryland parents, ruling they have a right to opt their children out of public school instruction that conflicts with their religious beliefs. The case involved Christian, Muslim, and Jewish parents who objected to elementary school readings of storybooks with LGBTQ themes. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Samuel Alito, stated that denying an opt-out unconstitutionally burdens the parents' right to free exercise of religion. The dissenting justices warned the ruling could create chaos for public schools.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in New Orleans has ordered a Catholic religious order to pay nearly $2.4 million to a 68-year-old man who was sexually abused as a child at a summer camp in the late 1960s. This is a landmark verdict, being the first of its kind since a 2024 Louisiana law allowed survivors to seek damages regardless of when the abuse occurred.

          <p>Before achieving global fame as a novelist, Toni Morrison had a parallel career as a book editor at Random House in the 1970s, where she championed a generation of Black writers. A new book, "Toni at Random," explores how she fought to publish uncompromising voices like Angela Davis and Huey P. Newton for a mass audience. Morrison believed that literature written for a specific community could achieve universal appeal without diluting its integrity. Her work as an editor helped prove there was a broad market for Black literature, fundamentally changing the publishing landscape.</p>
