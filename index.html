          <p>Fitch Ratings expresses concern that Southwest Airlines' new baggage fees and other policy changes, including assigned seating and expiring flight credits, could negatively impact customer satisfaction and the airline's overall performance.

          <p>Hungary's announcement of its withdrawal from the International Criminal Court (ICC) coincides with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's state visit.  This decision follows the ICC's issuance of an arrest warrant for Netanyahu, prompting criticism from Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who views the ICC as a "political court."  The withdrawal, while symbolically significant, does not affect ongoing ICC proceedings and may set a precedent for other nations questioning international justice based on political alliances.</p>
