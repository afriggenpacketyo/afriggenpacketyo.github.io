          <p>Severe storms and subsequent flooding have resulted in at least 34 fatalities in and around Beijing, with the majority occurring in the city's outlying districts. The torrential rainfall, exceeding 21 inches in some areas, has prompted the evacuation of over 80,000 people and caused widespread damage to infrastructure, including roads and communication lines. The article provides context through firsthand accounts from residents who described the sudden and overwhelming nature of the floodwaters. Authorities have issued top-level emergency responses and released water from a major reservoir to manage the crisis.</p>

          <p>The European Union is launching a major initiative to build "gigawatt" AI factories in an effort to bolster its competitiveness against the U.S. and China in the artificial intelligence sector. These facilities are envisioned as comprehensive ecosystems that bring together immense computing power, data, and talent to accelerate the development of AI models and applications. With an initial investment of 20 billion euros, the EU aims to enhance its technological sovereignty and support its thousands of AI startups, though significant challenges related to private funding and massive power consumption remain.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting occurred in a Midtown Manhattan skyscraper when a gunman killed four people before taking his own life. One of the victims was an off-duty NYPD officer, identified as Didarul Islam, who was working as a security guard. The shooter, a 27-year-old Las Vegas resident with a history of mental illness, reportedly drove cross-country before initiating the attack in the building's lobby and on an upper floor. The incident, which prompted a massive police response and a lockdown, marks the 254th mass shooting in the U.S. this year.</p>

          <p>A new report from Canalys reveals a significant shift in global manufacturing, as India has surpassed China to become the top exporter of smartphones to the United States. In the second quarter, Indian-assembled smartphones constituted 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from just 13% the previous year, while China's share fell to 25%. This transformation is primarily fueled by Apple's accelerated diversification of its supply chain away from China due to ongoing trade tensions and tariff uncertainties. The data highlights a broader trend of companies relocating final assembly to serve the American market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Singapore Airlines (SIA) fell by over 8% after the carrier announced a 59% drop in its first-quarter net profit, a decline attributed to lower interest income and losses from associated companies. A significant factor in the downturn was the financial performance of Air India, in which SIA holds a 25.1% stake. Analysts noted that Air India's losses were deeper than expected and are likely to continue affecting SIA's bottom line in the near term. The results reflect a normalization from pandemic-era highs as market competition increases and cargo revenue softens. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark decision, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been found guilty of witness tampering and bribery, marking a significant moment in the nation's history. The court determined that Uribe, who governed from 2002 to 2010, conspired to influence imprisoned former paramilitary members to change their testimony regarding his alleged links to these groups. The case, which originated from a libel suit Uribe himself filed, has been highly polarizing. Uribe, who faces up to 12 years in prison, is expected to appeal the verdict, which has drawn both condemnation and praise.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat a looming demographic crisis, China's government has announced its first nationwide subsidy to encourage more births. The new policy will offer parents 3,600 yuan (about $500) annually for each child under the age of three, benefiting an estimated 20 million families. This move comes as the country's birth rate continues to decline despite the abolition of the one-child policy nearly a decade ago. The high cost of raising children is a major deterrent for many families, and this national scheme follows various local pilot programs aimed at reversing the trend.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has filed a formal misconduct complaint against federal Judge James E. Boasberg, escalating a conflict over the administration's deportation policies. The complaint alleges the judge made improper public comments suggesting the Trump administration would defy court orders, thereby undermining judicial integrity. This action follows Judge Boasberg's ruling that blocked certain deportation flights to El Salvador and his subsequent finding of probable cause that the administration committed contempt of court by ignoring his order. The complaint seeks an investigation and potential sanctions against the judge.</p>

          <p>School districts across the United States are facing a potential crisis in student mental health services due to the abrupt discontinuation of federal grants by the Trump administration. Citing issues with diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, the Department of Education suspended millions in funding, leaving many districts unable to retain counselors and social workers. A CBS News analysis found that 47 states already fall short of recommended counselor-to-student ratios, a problem especially acute in rural areas. The cuts are now being challenged in court by 16 states.</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old U.S. citizen has spoken out after video of his violent arrest by immigration agents in Florida drew widespread scrutiny. Kenny Laynez, who is Hispanic, was detained with his mother and coworkers during a traffic stop, where an officer told him, "You got no rights here." The incident, which involved a Taser and threatening language captured on video, highlights concerns from advocates about the expansion of state and local law enforcement's role in federal immigration crackdowns.

          <p>A new trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union is drawing mixed reactions, with some economists arguing it is an "unbalanced deal" that will harm the EU's economy. The agreement imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, a significant increase, while American goods will face no new tariffs. In return, the EU has pledged to purchase hundreds of billions in U.S. energy and make substantial investments. While the Trump administration touts the deal as a win for American industry, some analysts predict it will reduce the EU's GDP. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the article notes the inherent risks for Starmer in associating with the free-wheeling and unpredictable president.

          <p>USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA after the organization denied his waiver for a final season of eligibility. Wingfield, a transfer player, is challenging the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," arguing it is anticompetitive and unfairly penalizes him for disruptions caused by the pandemic and a previous injury. The lawsuit claims the denial robs him of a significant name, image, and likeness (NIL) opportunity and the chance to enhance his career at a major program. The outcome could have a significant impact on USC's already thin offensive line for the upcoming season.</p>
