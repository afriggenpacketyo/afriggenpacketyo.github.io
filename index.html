          <h2>Treasury Yields Plummet Amidst Recession Fears Fueled by Trade War</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The 10-year Treasury yield significantly dropped below 4% on Friday, driven by investor anxieties surrounding a potential global recession triggered by escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China.  China's retaliatory tariffs against President Trump's policy caused a flight to safety in bonds. This sharp decline contrasts with earlier optimism in the year when yields exceeded 4.8%.  The situation highlights the market's sensitivity to trade disputes and their impact on economic growth.</p>
