        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives passed President Trump's signature legislative package, a massive bill containing trillions in tax cuts and increased defense and immigration spending. The measure, which passed 218-214 after a marathon overnight session, now heads to the president's desk to be signed into law. Despite Republican unity, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit over ten years and cause millions to lose health insurance due to significant cuts to Medicaid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's newly passed legislative package is set to significantly reshape the U.S. energy landscape by delivering major priorities to the fossil fuel industry while eliminating crucial support for renewable energy. The law opens more federal lands and waters to drilling, slashes royalty payments for producers, and enhances tax credits for carbon capture used in oil extraction. Conversely, it phases out long-standing investment and production tax credits for solar and wind power, a move that clean energy advocates warn will undermine American manufacturing and energy leadership.

          <p>A wildfire in Central California, dubbed the Madre Fire, has rapidly grown to over 35,000 acres, establishing it as the largest blaze in the state this year. Originating in the Los Padres National Forest, the fire has prompted evacuation orders and warnings in San Luis Obispo County. State and federal agencies are operating in unified command to combat the fire, which is currently 5% contained and threatens approximately 50 structures. The cause of the fire remains under investigation, and smoke is impacting air quality in neighboring counties.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy reveals that the tax cuts in President Trump's recently passed legislation will disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans, with the exact amount varying by state. The top 1% of U.S. households are projected to receive an average tax cut of about $66,000. However, the wealthiest residents in states with no personal income tax, such as Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas, will see the largest benefits, with average cuts exceeding $100,000 annually.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite being a major legislative achievement for President Trump, the newly passed "big, beautiful bill" is deeply unpopular with the American public, according to multiple polls. This article explores the historical trend of presidents and their parties facing political backlash after passing large, partisan bills via the budget reconciliation process. Such legislation often energizes the opposition and can lead to significant losses in subsequent midterm elections, a pattern seen with presidents from Reagan to Biden. The bill's unpopularity could therefore present a significant political challenge for Republicans moving forward.</p>

Other indicators are a debt-to-income ratio surpassing 40% and being unable to qualify for affordable debt consolidation loans, signaling that the debt has become unmanageable alone.

Senators like Josh Hawley and Ron Johnson, who had initially raised strong objections, eventually fell in line.

          <p>Edward Kelley, a Tennessee man who was pardoned by President Trump for his involvement in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, has been sentenced to life in prison for a separate, unrelated case. A federal jury convicted Kelley of conspiring to attack and kill federal agents who were investigating him for his role in the Capitol siege. Prosecutors stated that Kelley created a "kill list" of 36 law enforcement personnel and sought to incite a "civil war." The presidential pardon for his Jan. 6 offenses did not extend to this subsequent conspiracy conviction.</p>

          <p>For homeowners looking to borrow $150,000, this article compares the costs of a home equity loan versus a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Currently, average interest rates for both products are nearly identical, resulting in very similar monthly payments. However, the key difference lies in their rate structures: home equity loans have a fixed rate, providing predictable payments, while HELOCs have a variable rate that can change over time. This means a HELOC could become cheaper if rates fall but more expensive if they rise, introducing long-term cost uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With credit card interest rates at historic highs, this article highlights five costly mistakes that can worsen a person's debt situation. These include making only the minimum payment, which prolongs repayment and maximizes interest charges, and ignoring the expiration dates of 0% APR promotional offers, which can lead to a sudden spike in rates. Other pitfalls are using high-fee cash advances that accrue interest immediately, closing old credit cards, which can hurt your credit score, and making late payments, which trigger fees and penalty APRs.

          <p>OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever has announced he will become the CEO of Safe Superintelligence (SSI), the AI startup he launched last year. The move comes after Meta hired Daniel Gross, who had been serving as SSI's CEO. Sutskever, who will continue to lead the technical team, reaffirmed his commitment to keeping the company independent despite acquisition interest from other major tech firms. This leadership change occurs amid an aggressive AI talent acquisition push by Meta, which has been investing billions to hire top researchers and engineers in the field.</p>
