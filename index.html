          <p>Donald Trump and Elon Musk, once allies, are now engaged in a public feud after Musk criticized Trump's tax-cut and spending bill. Billionaires, politicians, and analysts have weighed in on the dispute, with some urging reconciliation and others calling for government intervention in Musk's companies. Bill Ackman called for peace, while Steve Bannon suggested seizing SpaceX through the Defense Production Act and stripping Musk of his security clearance. Mark Cuban seemingly endorsed Musk's proposal for a new political party, and Ian Bremmer commented on the power dynamic between Trump and Musk. Optimism is low due to the high profile and public nature of the conflict.</p>

          <p>Lululemon shares have experienced a significant drop after the company reduced its annual profit forecast, citing the impact of Trump's tariffs and concerns about a slowing U.S. economy. The company reported lower store traffic in the Americas, attributing it to economic uncertainty, inflationary pressures, and lower consumer confidence. Lululemon plans to implement strategic price increases on a small portion of its products and cut costs to mitigate the effects of the tariffs. Other clothing and footwear brands have also warned about the potential for higher prices due to the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Japanese high court overturned a ruling that had ordered former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. to pay damages for failing to prevent the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The Tokyo High Court's decision reverses a district court's order for the former executives to pay around 13 trillion yen ($90 billion) in compensation. The focal point of the appeal trial was whether the management's decisions on tsunami countermeasures were appropriate, after a TEPCO unit estimated a tsunami of up to 15.7 meters could hit the plant.</p>

          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders are often denied credit for "dead time" spent in detention before adjudication, unlike adults in the criminal justice system. In about two dozen states, this time doesn't count toward any incarceration they may face, adding months to their confinement. Experts argue that this practice undermines the rehabilitative goals of the juvenile justice system and wastes resources, as detention centers often lack rehabilitative programs. Some states are exploring reforms to address this issue, but challenges remain in ensuring that young people receive fair treatment and access to services.</p>
