          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China convened in Geneva for high-stakes trade negotiations aimed at de-escalating tensions stemming from President Trump's tariff war. The meetings, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, represent the first face-to-face discussions since the U.S. increased tariffs on Chinese goods to 145 percent, prompting retaliatory levies from China. Economists and investors are closely monitoring the talks, as the outcome could significantly impact the global economy, supply chains, and consumer prices. Despite low expectations for an immediate breakthrough, the fact that both sides are engaging in dialogue has raised hopes for a potential resolution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has implemented export controls on rare earth elements, which are critical for manufacturing military equipment and space technology, in response to increased U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. These restrictions, which went into effect in April, have raised concerns within the U.S. defense industry, as China dominates the global supply of these elements. The export control list includes seven categories of medium and heavy rare earths, potentially impacting the production of jet engines, radar systems, and other essential military technologies. This move is seen as a strategic maneuver in the ongoing trade war between Beijing and Washington, adding further uncertainty to America's defense industries.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's pursuit of personal profits through cryptocurrency ventures is jeopardizing his administration's efforts to pass crypto legislation. Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act, intended to regulate stablecoins, due to concerns that Trump's meme coin and other crypto projects create conflicts of interest. Critics argue that these ventures allow individuals to enrich the president by purchasing cryptocurrency he owns or controls. This situation has led to defections in support for stablecoin legislation, as Democrats call for stronger anti-money laundering provisions and safeguards against foreign influence.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may struggle to avoid President Trump's "Too Late" label amid a complex economic landscape influenced by volatile policies and tariffs. Economists suggest that the Fed's historical tendency to act cautiously could lead to delayed responses to economic shifts. While Trump pushes for rate cuts, Powell is balancing threats to both growth and inflation, making inaction the most prudent approach for now. The Fed's history of lagging behind economic trends raises concerns that policymakers will miss critical signals amid tariff-related uncertainties.</p>

The high-level meeting, the first since President Trump imposed new tariffs, signals a potential easing of tensions.

The timing of the talks coincides with Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow, allowing Beijing to project strength while engaging in negotiations.</p>

A U.S.-based study found at-home screening to be as effective as in-office screenings, with women overwhelmingly preferring the self-screening method.
