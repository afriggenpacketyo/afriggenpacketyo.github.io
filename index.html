          <p>President Trump stated he has no intention of firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, despite previously criticizing Powell's monetary policies. Trump nominated Powell to lead the Fed and has repeatedly urged him to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy. These comments follow speculation that Trump was exploring options to remove Powell, which raised concerns about the Fed's independence. Trump also expressed optimism about improving trade relations with China, suggesting potential de-escalation of the trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major automotive industry groups are jointly lobbying the Trump administration to reconsider imposing 25% tariffs on auto parts, arguing that the tariffs could jeopardize U.S. automotive production. The groups, representing automakers, suppliers, and dealers, warn that many suppliers are already financially strained and unable to absorb additional costs. They argue that the tariffs could lead to production stoppages, layoffs, and bankruptcies within the industry, disrupting the global supply chain. The letter comes after Trump indicated he might consider helping companies needing time to adjust their production.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that recent comments from President Trump indicating a potential softening of the U.S. stance on tariffs against China may give Beijing a strategic advantage in trade negotiations. Trump's remarks about reducing tariffs, though not eliminating them, are seen as a sign of U.S. anxiety to reach a deal. This perceived eagerness could allow China to secure more favorable terms in any potential trade agreement, as China isn't showing any signs of impatience in the trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>The deadline for Real ID enforcement is rapidly approaching, but many states are not yet fully compliant, potentially causing disruptions at airport security checkpoints and federal buildings. As of May 7th, Americans will need a Real ID to pass through airport security or enter federal buildings. A CBS News analysis revealed that numerous states have low compliance rates, meaning a significant portion of travelers may face delays or be denied access. The Real ID Act was passed in 2005 to enhance the security of state-issued identification.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that tariffs on goods from China will be reduced 'substantially' following comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about de-escalating trade tensions. Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced he will be stepping back from his role at the 'department of government efficiency' (Doge) starting in May, following a dip in Tesla's profits amid criticism of his White House involvement. These developments reflect ongoing shifts in both trade policy and the role of business leaders in government.</p>

          <p>China's energy-storage industry is facing difficulties due to the escalating US-China trade war and reduced government support, prompting concerns about price competition. Higher tariffs are expected to impact exports to the US, leading to potential cuts in capital expenditure by Chinese producers. The industry is also grappling with a price war due to overproduction, which has caused export prices to decline. Battery energy-storage systems are crucial for the global transition to clean energy, with China being a major player in the sector.</p>

          <p>While China grapples with declining birth rates, Guangdong province, particularly the Chaoshan region, is experiencing higher birth rates due to strong cultural traditions that value larger families and lineage. The province recorded over a million births, making it the top province for new births in China for the seventh consecutive year. This contrasts with the national trend, where many young people are reluctant to have children. The region's emphasis on ancestral halls and carrying on the family name contributes to its higher birth rate.</p>
