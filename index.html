          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, indicating persistent deflationary pressures.

Despite stimulus measures from Beijing, demand remains sluggish, and trade tensions with the U.S. add to the downward pressure on prices. Chinese policymakers are being urged to implement more forceful measures to stimulate consumption and address deflationary risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British energy firms are being paid significant sums to curtail power generation due to grid capacity limitations. The current electricity grid, designed for coal and gas plants, struggles to accommodate renewable energy generated in remote areas. This system results in compensation payments to firms like Ocean Winds when their output is restricted, while gas-fired power stations are paid to provide more electricity. The government is considering regional pricing to address these inefficiencies, but the plan faces opposition from energy firms and concerns about its impact on consumer bills.</p>
