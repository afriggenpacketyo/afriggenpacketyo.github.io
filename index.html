          <p>Jane Ragsdale, the owner and director of the Heart O' the Hills camp for girls in Kerrville, Texas, was among those killed in the catastrophic Guadalupe River flood. Remembered as a generous and influential community leader, Ragsdale had run the camp since 1988, teaching generations of girls life skills. Beyond her work at the camp, she was also deeply involved in community organizations and mission work in Guatemala. Her loss is deeply felt in Kerr County, where she is remembered as someone who would have been at the forefront of the recovery efforts, helping anyone in need.</p>

          <p>A year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, survivors and the family of the man killed, Corey Comperatore, are sharing their stories. Survivors James Copenhaver and David Dutch, both veterans, are still recovering from severe physical and psychological injuries but are focused on living life to the fullest. The Comperatore family continues to seek answers regarding security failures that day, questioning why the rally proceeded despite known threats. The article highlights their resilience and the lingering questions surrounding the event, which an independent review panel attributed to significant Secret Service failures.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Alliance Between US Tech Sector and 'Maga' Movement on China Policy May Face Challenges</h2>

          <p>A Chinese academic analysis highlights a growing, yet potentially unstable, alliance between some US tech leaders and the 'Make America Great Again' movement. This 'tech hawk' faction advocates for sustained pressure on China's technological development and further decoupling in high-tech industries. The analysis points to deepening ties between the tech and defense sectors as a sign of a more assertive, interventionist posture. However, the article suggests that underlying tensions between the tech elite and the broader Maga camp could ultimately undermine this coalition's efforts to reshape US politics and foreign policy toward China.

          <p>Evacuation orders have been issued for parts of Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona due to multiple wildfires sparked by lightning. The Dragon Bravo Fire has led to the immediate evacuation of all residents on the North Rim, following the evacuation of about 500 visitors the previous night. A larger blaze, the White Sage Fire, is burning north of the park, also prompting evacuations and road closures. Firefighting efforts are being challenged by strong winds, low humidity, and critically dry conditions, with both fires currently at 0% containment.</p>

This action starved the engines of fuel, leading to a total loss of power and the subsequent crash that killed 260 people. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, with the other denying he did so.

          <h2>Proposed Replacement of Historic Prague Railway Bridge Sparks Debate</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A plan to dismantle and replace Prague's historic 123-year-old Vysehrad railway bridge is facing significant criticism from architects, preservationists, and the public. The Railway Authority argues that the corroded bridge cannot handle projected increases in rail traffic and needs to be replaced with a new, three-track structure. However, a coalition of experts, backed by a public petition and UNESCO, insists the iconic bridge can be repaired in place for less money and disruption. The debate highlights the classic conflict between preserving cultural heritage and meeting the demands of modern infrastructure in a historically rich city.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has laid off 1,353 civil and foreign service employees as part of a sweeping reorganization plan by the Trump administration. The cuts are part of a larger staff reduction of nearly 3,000 people this year, aimed at streamlining what the administration calls a 'bloated bureaucracy.' Many of the layoffs hit offices focused on human rights, refugee resettlement, and foreign assistance, including the entire leadership team of the Afghan relocation office. Critics, including Democratic senators and the American Foreign Service Association, argue the indiscriminate cuts will undermine U.S. diplomacy and national security.</p>

          <p>The western Mediterranean Sea is experiencing its most extreme marine heatwave ever recorded for this time of year, with sea surface temperatures regularly exceeding 30C. Scientists are expressing high concern, as the prolonged and intense heat arrived much earlier than usual, threatening devastating consequences for marine life. Species like crucial seaweeds and seagrasses struggle to cope, which could have cascading effects on fish stocks and the overall ecosystem. This event, driven by global warming, highlights the Mediterranean's vulnerability as a climate change hotspot and could also fuel more extreme weather on land.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intensified its criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, with the Office of Management and Budget accusing him of overseeing an 'ostentatious' office renovation that may be 'violating the law.' This new line of attack comes as President Trump continues to pressure Powell over the Fed's decision not to slash interest rates, which the central bank has held steady to control inflation. Powell has defended the renovation project, calling descriptions of it misleading and inaccurate. The conflict underscores the tension between the administration's economic demands and the Federal Reserve's traditional independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent economic data and a stark warning from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) are setting a gloomy tone for the UK's upcoming autumn Budget. The OBR report described the nation's long-term fiscal risks as 'daunting,' with debt potentially soaring, and stated the UK cannot afford its current promises. This, combined with new figures showing a dip in GDP, suggests that Chancellor Rachel Reeves may need to implement significant tax rises of £10 billion to £20 billion.
