          <p>Millions across the Western United States are currently enduring a severe heatwave, with temperatures soaring past 100 degrees Fahrenheit in parts of California, Oregon, Washington, and Arizona, offering little nighttime relief. The National Weather Service has issued extreme heat warnings, emphasizing the significant risk of heat-related illnesses and urging residents to seek air-conditioned spaces and maintain hydration. These dangerously dry conditions are simultaneously escalating wildfire risks, with large blazes, such as the Pickett Fire in Napa County and the Flat Fire in central Oregon, actively challenging containment efforts. The persistent extreme heat and arid weather are making firefighting particularly difficult, underscoring the severe environmental crisis gripping the region.</p>

          <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov claimed European leaders are obstructing peace in Ukraine, praising Donald Trump's efforts to end the conflict, while US Vice President JD Vance stated America would persist in brokering talks. Lavrov denied Russia targets civilians and asserted that Trump and Putin respect each other's national interests, despite the recent Anchorage summit yielding no ceasefire or leader meeting. Vance highlighted Russia's "significant concessions," including recognizing Ukraine's territorial integrity and dropping demands for a puppet regime in Kyiv. Both sides acknowledge a complex, protracted diplomatic process, with Vance not ruling out further sanctions to exert leverage.</p>

          <p>The family of Kansas State Wildcats quarterback Avery Johnson issued a public apology following a physical altercation that occurred after the team's loss to Iowa State in Dublin, Ireland. A video circulated on social media appeared to show Johnson’s father and brother involved in a fistfight with other fans outside the stadium, part of the Aer Lingus College Football Classic. The family statement acknowledged that "senseless bickering escalated into an unnecessary fight" and expressed deep regret to Kansas State University, its alumni, and fans. They affirmed that differences have been resolved, taking full responsibility for the incident and committing to ensure it doesn't happen again, while Avery Johnson had a strong game despite the loss.</p>

          <p>An Ohio builder successfully constructed a highly functional 19-square-foot tiny house for just $5,000, demonstrating creative small-space living in his front yard. The compact dwelling, built on an old utility trailer, includes essential amenities like an AC/heating unit, a tilting bed in a vaulted loft, a storage bench, a portable toilet, and an outdoor shower system. Everything, including the mini-fridge, is powered by rooftop solar panels, with an option for outlet charging. The builder aimed to prove that a livable space could be created with minimal square footage, even testing its resilience during a snowstorm and camping with his son. While not for full-time occupancy by his family, the project showcases efficient design and the potential for off-grid living, inspiring others to embrace minimalism.</p>

          <p>The Football Association (FA) has launched an investigation into a provocative banner unfurled by Crystal Palace fans during a 1-1 draw against Nottingham Forest at Selhurst Park. The controversial display depicted Forest owner Evangelos Marinakis holding a gun to midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White's head, accompanied by text denying Marinakis's involvement in various illicit activities, which he has consistently denied. Nottingham Forest expressed significant disappointment that the banner was allowed into the stadium, deeming it inflammatory and xenophobic. This incident further heightens tensions between the clubs, following Crystal Palace's recent relegation from the Europa League due to UEFA's multi-club ownership rules, with Forest taking their place.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans a significant overhaul of its asylum appeals system, aiming to reduce "unacceptable delays" and decrease the reliance on hotels for asylum seekers, a policy ministers pledged to end this Parliament. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the establishment of a new body staffed by independent adjudicators, which is expected to process appeals more swiftly than the current court system. This initiative comes amid rising public frustration and protests across the UK over the use of asylum hotels, which still accommodate 32,000 individuals. Critics, including the Refugee Council, contend that reducing mistakes in initial decisions is the most effective way to cut the appeals backlog, noting that nearly half of original decisions are overturned on appeal.</p>

Trump's administration has indicated it will block federal permits for new projects, a move criticized by the American Clean Power Association as "unprecedented political review" and "obstruction." This, combined with rising costs from Trump's copper and steel tariffs, creates market instability, causing companies like Engie North America to slash planned US investment by 50%.

          <p>Germany's army chief, Lieutenant General Alfons Mais, warned that the Bundeswehr may face conflict before being fully combat-ready, despite significant progress in equipping troops, emphasizing a need for soldiers to be mentally prepared to defend national values. This comes as Chancellor Friedrich Merz called for social welfare reform, arguing the current welfare state is financially unsustainable, potentially creating contention within his coalition. Other national news included German firefighters redeploying to tackle raging wildfires in northern Spain, the renaming of Berlin's Mohrenstrasse due to its racist history, and an Italian executive facing backlash for filming himself driving at extreme speeds on a German autobahn. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is also set to visit Germany for talks with Merz, highlighting ongoing diplomatic engagements.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to introduce a sentencing bill next month, proposing significant changes including new powers for courts to impose pub and travel bans on convicted criminals receiving community sentences. These restrictions, which could extend beyond specific offenses, aim to deter crime and ease prison overcrowding. The legislation will also incorporate recommendations for restricting short prison sentences and implementing an early release scheme for well-behaved inmates, inspired by US supermax prisons. While Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood ruled out early release for serious offenders, critics express concerns about funding, implementation challenges for hospitality, and increased pressure on probation services and police forces, despite planned recruitment and funding boosts.</p>

          <p>A 66-year-old man, Lee Tate, was arrested in east Shelby County, Tennessee, after allegedly pointing a loaded pistol at deputies during a traffic stop just before midnight on Friday. Tate was pulled over for a traffic violation on Interstate 40, and deputies subsequently discovered he had an active warrant in Shelby County for reckless endangerment with a deadly weapon and vandalism. When asked to exit his vehicle, Tate reportedly resisted and drew a gun with a hollow-point round in the chamber before a deputy managed to grab his arm and disarm him. He was subsequently arrested and jailed on a $75,000 bond, facing new charges related to the incident.</p>

          <p>Prageeta Sharma's new poem, "Irresistible Contentment," delves into the poet's introspective journey to find the essence of her art beyond external influences and her "skirted body." The verses explore themes of speech, silence, and the transformative power of internal feelings over lesser ones, seeking a "poem's hearted center" to guide her. Sharma describes a process where morning's magic can appear opaque until a stronger emotion leads her towards a "plateau of nested changes." This evocative piece, from her latest book "Onement Won," reflects on the pursuit of an irresistible truth within her creative expression, aiming for a renewed sense of "golden silence" and a deeper understanding of her own alphabet.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer plans to meet with All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons following his apparent in-game protest during a preseason win against the Atlanta Falcons. Parsons, who has missed the entire three-game preseason due to an ongoing contract dispute, was observed without a jersey on the sidelines and later lying on a training table behind the team bench while the Cowboys were on offense. Despite Parsons' social media statement denying disrespect, Schottenheimer aims to understand his actions, especially after an MRI on Parsons' back was "pretty clean." The 26-year-old, in the final year of his contract, has requested a trade, leading to an ongoing, public dispute with owner Jerry Jones, who claims to have made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL.</p>

          <p>According to biographer Michael Wolff, former US President Donald Trump had "confrontations" with the Secret Service over his bedroom habits during his first administration. Wolff revealed on a new podcast episode that Trump had a lock installed on his bedroom door, which the Secret Service "demanded it be taken off" due to security protocols requiring their armed guards to have easier access for safety reasons. This wasn't the first public mention of this particular habit, as a 2019 biography also detailed his request for a door lock. Additionally, Wolff mentioned a separate, unexplained incident where Trump reacted strongly to White House domestic staff changing his bedsheets, adding to the anecdotes about his unique preferences.</p>

This action follows a report by prominent Nigerians, including ex-government ministers, raising concerns about "war-time levels of slaughter" despite official peace, citing over 10,000 deaths since President Bola Tinubu took office two years ago. The group called for a Presidential Task Force with wide-ranging powers to address the resurgence of militant Islamist groups like Boko Haram and ISWAP, as well as violent criminal gangs and widespread kidnappings. The US recently approved a $346 million weapons sale to aid Nigeria's efforts to quell the unrest.</p>

          <p>Three young sisters, aged nine, 11, and 17, tragically drowned in an overcrowded rubber boat carrying migrants across the central Mediterranean Sea. The dangerously overcrowded vessel, which departed from Libya's Zuwara city, encountered waves up to 1.5 meters, causing it to take on increasing amounts of water in the pitch-dark night. Rescuers from the German charity RESQSHIP saved about 65 people, including the sisters' mother and brother, but discovered the girls' bodies beneath the surface. Many survivors suffered severe chemical burns from the mixture of seawater and petrol, requiring medical treatment. UN agencies report over 700 deaths in this treacherous crossing this year, urging increased search and rescue operations and guaranteed safety for disembarking survivors.</p>
