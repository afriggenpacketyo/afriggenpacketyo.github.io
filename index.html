          <h2>Tariff Pause Between U.S. and China Expected to Cause Freight Surge and Price Increases</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a temporary trade deal between the U.S. and China, retailers and logistics firms anticipate a surge in freight shipments. While tariffs are reduced from 145% to 30%, importers are expected to frontload orders due to uncertainty beyond the 90-day pause, potentially causing container rates to skyrocket. Some businesses had shipments stuck in bonded warehouses due to previous high tariffs, incurring storage costs. The unpredictability of trade policy makes it difficult for businesses to forecast and plan, and higher freight rates may lead to increased prices for consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

The resettlement process occurred rapidly, despite broader efforts by the Trump administration to suspend the refugee program, and some refugee groups have declined to assist with the resettlement, citing racial justice concerns.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has resumed collection efforts on defaulted federal student loans, with the Education Department providing details on wage garnishments and other involuntary collections. The government can garnish up to 15% of disposable pay, leaving borrowers with at least $217.50 per week. Wage garnishments are scheduled to begin later this summer, with notices sent to 5.3 million defaulted borrowers. Borrowers can challenge the garnishment if it results in financial hardship or if they've recently been unemployed or filed for bankruptcy.</p>
