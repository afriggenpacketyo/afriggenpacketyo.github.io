            <p>Christians in Nigeria are facing increased violence and persecution from Islamist militants, leading to fears of genocide, with attacks on Christian communities resulting in numerous deaths and displacement.

            <p>A former member of the Deepwater Horizon inquiry commission warns that the Trump administration's cuts to science, environmental, and safety agencies, along with the rollback of environmental regulations, are setting the stage for a new environmental disaster. The author emphasizes the importance of science and environmental protections as the first line of defense against catastrophe. The author points to weakened offshore drilling safety measures, the reversal of drilling bans in sensitive coastal areas, and the elimination of EPA's scientific research office as alarming steps that disregard lessons from past crises. </p>

            <p>The Trump administration's move to freeze grants to Harvard University over diversity, equity, and inclusion programs has ignited a debate about academic freedom and government overreach. Harvard President Alan Garber refused to comply with demands that he says would give the government control over hiring, admissions, and curriculum. Critics argue that the administration's actions are part of a broader effort to undermine higher education and suppress dissenting viewpoints, drawing parallels to historical attacks on academic independence. The situation raises concerns about the future of academic freedom and the role of universities in a democratic society.</p>

            <p>An advice column explores the ethical implications of attention in an era of information overload and political turmoil, advocating for strategic withdrawal from overwhelming news cycles to preserve moral attention. The author suggests intentional news consumption habits, such as designated news-checking times and curated newsletters, alongside investments in personal well-being and moral training through literature or meditation. The piece distinguishes between empathy and compassion, promoting compassion as a means to engage with suffering without succumbing to burnout, and recommends Tonglen meditation as a technique to stay present with suffering and cultivate moral attention. </p>

            <p>An analysis suggests that the United States is likely to lose its trade war with China due to its dependence on Chinese goods and the Trump administration's flawed strategies. China has prepared for economic conflict by reducing its reliance on American imports and developing offensive economic weapons, while the US has alienated allies and failed to invest in domestic industries. The outcome hinges on each country's tolerance for pain, with the US facing potential shortages and higher prices, while China could redirect exports and implement domestic support measures.

            <p>Carole Cadwalladr reflects on her experience of being sued after giving a Ted Talk about Facebook's role in Brexit, and warns of the dangers of a "broligarchy," the alignment of Silicon Valley and autocracy. She argues that politics is technology now, and technology is politics, and that the power of tech titans is now front and center, but it feels too late. She criticizes the naivety of the British government, which is seeking to tear up copyright laws to make it easier for AI companies to use artists' intellectual property for training their models.</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has hit a career low, fueled by discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey. The survey reveals a decline in economic optimism and increased pessimism about the stock market, with Democrats and independents expressing strong disapproval of Trump's economic policies. While his Republican base remains supportive, concerns persist over tariffs and inflation, particularly among blue-collar workers. The findings suggest that Trump's economic policies are failing to resonate with a broader electorate, potentially impacting his political standing.</p>

            <p>President Vladimir Putin's announcement of a unilateral Easter truce in Ukraine has been met with skepticism, with Ukraine reporting ongoing attempts to advance and inflict losses. While Russia claims to be adhering to the ceasefire, accusations of violations have been exchanged, raising questions about the sincerity of the truce. The move is seen by some as a PR effort to maintain good relations with the Trump White House, while others view it as a genuine step towards ending the war, though the short notice and limited duration of the truce raise doubts about its effectiveness.</p>

            <p>Heather Stewart argues that the Labour party must focus on the risk to global financial stability posed by Trump's policies, not only trade. While the government is negotiating with Washington over tariffs, it is also planning to deregulate the City, which could threaten global financial stability. Labour's stance on the UK's financial sector appears to remain the one set out in the chancellor's Mansion House speech in November: that rules imposed after the 2008 crash have “gone too far”. The author warns that a crisis in the hyperglobalised financial system could put everyone at risk.</p>
