          <p>China refuted claims by Washington that it violated the Geneva trade agreement, asserting instead that the U.S. breached deal terms, escalating tensions between the two economic powers. This follows a period of relative calm after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and his Chinese counterpart He Lifeng agreed to suspend most tariffs for 90 days. China's commerce department spokesperson criticized the Trump administration for increasing export restrictions on semiconductor design software and chemicals and threatening to revoke visas for Chinese students, vowing to protect China's interests. China maintains its stance on rare earth exports, while the U.S. is accused of unilaterally provoking trade frictions.</p>

          <p>The average mortgage term for first-time homebuyers in the UK has increased to 31 years, up from 28 years a decade ago, as housing affordability remains a challenge. Higher mortgage rates have prompted buyers to extend their borrowing periods to lower monthly repayments. Despite recent decreases in mortgage rates, these extended terms show no signs of shortening, with many new mortgages extending into retirement. Lenders are offering mortgage terms up to 40 years to help first-time buyers manage repayments amid rising house prices.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of Kamala Harris’s defeat, Democrats are debating whether to prioritize messaging or policy reforms. Some argue for focusing on material abundance by addressing regulatory bottlenecks, while others advocate for populist measures targeting corporate power. A new poll from Demand Progress suggests voters prefer a candidate focused on curbing corporate influence over one emphasizing regulatory reforms. However, the article contends that Democrats do not need to choose between abundance liberalism and populism, as policies promoting abundance can complement efforts to redistribute wealth and power.</p>

          <p>Right-wing historian Karol Nawrocki has been elected as Poland's new president, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. Nawrocki secured 50.9% of the votes, while Trzaskowski received 49.1%, marking a turnaround from initial exit polls that favored Trzaskowski. As president, Nawrocki is expected to use his veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda. The result is likely to energize the national-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) opposition, potentially impacting the 2027 parliamentary elections.</p>

          <p>Some senior Tesla executives questioned Elon Musk after he denied a Reuters report that Tesla had killed a planned $25,000 EV, despite knowing the project had been canceled. Musk posted on X that "Reuters is lying" after the story was published, halting a decline in Tesla's stock. The executives were aware that Musk had pivoted Tesla to focus on self-driving robotaxis. Tesla has not released the low-cost EV that Musk once called pivotal to the company’s future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major international trial has demonstrated that an exercise program for colon cancer patients can reduce the risk of dying by a third. The three-year exercise program, which started soon after chemotherapy, aimed to get patients to double the exercise guidelines for the general population, with weekly coaching sessions. Results showed that 80% of people exercising remained cancer-free after five years, compared to 74% in the other group. The study suggests that exercise has a significant beneficial effect on cancer survival, although the exact reasons are still unknown.</p>

          <p>Many National Weather Service (NWS) forecast offices along the hurricane-prone Gulf of Mexico coast are understaffed as the U.S. enters an expected active hurricane season. Fifteen regional weather service offices, including those in Miami, Jacksonville, Puerto Rico, and Houston, lack the necessary meteorologists, while the National Hurricane Center (NHC) is short five specialists. This understaffing is due to job cuts and a hiring freeze imposed by the Trump administration, raising concerns about the ability to provide detailed, localized forecasts. Experts warn that the turmoil within the NWS and Fema will hamper the response to potential storms and floods.</p>
