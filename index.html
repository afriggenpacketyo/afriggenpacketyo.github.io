          <h2>US Asks China to Intervene to Prevent Iran from Closing Strait of Hormuz</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 00:12:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has urged China to use its influence to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global shipping route. This request follows reports that the Iranian parliament approved a plan to potentially close the strait, a decision that ultimately rests with the Supreme National Security Council. Closure of the Strait would severely impact the global economy, particularly China, which is a major importer of Iranian oil. Experts suggest that Iran risks alienating its neighbors and key markets like China by disrupting traffic through the Strait, but the US has positioned a strong defense in the region to counter any Iranian aggression, and the situation is rapidly escalating. The surge in oil prices reflects the gravity of the situation. </p>

          <p>New York City will utilize ranked choice voting in its upcoming Democratic mayoral primary election. Voters will rank up to five candidates in order of preference, and if no candidate secures a majority, the candidate with the fewest votes will be eliminated, and their votes redistributed based on voters' second choices. This process continues until a candidate reaches a majority. The system aims to ensure that the elected candidate has broad support and to prevent candidates with fringe views from winning in a crowded field. The tabulation process will begin on July 1, with official results certified on July 15. </p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has released its first images, showcasing its unprecedented ability to observe the universe. The observatory, equipped with the world's most powerful digital camera, aims to transform our understanding of the cosmos. The telescope will continuously film the southern night sky for ten years, potentially increasing the number of known objects in our solar system tenfold. Scientists hope to detect killer asteroids, map the Milky Way, and answer crucial questions about dark matter. </p>

          <p>Oil markets are experiencing increased volatility after the U.S. joined the conflict between Iran and Israel, raising concerns about potential supply disruptions. Experts warn of the possibility of triple-digit oil prices as investors closely monitor Iran's response to U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities. Threats of blocking the Strait of Hormuz have further fueled market jitters. Analysts suggest that a prolonged closure of the Strait could drive crude prices above $100 per barrel.
