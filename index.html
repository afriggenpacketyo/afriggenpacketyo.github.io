          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a joint resolution aimed at amending the state constitution to explicitly require U.S. citizenship for voting. The resolution, introduced by State Senator Brian Birdwell, seeks to clarify that only U.S. citizens are allowed to vote in Texas elections, adding to existing prohibitions based on age, mental competency, and felony convictions. While Abbott has signed the resolution, it still requires approval from Texas citizens in a November vote to ratify the constitutional amendment. This action comes amid broader debates on voter identification and election integrity, with 25 states considering similar legislation.</p>

          <p>Small-scale distillers in Japan are increasingly producing craft gins using homegrown ingredients, sparking a domestic gin boom. Distillers are incorporating local specialties, with shipments increasing from under 1.2 million liters per year until 2019 to over 5.5 million liters in 2024. Distilleries are using equipment for whiskey and shochu production, which can be converted to gin production. Some distilleries are redistilling an Okinawan spirit called Awamori and adding local ingredients such as "goya" bitter gourd, while others infuse their product with burnt lacquer wood to create a smoky flavor.</p>

With companies like SpaceX launching rockets more frequently, the noise, including sonic booms from returning boosters, is becoming a growing concern for residents. Kent Gee at Brigham Young University is leading research to determine acceptable noise levels and identify ways to lessen disruptions, especially as SpaceX tests the larger and potentially louder Starship rocket. The team is studying why Falcon 9 boosters generate a three-part sonic boom and how topography affects sound wave propagation.</p>

          <p>Japan has lost its position as the world's top creditor for the first time in 34 years, with Germany taking the lead, according to the Finance Ministry. Despite Japan's gross external assets increasing by 12.9% to a record 533.05 trillion yen, Germany's total of 569.65 trillion yen surpassed it. The yen's depreciation boosted the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, while Germany benefited from a large current account surplus. Japan increased its net external credit for the seventh consecutive year, reaching 1,659.22 trillion yen, driven by direct investment in the United States.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a delay in the implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, extending the deadline from June 1 to July 9 to allow for further negotiations. The decision followed a call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who expressed a desire to engage in serious negotiations. Trump had previously threatened to impose the tariffs due to dissatisfaction with trade negotiations with the EU, but von der Leyen said the EU is ready to advance talks swiftly. This delay provides an opportunity for both sides to seek a mutually agreeable trade arrangement.</p>

          <p>The English government is implementing changes to apprenticeship funding, prioritizing training opportunities for individuals under 21. Funding for level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree, will be eliminated for those over 21, shifting the financial burden to employers. This adjustment aims to create 120,000 more training positions for young adults and those requiring retraining. An increase in fees for employers recruiting from outside the UK will further support these initiatives, while the shadow education minister criticized the move for potentially harming public services and limiting professional access for non-university graduates.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin, labeling him as "absolutely crazy" due to the intensified attacks on Ukraine.

Trump's criticism follows his earlier claims of having a "very good relationship" with Putin and his promises to quickly resolve the conflict, suggesting a possible change in his approach towards the war and a response to accusations that he is unable to deliver on promises.</p>

The disaster occurred in international waters within Greece's rescue zone, and the case has drawn scrutiny due to conflicting accounts of the events.</p>
