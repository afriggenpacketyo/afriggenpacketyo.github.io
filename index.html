Lian Ping, chairman of the China Chief Economists Forum, suggests that while full-scale financial sanctions are unlikely, the U.S. might gradually target specific Chinese entities, potentially excluding China from the U.S. dollar system.

          <p>Jewish foreign students at Harvard are expressing fear and uncertainty due to President Trump's actions against the university. While Trump claims his measures are to protect Jewish students, some worry about becoming collateral damage in the conflict between the administration and Harvard. The government has given Harvard 30 days to prove it meets the requirements for enrolling foreign students, potentially impacting many international students. The students' concerns highlight the complexities and unintended consequences of political actions on individuals.</p>

          <p>An Alaska man survived after being pinned facedown in an icy creek by a 700-pound boulder for three hours, sustaining only minor injuries. His wife held his head above water while waiting for rescuers, who were transported to the remote location by a sled dog tourism company's helicopter. Firefighters used inflatable airbags and brute force to lift the boulder, allowing the man to be rescued by an Alaska National Guard helicopter. The man acknowledged his luck and the importance of sticking to established trails.</p>

The US Court of International Trade ruled that Trump exceeded his authority in imposing tariffs, but a federal appeals court has temporarily stayed that ruling.
