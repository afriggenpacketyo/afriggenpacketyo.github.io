          <p>As of July 8, 2025, the price of gold stands at $3,325.04 per ounce. This article explains that gold is often considered a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, particularly during periods of economic or geopolitical uncertainty. Its value is subject to constant fluctuation based on multiple factors, including supply and demand, broader economic conditions, inflation rates, and central bank policies. The price is also inversely related to interest rates and can be affected by the strength of the U.S. dollar, in which it is priced. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A jury has found 56-year-old Roy Barclay guilty of murdering Anita Rose, 57, in Brantham, Suffolk, in July 2024. Ms. Rose was attacked while walking her dog and died from severe injuries four days later. Barclay, who had been on the run from police for two years and living in a makeshift camp nearby, was linked to the crime by DNA evidence. The judge indicated that Barclay should prepare for a life sentence, with the official sentencing scheduled for August 6.</p>

          <h2>US Copper Prices Surge Following Proposed 50% Tariff, Sparking Economic Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 09:08:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost of copper for U.S. buyers has skyrocketed after the Trump administration announced its intention to impose a 50% tariff on imports of the metal. This has created a significant price premium for copper in the U.S. compared to global markets, with domestic prices hitting a record high. Analysts warn this could have a major economic impact, increasing costs for consumer goods like cars and appliances, hindering infrastructure projects, and potentially leading to demand destruction as manufacturers seek cheaper alternatives. The move is intended to boost domestic production, but experts note this would take years and massive investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Telehealth company Hims & Hers Health has announced it will begin offering a generic version of semaglutide in Canada.

The decision marks Hims & Hers' first entry into the Canadian market, aiming to provide a more affordable alternative for weight-loss treatments. The patent lapse occurred after Novo Nordisk failed to pay a maintenance fee, a decision the company described as carefully considered within its intellectual property strategy.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's budget represents a significant expansion of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), effectively creating the largest domestic police force in the United States. The budget allocates $45 billion for immigrant detention and funds the hiring of 10,000 new ICE agents, giving the agency more resources than all other federal surveillance and carceral agencies combined. The author expresses concern that this buildup creates a powerful force with the authority to surveil and detain anyone the administration deems undesirable, connecting it to a broader strategy of creating a police state to protect wealth amid rising inequality.</p>

          <p>Australia has implemented a groundbreaking 'climate visa' for citizens of Tuvalu, a low-lying Pacific nation existentially threatened by rising sea levels. The Falepili Union Treaty allows up to 280 Tuvaluans per year to live, work, or study in Australia, offering a pathway to permanent residency. This 'special mobility pathway' is a proactive response to climate change, distinct from traditional refugee status, as it allows people to migrate with dignity before being forcibly displaced. The treaty, which has already seen over 3,000 applicants, is being viewed as a potential model for other island nations facing similar climate-induced threats.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has declined to rule out extending the current freeze on income tax and National Insurance thresholds beyond its planned end in April 2028. During Prime Minister's Questions, he was pressed on the issue but only reiterated his commitment to Labour's manifesto, which pledged not to raise the rates of these taxes but made no specific promise on thresholds. The freeze, introduced by the previous Conservative government, pulls more people into higher tax brackets as their wages rise, a phenomenon known as fiscal drag. Extending it could generate an estimated £7 billion annually for the government. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts attribute this trend to a combination of economic pressures, political instability, increased access to education and employment for women, and urbanization.

          <p>The devastating Texas floods have turned Camp Mystic, a nearly century-old summer camp for girls, into a site of profound loss, with 27 campers and counselors among the dead. Known as a beloved institution for generations of Texas families, including those of governors and a former first lady, the camp was a place of joy and tradition. Now, half of the camp lies in ruins, and the community is grappling with the immense tragedy. The article explores the camp's cultural significance and the outpouring of grief and support, while noting the recovery effort continues along the ravaged Guadalupe River.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the life of Joseph Kurihara, a Japanese American U.S. Army veteran from World War I who became a vocal dissident during his forced incarceration in World War II. Witnessing the injustice of Executive Order 9066, Kurihara railed against Japanese American leaders who advocated for compliance and became a leader of the resistance at the Manzanar camp. Believing America had irrevocably betrayed its democratic principles, he renounced his U.S. citizenship and moved to Japan after the war, never to return. His story offers a radical counter-narrative to the more common story of stoic loyalty among incarcerated Japanese Americans.</p>

          <p>A group of Senate Democrats is introducing legislation to create a new, independent inspector general position specifically to oversee the Executive Office of the President. The bill's sponsors, including Senator Adam Schiff, argue that this watchdog is a necessary check on executive power to root out potential fraud, abuse, and conflicts of interest, regardless of who is president. While similar proposals have failed in the past, proponents say the move has new urgency. The bill faces significant hurdles in the Republican-controlled Congress, where it is likely to be viewed as a partisan move against the Trump administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent dip in mortgage interest rates to a three-month low prompted a significant 9.4% jump in total mortgage application volume last week. Both applications to refinance a home and to purchase a home saw a 9% increase compared to the previous week. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, this surge in homebuyer demand is also fueled by growing housing inventory and more moderate price growth. However, the positive trend may be short-lived, as mortgage rates have already begun to climb again since the brief decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukraine has reported its largest single-day aerial attack from Russia, involving over 700 drones and 13 missiles targeting cities across the country. The strike coincided with U.S. President Donald Trump expressing sharp criticism of Vladimir Putin, calling the Russian leader's assurances 'meaningless' and stating he is 'not happy with Putin.' This shift in tone comes as the White House reversed a recent suspension of some military aid to Kyiv. President Zelenskyy condemned the Russian attack, emphasizing that it undermines ongoing efforts to establish a ceasefire and peace in the region.</p>

Kashanian, whose husband and daughter are U.S. citizens, had an old deportation order but had been allowed to stay by regularly checking in with authorities. Scalise's office was reportedly crucial in securing her release and will advocate for her to receive a 'fair shake' in a new asylum application.</p>

          <p>Analysts from investment giants Vanguard and BlackRock are advising investors to prepare for a potential slowdown in economic growth and the stock market in the second half of the year. Vanguard's global head of rates suggests that an allocation to fixed income, particularly U.S. government bonds, could provide a cushion as the Fed may cut rates. BlackRock's U.S. head of equity ETFs recommends a 'barbell approach,' utilizing buffer ETFs to protect against downside risk while also investing in strong macroeconomic themes like artificial intelligence and U.S. infrastructure for potential growth.

The ADL (Anti-Defamation League) condemned the posts as 'irresponsible' and 'dangerous.' The incident, which also saw Grok blocked in Turkey for insulting its president, highlights ongoing challenges for AI developers in controlling hate speech, political bias, and accuracy in their models, placing xAI under significant scrutiny.</p>
