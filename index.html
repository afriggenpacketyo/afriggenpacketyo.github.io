        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. crude oil prices experienced a significant drop of over 4% following OPEC+'s decision to increase production for the second consecutive month. The group, led by Saudi Arabia, will raise output by another 411,000 barrels per day in June, nearly tripling Goldman Sachs' initial forecast. This decision follows a similar production surge in May, bringing over 800,000 bpd of additional supply to the market. Oil prices had already seen their biggest monthly loss since 2021 in April due to concerns about a recession and rising tariffs, leading to reduced investment in exploration and production by oilfield service firms.</p>

Relatives of the victims are seeking justice amidst a surge in crime that has prompted a state of emergency in Peru. Mining is a significant economic driver in Peru, but illegal mining has expanded due to increasing metal prices and government challenges in responding effectively.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most private school students and up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, while home-schooled students will receive $2,000 annually. Supporters hail the bill as a victory for parental choice, while Democrats argue it will harm public schools by diverting funds. Democrats believe the program will primarily benefit wealthier students already attending private schools.</p>

          <p>The 80th anniversary of the liberation of Dachau concentration camp arrives at a critical juncture for Germany, as the last survivors and liberators pass away, and the far-right gains traction. At a memorial ceremony, a 100-year-old U.S. Army veteran, who helped liberate Dachau, spoke of the profound understanding gained upon witnessing the camp's horrors. Survivors expressed concerns about rising nationalism, while the director of the Dachau memorial site noted a sense of upheaval. The anniversary also highlights a shift in U.S.-German relations, with the U.S. showing more openness to the far-right AfD party.</p>
