          <p>Cisco has reported quarterly results that slightly exceeded analyst predictions for both earnings and revenue, driven by a 7.6% year-over-year increase in revenue. The company's net income also rose significantly compared to the same period last year. Looking ahead, Cisco provided an optimistic forecast for the upcoming fiscal year, projecting figures that align with or slightly surpass market consensus, signaling confidence despite a complex economic environment. The company also highlighted its growing involvement in AI infrastructure, with orders in this sector doubling its initial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recently installed temporary barriers have largely protected Juneau, Alaska, from what could have been catastrophic damage from a record-breaking glacial outburst flood. The Mendenhall River crested at unprecedented levels after an ice dam at the nearby Mendenhall Glacier released a massive surge of water. While some minor flooding occurred, the fortified riverbanks prevented the widespread destruction of homes seen in previous years. Scientists attribute the increasing intensity of these annual floods to climate change, as Alaska is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the U.S.</p>

          <p>A man in Washington, D.C., has been federally charged with assaulting a federal officer after allegedly throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Protection agent. The incident occurred amid a confrontation where the man reportedly shouted profanities at the officer. This event unfolds against a backdrop of heightened tensions regarding the increased presence of federal law enforcement in the city, a move initiated by President Trump who cited rising crime. However, local officials and police statistics indicate that violent crime has actually decreased in the District.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its decision to cancel billions of dollars in foreign aid previously appropriated by Congress. The court's 2-1 decision focused on procedural grounds, stating that the non-profit plaintiffs were not eligible to bring the lawsuit and that only the Government Accountability Office could challenge the withholding of funds. This ruling is a significant blow to global humanitarian groups, as the withheld funds include critical support for global health initiatives like HIV/AIDS prevention, potentially impacting millions of lives.</p>

He pointed to a drop in performance, noting the team's lowest Olympic medal percentage since 1988, and expressed concern for the lack of support for athletes. Phelps clarified his criticism is aimed at management, not the swimmers, and stated he is unsure if he would want his own sons to compete under the current system. He has offered to be a resource for change and recommended an independent review to instill an athletes-first mentality.</p>

The franchise's soaring value is largely attributed to its relocation to Los Angeles and the development of the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium in Inglewood.

          <p>Researchers predict that global reindeer populations, including North American caribou, could decline by as much as 80% by the year 2100 if greenhouse gas emissions are not significantly reduced. A study led by the University of Adelaide used ancient DNA and computer models to reconstruct how these animals responded to past climate warming events. The findings suggest that future losses are likely to be more severe than historical declines, which have already seen a two-thirds reduction in populations over the last three decades. This decline could also have cascading ecological effects, including reduced plant diversity and accelerated climate warming.</p>

          <p>U.S. men's national team players Christian Pulisic and Tim Weah have strongly criticized former USMNT players who work as media pundits, with Weah calling their commentary "evil." The comments, made in a new docuseries, address the backlash Pulisic received for skipping the 2025 Gold Cup due to fatigue. Pulisic stated the pundits disrespected him and forgot his contributions, while his father attributed the criticism to jealousy and a desire for clicks. Weah argued that the former players know the pressure of being criticized and suggested their own careers were not beyond reproach.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI data center provider CoreWeave fell by 20% after the company reported a second-quarter adjusted loss of 27 cents per share, which was wider than the 21 cents per share loss anticipated by analysts. The disappointing results were released just before the expiration of the post-IPO lock-up period, which could introduce more volatility to the stock. Despite the loss, the company's revenue more than tripled year-over-year to $1.21 billion, and it raised its full-year revenue guidance. However, some analysts expressed concern over a delay in capital expenditures.</p>

          <p>Missouri health officials have confirmed a rare and life-threatening infection from the Naegleria fowleri amoeba, commonly known as the brain-eating amoeba. The patient is currently being treated in an intensive care unit. While the source is still under investigation, the patient became ill several days after water skiing in the Lake of the Ozarks. The infection, primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), occurs when contaminated water is forced up the nose, allowing the organism to reach the brain. Such infections are extremely rare, with only 167 reported cases in the U.S. since 1962.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining around 2%, in contrast to a decline in some of the market's largest technology companies. This rotation is fueled by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September. Lower interest rates are particularly beneficial for smaller companies, as they reduce borrowing costs and can stimulate consumer spending. Despite the daily gain, small-cap stocks have largely underperformed their megacap counterparts since late 2022. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite criticism from President Trump, Goldman Sachs is not alone in its forecast that U.S. consumers will face higher inflation due to tariffs. A consensus is forming among Wall Street economists that as pre-tariff inventories are depleted, the impact of increased duties will become more apparent in retail prices through the end of the year. While no one is predicting runaway inflation, many see a steady rise that could push the Federal Reserve's preferred core inflation measure into the low-to-mid 3% range. This potential rise in inflation is not expected to deter the Fed from cutting interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

The service is free for Prime members on orders over $25, and Amazon noted that initial testing showed the offering attracted new grocery customers. The move is part of a broader strategy to integrate its grocery business, including Whole Foods, more closely with its core e-commerce platform.</p>

          <p>A European Commission proposal to impose penalties on Israel for restricting humanitarian aid to Gaza remains stalled due to disagreements among EU member states. The plan, which would bar Israeli startups from accessing EU research funding, was proposed in late July amid warnings of a famine in Gaza. However, consensus has not been reached, with Germany among the countries asking for more time to review the measures. Human rights groups have expressed outrage at the delay, accusing the bloc of failing to use its leverage to address the escalating humanitarian crisis.</p>

In response, the National Academies of Sciences has launched a fast-track review of climate evidence, and researchers are working to safeguard federal climate data that has been removed from government websites.
