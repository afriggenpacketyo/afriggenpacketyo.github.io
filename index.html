          <p>A controversial proposal to mandate the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public land across 11 Western states has been withdrawn from a Republican tax and spending bill. The measure, championed by Senator Mike Lee, faced strong bipartisan backlash from at least four Republican senators and five House members, as well as conservation and recreation groups. Lee stated he pulled the provision due to an inability to guarantee the land would only be sold to American families and not foreign interests. Conservationists celebrated the move as a victory but remain vigilant against future attempts to privatize public lands.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek re-election, a decision following a public dispute with former President Donald Trump. The conflict erupted after Tillis opposed Trump's key budget bill, citing its "devastating" cuts to Medicaid that would harm his state. Trump responded with criticism and threatened to support a primary challenger. In his retirement announcement, Tillis stated that independent thinkers and those willing to compromise have become an "endangered species" in Washington, alluding to the increasing political polarization.</p>

          <p>The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has estimated that the Republican-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill" could result in nearly 12 million Americans losing their health insurance coverage. The CBO's analysis also projects the legislation would add approximately $3.3 trillion to the national debt. These figures could complicate the bill's passage as it faces a narrow path in the Senate, where Republicans can only afford three defections. The proposed cuts to Medicaid have become a major point of contention, with Democrats criticizing the plan as a tax cut for the wealthy financed by reducing healthcare for vulnerable populations.

          <p>The U.S. Senate is engaged in a contentious debate over former President Trump's signature tax and spending package, known as the "One Big, Beautiful Bill." After narrowly advancing the legislation in a procedural vote, Democrats initiated a nearly 16-hour reading of the bill to delay its progress. The bill, which Republicans are moving through the reconciliation process to bypass filibuster rules, includes increased spending on border security and defense, offset by cuts to healthcare and nutrition programs. With a slim majority, GOP leaders face a challenging path to final passage ahead of a self-imposed July 4 deadline. (not investment advice)</p>

The pressure was reportedly linked to a federal investigation into the university's diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies.

          <p>A report from Dessau, in eastern Germany, reveals a troubling trend of rising right-wing extremism and nationalism among young people, where Nazi symbols and slogans are becoming normalized as "cool." This phenomenon is part of a broader radicalization of youth in the region, with the far-right AfD party gaining significant political traction. Despite Dessau's history as a center for the progressive Bauhaus movement, it has been plagued by racist violence. Local civic groups and activists are working to counter the hate, but they face an increasingly hostile environment as extremist views become more mainstream.</p>

          <p>A debate continues over the health impacts of common seed oils like canola, soybean, and sunflower oil, fueled by claims from figures such as Health Secretary RFK Jr. that they are harmful to Americans. These oils are prevalent in processed foods and are a major source of linoleic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid. While some wellness influencers advocate for avoiding them, many nutrition researchers and major health organizations maintain that the evidence does not support these negative claims. They argue that when consumed as part of a balanced diet, these oils can be a healthy source of unsaturated fats.</p>

This article explains that a proper BDA is a lengthy process integrating imagery, intelligence, and analysis of functional effects, not just physical destruction. The preliminary assessments released shortly after the strikes were likely incomplete. Given the use of advanced precision-guided munitions like the 15-ton GBU-57 bomb and the sophisticated B-2 platforms, an educated guess suggests the cumulative damage to Iran's nuclear ecosystem from the U.S. and prior Israeli actions was likely severe.</p>

          <p>Two tropical storms, Barry and Flossie, have formed simultaneously off Mexico's Atlantic and Pacific coasts, respectively, threatening the region with heavy rainfall. Tropical Storm Barry is located on the southeast coast and is expected to strengthen slightly before making landfall, bringing several inches of rain to states like Veracruz and Tamaulipas. On the southwest coast, Tropical Storm Flossie is forecast to become a hurricane but remain offshore, though it will still produce significant rainfall across several coastal states. The formations mark an active period in both the Atlantic and Pacific hurricane seasons.</p>

          <h2>Intercepted Communications Suggest Iran Downplayed Damage from US Strikes</h2>

          <p>According to a report citing classified intelligence, intercepted communications from Iranian officials have downplayed the severity of the damage caused by recent U.S. strikes on the country's nuclear program. While former President Trump claimed the strikes "obliterated" the program, this intelligence adds to other reports, including a preliminary one from the Defense Intelligence Agency, that suggest the setback may have been less extensive. A White House spokesperson dismissed the report, asserting that Iran's nuclear weapons program is over, while experts caution that a full damage assessment will take considerable time.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has signed a decree initiating Ukraine's withdrawal from the Ottawa Convention, which bans the use and production of anti-personnel landmines. The decision, which requires parliamentary ratification, follows similar moves by other nations bordering Russia. This development comes as Ukraine's military confirmed the loss of an F-16 fighter jet and its pilot during a large-scale Russian aerial attack. The pilot reportedly downed seven enemy targets before his aircraft was damaged, and he guided it away from populated areas before the crash.</p>

          <p>Insiders at chipmaker Nvidia, including CEO Jensen Huang, have sold more than $1 billion of the company's stock in the past year, with approximately half of that amount being sold in the last month. The sales coincide with the stock reaching new record highs and the company briefly becoming the most valuable in the world. Huang's recent sales are part of a pre-disclosed plan to sell up to 6 million shares. The significant offloading by executives has been noted by market analysts as the share price surged.
