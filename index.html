          <p>Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko stated that Ukraine might need to consider ceding land to Russia as part of a potential peace agreement, acknowledging the immense pressure from President Donald Trump. He emphasized that while this option is unfair, it could offer a temporary resolution to the conflict. Klitschko also mentioned his lack of involvement in President Zelensky's negotiation strategies and highlighted existing political tensions between them. The mayor's statement comes after a deadly Russian attack on Kyiv, underscoring the urgency and complexity of the situation. Optimism score: 30</p>

          <p>The UK Post Office spent over £600 million in public funds to continue using the faulty Horizon IT system, despite recognizing its flaws more than a decade ago. The original 1999 agreement with Fujitsu prevented the Post Office from owning the system's code or building a replacement, leading to the wrongful prosecution of hundreds of sub-postmasters for alleged financial discrepancies. The Post Office was unable to independently verify the system's accuracy and had to rely on Fujitsu's assurances. This scandal highlights the long-term consequences of flawed IT procurement and the importance of code ownership. Optimism score: 5</p>
