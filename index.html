The article states that Yunnan's involvement dates back to the "alternative crop cultivation programme" aimed at reducing opium production through agricultural technology sharing. Overseas agricultural investment and cooperation could support China's food security by diversifying its food supply sources, given China's large demand for agricultural products and limited farmland.</p>
