          <p>A major wildfire near the Grand Canyon's North Rim has destroyed the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and dozens of other structures. The blaze, fueled by strong winds, prompted evacuations and caused a chlorine gas leak from a damaged water treatment plant, complicating firefighting efforts. In addition to the Arizona fires, smoke from extensive Canadian wildfires is causing poor air quality across the Upper Midwest, while extreme heat warnings are in effect for the Southwest. The events highlight a period of severe weather and fire danger across multiple regions of North America.</p>

          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents, with one other critically injured. Firefighters arrived to find heavy flames and rescued numerous people from windows, though five firefighters sustained minor injuries. Officials have praised the heroic efforts of first responders, stating that the death toll could have been much higher without their actions. An investigation into the cause of the fire is underway, with authorities noting that smoke damage was extensive throughout the building.</p>

          <p>China's overall exports accelerated in June, driven by a rush of orders before a potential renewal of higher U.S. tariffs. However, exports specifically to the United States fell by 16%, a smaller drop than the previous month, indicating some companies pre-ordered goods during a temporary tariff truce. Despite the ongoing trade dispute with the U.S., China's global trade reached a record high in the first half of the year as it diversified its markets, particularly in Southeast Asia and Europe. Analysts remain cautious, expecting export growth to slow in the coming quarters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new record high, trading above $120,000, fueled by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and growing institutional demand. The rally comes as the U.S. Congress prepares for "Crypto Week," a series of deliberations on bills aimed at creating a clearer regulatory framework for the digital asset industry. Analysts attribute the price surge to long-term institutional buyers and increased investor confidence due to emerging policy clarity. Some experts project Bitcoin could reach even higher valuations by the end of the year, though potential U.S. Federal Reserve policies remain a risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A violent incident in Lexington, Kentucky, ended with two women shot and killed at a local church after a suspect fled there. The events began when the suspect, Guy House, shot and wounded a state trooper during a traffic stop, then carjacked a vehicle to escape. Arriving at the Richmond Road Baptist Church, he fatally shot 72-year-old Beverly Gum and 32-year-old Christina Combs and wounded two other men before being killed by police.

          <p>The German parliament has postponed a crucial vote to appoint three new judges to the Federal Constitutional Court, creating a political impasse. The delay was forced after the conservative CDU party, part of the governing coalition, indicated it would not support the SPD's nominee, Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf, citing plagiarism allegations and her liberal stance on abortion. The move has been condemned by opposition parties like the Greens and the Left Party as a "smear campaign" and a "bad day for democracy." The crisis highlights deep divisions within the ruling coalition and threatens the stability of the government.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve potentially cutting interest rates later this year, experts are advising savers on the best Certificate of Deposit (CD) strategies. Some analysts suggest that short-term CDs remain attractive, as banks are offering competitive rates in anticipation of future rate drops. Others argue for locking in current high yields with longer-term CDs before rates potentially fall. For those uncertain, a "CD ladder" strategy, which involves spreading deposits across multiple terms, is recommended to balance access to funds with securing long-term yields. High-yield savings accounts are also presented as a flexible alternative to CDs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has launched a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting that ownership could be transferred to its postmasters through a mutual model. This initiative is part of a "fresh vision" aimed at transforming the organization's culture and restoring trust following the Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. The consultation will also explore what future services the Post Office should offer, particularly banking services, as traditional banks close high street branches. The government has committed to maintaining the current network size of 11,500 branches.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the current surge in measles cases in Europe and the U.S. is a direct consequence of the anti-vaccine movement, which gained momentum from Andrew Wakefield's discredited 1990s study. The author reflects on how the "maleficent woo-woo" of the study found fertile ground in a society eager for simple answers and a new culture of performative, hyper-cautious parenting. Despite the scientific community debunking the claims, a generalized distrust of vaccination persisted, leading to lower immunization rates. The article concludes that the resurgence of this preventable disease is a depressing testament to the real-world harm caused by misinformation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's social media post suggesting he was considering revoking Rosie O'Donnell's citizenship, legal experts have affirmed that such an action would be unconstitutional. The 14th Amendment establishes that all persons born in the United States are citizens, and the president has no authority to unilaterally strip this right from a native-born American. While naturalized citizens can have their status revoked under specific circumstances like fraudulent application, the process for a native-born citizen to lose citizenship is strictly voluntary. The president's threat is seen as legally baseless and part of a long-running feud with the actor.</p>

          <p>Newly released family court documents reveal a history of parental failures by Constance Marten and Mark Gordon, who were recently convicted of gross negligence manslaughter in the death of their fifth child, Victoria. The papers, from a years-long case that resulted in their four other children being placed in care, detail a chaotic lifestyle. The couple fled to Ireland to avoid social services, refused essential healthcare for their children, and were inconsistent with contact sessions. A key finding was that Gordon likely caused Marten to fall from a first-floor window while she was pregnant, highlighting a pattern of dangerous behavior.</p>

Both players have maintained the incidents were due to contamination, which authorities accepted, resulting in short bans. However, the situation has sparked debate within the tennis world, with some players like Nick Kyrgios calling it a "horrible look" for the sport and others questioning the consistency of the anti-doping system. Sinner stated that he and Swiatek celebrated their wins even more because of the difficult and stressful periods they endured during their cases.</p>

          <p>The American woman who was sexually assaulted by Mark Gordon at knifepoint in 1989, when he was 14, has spoken out, describing him as an "evil" psychopath who should have been imprisoned for life.

The victim, whose identity is protected, told the BBC she was "floored" to learn he was on the run in the UK.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by the Energy Innovation think tank predicts that a Republican-passed spending bill signed by President Trump will cause a significant surge in electricity costs across the U.S. By removing tax credits and support for cheaper renewable energy sources like wind and solar, the legislation is expected to increase average household energy bills by $170 annually by 2035. The report finds that Republican-leaning states, such as Missouri, Kentucky, and Texas, will experience the largest price hikes. Critics argue the bill will disproportionately harm lower-income households and contradicts Trump's campaign promise to lower energy costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As gold trades near record highs, financial experts are analyzing the factors that will influence its price for the remainder of 2025. Key drivers identified include strong consumer behavior, with new buyers entering the market, and persistent geopolitical risks that enhance gold's role as a safe-haven asset. Additionally, "sticky" inflation continues to make gold an attractive hedge against rising prices for consumers and central banks alike. While some analysts believe gold will hold its value, others see potential for further upside if global instability or economic risks increase. Silver is also mentioned as a more affordable alternative for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A sex therapist with over two decades of experience explains that intimacy is crucial for a thriving relationship and is about more than just physical connection. The article identifies four surprising factors that can quietly kill intimacy: phones, which signal a lack of presence; unresolved feelings about an ex, which occupy emotional space; a negativity bias, which leads to self-rejection; and an unmanaged stress response, which can shut down desire. For each obstacle, the therapist offers practical advice, such as setting screen-free zones, processing past relationships, challenging negative thoughts, and communicating openly with a partner about stress triggers.</p>
