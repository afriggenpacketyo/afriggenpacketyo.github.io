          <p>New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, held a lavish three-day wedding celebration at his family's private compound in Uganda. The event for the self-described socialist reportedly featured extensive security, including masked military guards and a cellphone jamming system. Critics have called the extravagant celebration insensitive, particularly as it took place while the community was mourning a local judge. The article highlights the contrast between Mamdani's political platform and the opulence of the event.</p>

          <p>A stabbing incident at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, resulted in eleven people being wounded, with six in critical condition. Authorities have a suspect in custody and believe the attack, which occurred near the checkout area, was a random act of violence. A folding-style knife was reportedly used in the attack, and officials noted that citizen involvement played a role in the response. Governor Gretchen Whitmer expressed her support for the victims and the community.</p>

          <p>In the Washington Open semi-final, Anna Kalinskaya defeated Emma Raducanu in straight sets, 6-4, 6-3, ending Raducanu's run in the tournament. Kalinskaya broke Raducanu's serve at key moments in both sets to secure the victory and advance to the final. She will face Leylah Fernandez, who won a marathon three-set match against Elena Rybakina. The result prevents a highly anticipated rematch of the 2021 US Open final between Raducanu and Fernandez.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Kansas Governor Laura Kelly are reportedly leaving the National Governors Association, a prominent bipartisan organization. Sources indicate their departure stems from frustration over the NGA's perceived lack of pushback against Trump administration policies and federal overreach impacting states. The governors feel the organization is not fulfilling its mission to advocate for state interests. Other governors, like Maryland's Wes Moore, acknowledged the frustrations but argued for working to reform the NGA from within.</p>

          <p>A new BBC documentary investigates the Jesus Army, a now-disbanded evangelical group based in Northamptonshire, revealing it as one of the UK's most abusive cults. The investigation, which began years ago, uncovered hundreds of cases of trauma, including the widespread sexual and physical abuse of children within the group's communal houses. The documentary director highlights that many survivors are still processing their trauma, which has had a lasting impact on their lives. The Jesus Fellowship Trust has since apologized and funded a redress scheme for victims.</p>

This action comes amid reports of starvation-related deaths and deadly incidents around aid distribution sites. While Israel states there is no deliberate starvation, UN agencies and humanitarian groups report that aid delivery is severely hampered by restrictions and that malnutrition, especially among children, is rapidly increasing.

While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather, it stands in stark contrast to the oppressive heat seen in other parts of California.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 17:30:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to better protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing, and processes for opening new businesses in disused shops would be streamlined. The government hopes these reforms will help revitalize struggling town centers and support the hospitality industry. The changes aim to promote outdoor dining and live performances while preventing established venues from being threatened by new neighbors.</p>

          <p>Opposition lawmakers in Taiwan have successfully survived a recall vote, allowing them to maintain their controlling majority in the legislature. The recall campaign targeted 24 opposition members accused of being "pro-China" and undermining national security, but it failed to unseat them. This outcome ensures the continuation of political gridlock, as the opposition has consistently stymied the agenda of President William Lai's Democratic Progressive Party. The result is a victory for the opposition KMT party amid rising military and diplomatic pressure from Beijing.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed a convicted fraudster who orchestrated an elaborate plan for a massive, but entirely fake, music festival in Wales. The man, James Kenny, promised a 45,000-capacity event with headliners like The Killers and Pulp, attracting employees and suppliers with false claims of major investors and government backing. The scheme unraveled when payments failed to materialize and documents, including invoices and bank transfers, were discovered to be potential forgeries. The article details how the "fantasist" built a festival based on lies, leaving people unpaid and disillusioned.</p>

In October 2023, Czuba stabbed 6-year-old Wadee Alfayoumi 26 times and seriously wounded his mother, Hanan Shaheen, targeting them because they were Muslim. The attack, which occurred days after the start of the Israel-Hamas war, drew global condemnation and heightened fears of anti-Muslim violence.

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight en route to Las Vegas performed a sudden dive of several hundred feet to avoid a potential collision with another aircraft shortly after takeoff from Burbank.

The maneuver was described as aggressive by passengers, with some flying out of their seats, but the flight continued safely to its destination. The FAA is investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is set to hear arguments in a major lawsuit challenging former President Trump's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). This law is the legal foundation for many of his significant tariffs, and a lower court has already ruled that he exceeded his authority. The outcome of this case, which is expected to reach the Supreme Court, could invalidate numerous trade deals and tariff actions from his administration. The administration argues the law grants the president broad power to regulate imports for national security. (not investment advice)</p>

After taking five wickets in the first innings, the all-rounder did not bowl on day four as India mounted a strong defense, with coaches citing he was "a bit stiff and sore." Stokes has a history of injury issues, and his absence from the bowling attack is a significant concern for England. His side needs to take eight more wickets on the final day to win the match.</p>
