          <p>Convicted Jeffrey Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell has requested congressional immunity or a presidential pardon as a condition for her testimony before a House committee. Her lawyer stated these are non-negotiable terms, otherwise she will invoke her Fifth Amendment rights. The article also details former President Trump's recent comments, where he claimed Epstein had "stole" Virginia Giuffre from his Mar-a-Lago club. Additionally, it covers Trump's ongoing defamation lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch's News Corp over a Wall Street Journal story about him and Epstein.</p>

          <p>Starbucks announced its sixth straight quarter of same-store sales declines, with a global drop of 2% that was steeper than analysts anticipated. Despite this, the company's North American performance was better than feared, and its China market saw 2% growth. CEO Brian Niccol expressed confidence in the company's turnaround strategy, stating that progress is being made despite the financial results not yet fully reflecting it. The company is planning future initiatives, including new menu items and a refreshed rewards program, to regain momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spotify's stock experienced its worst day in over a year, falling more than 11% after the company reported disappointing second-quarter results and issued weak guidance for the upcoming quarter. The music streaming service missed revenue expectations and posted a net loss, attributing the results to increased personnel and marketing costs. CEO Daniel Ek acknowledged the performance issues as an "execution challenge" rather than a strategic failure. The company is focusing on improving its advertising business and noted promising signs in its programmatic ad sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has given Russian President Vladimir Putin a firm 10-day deadline to enter into a peace agreement to end the war in Ukraine. If no deal is reached by August 8, Trump stated he will impose significant tariffs on Russia. The president expressed some doubt about whether these economic measures would influence Putin's decisions regarding the conflict. The move could also involve secondary sanctions on countries like China and India if they continue to purchase Russian oil, complicating ongoing trade negotiations with those nations.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the recent announcement by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to recognize a Palestinian state, questioning whether the move can be more than a symbolic gesture. The decision comes after significant political pressure from within his party and the public. The recognition is conditional on Israel taking steps toward peace, but given the current Israeli government's stance, these conditions seem unlikely to be met. The analysis suggests that while the pledge is a major shift in British foreign policy, its real-world impact may be limited without support from the U.S., which holds greater influence over Israel.</p>

          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has reported that the death toll from Israel's military offensive has now exceeded 60,000 people since the conflict began in October 2023. The figure includes over 18,500 children and nearly 9,800 women. Recent Israeli strikes reportedly killed dozens more, including individuals near an aid distribution point. In response to the ongoing crisis, a senior Hamas official stated that the group would halt indirect ceasefire talks with Israel while starvation persists in the territory, further complicating negotiation efforts.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency is moving to revoke its 2009 "endangerment finding," a landmark scientific conclusion that greenhouse gases threaten public health and must be regulated under the Clean Air Act. This finding has served as the legal basis for nearly all federal climate regulations, including vehicle emission standards. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as a major deregulatory action intended to save Americans billions and increase consumer choice. Environmental groups have condemned the decision as illegal and dangerous, vowing to challenge it in court.</p>

          <p>An analysis by financial experts suggests that President Trump's threatened tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals could have a varied impact across the industry. Companies with larger U.S. manufacturing footprints, such as AbbVie, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Eli Lilly, may be better positioned to handle the duties. Conversely, firms like Novartis and Roche, with more extensive overseas operations, could face greater financial risk. Analysts note that tariffs above 50% would be particularly damaging, potentially forcing aggressive reshoring of manufacturing and cuts to research and development spending.

          <p>This article explores the tactical possibilities for Liverpool following the potential signings of two elite strikers, Alexander Isak and Hugo Ekitike, in a single transfer window. The move suggests a significant strategic shift under new manager Arne Slot, ending the Jürgen Klopp era. The analysis presents several potential formations, including a squeezed 4-2-3-1 with narrow wingers and a riskier 4-4-2. It also considers the likelihood that the two forwards would be part of a regular rotation system to manage a long season, rather than consistently starting together in a single formation.</p>
