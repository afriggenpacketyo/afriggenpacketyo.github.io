          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose a 35% tariff on all imports from Canada, set to begin on August 1. The White House justified the move by citing Canada's alleged failure to stop the flow of fentanyl, though it also warned of higher levies if Ottawa retaliates with its own duties. This action escalates ongoing trade tensions, which have previously involved disputes over steel, aluminum, and a digital services tax, creating further economic uncertainty.

          <p>The U.S. State Department is moving forward with a plan to lay off nearly 1,800 domestic employees in the coming days. This action follows a recent Supreme Court decision that permitted the Trump administration's plan to downsize the federal workforce. The layoffs are part of a broader reorganization effort unveiled by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, which aims to streamline the agency by merging or eliminating over 300 bureaus and offices deemed redundant.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece in The Guardian reflects on the 30th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, where over 8,000 Bosnian men and boys were killed. The author, Australian minister Ed Husic, draws a parallel between the international community's declaration of "never again" after past atrocities and the current situation in Gaza. The article questions whether the world is repeating a cycle of witnessing suffering and acting too late, urging for a more decisive response.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing an extraordinarily warm year, with 2025 having the warmest spring on record and June being the hottest ever for England. An analysis by the BBC explains that while natural weather patterns play a role, the increased frequency and intensity of these heatwaves are an unequivocal result of human-induced climate change. This trend suggests that extreme heat is becoming a more regular and predictable feature of British summers.</p>

          <p>Despite having the world's lowest birth rate, South Korea is experiencing a boom in its fertility treatment industry. This paradoxical trend is driven by a growing number of couples who delay having children due to high living costs and demanding careers, and then turn to IVF and other treatments later in life. While this signals a persistent desire for parenthood, the significant financial and emotional costs of treatment remain a major challenge for many.</p>

The findings, published in Nature Geoscience, indicate that the longest and most extreme heat events are changing most rapidly.
