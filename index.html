          <p>A 42-year-old man has been taken into custody after allegedly stabbing eleven people in what authorities are calling a random attack at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan. The incident, which occurred near the checkout area, left six victims in critical condition and five in serious condition. The suspect reportedly used a folding knife and was apprehended by a sheriff's deputy with assistance from citizens in the store. State and federal officials are involved in the investigation, and public figures have condemned the brutal act of violence.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Florida have arrested four individuals, including a married couple, on charges of aggravated child abuse involving nine children aged 7 to 16. The suspects are accused of confining the children in plywood cages, spraying them with vinegar, and beating them with canes. Investigators noted that the four adopted children were treated more harshly than the biological children and were unaware of their own full names or birthdays. The investigation began after a church member reported concerns, leading to the removal of all children from the home.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Official's Remarks on Ancient Kingdoms Strain Relations with South Korea</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 00:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A senior Chinese official has ignited diplomatic sensitivities with South Korea by calling for a more assertive presentation of China's historical claim over ancient kingdoms. The party chief of Jilin province urged scholars to clearly explain that the kingdoms of Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae, which existed in northeastern China and the Korean peninsula, are part of Chinese history. This move contests the Korean perspective and is seen as part of a broader effort to frame history in a way that reinforces modern territorial narratives. The official's comments link this historical project to resisting past foreign encroachment during China's "century of humiliation."</p>

          <p>China's government is increasingly suppressing news coverage of mass casualty events, such as stabbings and vehicle attacks, prompting some citizens to voice their frustration online. The Communist Party's information control has expanded under Xi Jinping, and recent incidents, including a car striking children near a Beijing school, have seen details scrubbed from the internet. While authorities may be trying to prevent copycat crimes, experts suggest local officials are also covering up security failures. This clampdown marks a shift from the past, when basic details of such attacks were often released to the public.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a civilian-led rival government, escalating the country's 27-month civil war and raising fears of a permanent partition. The new administration, led by RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government. This move, aimed at establishing a secular "New Sudan," could allow the RSF to secure international legitimacy and advanced weaponry. The United Nations has warned that this development risks further fragmenting the nation, which is already suffering from mass displacement and a severe famine risk.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury found former ballerina Ashley Benefield guilty of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield. Prosecutors argued she killed him to ensure sole custody of their child, while the defense claimed it was self-defense after years of alleged abuse. The complex trial featured testimony about their turbulent relationship, a failed ballet company, and numerous accusations from both sides, including Ashley's unsubstantiated claim that Doug had poisoned her. Though acquitted of second-degree murder, the manslaughter conviction carries a sentence of up to 30 years in prison.</p>

While both countries publicly thanked him, their positions remain unchanged: Cambodia seeks an unconditional ceasefire, while Thailand insists on dialogue first.

          <p>Approximately 400 passengers on a high-speed ICE train traveling from Vienna to Hamburg were stuck inside a tunnel for over six hours following a power failure. The incident left passengers in the dark and without air conditioning in the heat. The evacuation operation was prolonged when some passengers exited the train on foot into the tunnel, forcing a safety shutdown of power to a replacement train. Eventually, all passengers were evacuated through emergency exits and transported back to Vienna by bus, with two individuals receiving on-site medical treatment.</p>

          <p>The United States Postal Service is celebrating its 250th anniversary, an occasion marked by a special event at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum and the release of new commemorative stamps.

The celebration occurs amid modern challenges, including recent rumors that the Trump administration was considering privatizing the agency, a move the new Postmaster General has stated he does not support.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow, but an MRI revealed no serious ligament damage. The two-time MVP, who leads the major leagues in batting average, received a PRP injection and is expected to miss 10 to 14 days. Judge first felt pain during a game against Toronto and hopes to return initially as a designated hitter once he is cleared. The news came as a relief to the team, which had feared a more severe, long-term injury for its star player.</p>

          <p>Beyond his legendary music career, the late Ozzy Osbourne is being remembered for his iconic role in pioneering celebrity reality television with the early 2000s MTV show, "The Osbournes." The series, which followed the daily life of his family, presented the "Prince of Darkness" as a lovable, often-confused father, a stark contrast to his heavy metal persona. The show's success, blending mundane family life with rock-star fame, won an Emmy and paved the way for future reality TV dynasties like the Kardashians. It offered an unprecedented, and at the time unscripted, look into the private world of a celebrity family.</p>

          <p>Floribert Bwana Chui Bin Kositi, a 26-year-old Congolese customs official murdered in 2007 after refusing bribes, has been declared a martyr by the Catholic Church and is on the path to sainthood. A devout Catholic, Kositi was killed after he blocked a shipment of spoiled rice that smugglers were trying to bring into the country, fearing it would poison people. Despite threats, he stood by his principles, an act the Church considers a testament to his faith. His story of integrity has been highlighted by Pope Francis as an example for young people to resist the "filth of corruption."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As football fans prepare for the tense Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the intense physical and emotional reactions that come with watching a high-stakes match. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, causes elevated heart rates and anxiety, which is a normal sign of deep engagement. Experts advise managing these effects by getting good rest, having a clear plan for the day, and engaging in movement to release pent-up energy. They also suggest reframing the nerves as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that provides a rare outlet for emotional expression.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the 60s. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold, deep ocean water to the surface. While the Bay Area remains cool, other parts of California are dealing with oppressive heat and dangerous fire conditions. Forecasters warn that despite the cold start, the Bay Area's hottest months are often September and October, so a heatwave is still possible.</p>
