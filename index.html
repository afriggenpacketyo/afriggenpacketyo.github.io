          <p>A 34-year-old man and his family saved $60,000 to quit their jobs and move from Ohio to Taipei for 13 months. The primary motivation was to allow their young son to spend meaningful time with his paternal grandparents, who live in Taiwan. The experience proved transformative, leading them to re-evaluate their career priorities, embrace a happier life on a lower income, and even welcome a new child born during their stay. The family found the time abroad essential for personal growth and strengthening family bonds.</p>

Coming on as a second-half substitute, he quickly influenced the game by drawing a penalty that led to the tying goal in a 2-2 draw. Son expressed slight disappointment in not securing a win but was touched by the warm welcome he received from fans, a contrast to the hostile receptions often seen in away games. His move is highly anticipated to resonate with Los Angeles's large Korean community.</p>

          <p>As generative AI empowers cyberattackers with more sophisticated tools, corporations are increasingly recruiting AI agents for their defense teams. These autonomous AI "teammates" are used to automate routine tasks, analyze threats, and handle alerts, freeing up human cybersecurity professionals to focus on more complex issues. This shift is seen as a necessary response to the rising scale of AI-driven attacks and helps address the talent shortage in the cybersecurity field. Experts view this as an augmentation of human capabilities rather than a replacement, improving efficiency in a rapidly evolving threat landscape.</p>

          <p>London authorities are bracing for another day of demonstrations related to the Israel-Gaza war, with a march planned to demand the release of hostages held by Hamas. This follows a day where police arrested nearly 500 people for showing support for Palestine Action, a recently banned pro-Palestinian organization. The weekend's events highlight the intense and conflicting public reactions in the UK to the ongoing conflict and to Israel's plan to occupy Gaza City. Organizers of the hostage-release march emphasize their demand is a human issue, not a political one.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 474 people at a demonstration in Parliament Square for supporting Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed under the Terrorism Act. The protest, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw hundreds of individuals display signs of support, leading to the largest number of single-day arrests by the force in a decade. While the Home Secretary defended the ban and the police response, organizations like Amnesty International criticized the mass arrests as disproportionate and a threat to freedom of expression.

The crucial piece of evidence was a small metal part of the door lock found under Pennig's body, suggesting the door was forced open *before* she was shot.

The author argues that the legacy of Jewish suffering should inspire a commitment to preventing hunger and persecution for all peoples, including Palestinians. The piece criticizes the Israeli government's blockade and the resulting humanitarian crisis, asserting that ensuring food and water for all must supersede political ideology. It is a call for empathy and imagination to envision a future of shared existence.</p>

          <h2>Planners Look to ‘Sponge City’ Model to Address Los Angeles's Chronic Flooding Issues</h2>

          <p>As cities like Los Angeles grapple with intensifying floods and droughts, some urban planners are advocating for the "sponge city" model, which uses nature-based solutions to absorb and manage stormwater. Pioneered in China and implemented in cities like Bangkok, this approach replaces impermeable concrete with green infrastructure like parks and wetlands. These spaces capture and filter rainwater, replenishing groundwater and reducing strain on drainage systems, while also providing recreational benefits. Los Angeles County has begun funding such projects, but progress is slow and costly, highlighting the challenges of retrofitting a metropolis.</p>

          <p>Facing the threat of diminishing water supplies from traditional sources like the Colorado River due to climate change, Southern California water agencies are planning for a more resilient future. The Metropolitan Water District is pursuing major investments in local sources, including an $8 billion project to recycle wastewater, which could eventually supply half a million homes. The goal is to create a diversified portfolio including recycled water, stormwater capture, and possibly desalination to avoid a "Day Zero" crisis where taps run dry. These costly projects aim to ensure long-term sustainability while keeping water affordable.</p>

          <p>A new Los Angeles law raising the minimum wage for hotel and airport workers to $30 per hour has ignited a battle between labor unions and business groups, leading to a series of aggressive ballot proposals. After business groups filed a referendum to repeal the wage hike, the Unite Here Local 11 union countered with four measures, including one to require citywide votes on major developments. In response, business leaders proposed a measure to repeal the city's entire business tax, a move officials warn would gut funding for essential services. The escalating conflict reflects a lack of negotiated compromise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As California wildfires grow faster and more intense, some emergency response experts argue that shelter-in-place policies are becoming a necessary survival strategy. Institutions like Pepperdine University have successfully used this approach for decades, relying on fire-resistant buildings and extensive brush clearance to protect students when evacuation is not feasible. Researchers from the National Institute of Standards and Technology are now pushing to develop official standards for community fire shelters and outdoor safety zones. They argue that as fires increasingly trap residents, having pre-planned, designated refuges could be crucial to saving lives.</p>

          <p>UCLA academics are in limbo after the Trump administration suspended $584 million in federal research grants, a move following a Justice Department finding that the university inadequately addressed antisemitism on campus. The freeze affects at least 800 grants, imperiling potentially lifesaving research in fields like cancer and infectious diseases, and threatening the salaries of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars. While professors' work continues for now, they are scrambling for alternative funding. The administration has demanded a $1 billion fine to resolve the issue, which the California governor has called "extortion."</p>

          <p>Despite being a major focus of protest, California was not the state with the most ICE arrests during the first five months of President Trump's second term, according to a data analysis. Texas led the nation with over 26,000 arrests, followed by Florida, with California third. When adjusted for population, California ranked 27th. Experts attribute the disparity to greater cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE in Republican-led states. However, California did see one of the most dramatic increases in arrest rates, with a 212% jump, as federal agents conducted more at-large arrests in communities.</p>
