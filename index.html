          <h2>Los Angeles Mayor Describes Widespread Fear Amid Federal Immigration Raids</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 11:57:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass reports that recent immigration raids under the Trump administration have instilled significant fear throughout the city's large immigrant communities. She described how neighborhoods can feel like ghost towns as residents, including legal residents and citizens, are afraid to leave their homes. Bass criticized the tactics used by federal agents, such as wearing masks and using unmarked vehicles, which she argues create a climate of terror and resemble kidnappings rather than lawful enforcement. The mayor also questioned the necessity of the continued military presence in the city.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will not resign, even though exit polls suggest his ruling coalition is set to lose its majority in the upper house election. The projected defeat for the Liberal Democratic Party and its partner Komeito is attributed to public frustration over rising prices and a series of political scandals. Losing control of both parliamentary houses would significantly weaken Ishiba's influence and could lead to political instability, especially during critical trade negotiations with the United States.</p>

          <p>Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner has sharply criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for the $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed's headquarters. Turner argues these funds are being wasted while high interest rates, which he blames on Powell, are making it difficult for Americans to afford homes. The critique is part of a broader Trump administration pressure campaign against Powell for not lowering interest rates, a move they claim is stifling economic growth and perpetuating the housing crisis.

          <p>Republican Representative Tim Burchett of Tennessee is continuing his push for the Department of Justice to release evidence related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. Speaking on Sunday, Burchett emphasized the need for transparency but also cautioned that the identities of victims and innocent individuals should be protected. He acknowledged President Trump's recent directive for the Attorney General to unseal grand jury evidence as a positive first step. Burchett expressed skepticism that the full truth will ever be revealed, citing Washington's tendency to protect its secrets.</p>

          <p>A new peace declaration has been signed between the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the AFC/M23 rebel group, aiming to establish a permanent ceasefire and begin negotiations. However, experts and analysts remain skeptical about the deal's long-term success, citing the challenges of implementation that have plagued previous agreements. Diverging interpretations of the terms, such as the withdrawal of rebel forces, emerged just hours after the signing. The agreement lacks enforcement mechanisms and leaves critical issues like justice for war crimes unresolved, raising doubts about genuine political will for lasting peace.</p>

          <p>The small desert town of Newberry Springs, California, a historic stop on Route 66, is hoping for a resurgence as the famous highway approaches its 100th anniversary in 2026. Once a bustling hub, the town declined after being bypassed by a new interstate in the 1970s, leaving it feeling like a ghost town. Local residents and business owners are now planning events and preservation projects to attract the anticipated influx of tourists and caravan drivers celebrating the centennial. They aim to capitalize on the milestone to revitalize their community while preserving its unique, time-capsule character.</p>

          <p>Family members of Israeli hostages still held in Gaza are voicing increasing mistrust in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to secure their release. Campaigners feel that opportunities for deals have been missed and that far-right elements within the ruling coalition prioritize political goals over human lives. They express more hope in the United States administration to pressure Israel into an agreement. This sentiment is fueled by the deaths of several hostages in captivity who might have been saved by earlier truce deals, deepening the families' sense of urgency and frustration.</p>

          <p>Recent developments in personality science suggest that individuals can intentionally change their characteristic traits, such as neuroticism or introversion, through sustained effort. This article profiles writer Olga Khazan, who documented her year-long project to redesign her personality in her book "Me, But Better." By consciously adopting new behaviors outside her comfort zone, like taking an improv class to combat social anxiety, she was able to shift her personality. Experts say this process of 'faking it until you make it' can lead to genuine, lasting changes in how people think, feel, and behave.</p>

          <p>Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is facing bipartisan criticism for circumventing a 2021 law by restoring the names of army bases previously named after Confederate generals. Hegseth claims the bases are being renamed for other historical soldiers who coincidentally share the same last names, a move lawmakers have called a transparent effort to flout the law. The House Armed Services Committee, with some Republican support, voted to block the action, arguing it is an insult to the country to honor figures who fought to preserve slavery.</p>

The poll also shows that Hispanic Americans' approval of the president has declined, and that a majority of Americans want the administration to focus more on lowering prices rather than on deportation or tariffs.

          <p>An opinion piece in The Atlantic expresses the growing fear among naturalized U.S. citizens due to the Trump administration's rhetoric and policies. The author highlights the administration's pledge to pursue denaturalization and the questioning of birthright citizenship as actions that undermine the permanence of their status. This creates a chilling effect, making many naturalized citizens, who number nearly 25 million, feel their rights are precarious and less secure than those of natural-born Americans. The essay argues this challenges the very definition of American citizenship.</p>
