          <p>Vance Boelter, the suspect in the shooting of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, possessed a cache of weapons and a hit list in his vehicle, according to court documents. Boelter allegedly posed as a police officer and used a Ford SUV with police lights to carry out the shootings. The hit list contained about 70 names, including public officials and abortion rights advocates, with former congressman Dean Phillips confirming his name was on the list. Boelter was captured after a two-day manhunt and faces four felony counts of second-degree murder. </p>

JPMorgan Chase announced an imminent refresh of its Sapphire Reserve, while American Express stated that "major" changes are coming to its consumer and business Platinum cards later this year. The updates are expected to include enhanced benefits around lounges, dining, and events, potentially accompanied by increases in annual fees. This competition was ignited when JPMorgan shook up the industry in 2016 with a lavish sign-on bonus and other incentives for its Sapphire card.</p>

          <p>Trade talks between the US and China in London signaled cautious optimism for de-escalating tensions, with negotiators agreeing on a framework to implement previous consensus. Both sides expressed positive sentiments regarding the talks, which addressed issues such as rare earths, Chinese student visas, and US exports of jet engine parts to China. Experts remain cautious about whether the momentum can lead to broader dialogue on challenging issues like military communications, security, climate, and fentanyl cooperation.

          <p>The Asian needle ant, an invasive species first detected in the US in 1932, continues to spread across the country, now detected in 20 states. While not aggressive, the ant's sting can cause anaphylaxis in some individuals, prompting experts to raise public awareness of the risks. These ants often colonize undisturbed forest areas and can also be found near homes and businesses. Entomologists recommend wearing gloves and shoes when gardening and cleaning up woody debris to avoid contact, and encourage those with a history of anaphylaxis to seek medical attention if stung.</p>

          <p>New York City's congestion pricing, implemented in January, charges drivers entering lower Manhattan a $9 toll, aiming to reduce traffic and fund public transit. Early results suggest the policy is working, with a decrease of 70,000 vehicles entering the congestion zone daily and buses moving up to 20% faster on routes through Manhattan. The program is expected to raise $500 million annually for public transit upgrades, but faces opposition from conservatives and potential termination by a Trump administration. Despite the challenges, public sentiment has improved, with 42% approval in March, and 66% support from those entering the toll zone multiple times a week.</p>

Parents should be active members of their child's sporting environment, prioritizing the child's autonomy and well-being.

          <p>Federal immigration agents conducted raids at Home Depots in Los Angeles, targeting undocumented immigrant workers who often gather in store parking lots seeking employment. The raids have disrupted the local economy and caused fear among workers, even those with legal status. Advocates say the raids have entrapped immigrant workers who have contributed to building the city, triggering painful flashbacks for those who escaped violence in their home countries. The Department of Homeland Security denies blocking attorneys from seeing detained clients, despite documented evidence to the contrary.</p>

          <p>In Hawaii, scientists are using drones to release live mosquitoes as part of a project to save endangered forest birds. The mosquitoes, all males containing a strain of bacteria called wolbachia, are released into honeycreeper habitats to disrupt reproduction and reduce the spread of avian malaria. The approach has little ecological downside, as mosquitoes are not native to Hawaii, and has been successful in stemming mosquito populations in other parts of the world. While it is still too soon to tell if this method is working, the goal is to suppress the spread of disease and save the remaining avian species.</p>

          <p>Iran fired missiles at Israel, killing civilians, as the conflict between the two nations escalated. The Israeli military accused Tehran of deliberately targeting civilians with its strikes. In response, Israel launched aerial attacks on Iranian missile launchers and military targets. President Trump warned Iran against retaliating on U.S. targets and denied involvement in the Israeli attack. The fighting has led to the cancellation of talks on Iran's nuclear program between the U.S. and Iran.</p>
