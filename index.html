          <p>North Carolina's Outer Banks, including Ocracoke and Hatteras Islands, is undergoing mandatory evacuations as Hurricane Erin approaches, prompting a state of emergency. Officials anticipate dangerous surf, life-threatening storm surge of 2-4 feet, and extensive inland flooding, potentially hindering emergency responses and damaging infrastructure like I-40. Concurrently, strong rip currents have led to swimming bans at New York City beaches and urgent warnings for beachgoers in New Jersey, with both states preparing for possible flooding. This widespread preparedness underscores the severe and multifaceted threat posed by the hurricane to the U.S. East Coast, emphasizing safety precautions for coastal communities and their economic drivers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reverse mortgages, which allow homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash without monthly mortgage payments, are not universally accessible due to increasingly rigorous application processes. Key disqualifying factors include failing to meet age requirements, particularly when a younger spouse is involved, or possessing insufficient home equity, typically requiring at least 50%. Furthermore, properties must adhere to strict FHA standards, with major structural issues or neglected maintenance often leading to denial. Applicants also undergo mandatory financial assessments to verify their ability to cover ongoing property expenses like taxes and insurance, and must complete a HUD-approved counseling session.

          <p>Five veteran FBI agents, including former acting director Brian Driscoll and Washington field office head Steven Jensen, were summarily fired in August without clear explanations, sparking widespread shock and concerns about political motivations. Sources close to the agents allege that some were targeted due to their involvement in criminal investigations against Donald Trump or the January 6 inquiry. Whistleblower attorneys are preparing lawsuits, asserting a "despicable purge" driven by external political interference, potentially from the White House or Justice Department. The abrupt dismissals will deprive these agents of their full pensions, with one particularly poignant case occurring just a month after an agent's wife passed away.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller encountered vocal heckling from protesters during a photo opportunity with National Guard troops at Washington D.C.'s Union Station. The officials, who purchased lunch for the guardsmen, dismissed the crowd's "Free DC" chants as "crazy" and "communists," with Vance claiming the station was overrun by homeless people. Vance also asserted that crime statistics don't fully capture street crime, declining to provide evidence. This public confrontation unfolded simultaneously with a news conference by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, underscoring the deep divisions and ongoing tensions surrounding the National Guard's deployment in the city.</p>

          <p>Intel is reportedly in discussions with various large investors to secure an equity infusion at a discounted price, following a 7% stock slide that erased recent gains. This development follows a $2 billion capital injection from SoftBank and ongoing reports of potential Trump administration involvement through CHIPS Act funds. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick had previously asserted that the U.S. government should receive an equity stake in exchange for CHIPS Act funding, a prospect Intel views as dilutive. The chipmaker is in the midst of a challenging turnaround, having struggled with declining sales and market share for years, and requires significant capital to expand its manufacturing business and capitalize on the burgeoning artificial intelligence sector.

          <p>The Trump administration is significantly reshaping the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), with President Trump indicating a move towards less federal disaster relief funding and more direct oversight from his office. This policy shift is poised to place a greater financial burden on state and local governments, which are already responsible for the bulk of disaster recovery costs. Critics, including the Government Accountability Office, have long pointed to FEMA's slow payout processes and difficulties in streamlining recovery programs. The situation in North Carolina after Hurricane Helene, where federal funds covered only a fraction of the nearly $60 billion in damages, highlights the severe challenges states may face with reduced federal support for future disasters.</p>

          <p>The article highlights Donetsk's critical strategic importance for Ukraine, especially as Russia reportedly seeks to freeze the war along current front lines in exchange for the region's surrender. Ukraine still controls about 6,600 square kilometers of Donetsk, including major urban centers like Kramatorsk and Slovyansk, which form a vital part of the Donbas industrial region. This territory is militarily crucial due to an 11-year "fortress belt" of extensive defensive infrastructure, including trenches, bunkers, and minefields, as well as defensible topography like the Chasiv Yar height. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has firmly rejected any Russian proposals to give up Donbas, asserting it would serve as a dangerous springboard for future attacks and represents a grievous loss of land and a potential new refugee exodus.</p>

Despite having recently surged to record highs after posting its first $1 billion-revenue quarter, largely fueled by the artificial intelligence boom and securing major government contracts, Palantir's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 193 times still suggests its shares remain considerably expensive when compared to its megacap peers.

The company acknowledged it is navigating a "challenging economic environment," aligning with warnings from other consumer companies about impending price increases due to these trade policies.

This ongoing delay represents a significant setback for families who are legally entitled to and expecting this debt relief, particularly impacting borrowers who may have previously been enrolled in other income-driven repayment plans. While the hold on IBR discharges may not immediately affect borrowers still years away from debt forgiveness, it introduces considerable uncertainty for those nearing the completion of their repayment period.

A national strategy, they argue, would bolster the UK's position as a global financial center, generate new fee and foreign exchange revenue streams, and support demand for gilts through innovative digital channels.

          <p>Lowe's surpassed Wall Street's quarterly earnings expectations and announced a significant $8.8 billion acquisition of Foundation Building Materials, a leading distributor for large residential and commercial professionals. This strategic move is part of Lowe's broader effort to attract more lucrative and stable business from home professionals, as overall home improvement demand remains softer due to elevated borrowing costs and mortgage rates. CEO Marvin Ellison noted an improvement in sales trends later in the quarter, particularly in July, but prudently cautioned against declaring it a sustained trend. The acquisition, alongside other recent pro-focused purchases, strategically positions Lowe's for anticipated growth when housing activity and mortgage rates eventually unlock, despite the company also navigating challenges like higher costs from tariffs.

          <p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, acting on direct orders from President Donald Trump, has revoked the security clearances of 37 current and former U.S. intelligence officials. Gabbard stated that these officials "abused the public trust by politicizing and manipulating intelligence, leaking classified intelligence without authorization, and or committing intentional egregious violations of tradecraft standards." This sweeping action primarily targets individuals who served under former Democratic presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama, and it follows Trump's previous revocations of clearances for other critics. Democrats have largely dismissed these moves as politically motivated distractions, accusing the White House of attempting to deflect attention from unpopular policies and other ongoing controversies, while also raising concerns about the politicization of the intelligence community.</p>

While many top-performing tech stocks in the portfolio saw declines, some previously struggling names like DuPont, Bristol Myers Squibb, and Dover showed positive momentum. This market rebalancing highlights a dynamic investment environment where investors are actively re-evaluating valuations and seeking opportunities in sectors that have been comparatively overlooked, indicating a strategic reallocation of capital.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul emphasized that borders should not be shifted by force, a clear message regarding Taiwan, which Beijing claims. Both nations aim to assume greater security responsibility, with Germany increasing its military presence in the region and deepening intelligence sharing with Japan. Japan, which has already made strides in reducing its strategic dependence on China for rare earths, also strongly supports Ukraine against Russia, contrasting with Beijing's stance. This enhanced cooperation seeks to collectively defend the international rules-based order and diversify critical supply chains, learning from past mistakes in Europe.</p>

Fiddelke, a 20-year Target veteran who previously served as CFO, outlined his immediate priorities to restore Target's reputation for stylish and unique items, provide a more consistent customer experience, and leverage technology for efficient business operations.

Prosecutors detailed how some of the women were sexually abused after being recruited to a "homebase team" and subjected to sexual favors, often under the guise of massages. Brain had been fast-tracked for ordination in 1991 due to the NOS's initial success, but the group was ultimately dissolved in 1995 when the first concerns about his behavior were raised.

Trump asserted that the delay negatively impacts thousands of jobs and benefits "other Copper competitive Countries," stressing the immediate need for domestic copper production.

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is actively exploring significant property tax reforms ahead of the November Budget, aiming to address government borrowing rules after ruling out increases to income tax, national insurance, or VAT. Among the options reportedly under consideration are changes to Capital Gains Tax (CGT) relief for pricier homes, a move that could generate billions but might also prove controversial by potentially slowing down transactions. Another major consideration is the abolition of stamp duty, a tax on home purchases, which would result in lost revenue but could significantly boost market movement. Any such stamp duty removal would likely be offset by other property tax adjustments, such as a comprehensive reform of the council tax system, which currently faces widespread criticism for its outdated 1991 valuations and unfair disparities across different council areas.
