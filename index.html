The author highlights the disproportionate impact on Black women, who are more likely to face pregnancy-related complications and mistreatment in the healthcare system. Smith's family seeks the right to make decisions about her care, free from state interference.</p>

The article highlights the report's methodological flaws, including a lack of transparency about data sources and questionable criteria for defining adverse events.

Unlike previous military leaders, Hegseth has aligned the Defense Department with Trump's MAGA agenda, raising concerns about the military's politicization. The service academies are also at the center of the administration's push to remake military culture, leading to changes in curricula and student groups.</p>

          <p>The death of 4,000 chicks during shipping highlights a broader issue within the poultry industry, where animals are treated as commodities. Mass-casualty events are rare, but many more animals die during transport than most realize, and these deaths are a margin of error baked into the economics of the annual hatching, raising, and slaughtering of billions of chickens for food. Animals raised for food are often transported numerous times throughout their lives, and they’re typically treated like cargo rather than living, feeling animals. The industry could choose to pack fewer animals into each truck, require heating and cooling during transport, and give animals ample time for rest, water, and food on long journeys, but they are unwilling to cut into profits.</p>

The goal is to rehabilitate the cub for up to a year and eventually return him to the wild, potentially pairing him with another cub to avoid human imprinting.</p>

Scientists analyzed fossils and found similarities between the structures of ancient fish armor and vertebrate teeth. This suggests that early vertebrates used their armor to sense their environment, and our teeth inherited that ability to sense pain and temperature. The findings help explain why we experience toothaches and how our skeletons evolved.</p>
