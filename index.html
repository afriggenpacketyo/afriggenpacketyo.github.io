        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republicans in Congress are nearing the passage of a bill that would introduce nationwide work requirements for Medicaid recipients, mandating at least 80 hours of monthly work or community activity for adults without children who became eligible under the Affordable Care Act. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that over 10 million people could lose Medicaid coverage by 2034 due to this provision and stricter eligibility checks. While Republicans argue this will incentivize work and reduce dependency on government assistance, critics point to the failed implementation of similar policies in states like Arkansas, where many lost coverage due to administrative hurdles despite meeting the requirements.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has blocked Harvard University from enrolling future international students and retaining currently enrolled foreign students, citing an unsafe campus environment due to anti-American and pro-terrorist agitators. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Harvard of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party, leading to the revocation of its Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification. Harvard has denounced the decision as unlawful and retaliatory, threatening harm to the university and the nation, while a federal judge issued an injunction potentially blocking the administration's actions. As of Fall 2023, international students comprised over 27% of Harvard's total enrollment.</p>

          <p>A White House report, led by Health Secretary Robert F.

The report criticizes corporate influence in federal policymaking and calls for more research into the causes and prevention of chronic diseases. However, the report has been criticized for misrepresenting scientific consensus on issues like vaccine safety and for not addressing behavioral health issues like smoking and opioid use.

Beijing's strict drug control policy, implemented in May 2019, added all fentanyl-related substances to its list of controlled substances, restricting their export.

The researcher, Shuoli Zhao, suggests these findings contribute to the broader discussion about the overall 'food environment' that children are exposed to, as often times, working families may have limited 'bandwidth' and time on grocery shopping, which leads to unintended suboptimal decisions in food choices.</p>

          <p>The House passed a budget package that includes a provision to raise the tax deduction cap for state and local taxes (SALT) to $40,000 from the current $10,000 limit, which could provide tax savings for homeowners with high property taxes or significant state income tax liabilities. The $40,000 deduction would only be available to filers with household incomes below $500,000. Policy experts say that lifting the SALT cap would result in the federal government forgoing more tax revenue.</p>

          <p>The US Congress is moving to block California's law banning the sale of petrol-only cars by 2035, effectively nullifying a waiver that allowed the state to set stricter emissions standards. This move is a victory for Republicans, energy firms, and carmakers, while it's a blow to Democrats and environmental groups. California's Attorney General Rob Bonta has said the state will sue over the move. Critics argued that the standards were unachievable, while supporters say they reduce costs for drivers, boost manufacturing, improve air quality, and address climate change.</p>

          <p>The Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries after a new review using the Pentagon's standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion titles. Almost all of the books have been returned to the shelves, with only about 20 titles needing to be removed pending a future review by a Department of Defense panel. The reversal comes after a May 9 Pentagon memo set Wednesday as the date by which the military services were to submit and remove book titles from the libraries of their military educational institutions that touch on diversity, race, and gender issues using the Pentagon's specific search terms.</p>

          <p>Stocks are rebounding from a recent sell-off as interest rates decline, with technology stocks leading the market higher. Honeywell announced the acquisition of Johnson Matthey's catalyst technologies unit for $2.4 billion, aligning with the company's strategy of investing in value-accretive businesses. Honeywell has been on a buying spree, spending $11 billion on deals to boost growth, and is also planning to split into three separate companies. The National Association of Realtors reported that existing home sales fell 0.5% month over month in April to a seasonally adjusted rate of 4 million, representing the slowest April pace since 2009.</p>

          <p>Congress has voted to undo a Clean Air Act regulation that strictly controls the amount of toxic air pollutants emitted by many industrial facilities. Environmental groups and public health advocates condemned the vote, saying the rollback could cause higher pollution and harm human health. The vote targets a rule finalized late in the Biden administration, which re-imposed tight regulations on facilities that emit seven so-called "super pollutants." Industry groups welcomed Congress's decision, calling the rules "technically unachievable and economically infeasible."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ability of an annuity to provide a steady income stream for life depends on the type of annuity and the financial health of the insurer. Immediate and lifetime annuities are designed to guarantee income for life, while fixed-term annuities pay out for a set number of years and then stop. Variable and indexed annuities can be tied to investment performance, and their cash value could be depleted if the underlying investments perform poorly. Choosing a lifetime income annuity, diversifying retirement income, researching the insurance company, and monitoring withdrawal habits are strategies to protect against losing annuity payments.</p>

          <p>The number of white nationalist, hate, and anti-government extremist groups in the US has decreased, not due to declining influence, but because many proponents feel their beliefs have become normalized in government and society. The Southern Poverty Law Center's annual report documented 1,371 hate and extremist groups across the country in 2024, down from 1,430 groups in 2023. The report notes that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives became a focal point for many of these groups, influencing policy actions to restrict discussions of race and gender in classrooms and cutting funding for programs affecting marginalized communities.</p>
