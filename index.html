          <p>Global military expenditure surged to a record $2.72 trillion in 2024, marking a significant 9.4% increase from the previous year, the steepest rise since 1988, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. This increase is attributed to Russia's war in Ukraine and escalating tensions in the Middle East. The United States remains the top spender, followed by China, with both nations accounting for nearly half of the global total. Japan's military spending also saw a substantial increase, driven by regional security concerns, while Israel significantly increased spending due to ongoing conflicts. Optimism Score: 20</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent statement questioning why Vladimir Putin would continue to attack Ukraine while the U.S. is trying to broker peace talks has provided a glimmer of hope for Ukrainians. After meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump suggested that Putin may not want to stop the war and might need to be dealt with more firmly, possibly through increased sanctions. This contrasts with previous U.S. proposals that Ukraine abandon NATO aspirations and recognize Crimea as Russian, which Ukraine has rejected. Trump's shift in tone has been viewed as a potential win for Zelensky and Ukraine. Optimism Score: 35</p>

Operators are increasingly choosing to upgrade or replace turbines to increase electricity output by up to 50%. This repowering activity presents economic benefits, as it avoids the need to acquire new property and can increase electricity output while using fewer turbines.

          <p>The BBC has identified members of Kenya's security forces who fatally shot anti-tax protesters at the country's parliament last June. The analysis of over 5,000 images indicates that the victims were unarmed and posed no threat. Despite a parliamentary committee ordering an investigation, no report has been issued, and no one has been held accountable. The BBC's investigation traced the fatal shots back to the rifles of a police officer and a soldier. Optimism Score: 25</p>
