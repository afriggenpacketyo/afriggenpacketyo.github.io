          <p>The wife of a U.S. Coast Guardsman was arrested at Naval Air Station Key West for an expired work visa. Homeland Security Investigations detained her after a routine security check flagged her for a removal order dating back to 2017. The Coast Guard and NCIS cooperated with HSI in the arrest, which occurred as the couple was moving into on-base housing. Immigration arrests have been a priority, and the woman is believed to remain in custody as officials have not responded to requests for comment.</p>

          <p>A recent plane crash near Ronald Reagan National Airport, involving an Army Black Hawk helicopter, has been attributed to the pilots' use of 'visual separation,' a practice allowing pilots to navigate around other aircraft independently. The air traffic controller approved the request, but the maneuver was mishandled, leading to the fatal incident. Aviation experts have warned about the risks associated with visual separation when not properly executed. The Black Hawk crew attempted the maneuver shortly after passing over Washington's cherry trees, highlighting the dangers of even routine aviation practices.</p>

When questioned about investor confidence in the U.S. economy, Bessent dismissed concerns, stating that market fluctuations over a short period are often statistical noise.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates that numerous non-antibiotic drugs, such as those used for cancer, diabetes, and depression, can kill bacteria at typical human dosages. A new machine learning method has identified that these drugs kill bacteria differently than standard antibiotics, potentially offering new targets for antibiotic development. This approach involves genetically screening bacteria to identify mutations that increase or decrease drug sensitivity. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for combating antibiotic resistance and discovering new antibacterial strategies. This research has far-reaching implications for medicine and antibiotic discovery.</p>

          <p>Ukrainians are finding a small measure of optimism in President Trump's recent comments after meeting with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, where he questioned why Putin would continue attacks while the U.S. is trying to broker peace talks. Trump suggested that Putin may need to be 'dealt with differently' through more sanctions, indicating a possible shift in his approach. This has offered a glimmer of hope that Trump may not force Ukraine into a lopsided peace plan, which Ukraine has previously rejected.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is experiencing growing uncertainty regarding the reliability of U.S. support following Donald Trump's imposition of tariffs.

This has caused frustration, especially considering Taiwan's investments in U.S. chip plants and increased defense spending. Taiwan's exclusion from the first round of trade negotiations has raised questions about its strategic value being judged mainly by economic and military contributions.</p>
