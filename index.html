          <p>A mega-bill encompassing President Trump's legislative agenda faces opposition from Republican hard-liners, jeopardizing its advancement out of the House Budget Committee. Representative Ralph Norman and others voice concerns about the bill's impact on the national debt, potentially leading to its failure in the committee. Speaker Mike Johnson is working to sway holdouts, but faces a tough road ahead given the slim Republican majority. The bill's fate is a crucial test for Johnson's speakership as he aims to unify a divided conference, with negotiations ongoing regarding Medicaid and tax reform. </p>
