          <p>The Supreme Court is hearing a case regarding the ability to sue the FBI for damages resulting from a wrong-house raid that occurred in 2017, traumatizing a family. The plaintiffs, Trina Martin, her son Gabe, and Toi Cliatt, are seeking to hold the FBI accountable for the damages they sustained during the mistaken raid, arguing that existing laws should allow victims to sue in such cases. The government contends that sovereign immunity shields them from liability, as the officers were instructed to raid the correct house, not the one they mistakenly targeted. The court's decision could have implications for the accountability of law enforcement in similar situations. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>A new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll indicates that more people give President Trump an F grade than any other grade for his first 100 days in office.

          <p>According to an NPR review, President Trump has used government powers to target over 100 perceived enemies during his second term. This includes launching criminal investigations, detaining individuals through ICE, banning companies from federal contracts, and revoking security clearances. Agencies like the Justice Department, Defense Department, and Department of Homeland Security are involved in the retaliation campaign, which targets political opponents, news organizations, former officials, universities, and law firms.

          <p>Dr. Victoria McCloud, the UK's only publicly transgender former judge, plans to challenge the Supreme Court's ruling on biological sex at the European Court of Human Rights. She argues the judgment and equality watchdog's guidance violate her human rights, leaving her legally defined as "two sexes at once." The Supreme Court ruled that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law, leading to interim guidance that could restrict trans individuals' access to single-sex spaces. McCloud contends that the court failed to consider the human rights implications for trans people. Optimism score: 45</p>

          <p>Economists at Morgan Stanley anticipate that the US and China will engage in negotiations and gradually reduce tariffs on Chinese imports to 60 per cent by the end of the second quarter, despite conflicting statements. More comprehensive talks in the second half of the year could lead to a further reduction in tariffs, bringing them down to 34 per cent by year’s end. Washington has imposed tariffs totalling 145 per cent on Chinese imports so far this year, while Beijing’s new levies on US goods have risen to 125 per cent. Given the damage already done to the economic cycle, the overall direction of growth is expected to remain downward. Optimism score: 50</p>
