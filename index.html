          <p>Several Asian countries have responded to the Trump administration's revised tariff schedule. Nations like Cambodia, Thailand, and Malaysia expressed relief over reduced rates, viewing them as beneficial for their economies and reflective of positive U.S. relations. In contrast, Taiwan faces a temporary 20% tariff pending further negotiations, while India, having not secured a deal, confronts a 25% duty. Japan and Australia also saw favorable outcomes, with officials highlighting increased competitiveness and reduced economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formalized new "reciprocal" tariffs on numerous countries, with rates ranging from 10% to 41%, set to take effect on August 7. The executive order also imposes a steep 40% duty on all goods transshipped to evade tariffs, a move seen as targeting China's interests. While some Asian nations received lower rates than initially proposed, countries without specific agreements face a baseline 10% tax. Trade experts warn that this policy introduces significant uncertainty and could lead to further tariff increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia has publicly denied that its H20 chips, specifically designed for the Chinese market, contain any "back doors" that would permit remote access or control. The statement came after China's cyberspace regulator summoned company representatives to address potential security risks associated with the hardware. This development underscores the significant challenges Nvidia faces as it navigates the escalating technological rivalry between the U.S. and China. The company is attempting to comply with U.S. export controls while still serving its large customer base in Beijing.</p>

The state has carried out more executions in the current year than any other, with two more scheduled for August.

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, has expressed shock over President Trump's recent comment that Epstein had "stolen" her from his Mar-a-Lago club. In a statement, the family called the remark objectifying and demanded answers about what the president knew at the time. This follows reports that the Justice Department recently interviewed Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's associate currently serving a 20-year prison sentence. The family's statement emphasizes that Giuffre was preyed upon, not stolen like an object, highlighting the ongoing trauma for survivors.</p>

          <p>A new anti-poaching initiative in South Africa, called the Rhisotope Project, involves injecting rhino horns with harmless radioactive isotopes to combat illegal trafficking. Launched by the University of the Witwatersrand and partners, the technique makes the horns easily detectable by radiation scanners at borders and airports without harming the animals. Following successful trials, researchers are confident this method can disrupt the black market supply chain. The project aims to protect the country's rhino population, which has been devastated by poaching driven by high demand for their horns.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: U.S. Healthcare Failures Are Not Australia's Fault</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the U.S. should look at its own systemic failures rather than blaming countries like Australia for its high prescription drug costs. The author points out that the U.S. spends nearly twice as much per person on healthcare as other wealthy nations for worse health outcomes, including lower life expectancy. The writer refutes the "freeloader" narrative, noting that U.S. government funding for medical research has stagnated and that many innovations now come from Europe. The article suggests the U.S. could learn from Australia's universal Medicare system.</p>

          <p>In her first interview since leaving office, former Vice President Kamala Harris told Stephen Colbert that she believes the American political system is "broken." She explained her recent decision not to run for governor of California by stating that, for now, she does not want to be "in the system." Harris clarified that her critique is not aimed at public servants but at the systems themselves, which she feels are not strong enough to defend fundamental democratic principles. She plans to travel the country to engage with Americans outside of a political campaign context.</p>

          <p>An anti-terrorism court in Pakistan has sentenced 108 members of former Prime Minister Imran Khan's PTI party to prison for their roles in the May 2023 protests against the military. The convictions, which include a 10-year term for opposition leader Omar Ayub Khan, are a significant blow to the opposition party. The protests erupted after Khan's arrest on corruption charges and led to violent clashes across the country. The PTI has denounced the sentences as politically motivated and a "black day for democracy," vowing to challenge the verdict.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2017, annual university tuition fees for undergraduate degrees in England and Wales have risen, increasing by 3% to £9,535. Maintenance loans for student living costs have also seen a modest increase to help with rising expenses. The government stated the fee hike is in line with inflation, coming after universities warned of significant financial pressures and potential cuts to staff and courses. The change means students are likely to borrow more, with recent graduates in England already facing an average debt of £53,000. (not investment advice)</p>
