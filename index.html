          <p>The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy has conducted its first degaussing exercise for warships using artificial intelligence (AI), increasing the process efficiency by 60%. This AI integration potentially enhances the stealth capacity and survivability of Chinaâ€™s submarine fleet. The exercise, held at a PLA Northern Theatre Command naval base, simulated emergency conditions and tested the AI-assisted decision-making system's performance against traditional manual methods. According to the PLA Daily, degaussing is critical for a warship's survivability in modern combat, and the exercise employed acoustic and electromagnetic modeling to replicate realistic conditions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has arrived in Saudi Arabia, marking the start of his official visit to the Middle East, during which he aims to promote peace between Russia and Ukraine and in the Gaza Strip. The visit follows a joint statement from the U.S. and China announcing a 90-day agreement to reduce reciprocal tariffs, which has been well-received by U.S. markets. Trump is expected to visit three Gulf nations during the four-day trip, focusing on strengthening ties and discussing regional security issues.

          <p>Three key House committees are meeting to advance a major budget package addressing President Trump's defense, energy, and tax priorities, with Republican leaders aiming for a floor vote next week. The Energy and Commerce Committee's proposal includes changes to Medicaid, such as work requirements and eligibility checks, while the Ways and Means plan raises the debt limit by $4 trillion and extends tax cuts from Trump's first term. The Agriculture Committee seeks to increase the age requirement for SNAP benefits, leading to internal divisions among Republicans on Medicaid overhauls and tax deductions. Trump has urged Republicans to unify behind the bill, which also includes funding for border infrastructure and oil and gas leasing mandates.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid President Trump's evolving tariff policies, consumers can save money by seeking sales, checking product origins, and purchasing domestic goods. A U.S. agreement with China would reduce U.S. taxes on Chinese goods to about 30% from 145%, while China will cut tariffs on American goods to 10% from 125%. Electronics and toys are expected to be most affected by tariffs, so consumers should consider planned purchases and move up timelines without panic buying. Under the USMCA, goods traded between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada are mostly tariff-exempt if they meet origin requirements, while domestic staples like apples and potatoes can help avoid price hikes on imported produce.</p>

          <p>President Trump has nominated Dr. Casey Means, a "metabolic health evangelist" and ally of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., as his surgeon general, furthering the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement's influence on federal health policy. Means, who dropped out of her residency program due to concerns about the healthcare system, has gained a large social media following by focusing on personal wellness. Her book, "Good Energy," promotes a theory of "metabolic dysfunction" as the root cause of chronic diseases and criticizes the food and medical industries. While Kennedy praises Means as the perfect choice for surgeon general, her nomination has sparked controversy, with critics questioning her qualifications and views on vaccines.</p>

The study, using data from the 2023 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, highlights that 7.6 million of these children live with a parent with a moderate or severe addiction, and 3.4 million live with a parent with multiple substance use disorders. The study also found that over 6 million children have a parent with both a mental health condition and a substance use disorder, emphasizing the need for increased support and screening for mental health concerns in children of parents with addiction. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that pediatricians inquire about substance use within families to educate and connect them to treatment.</p>

          <p>Republicans on Capitol Hill have reacted with a mix of humor and avoidance to reports that President Trump is considering accepting a luxury jet from the Qatari government for use as Air Force One.

The proposed gift, estimated to be worth $400 million, has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest and security protocols.

Although police prepared a file for prosecutors, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) dropped the case due to insufficient evidence and difficulties identifying the perpetrators.

          <p>This week's inflation report will provide an initial assessment of President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement's impact on U.S. pricing, though economists expect the initial data to defy inflation worries. Trump has eased tariffs significantly since the policy's announcement, including temporarily slashing tariffs on China from 145% to 30%. The rollback of levies on Chinese goods is expected to reduce the average cost of tariffs per household this year from $4,900 to $2,800.

          <p>As President Trump engages in talks in Saudi Arabia, new trade and investment agreements are expected, but China's increasing economic influence in the Gulf region may test economic relations between the Gulf states and the U.S. Washington seeks to counter Beijingâ€™s growing economic footprint, particularly the internationalization of the yuan. China has established currency swaps with Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar, but Washington may pressure these countries to scale back their use of the Chinese currency in future trade negotiations. Analysts suggest that China's economic leverage and political ties could help stabilize the region, especially regarding Iran.</p>

          <p>Japanese carmaker Nissan has announced plans to cut another 11,000 jobs globally and shut down seven factories in response to weak sales, with falling sales in China and heavy discounting in the US impacting earnings.

This announcement follows the collapse of a proposed merger with Honda and Mitsubishi in February. The company also reported an annual loss of 670 billion yen ($4.5bn; Â£3.4bn), with US President Donald Trump's tariffs adding further pressure.</p>

          <p>French cinema icon GÃ©rard Depardieu was convicted of sexually assaulting two women on a film set in Paris in 2021 and received an 18-month suspended sentence. The actor, who denied the charges, was accused of forcefully groping a set decorator and an assistant producer. The assistant producer, identified as AmÃ©lie, expressed satisfaction with the court's decision. The trial opened in October but was adjourned due to Depardieu's health, with medical experts later deeming him fit to attend with limited hours.

          <p>Illinois lawmakers are debating legislation to restrict crime-free housing laws, which have led to evictions for minor offenses. The New York Times and Illinois Answers Project found that hundreds of people have been evicted in Illinois, often for incidents unrelated to their homes. Alternative strategies to enhance rental property safety include protecting domestic violence victims, limiting enforcement to serious crimes, and requiring due process. Some cities have implemented rental registration, complaint hotlines, and code enforcement, while others have repealed or banned the ordinances altogether. The proposed legislation aims to protect renters from overzealous enforcement, allowing cities to evict renters convicted of felonies on rental property while curtailing other enforcement actions.</p>

The laws, intended to combat crime and nuisance tenants, have led to evictions for shoplifting, driving while intoxicated, and excessive 911 calls, often without convictions. A bill is under consideration in the Illinois State Senate to limit evictions under these laws for unconvicted individuals.</p>

With just months left until the treaty's deadline, Mexico has only provided a fraction of the required water, leading to concerns about the future of agriculture in the region.
