          <p>The Freedom Flotilla Coalition, a pro-Palestinian group, reported that Israeli forces boarded and seized its vessel, the Handala, in international waters. The boat was attempting to deliver baby formula and other food aid to the Gaza Strip, defying Israel's long-standing maritime blockade. Israel's foreign ministry confirmed the interception, stating the boat was stopped from illegally entering Gaza's maritime zone and that all passengers were safe. The incident highlights ongoing tensions surrounding humanitarian access to Gaza, which has been under blockade by Israel and Egypt since 2007.</p>

          <p>Turkey has registered its highest temperature ever recorded, reaching 50.5 degrees Celsius (122.9 degrees Fahrenheit) in the southeastern town of Silopi. This new record comes as a severe heatwave grips the eastern Mediterranean, with temperatures up to 12 degrees Celsius above seasonal averages. The extreme heat, combined with strong winds, has fueled dozens of devastating wildfires across the country, resulting in evacuations and multiple fatalities. Other nations in the region, including Greece and Cyprus, are also battling extreme heat and fires.</p>

          <p>A 42-year-old man allegedly stabbed eleven people with a folding knife at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, before being apprehended by shoppers and a sheriff's deputy. The Grand Traverse Sheriff's Office described the attack as a random act, with victims chosen without pre-determination near the checkout area. Multiple victims are reported to be in serious or critical condition at a local medical center. Governor Gretchen Whitmer condemned the "brutal act of violence," and the FBI is providing support to the local investigation.</p>

          <p>The Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office has acknowledged the mistaken release of a violent offender, Khalil Bryan, due to a clerical error.

Sheriff Susan Hutson took full responsibility, promising an internal investigation and disciplinary action to prevent future occurrences. The incident has drawn sharp criticism from the District Attorney, highlighting systemic issues and public safety risks at the facility.</p>

Red Sox ace Garrett Crochet, a Cy Young candidate, effectively shut down the Dodgers' offense, striking out ten and stranding multiple runners despite giving up two early solo home runs to Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández. The Dodgers' comeback efforts were hampered by missed opportunities and baserunning errors, culminating in a frustrating loss.

          <p>NASA has confirmed that nearly 4,000 employees, representing about 20% of its workforce, have chosen to leave the agency through a deferred resignation program initiated by the Trump administration. This reduction is part of a broader plan to shrink the federal workforce and implement cuts recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency. The departures come amid proposed budget cuts, although recent legislation has allocated additional long-term funding for key missions. The significant workforce reduction has raised concerns among scientists and space organizations about its potential impact on NASA's future capabilities.</p>

          <p>A new BBC documentary series investigates the Jesus Army, a disgraced evangelical group in the UK formally known as the Jesus Fellowship, which disbanded five years ago following revelations of widespread abuse. The investigation, which began in 2016, uncovered hundreds of cases of trauma, including the sexual abuse of children and a subsequent cover-up by senior leadership. The documentary's director, Ellena Wood, interviewed over 80 survivors to explore the lasting psychological damage inflicted by the cult. The Jesus Fellowship Trust has since apologized and a redress scheme has provided compensation to hundreds of victims.</p>

While he will miss time, there is relief that the injury is not career-threatening, and he hopes to return in 10 to 14 days, initially as a designated hitter.

          <p>As England fans face the nerve-wracking Euro 2025 final, this article explores the science behind the intense physical and emotional reactions to watching sports. Psychologists explain that high-stakes matches trigger a stress response, releasing hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, which cause increased heart rate and other physical symptoms. This "fight or flight" response is a sign of deep emotional investment in the team. Experts advise fans to manage the stress by getting rest, eating well, and engaging in physical movement to release pent-up energy, reframing the nervous feelings as part of an enjoyable, communal experience.</p>

          <h2>San Francisco Experiences Its Coldest Summer in Decades</h2>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the 60s. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather as a respite from extreme heat elsewhere, the pattern is unusual for this time of year. Forecasters warn that summer is not over, and hotter temperatures could still arrive in late August or September.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is being held out of training camp practices due to a back issue, with his status now being evaluated on a week-to-week basis. While coach Sean McVay publicly states he is not concerned, the situation is worrying for the team's Super Bowl aspirations, which heavily depend on a healthy Stafford. This is the second time in four years a back problem has sidelined the 37-year-old quarterback, who missed the end of the 2022 season with a spinal contusion. Until he returns to the field, uncertainty will surround the Rams' prospects for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>A new American Eagle campaign starring actress Sydney Sweeney has generated both backlash and support online.

Conversely, other fans praised the campaign, with some claiming it was "killing woke advertising." The controversy has nonetheless created significant buzz, boosting American Eagle's stock and marking a strategic shift for the brand, which is betting on Sweeney's star power to revive sales.</p>

Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing, and permissions for new businesses or outdoor areas could be fast-tracked. The government hopes these reforms will bring vibrancy back to town centers and support the struggling hospitality industry. The move follows several high-profile cases where beloved venues faced closure due to noise complaints from newly arrived neighbors.</p>

The opposition has blocked budgets and appointments, creating tension amid increased military pressure from Beijing.
