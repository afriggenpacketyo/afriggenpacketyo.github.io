          <p>Montanez Merriweather, a suspect in a widely publicized group assault in downtown Cincinnati, has been indicted on a federal charge of illegally possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. This new charge is separate from the state charges he faces, which include felonious assault and aggravated rioting, related to the July 26 beating that injured six people. One victim, a mother of three, suffered significant brain trauma from the attack. If convicted on the federal gun charge alone, Merriweather could face up to 15 years in prison.</p>

          <p>Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has dismissed any possibility of renewed dialogue with South Korea, stating Pyongyang has no intention of improving relations. She denied reports that North Korea had removed propaganda loudspeakers from the border and criticized upcoming joint military drills between the U.S. and South Korea as proof of their hostile intentions. Her statement serves as a firm rejection of recent hopes from South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, reinforcing North Korea's hardline stance against diplomatic engagement.</p>

          <p>A Menifee police officer, Juan Pesina, has been arrested on suspicion of committing multiple sexual assaults, some of which allegedly occurred while he was on duty. The investigation began after the Menifee Police Department received a complaint, which led to the discovery of other alleged incidents in 2023 and 2024. The Riverside County Sheriff’s Department is now leading an independent investigation and believes there may be more victims. Pesina faces serious charges, including sexual assault, sodomy, and forced oral copulation, prompting the Menifee Police Chief to address the potential impact on public trust.</p>

Lai, a British citizen and founder of the Apple Daily newspaper, faces a potential life sentence for allegedly colluding with foreign forces under a law imposed by Beijing. His case is seen by critics as a key indicator of eroding press freedom and judicial independence in Hong Kong. Supporters, including his son, have called for his release, highlighting his failing health and framing the trial as a crucial test for international relations.</p>

          <p>Former first lady Melania Trump has demanded a retraction from Hunter Biden for comments he made linking her to the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, threatening a lawsuit if he fails to comply. In a recent interview, Biden alleged that Epstein had introduced Melania to Donald Trump, a claim her lawyer has labeled as false, defamatory, and "extremely salacious." The letter states the remarks have caused significant financial and reputational harm. The Trumps have consistently maintained they were introduced at a New York Fashion Week party in 1998 by a modeling agent.</p>

          <p>National Guard troops and armored vehicles have appeared on the streets of Washington D.C. following President Donald Trump's decision to deploy them and assume control of the city's police force. Trump cited "out of control" violent crime as the reason, a claim disputed by D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and local crime statistics, which show a significant decrease in violent offenses. Mayor Bowser criticized the move as an "authoritarian push," while the White House reported dozens of arrests by federal agents in the operation's initial phase. The deployment includes 800 Guard troops and 500 federal agents.</p>

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has announced a $5.5 billion support package for exporters impacted by new U.S. tariffs of up to 50%. The plan includes credit lines and tax deferrals for affected businesses. President Trump justified the tariffs by citing the legal situation of his ally, former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, a reason Lula dismissed as non-existent. While criticizing the U.S. move, Lula stated he is not interested in a trade war and prefers to negotiate, emphasizing that Brazil's sovereignty is "untouchable" and will not be dictated by other nations.

          <p>A new survey reveals that the practice of "bleisure," or blending business and leisure travel, is becoming increasingly common, with 55% of business travelers admitting to having family or friends join them on work trips. The trend is even more prevalent among C-suite executives, at 73%. Proponents cite the benefits of maintaining work-life balance, saving money on personal travel, and reducing the loneliness of being on the road. While many companies quietly accept the practice, employees often navigate a "policy grey zone," carefully separating expenses to ensure the company incurs no additional costs.</p>

          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered the assets of Alex Jones's Infowars to be turned over to a court-appointed receiver, a major step toward paying the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to Sandy Hook families. The receiver now has the authority to seize and sell all company property, including the Infowars brand itself, with the process potentially beginning within days. This move shifts the case from federal bankruptcy court to state court, where attorneys for the families believe they have a better chance of a swift resolution. Jones decried the ruling on his show but may soon lose control of his platform.</p>

          <p>Small businesses, particularly coffee shops and specialty tea importers, are feeling the strain as U.S. tariffs contribute to rising commodity prices.

Business owners report that they are forced to raise consumer prices to protect their already slim margins. Since many of these products cannot be sourced domestically, companies are left with little choice but to absorb or pass on the increased costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large study from Sweden suggests that medication for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) can significantly reduce the risk of adverse life outcomes. Researchers found that for newly diagnosed individuals, starting drug treatment was linked to lower rates of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminal activity. The findings are based on data from nearly 150,000 people and provide evidence that the drugs' effects on impulsivity and concentration have tangible, long-term benefits. This research could help patients and doctors make more informed decisions about beginning medication for the disorder.</p>

          <p>The UK government's decision to proscribe the activist group Palestine Action (PAG) as a terrorist organization has sparked a significant legal and political battle. Over 700 people, many of them elderly, have been arrested for showing support for the banned group, raising questions about the proportionality of the ban and the state's response. The government justifies the ban by citing millions of pounds in criminal damage and alleged assaults by PAG activists. The situation is set to unfold across three key legal fronts: the prosecution of supporters, the trials of activists for pre-ban offenses, and a High Court challenge to the legality of the ban itself.</p>

The restrictions, which include a hefty C$25,000 fine for violators, have been called "draconian" by a civil liberties group. However, provincial officials defend the move as necessary, pointing out that the region is a "tinder box" and that human activity causes nearly all wildfires.

The lawsuit alleges that EWS knew its network was highly susceptible to fraud due to features like a quick registration process and lack of verification, but failed to enforce meaningful anti-fraud rules.

This has led to difficult cases where doctors must decide on eligibility for patients with treatable conditions who refuse care.
