          <p>Nomura Holdings, a Japanese investment bank, is set to acquire Macquarie's U.S. and European public asset management businesses for $1.8 billion in an all-cash deal expected to close by the end of the year, pending regulatory approvals. This acquisition aligns with Nomura's strategic focus on global asset management, aiming to increase its investment management division's assets under management from $590 billion to $770 billion. Macquarie will retain its Australian public investments business and collaborate with Nomura on product distribution, including Nomura acting as a U.S. wealth distribution partner for Macquarie's alternative investment capabilities. The impact on Nomura's financials is projected to be minimal, with both companies operating independently until the deal's completion.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has proposed a budget to address a nearly $1 billion financial gap, which includes eliminating over 2,700 city positions, with approximately 1,650 layoffs. While the budget aims to maintain core services like libraries and recreation centers, many agencies face deep spending reductions, particularly the LAPD, which could see over 400 civilian workers laid off, reducing the number of police officers to the lowest level since 1995. The budget allocates funding for new hires at the fire department, to address the aftermath of the Palisades fire, and also proposes merging smaller agencies into a single entity, while city officials are lobbying for state financial aid to mitigate the job cuts. Union leaders have vowed to fight against the layoffs, emphasizing the need to maintain essential city services.</p>

          <p>Joey Aguilar, who initially joined UCLA, is now transferring to Tennessee following Nico Iamaleava's move to UCLA, which stemmed from a reported disagreement with Tennessee over NIL negotiations. Iamaleava reportedly sought a $4 million deal for the upcoming season but ultimately left for UCLA, leading Aguilar to seek a new opportunity. Aguilar, with one year of eligibility remaining, has a strong track record, throwing for 6,760 yards and 56 touchdowns in his last two seasons at Appalachian State. This quarterback "trade" highlights the growing influence of NIL deals in college football and the potential for player movement based on financial incentives.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Pope Francis, Los Angeles residents are reflecting on his legacy, particularly his commitment to social justice and support for the marginalized. Many remember him as a pope who connected with the Latino community and demonstrated a strong commitment to the poor and migrants. Theologians highlight his actions, such as organizing events for missing women and washing the feet of incarcerated individuals, as evidence of his dedication to social justice.

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, contesting its attempts to control academic decision-making by threatening to review $9 billion in federal funding. The lawsuit specifically aims to halt a freeze on $2.2 billion in grants after Harvard refused to comply with demands to appoint an outside overseer to ensure viewpoint diversity. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, argues that the government should not dictate what private universities teach or who they admit and hire, as the administration has sought to force changes at multiple Ivy League institutions following campus activism related to the war in Gaza. The White House maintains that taxpayer funds are a privilege that Harvard fails to meet the basic conditions to access.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the Palisades wildfire, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is proposing to add 227 positions to the Fire Department, despite other agencies facing potential layoffs due to a budget gap. The new positions include firefighters, EMTs, and mechanics, addressing concerns about under-resourcing that were raised after the wildfire destroyed nearly 7,000 structures and resulted in 12 fatalities. The budget also includes a new Homeless Fire Protection and Street Medicine Program to address the increasing number of fires connected to individuals experiencing homelessness. While some officials and residents view the proposal as a positive step, concerns remain about the department being understaffed and underfunded.</p>

          <p>Scientists from China and France have created a detailed map of the crab-eating macaque’s claustrum, a brain region thought to be involved in consciousness. The map details connections between nerve cells in the claustrum and other brain regions, potentially aiding understanding of cognitive functions like memory integration and abstract thinking. The research also revealed differences in the claustrum's structure and cell types between macaques and rodents, which could provide insights into the evolutionary mechanisms behind consciousness. The claustrum's role in various brain functions, such as sleep regulation, depression, and cognitive control, is being investigated to understand how consciousness is generated.</p>

          <p>An experiment has been launched into orbit to assess the feasibility of growing lab-grown food in space, aiming to reduce the high costs of feeding astronauts, which can reach up to £20,000 per day. The project, funded by the European Space Agency (ESA), involves growing protein, fat, and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats to create food in space. This initiative is seen as a crucial step toward establishing small-scale food production plants on the International Space Station and enabling long-term human presence on the Moon and Mars. The experiment involves sending a bioreactor with yeast concoction into orbit to test the process in weightlessness and high radiation environments, with the ultimate goal of using 3D printers to create customized meals for astronauts.</p>

Investors are increasingly concerned about the safety of U.S. assets, as the dollar index slid to its lowest level since 2022 and gold reached a record high.

          <p>Attorneys discovered thousands of documents related to sexual assault cases inside a defunct Santa Clarita detention camp that were never turned over to the victims' attorneys. The documents include grievances and a drawing allegedly signed by a probation deputy accused of sexual assault. The discovery was made during preparation for a looming trial related to the decades-old incidents. The county claims that the records they need to fight decades-old cases are long gone, but the attorneys argue the claim flies in the face of what his firm saw at Camp Scott.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging deceptive billing and cancellation practices related to its Uber One subscription service. The FTC accuses Uber of charging customers for the subscription without their consent and making it difficult for users to cancel, requiring them to navigate numerous screens and actions. Uber disputes these allegations, stating that cancellations can be done in-app in a matter of seconds and that it does not sign up or charge consumers without their consent. The lawsuit marks the FTC's first legal action against a major U.S. tech company since President Donald Trump took office for his second term.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that it unlawfully froze billions in federal funding in response to the university's rejection of the administration's demands to change policies and leadership. The lawsuit alleges that the Trump administration violated Harvard's constitutional rights by halting federal funding, claiming that the withholding of funds is part of its pressure campaign to force Harvard to submit to the Government's control over its academic programs. The Trump administration has also threatened to block the university from enrolling international students and called for broad leadership reforms and changes to admissions policies.</p>

Mark Carney's Liberals are promising to make Canada a global superpower in both conventional and green energy. The Conservatives under Pierre Poilievre want to invigorate the oil and gas sector and scrap the industrial carbon tax.
