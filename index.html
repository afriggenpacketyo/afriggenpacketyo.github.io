          <p>Shares of Tesla experienced a significant drop of approximately 7% after CEO Elon Musk announced his intention to create a new political entity called the "America Party." This move has renewed investor anxiety regarding Musk's political engagements, which have previously been a point of contention and perceived as a potential risk to the Tesla brand. Analysts express concern that this foray into politics is a distraction during a critical period for the company, which is already facing challenges like decreased vehicle deliveries and heightened competition.</p>

          <p>With interest rates remaining high, savers are contemplating whether to lock in current certificate of deposit (CD) yields with long-term or short-term accounts. Financial experts suggest that one-year CDs offer flexibility for those who might need funds soon, especially as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates within 18 months. Conversely, five-year CDs can provide guaranteed income security for individuals with longer-term goals, like retirement, who are concerned about future rate drops. The best choice ultimately depends on an individual's financial goals and liquidity needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Scottish paramedic, Stephen Doohan, has been sentenced to ten and a half years in prison for secretly administering an abortion-inducing drug to a woman he was in a relationship with, causing her to have a miscarriage. The court heard that Doohan, who was married at the time, committed the act after learning the woman was pregnant with his child. The judge described the crime as a calculated and manipulative act that caused the victim immense pain and lifelong loss. The article also notes that Doohan was featured in a BBC documentary and has since been dismissed from the Scottish Ambulance Service.</p>

          <p>In Peru, particularly in the impoverished outskirts of Lima, criminal gangs are increasingly targeting private schools for extortion, demanding large payments under the threat of violence. School administrators report receiving threats accompanied by images of weapons, and in one case, a bomb was planted at a school's entrance. This trend is part of a larger crime wave that has intensified since the pandemic, forcing some schools to switch to online classes or close down entirely. The problem is exacerbated by political instability and alleged police corruption, with gangs also targeting small businesses and even soup kitchens.</p>

          <p>South Korean prosecutors have reportedly found evidence that impeached former President Yoon Suk Yeol ordered military drones to be sent over Pyongyang in an attempt to provoke a military response from North Korea. Analysts believe the alleged plan was to use any retaliation as a pretext to declare a national emergency and impose martial law, which he later did in December before being impeached. The incursion, a violation of the Korean War armistice, risked escalating into a devastating conflict but failed to elicit the desired military reaction from Pyongyang.

          <p>The U.S. has recorded over 1,277 measles cases this year, the highest number since 1992, with the virus continuing to spread as summer activities begin. This resurgence of a nearly eradicated disease, which has already caused three deaths, is attributed to declining childhood vaccination rates. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging summer camps to verify the vaccination status of attendees to prevent further outbreaks. This public health crisis is unfolding amid a more relaxed approach to vaccination from the Trump administration, increasing the importance of individual protective measures.</p>

President Trump has recently intensified these demands, threatening tariffs on iPhones made outside the U.S. and specifically discouraging production in India.

Apple argues that the EU's mandate on how it should run its store creates confusing terms for developers and a poor experience for users.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has issued a warning that any country aligning with the BRICS alliance on policies deemed contrary to American interests will face an additional 10% tariff. This statement escalates the administration's hardline stance on global trade and its criticism of the BRICS bloc, which includes rivals China and Russia. The threat comes as the U.S. continues trade negotiations with various nations, with a new deadline of August 1 for new tariff rates to be implemented if deals are not reached. The move signals a potential new front in global trade disputes.</p>

          <h2>Texas Floods Spark Scrutiny Over Emergency Alert Systems and Weather Service Capabilities</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the aftermath of the deadly flash floods in central Texas, questions are being raised about the adequacy of emergency warnings and potential systemic failures. Local officials in Kerr County, the hardest-hit area, have stated they lack a sophisticated warning system and were caught off guard by the flood's intensity. An analysis revealed that while the National Weather Service did issue increasingly urgent alerts, no local emergency alerts were sent to cellphones. This has drawn attention to concerns about NWS staffing levels and budget cuts, and whether they impacted the ability to effectively coordinate with local authorities.</p>

          <p>The umpire at the center of a significant electronic line-calling error at Wimbledon, Nico Helwerth, was not scheduled for matches the following day. During a fourth-round match, an operator error caused the ball-tracking system to deactivate for a crucial point, which Helwerth opted to replay instead of making an overrule. While the All England Club stated the umpire followed protocol and was simply on a routine rest day, the incident has fueled debate over the role of chair umpires and their authority in an era of automated line-calling technology.</p>

The firm has raised its total addressable market estimates for AI compute and networking, expecting Nvidia to capture a large share of this growth.

Apologies that seem rehearsed, lack emotion, or fail to take ownership can erode trust and damage morale. Ultimately, audiences want to hear from a human leader who demonstrates vulnerability and a commitment to fixing the problem, not just a brand delivering a scripted statement.</p>

          <p>Despite its reluctance to embrace traditional wide theatrical releases, Netflix consistently attracts elite directors like Martin Scorsese, Greta Gerwig, and Rian Johnson. The streaming giant accomplishes this by offering a powerful combination of lucrative contracts, significant creative freedom, and access to a global audience of over 300 million subscribers. For many filmmakers, Netflix has become a haven for projects that are too expensive or artistically risky for conventional studios. By prioritizing subscriber content over box-office returns, Netflix has created an appealing alternative model for some of Hollywood's biggest talents.</p>
