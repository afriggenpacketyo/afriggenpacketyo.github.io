          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 16:06:59 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump has stated that Attorney General Pam Bondi has the authority to release any information regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case that she deems credible. This statement comes as the administration faces pressure from supporters for more transparency, following a Justice Department and FBI review which concluded that no "client list" existed and found no evidence to contradict Epstein's death by suicide. The article details the political pressure and internal disagreements within the administration over the handling of the files, with some allies and lawmakers also calling for the public release of all related documents. The situation highlights a growing rift between Trump and segments of his base.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced its intention to restart shipments of its MI308 artificial intelligence chips to China, pending license approvals from the U.S. Commerce Department. This development, which caused AMD's stock to climb over 6%, follows a period of heightened trade tensions and export controls aimed at curbing China's access to advanced technology. The move is part of a broader industry push, with competitor Nvidia also planning to resume sales of its specialized chips to the Chinese market. Chipmakers have previously reported significant revenue impacts due to the U.S. restrictions on AI hardware exports. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A package of cryptocurrency-related bills, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation, failed to pass a key procedural vote in the House of Representatives, despite being backed by President Trump. Thirteen Republicans joined Democrats in blocking the motion, creating a significant setback for the crypto industry's push for regulatory clarity. The legislative failure led to a downturn in crypto-linked stocks, with companies like Circle and Coinbase seeing their shares fall. The article notes that some Republican defectors, such as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, opposed the bill for not including a ban on a central bank digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Determining the optimal age to buy an annuity depends heavily on individual financial goals, health, and risk tolerance, rather than a universal rule. While purchasing later in life, such as in one's 70s, typically yields higher monthly payouts due to shorter life expectancy calculations, it isn't always the best strategy. Financial advisors often suggest the 60-70 age range as a balanced window to secure significant income while mitigating market risks. The article explains that different types of annuities, like deferred or immediate, have different ideal purchase timelines, emphasizing the need for a personalized approach to retirement planning.

          <p>Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee are formally demanding that Chairman Jim Jordan summon top Justice Department and FBI officials for a public hearing regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. The letter calls for testimony from Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel to address the department's conclusion that Epstein's death was a suicide and that no client list exists. Democrats argue a public hearing is necessary to restore trust and scrutinize the administration's handling of the matter, which has caused a rift between President Trump and some of his supporters who were promised further revelations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has launched an investigation into the University of Michigan's foreign funding disclosures and research security protocols. The probe was triggered by two recent federal cases in which Chinese scientists linked to the university were charged with smuggling biological materials into the country. The department cited these "highly disturbing criminal charges" as raising concerns about the university's vulnerability to national security threats from China. This investigation is part of a broader federal effort to increase transparency around foreign gifts to U.S. universities and scrutinize research ties with Chinese institutions.</p>

          <p>For the first time, the UK government has released data detailing the immigration status of individuals receiving Universal Credit, a key social benefit. The figures from June show that of the nearly eight million claimants, 83.6% were British and Irish nationals, while over a million were born overseas. This overseas group includes approximately 700,000 EU citizens with the right to live and work in the UK, as well as smaller percentages of refugees and individuals on safe routes from countries like Ukraine. The publication of these statistics follows pressure from some politicians and has ignited political debate about welfare system controls.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defended the administration's decision to allow Nvidia to resume selling its H20 AI chip to China, stating the technology is not the company's best. Lutnick explained that the U.S. wants Chinese companies to remain dependent on the American "tech stack" by selling them chips that are a step behind the most advanced versions available to U.S. firms. He characterized the H20 as Nvidia's "fourth best" chip, slower than its top-tier products. This policy reversal is seen as a major win for Nvidia, which had previously warned of significant revenue loss from the export restrictions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An ancient Roman mosaic depicting an erotic scene, which was stolen from Pompeii by a Nazi German captain during World War II, has been returned to the archaeological park. The artwork, dating to the first century, was repatriated from Germany after the heirs of its last owner contacted Italian authorities to arrange its return. The mosaic, which likely decorated a bedroom, is considered a work of extraordinary cultural interest and provides insight into the theme of domestic love in the Roman era. Officials hailed the return as healing a historical wound and a positive change in mentality regarding the possession of stolen art.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated a rise in U.S. inflation, with prices increasing 2.7% on an annual basis in June, the highest level since February. On a monthly basis, the index rose 0.3%, driven by increases in energy, food, and housing costs. The data suggests that new tariffs may be starting to contribute to upward price pressures in categories like apparel and home furnishings. While underlying core inflation remained relatively muted, the overall increase makes it highly unlikely that the Federal Reserve will consider an interest rate cut at its upcoming July meeting.
