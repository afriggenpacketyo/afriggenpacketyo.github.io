          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 17:08:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The CEO of MercadoLibre, Marcos Galperin, believes the U.S.-China trade war presents a significant opportunity for Latin American countries, especially Mexico, if they leverage the situation effectively. He noted that many American companies have already shifted manufacturing from China to Mexico to avoid tariffs, and Mexico has a free trade agreement with the U.S. Galperin emphasized that Latin America could benefit from the volatility if it plays its cards well, as MercadoLibre's shares have surged while Amazon's have declined due to tariff exposure. Galperin is Argentina's richest person with an $8.7 billion fortune.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. is considering a $5,000 "baby bonus" to combat a record-low birth rate, a trend that could lead to long-term economic problems. While President Trump expressed support for the idea, its implementation remains uncertain. Other countries, like Australia and Hungary, have tried similar financial incentives with limited success, highlighting the need to address underlying economic issues such as affordable childcare and paid parental leave. Experts suggest shifting priorities and changing views on parenting are also contributing factors to the declining birth rate.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar is on track for its worst performance during the first 100 days of a presidency since the Nixon era, having lost about 9% of its value since President Trump's return to office. Trump's tariff policies have led investors to seek assets outside the U.S., weakening the dollar. UBS Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG have cut their dollar forecasts, citing concerns over the U.S.-China trade standoff and the Federal Reserve's independence. (not investment advice)</p>
