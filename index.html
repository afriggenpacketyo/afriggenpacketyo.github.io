          <p>Charles Li Xiaojia, the former CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX), is seeking to list his investment company, Micro Connect International Finance Company, on the exchange. The company, established in May, has applied to list under Chapter 21, a rule designed for investment firms to raise funds from institutional investors. Li, who stepped down as CEO of HKEX in 2021, aims to use the proceeds to invest in start-ups and companies with cash flow, providing returns to shareholders. The listing application underscores the strong momentum for initial public offerings (IPOs) in Hong Kong, with 43 new applications received this month, bringing the total number of hopefuls to 200.

A hurricane warning is in effect from Acapulco to Puerto Angel. Erick is expected to produce 8 to 12 inches of rain, with maximum totals of 16 inches in Oaxaca and Guerrero, potentially leading to life-threatening flooding and mudslides, especially in areas of steep terrain.</p>

The ministry is currently confirming how many of the approximately 280 Japanese nationals in Iran and 1,000 in Israel wish to leave. The Japanese government is also planning to evacuate around 90 nationals and their family members from Tehran to neighboring Azerbaijan by bus and offering those in Israel the option of evacuation to Jordan.</p>

          <p>Women are sharing their experiences of having their medical symptoms dismissed or downplayed by healthcare professionals, often attributed to being "normal" for women or related to anxiety or weight. Many recount instances where serious conditions, such as heart problems, Lyme disease, kidney stones, and even a brain tumor, were initially misdiagnosed or ignored. These experiences highlight a pattern of gender bias in healthcare, where women's health concerns are sometimes not taken as seriously as men's, leading to delayed diagnoses and potentially harmful outcomes. The anecdotes underscore the importance of advocating for oneself and seeking second opinions when medical concerns are dismissed.</p>

The farm, which has been in operation for over a century, had to cull its 100,000-bird flock in January. Owner Doug Corwin is working to preserve the unique lineage of fowl that has allowed the farm to thrive, even as others in the region have closed.

Xie stated that China is willing to buy more from America, but the U.S. has imposed strict restrictions on exports of competitive products like semiconductors.

          <p>President Donald Trump, during the installation of new flagpoles at the White House, asked the construction workers about their immigration status. The remarks, made in jest, came after a reporter questioned him about his administration's deportation efforts. Trump inquired, "Any illegal immigrants?" The workers shook their heads, and Trump added, "If there were, we'll find out." Trump's comments coincide with his administration's efforts to oversee the largest mass deportation program in history, targeting major cities with large undocumented populations.</p>

          <p>Israeli President Isaac Herzog stated that Israel's attack on Iran was aimed at eliminating its nuclear capabilities, not pursuing regime change. He accused Tehran of "cheating" and "rushing to the bomb," emphasizing that a change in regime could bring peace to the region. Herzog's comments follow a series of airstrikes by Israel against Iran, targeting locations allegedly related to the country's nuclear program. The Group of Seven countries expressed support for Israel, while China condemned Israel's violation of Iran's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to legally reduce import duties by altering product materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit into lower-tariff categories. Customs lawyers and supply chain experts note this practice, which predates Trump, has become more prevalent as tariffs increase. Examples include manufacturers bundling steel and aluminum elements, hoodie makers switching to cotton, and footwear companies adding fuzzy-felt fabric to soles. However, companies must avoid fraudulent misrepresentation, as demonstrated by Ford's case involving the misclassification of cargo vans. (not investment advice)</p>
