          <p>Raul Celis Lopez, a Peruvian journalist known for reporting on corruption and gang violence in Iquitos, was murdered by hitmen while traveling to work. The 70-year-old radio host had been reporting from the Peruvian Amazon for over three decades and had regularly discussed sensitive topics on his current affairs program. Reporters Without Borders condemned the killing as a "tragic wake-up call," highlighting the lack of protection for journalists reporting on social, political, and environmental issues in the Amazon. This is the second such murder this year, following the killing of a regional TV channel owner in January.</p>

          <p>Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins testified that the USDA is actively recruiting to fill key positions after offering over 15,000 employees deferred resignations with salaries and benefits paid through September. Rollins stated that the department loses 8,000 to 10,000 employees annually through attrition, but Senator Patty Murray questioned the efficiency of letting experienced employees go only to seek replacements. Rollins invited some former employees to return and denied that key positions were accepted in the second round of the deferred resignation program, despite conflicting accounts from APHIS employees.</p>

          <p>A coalition of blue states, led by California, Colorado, and Washington, is suing the Trump administration for halting the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program. The lawsuit argues that the FHWA's actions are unlawful and impede states' efforts to build EV charging infrastructure, combat climate change, and support green economies. The states are seeking a court order to reinstate the program and prevent the administration from withholding funds. The lawsuit coincides with criticism of Tesla and acts of vandalism against its vehicles, linked to protests against Elon Musk.</p>

          <p>Economists are struggling to detect the impact of President Trump's trade wars in mainstream economic data, leading them to examine alternative sources like earnings calls and private-sector data. Evidence of the impact includes declining spending at McDonald's, fewer container ships at the Port of Los Angeles, and companies shifting production out of China. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring these indicators as it considers monetary policy amidst trade policy uncertainty. The current situation is reminiscent of the early days of the coronavirus pandemic when economists sought alternative measures to gauge economic damage.</p>

          <p>Following the implementation of tariffs, cargo volume at the Port of Los Angeles has decreased by 35% compared to the previous year, leading to reduced work for longshore workers and impacting businesses throughout Southern California. The decline affects trucking, shipping, and distribution centers, with potential consequences for manufacturers, retailers, and consumers nationwide. Port officials anticipate shortages and price increases as stockpiled inventory runs out, raising concerns about the long-term economic impact of the tariffs.</p>
