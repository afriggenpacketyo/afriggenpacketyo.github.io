          <p>Rod Stewart, the 80-year-old rock star, has cancelled several US concerts due to the flu, ahead of his performance at the Glastonbury festival later this month. Stewart announced the cancellation of four dates and the rescheduling of two others on Instagram, expressing his apologies to his fans. He is scheduled to play the legends slot on Sunday, June 29, marking his first appearance at the festival in 23 years. Stewart previously indicated his intention to scale back large-scale world tours by the end of 2025, opting for more intimate venues instead, and expressed his excitement about performing at Glastonbury with former Faces bandmate Ronnie Wood.</p>

          <p>This article addresses and disproves several false claims made by Donald Trump and amplified on social media regarding wind energy. These claims include the assertions that wind turbines are killing whales and birds, are not truly green due to recycling issues, and are inefficient. The article cites data from the National Marine Fisheries Service and the US Fish & Wildlife Service to counter these claims, noting that there is no scientific evidence linking wind turbines to whale deaths and that cats and building collisions are far greater threats to birds. It also addresses the issue of turbine blade recycling, highlighting ongoing efforts to improve recycling rates and implement landfill bans. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is taking a more aggressive stance against antisemitism, launching investigations and penalizing universities. Harmeet Dhillon, DOJ's assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, emphasized that violent rhetoric and actions targeting Jewish students and institutions are not protected by the First Amendment. Recent incidents, including attacks on pro-Israel demonstrations and assaults on Jewish individuals, have prompted increased scrutiny and enforcement. The administration is also focusing on non-citizen students accused of supporting Palestinian causes in ways deemed hostile to U.S. interests, while civil rights groups caution against overreach that could infringe on free speech and protest rights.</p>

          <p>This article details the timeline of Kilmar Abrego Garcia's mistaken deportation to a mega-prison in El Salvador in March 2025, despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution. The Trump administration claimed Abrego Garcia was a member of MS-13, which his family denies. After court battles and a Supreme Court ruling, Abrego Garcia was eventually indicted for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants and brought back to the U.S. to face charges. The timeline covers events from the deportation to his return, including court hearings, legal arguments, and political interventions.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the potential challenges and security considerations involved in converting a luxury jet from Qatar into Air Force One for President Trump's use. While Trump wants the jet ready quickly, installing security capabilities equivalent to the current Air Force One could be costly and time-consuming, potentially requiring some security precautions to be skipped. Key requirements for Air Force One include survivability, secure communications, and anti-missile measures. The article explores the potential costs, timeline, and security trade-offs involved in the conversion process, as well as the possibility of Trump waiving certain requirements.</p>

          <p>This article explores the concept of time limits on federal rental aid, focusing on a program in Delaware that imposes a seven-year limit on rental assistance. The Delaware program also requires recipients to work and provides financial coaching and savings incentives. While the Trump administration proposed a two-year time limit nationally, housing experts argue that such limits are unrealistic and ineffective without additional support. The article contrasts Delaware's approach with a failed program in Washington state, highlighting the importance of savings accounts and comprehensive support services in helping people achieve self-sufficiency.</p>

          <p>China's Gen Z is reshaping the liquor industry by favoring low-alcohol, fruit-flavored beverages over traditional baijiu, a strong distilled spirit. This shift is prompting Chinese liquor brands to innovate and target younger consumers, particularly urban women. In Baisha, a town famous for baijiu production, farmers are increasingly growing green plums for lighter wines instead of sorghum grain used in baijiu. Industry insiders believe this trend reflects a broader shift towards self-indulgent experiences and emotional companionship rather than social rituals associated with traditional alcohol consumption.</p>

It argues that this behavior undermines public faith in government and damages the reputation of the United States. The editorial contrasts this with old-fashioned corruption, noting a lack of direct bribes but highlighting a pattern of self-enrichment through policy changes.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the upcoming military parade in Washington, D.C., scheduled for the Armyâ€™s birthday, addressing criticisms that it is a self-aggrandizing display by President Trump. The author argues that a military parade could be a patriotic celebration and an opportunity to counter misperceptions about the armed forces. With military recruitment facing challenges and most Americans having little exposure to service members, the parade could help bring Americans closer to the military and boost recruitment efforts.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's order to investigate Joe Biden's cognitive decline, arguing that it is a step in Trump's takeover of the Department of Justice and an attempt to expand presidential immunity. The author contends that the investigation, while seemingly targeting Biden's aides, could set a precedent for shielding the president's subordinates from prosecution. The article suggests that this move could further enable lawlessness and undermine the rule of law.</p>

The government expects the shift away from traditional letters to save the health service Â£200 million over the next three years, with a Â£50 million investment in the app. Patients without access to the app will receive text messages and letters as a last resort, and NHS phone lines will be freed up. The initiative aims to improve patient access to healthcare management and informed decision-making.</p>
