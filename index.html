          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 16:10:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hollywood's film and TV production has largely relocated from Los Angeles to other US states and international hubs, primarily due to lucrative tax incentives and lower labor costs. This exodus has been exacerbated by rising production expenses post-pandemic and labor strikes, alongside the shifting economics of the streaming era. President Trump's proposal for a 100% tariff on foreign-made films aims to reverse this trend, though industry experts express skepticism about its feasibility, potential for global retaliation, and overall effectiveness in revitalizing domestic production. The core challenge remains creating a more competitive financial structure within the US to attract and retain large-scale film projects.</p>

          <p>Charlie Javice, the founder of the financial aid startup Frank, received a sentence of just over seven years in prison for defrauding JPMorgan Chase. A jury found Javice guilty of misrepresenting Frank's customer numbers, inflating them from under 300,000 to over five million, which led to JPMorgan acquiring the company for $175 million in 2021. The judge noted the bank's "stupidity" in its due diligence but underscored the necessity of punishing Javice's greed-driven actions. This article details a high-profile case of startup fraud and its legal consequences for a prominent tech executive.</p>

          <p>A potential government shutdown highlights deep divisions within the Democratic Party, particularly regarding Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's leadership and his relationship with progressives. While Republicans frame the shutdown as "Schumer's Shutdown," Democrats are attempting to pivot the narrative to focus on the high cost of healthcare, pushing for renewed Affordable Care Act subsidies. This article explores the political maneuvering, with Republicans hoping to exploit Schumer's perceived vulnerability to the left and Democrats aiming to connect the shutdown to tangible issues like healthcare costs ahead of the 2026 midterms. The outcome will significantly impact the party's future strategy.</p>

          <p>Historically, government shutdowns have had marginal economic impact, but the upcoming one could differ significantly due to President Trump's threat of permanent federal employee layoffs. This potential departure from past practice introduces substantial uncertainty into an already unstable labor market, especially affecting the Washington D.C. area. A prolonged shutdown could also delay the release of vital economic data, such as the monthly jobs report and consumer price index, potentially complicating the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. This article emphasizes the unique risks of this shutdown, including its potential to cause more severe and lasting economic disruption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, the earning potential for Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts is on a downward trend, yet savers can accrue significant interest on a $20,000 deposit. For example, a 1-year CD at 4.20% could yield $840, and a 5-year CD at 3.85% could earn over $4,000 upon maturity. This article advises savers to consider acting promptly to secure current rates, as additional Fed cuts are expected, potentially leading banks to further reduce their CD offers. The overall value of a CD depends on individual financial objectives and comfort with locking funds away. (not investment advice)</p>

The article explains that stress, inherently a social experience, triggers oxytocin release to foster connection.

          <p>Lesotho's Famo music, a traditional pastoral accordion genre, has regrettably transformed from its origins among shepherds into a catalyst for deadly gang violence. What began as a means of emotional expression now sees Famo artists engaging in lyrical "rap battles" that frequently escalate into real-world conflicts, resulting in numerous fatalities and prompting a government crackdown. This article contrasts the genre's violent present with the legacy of pioneer Puseletso Seema, "the Queen of Famo," who lives in poverty. The violence, compared to 1990s hip-hop rivalries, has also permeated the nation's political sphere.</p>

This initiative, from the Departments of Interior, Energy, and EPA, seeks to support an industry that has seen its US electricity contribution fall from 50% in 2000 to 15% in 2024. Critics, like the Natural Resources Defense Council, label this a "colossal waste" of taxpayer money, arguing it funnels funds to an outdated, polluting energy source while clean energy grows.
