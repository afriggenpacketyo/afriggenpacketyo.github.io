          <p>Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse held a press conference on Capitol Hill, urging the release of Justice Department files related to his case. They directly countered President Trump's claims that the issue is a "hoax," with some inviting him to meet them in person to understand their trauma. The event highlighted a bipartisan push by Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna to compel the release of the documents, though they face opposition from House leadership and the White House. The survivors emphasized the need for transparency to understand how Epstein was protected for so long.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo announced plans to eliminate all childhood vaccine mandates in the state. Dr. Ladapo controversially compared the mandates to "slavery" and an infringement on parental rights, stating his department would work with the legislature to repeal them. The move, which would make Florida the first state to take such a broad step, drew immediate criticism from opponents who warned of a potential "public health disaster." DeSantis also established a "Make America Healthy Again" commission to focus on medical freedom and parental rights.</p>

          <p>UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner has admitted to underpaying stamp duty tax on a flat she purchased, attributing the error to incorrect legal advice. The issue relates to the sale of her stake in a family home, which involved a complex trust established for her disabled son. Rayner has now contacted tax authorities to settle the amount owed and has referred herself for an investigation by the Prime Minister's standards adviser. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has publicly supported her, while the opposition has called for her dismissal from her roles.</p>

          <p>The average monthly Social Security benefit for retired workers is projected to be $1,976 in 2025, though actual payments can vary significantly based on earnings history and claiming age. While the maximum possible benefit can reach $5,108 for high earners who delay until age 70, many retirees receive amounts closer to $1,000. The article highlights that these benefits alone are often insufficient for a comfortable retirement, suggesting strategies like annuities, reverse mortgages, and part-time work to supplement income. Annual cost-of-living adjustments help benefits keep pace with inflation, but proactive financial planning is crucial. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newsmax has filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against Fox News, accusing the media giant of unlawfully monopolizing the market for right-leaning cable news. The lawsuit alleges that Fox News uses anticompetitive tactics, such as coercing cable distributors into not carrying or marginalizing competing channels like Newsmax. According to the complaint, Fox imposes financial penalties and contractual barriers on distributors who work with its rivals. Newsmax is seeking a permanent injunction against these practices and triple the amount of damages it claims to have sustained as a result of these actions.</p>

This success underscores the continued dominance of live sports, particularly the NFL, in attracting significant advertising investment for both traditional broadcast and streaming platforms. The high demand has reportedly pushed the price for a 30-second Super Bowl commercial to as much as $8 million.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of House members has introduced new legislation aimed at banning lawmakers, their spouses, and dependent children from trading individual stocks. The bill would require current members to sell all individual stocks within 180 days and new members to do so before being sworn in, with a 10% fine for non-compliance. This renewed effort seeks to address long-standing concerns about potential conflicts of interest and insider trading, gaining momentum with support from House Speaker Mike Johnson, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and President Trump.

Paul expressed concern that government ownership in the private sector is a mistake and diminishes the free market principles within the Republican Party. The move is part of a broader trend of increased government intervention in key industries under President Trump, which has included stakes in other tech and materials companies. The Intel investment had found unlikely support from Senator Bernie Sanders, who argued taxpayers should get something in return for corporate aid. (not investment advice)</p>

Experienced FEMA leaders are leaving federal service due to uncertainty and policy changes, taking their expertise to companies that states will likely hire to fill the void left by the federal government. While the administration aims to shift more disaster responsibility to the states, critics worry this will lead to inefficiencies, a lack of standardized protocols, and potential for fraud.

          <p>Germany's parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces, Henning Otte, has called for the reintroduction of mandatory national service for both men and women. His proposal suggests a year of service that could be fulfilled not only in the military but also in emergency services, cultural institutions, or other volunteer work. This recommendation comes as the German government debates a draft law that currently only proposes voluntary service, with a compulsory questionnaire for young men. Otte argued that the security situation has changed significantly since mandatory service was abolished in 2011, and that the military urgently needs more recruits, particularly women.</p>

          <p>Speaking in Beijing, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that Russia will achieve its objectives in Ukraine through military means if a diplomatic agreement is not reached. While praising President Trump's efforts to find a solution, Putin has continued to refuse a direct meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He reiterated Russia's demands, including that Ukraine not join NATO and that Russia will not relinquish control of the Donbas region. Putin's comments underscore the ongoing impasse, as he rejects calls for a ceasefire while his forces intensify attacks on Ukrainian cities.</p>

          <p>For savers considering a $50,000 certificate of deposit (CD), the "best" rate depends on their financial goals, as higher rates do not always yield the highest returns. Currently, short-term CDs of three to six months offer the highest interest rates, around 4.25% to 4.45%, but their shorter duration limits total earnings. In contrast, longer-term CDs, such as a two-year option, may have a slightly lower rate of around 4.10% but can generate significantly more interest over time due to compounding. Savers must decide whether their priority is securing the highest possible rate or maximizing their overall interest earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

McIver, who has pleaded not guilty, claims the Trump administration has weaponized the Department of Justice against her for conducting congressional oversight. The resolution argues her continued presence on the committee represents a significant conflict of interest given the charges against her.</p>

Wise, a former FBI agent, was charged with multiple felonies for his role in the Capitol riot, where he was recorded urging others to kill police officers. His case was dismissed following President Trump's sweeping pardons for those involved in the insurrection.

The author describes witnessing classmates use AI to generate annotations for classic literature and solve math problems, leading to a culture of shortcuts that devalues learning and discipline. This reliance on technology, the student contends, has removed academic urgency and fostered a focus on grades over genuine understanding. The article calls for schools to adopt assessment methods that are less susceptible to AI, such as oral exams and personalized projects, to restore integrity and critical thinking.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is appealing a federal judge's ruling that found the deployment of National Guard troops for law enforcement activities in Los Angeles to be illegal. The judge had determined that the action violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which generally prohibits the use of military forces for domestic law enforcement. The ruling had barred the remaining troops in Los Angeles from making arrests or conducting crowd control and applied to similar deployments elsewhere in California. This legal challenge comes as President Trump considers deploying the National Guard to other U.S. cities to address what he has described as rampant crime.</p>

According to the complaint, the Army knew Card was delusional and had created a "hit list" but did not enforce recommendations to remove his weapons or ensure he received follow-up care.
