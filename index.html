        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sanae Takaichi has been elected as Japan's first female prime minister by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, a historic milestone for the nation. A self-declared admirer of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Takaichi is known for her ultraconservative and hard-line political stances, including a hawkish approach toward China and support for constitutional revision. Her economic platform aligns with the fiscal and monetary stimulus policies of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. While her election is a significant moment for female representation, analysts suggest her rise was driven more by her conservative ideology than by her gender, as she opposes same-sex marriage and separate surnames for married couples.</p>

          <p>Leading U.S. defense and aerospace companies, including GE Aerospace, Northrop Grumman, RTX, and Lockheed Martin, have raised their financial forecasts for 2025. This upward revision is attributed to significantly stronger demand for their products and services, despite broader economic uncertainties and the impact of tariffs. The companies reported beating third-quarter profit estimates, citing increased defense deliveries and a substantial backlog of orders valued in the hundreds of billions. The positive outlooks signal robust health in the defense sector, with executives highlighting unprecedented demand from both domestic and international customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Foreign Office has added eight countries, including Japan, Mexico, and Russia, to its travel advisory list concerning the risk of methanol poisoning from tainted alcoholic drinks. This update follows several incidents involving British nationals, including fatalities, and expands the warning that already covered nations like Thailand and Turkey. Methanol, a toxic industrial chemical, is sometimes illicitly added to counterfeit alcoholic beverages by unregulated producers to cut costs. The government has launched a new campaign urging travelers to purchase sealed drinks from licensed venues and be aware of symptoms like blurry vision and confusion, which require immediate medical attention.</p>

          <p>Pizza Hut's UK restaurant operator has entered administration, leading to the closure of 68 restaurants and 11 delivery locations across the country and making 1,210 employees redundant. The closures affect major cities such as Brighton, Leeds, and Edinburgh. Administrators cited challenging trading conditions, increased costs, and tax-related obligations as reasons for the financial pressure on the operating company, DC London Pie Limited. Global brand owner Yum! Brands has stepped in to acquire the remaining 64 restaurants, saving 1,276 jobs, and will continue to operate its 343 Pizza Hut delivery outlets in the UK.</p>

This biosecurity threat comes as the U.S. cattle herd is at its lowest level since 1951, compounded by ongoing drought conditions. Ranchers argue that President Trump's recent suggestion to import beef from Argentina is not a viable solution and could introduce other diseases like foot-and-mouth, further jeopardizing the domestic supply chain. Industry groups are urging the government to focus on eradicating the screwworm threat rather than intervening in markets, which they believe will self-regulate.</p>

          <p>An Associated Press investigation has uncovered a wave of over 420 anti-science bills introduced in U.S. state legislatures this year, targeting public health protections related to vaccines, water fluoridation, and milk safety. This organized effort is reportedly pushed by groups with close ties to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his Make America Healthy Again agenda. While proponents claim to be promoting natural food and informed choice, public health experts warn that this movement normalizes dangerous ideas, contributing to falling vaccination rates and the resurgence of preventable diseases like measles. More than two dozen of these bills have already been enacted into law.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has unveiled a plan to boost business growth by cutting red tape and scrapping "needless form filling" for companies. The proposed reforms, which she claims will save firms nearly £6 billion annually, include simplifying the company merger process and removing lengthy reporting requirements for over 100,000 small businesses. The announcement comes ahead of next month's Budget, as the government aims to make the UK a more attractive destination for global investment. However, business groups like the Federation of Small Businesses remain cautious, stating that the true test will be whether the government avoids raising taxes for employers.</p>

While the movie is celebrated for tackling issues of racism, gender norms, and cultural identity, the normalization of this inappropriate relationship is jarring in the modern context of women's soccer, which has seen numerous real-life scandals involving such power dynamics. The article suggests that if a sequel were made today, it would need to address this element, reflecting the current understanding of grooming and abuse of power in sports.</p>

The victim, Shannon Keeler, pursued charges for years after prosecutors were initially reluctant to take up the case, which was revived after she shared the incriminating message with police.

The 2003 deal with the Crown Estate shows he made large lump-sum payments totaling around £8 million for renovations and to effectively buy out his future rent obligations for the 75-year lease. This arrangement means he only ever paid a token annual rent, which may not even be required.

          <p>Despite ambitious claims from tech CEOs that AI will soon write the vast majority of code, many software engineers remain skeptical about its current productivity benefits. While AI tools are useful for simple, repetitive tasks and creating quick prototypes, developers report they often generate messy, unworkable code for complex projects, sometimes creating more work. Engineers express that their job is primarily about high-level problem-solving, a skill AI cannot replicate, and that every line of AI-generated code still requires human review. This skepticism contrasts with the top-down pressure in some companies to adopt AI, fostering a sense that there is little room for disagreement.</p>
