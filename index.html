          <p>Despite Meta Platforms' stock being stuck in a range recently, analysts at Citi have placed a 90-day positive catalyst watch on the company. This optimism is based on signs of growth in Meta's core advertising business and estimates that it is gaining a larger share of ad budgets. While concerns exist about competition from OpenAI's video generation tool, Sora, the firm sees potential for the stock to move higher, setting a price target of $915. The broader tech market saw gains, partly fueled by a new partnership between OpenAI and Broadcom. (not investment advice)</p>

In an interview, the actors emphasized that the movie is designed to provoke conversation and debate about its blurred moral lines and ambiguous truths.

          <p>The University of Chicago's Turning Point USA chapter is calling for repercussions against Associate Professor Eman Abdelhadi following her arrest at an anti-ICE rally. Abdelhadi was charged with felony aggravated battery to a government employee and misdemeanor obstruction. The student group's president, Tyler Shasteen, stated that the professor's history of "inflammatory and anti-American rhetoric" undermines campus safety. The university has condemned violence but has not commented on potential disciplinary action against Abdelhadi, who has previously made strong statements against both ICE and her employer.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview with the BBC, King Abdullah II of Jordan warned that the Middle East is "doomed" without a viable peace process that leads to the creation of an independent Palestinian state. Speaking ahead of a peace summit in Egypt, the king emphasized that a two-state solution is the only path to lasting stability in the region. He expressed hope that the current U.S.-brokered ceasefire could provide a political horizon for progress but conveyed deep mistrust of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. King Abdullah stressed the urgency of the moment, stating that peace is the only option to avoid perpetual conflict.</p>

          <p>In a high-interest-rate environment, several persistent myths about credit card debt can negatively impact personal finances. Contrary to popular belief, carrying a balance does not improve your credit score; it only costs you money in interest. Another harmful misconception is that making only the minimum payment is an effective debt management strategy, when in reality it can take decades to pay off the principal. The article also debunks the idea that closing old credit cards is beneficial, explaining that it can actually harm your credit score by increasing your utilization ratio and shortening your credit history.

While acknowledging the fragility of the situation, the piece posits that the end of the war could create space for a new political reality to emerge.

          <h2>Economists Revise U.S. Growth Forecast Upward but Anticipate Weaker Job Gains</h2>

          <p>A new survey from the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) indicates that economists now expect faster U.S. economic growth through 2025, raising the GDP forecast from 1.3% to 1.8%. This improved outlook persists despite challenges from tariffs and inflation. However, the forecast for the labor market is less robust, with predictions of weaker job gains for the remainder of the year and an unemployment rate rising to 4.5% in 2026. The economists also anticipate the Federal Reserve will continue to lower interest rates, which could further support economic activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees as part of a ceasefire deal has been met with emotional scenes of both celebration and confusion. In the West Bank, families joyfully reunited with loved ones, some of whom had been imprisoned for decades and appeared gaunt and in poor health. However, the joy was marred by sorrow for some families who discovered at the last minute that their relatives were being deported to Gaza instead of returning home. The release followed Israel's prohibition on celebrations and warnings against showing support for militant groups.</p>

          <h2>Analyzing the Monthly Cost of a $300,000 Home Equity Line of Credit</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the monthly payments for a $300,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) in the current interest rate environment. With average HELOC rates now at 7.84% following a recent Federal Reserve rate cut, a 10-year loan would cost approximately $3,615 per month, while a 15-year term would be around $2,839. These costs are notably lower than they were a year ago when rates were higher. The article explains that since HELOCs have variable rates, borrowers can automatically benefit from future rate cuts without needing to refinance. (not investment advice)</p>
