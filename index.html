          <p>Rabbi Daniel Walker provided a harrowing account of the deadly terror attack at his Manchester synagogue, describing the moment he and others held the doors shut to prevent the attacker from entering. He praised the quick-thinking and heroism of congregants who ran to help others instead of fleeing the scene. Two men, Adrian Daulby and Melvin Cravitz, were killed in the attack, which involved a car ramming and stabbings. Rabbi Walker expressed his commitment to offering comfort to the grieving families and fostering resilience within the community in the face of such hate.</p>

          <p>During the sentencing for Sean 'Diddy' Combs, prosecutors argued for a harsh sentence, emphasizing what they described as his "staggering" and "life-altering" violence against his ex-girlfriends. The defense countered by claiming Combs lacked a financial profit motive, comparing his actions to those of a client of prostitutes rather than a pimp. The presiding judge stated he does not believe Combs has taken full responsibility for his actions or demonstrated remorse for the crimes. The judge also indicated he would consider conduct for which Combs was acquitted as relevant context when determining the final sentence.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has set a Sunday evening deadline for Hamas to accept a U.S.-backed peace plan aimed at ending the conflict in Gaza. The proposal includes an immediate cessation of fighting and the release of 20 living Israeli hostages within 72 hours in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans. Trump warned on social media that if the agreement is not reached, "all HELL" will break out against the group. Mediators are pressing Hamas for a response, but key figures within the group have indicated they are likely to reject the terms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is primarily caused by a dispute over extending the enhanced premium tax credits for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. These subsidies, which help 22 million Americans afford their coverage, are set to expire at the end of 2025. Democrats are making their extension a condition for any government funding deal, while Republicans resist. Experts warn that if the credits lapse, insurance premiums could more than double for many, potentially causing four million people to lose their health coverage due to affordability issues.</p>

          <p>Internal government data shows that nearly 40% of the 3,550 arrests made during the Trump administration's recent federal law enforcement surge in Washington, D.C., were for civil immigration violations. While the operation was publicly framed as an effort to combat violent crime, a significant portion of the actions were administrative arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The operation has also led to the seizure of illegal guns and arrests for narcotics and homicide. A similar law enforcement surge is now underway in Memphis, Tennessee.</p>

          <p>Members of the Jewish community in Manchester have described themselves as "shocked but not surprised" following the deadly terror attack outside a synagogue during Yom Kippur. Residents expressed a growing sense of fear amid rising antisemitism, with some comparing the current climate to pre-1930s Germany. The attack has left the community feeling vulnerable, though many also highlighted the strength of local interfaith relationships and solidarity. The incident has intensified concerns about safety and the future for Jewish families in the area, prompting calls for government action against antisemitism.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Why U.S. Government Shutdowns Are a Uniquely American Political Phenomenon</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis of why government shutdowns are a recurring issue in the United States but are virtually nonexistent in other Western democracies like the United Kingdom. The key differences lie in four main areas: the U.S. Congress has significantly more power over the budget process than parliaments, passing a budget requires navigating more complex voting thresholds, and there are no immediate job-threatening stakes for U.S. lawmakers who fail to approve funding. Furthermore, a 1980 legal ruling in the U.S. makes it illegal for federal agencies to operate without congressionally approved funding, unlike in the U.K.</p>

          <p>Following pressure from the Trump administration, Apple has removed IceBlock, an app that used crowdsourcing to alert users to the presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The app's developer stated they believe the removal was a direct result of government pressure, calling the app's content "objectionable." Apple confirmed the removal, citing safety risks based on information received from law enforcement. The action highlights the ongoing tension between tech companies, user privacy, and government demands, especially as similar features exist in popular navigation apps like Waze.</p>

Police, who treated it as a terror incident, arrived within minutes and shot the suspect dead. Tragically, Greater Manchester Police later confirmed that one of the deceased victims was inadvertently struck by police gunfire during the response.</p>

Despite Johnson's physical commitment to the role, the movie is described as a "stiff karaoke" performance that fails to explore the deeper complexities of Kerr's life, addiction, and relationships, ultimately questioning the film's reason for existing.</p>

          <p>The United States experienced record sales of all-electric vehicles this year, with Tesla and General Motors leading the market as sales topped one million units in the first nine months. A significant surge occurred in the third quarter, achieving a 10.5% market share, as consumers rushed to make purchases before federal incentives of up to $7,500 per vehicle expired at the end of September. Industry analysts now predict a sharp decline in EV sales, anticipating a boom-and-bust cycle now that the popular consumer credits have ended. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pediatricians across the U.S. are facing increasing financial and professional hardship due to the Trump administration's anti-vaccine rhetoric and policy shifts. Providing immunizations is already a low-margin, high-cost endeavor for many practices, and now inconsistent federal recommendations and rising vaccine hesitancy are creating unpredictable demand and greater financial risk. This pressure is discouraging providers from stocking certain vaccines and may exacerbate the existing nationwide shortage of pediatricians, potentially compromising children's health care. The article highlights the significant challenges these policies pose to a critical medical field.</p>

This move is a significant step in OnePay's strategy to become an American "super app" for digital finance, similar to overseas offerings like WeChat. It reflects the growing mainstream adoption of crypto and positions OnePay to compete with other major financial apps that already offer these services.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth delivered a highly partisan speech to hundreds of top U.S. military commanders, raising concerns about the politicization of the armed forces. The address included anti-DEI rhetoric and threats to deploy the military to police major American cities, which Trump described as a "war from within." While the meeting did not result in an immediate purge of generals as some had feared, it was widely viewed as using senior military leaders as a backdrop for a political rally, blurring the lines between military service and partisan politics.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk used his social media platform, X, to urge his followers to cancel their Netflix subscriptions, citing a "transgender woke agenda." His posts were in response to conservative backlash against the animated series "Dead End: Paranormal Park," which features a transgender main character and was canceled in 2023. The controversy was further fueled by claims that the show's creator had mocked the murder of a conservative activist. Despite the high-profile call for a boycott, financial analysts believe it is unlikely to have a significant or lasting impact on Netflix's massive subscriber base.</p>

The song's narrator acknowledges the pain of fame but concludes, "I wouldn't have it any other way," a departure from the often-conflicted portrayals of celebrity in pop music. The article suggests Swift is no longer hiding her drive to succeed behind a relatable persona but is instead integrating it into her identity. This self-assuredness is presented as a powerful statement, particularly in a cultural moment marked by anti-feminist backlash.</p>
