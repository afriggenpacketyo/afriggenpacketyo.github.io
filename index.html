          <p>The United States and China have initiated high-level discussions in Geneva aimed at de-escalating trade tensions, marking the first in-person engagement between the world's two largest economies since President Trump imposed substantial tariffs on imports earlier in the year. Key figures such as U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are participating in these negotiations. These talks signal a potential move towards resolving the ongoing trade disputes that have significantly impacted global markets and economic relations. The Kyodo News article provides a concise overview of this development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times article analyzes how President Trump‚Äôs policies, particularly his reluctance to continue U.S. support for Ukraine, are straining European allies. As the U.S. reduces its commitment, European nations are struggling to increase their military assistance to Ukraine due to their own rearmament needs and limited industrial capacity. This situation forces Ukraine to seek alternative financial arrangements, such as offering future revenue from natural resources to the U.S., in exchange for continued arms shipments. The article highlights the challenges Europe faces in filling the gap left by diminishing American support.</p>

          <p>A recently introduced bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), aims to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances, potentially allowing for more clinical studies on medical cannabis. Representatives Dina Titus and Ilhan Omar introduced the EBDPA which would allow research to catch up with the US‚Äôs increasing cannabis consumption. The Biden administration's efforts to reschedule cannabis have stalled, and this bill seeks to repeal provisions that restrict federal funding for research on Schedule I drugs, prioritizing evidence over ideology. Experts have mixed opinions on the bill's likelihood of passage, but it is viewed as a neutral step towards informed cannabis policy.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how President Trump's administration has revolutionized White House communications through the use of crass language, shock-value tactics, and social media memes. Trump's team is actively bypassing traditional media outlets and directly engaging the MAGA base through platforms and personalities that nurture a parallel information ecosystem. This approach has allowed the president to dominate the ‚Äúattention economy‚Äù and reshape narratives around key policy issues. Critics warn that this method sacrifices decency and respect for the office, replacing it with propaganda and outrageousness.</p>

Mazzone advocates for a return to prioritizing movement, change of speeds, and location, as well as for pitchers to work through fatigue rather than relying solely on brute strength.</p>
