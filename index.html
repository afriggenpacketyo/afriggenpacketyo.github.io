          <p>The House Oversight Committee initiated a closed-door investigation into President Biden's mental acuity, with Neera Tanden, former White House Domestic Policy Council Director, as the first witness.

Tanden's testimony marked the beginning of a series of interviews with former Biden aides, including additional interviews planned with Anthony Bernal, Ashley Williams and Annie Tomasini.

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) argued that the War Powers Act, limiting presidential authority in initiating war, is unconstitutional.  He cited President Trump's recent strikes on Iranian nuclear targets as an example of actions within the president's constitutional powers as Commander-in-Chief.  Johnson's stance opposes a resolution introduced by Rep. Thomas Massie and Rep. Ro Khanna to bar military action in Iran, which could be brought to a vote despite Johnson's opposition.
