          <p>Leaders from Britain, France, Germany, and Poland visited Kyiv to propose a 30-day unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine, coordinated with the Trump administration, which would impose further sanctions if Russia does not comply. The European leaders emphasized the need to strengthen Ukraine's military to ensure lasting peace, suggesting increased arms supply and investment in Ukraine's defense sector. Kremlin spokesman Dmitri S. Peskov dismissed the threat of new sanctions, stating Russia is accustomed to such pressure, while insisting Western nations cease military aid to Ukraine for any ceasefire to be considered. The European leaders also paid tribute to fallen Ukrainian soldiers, highlighting Europe's commitment to resolving the conflict amid shifting geopolitical dynamics.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era space probe, Kosmos 482, originally intended for Venus, reentered Earth's atmosphere and crashed into the Indian Ocean after being stranded in Earth's orbit for 53 years due to a launch vehicle malfunction. The probe, part of the Venera program, was designed to deliver a lander to study Venus's surface and atmosphere. Space agencies had been tracking the probe's descent due to concerns about potential dangers upon reentry, given its sturdy construction designed to withstand Venus's harsh environment. Roscosmos confirmed the spacecraft no longer exists after its fiery reentry.</p>
