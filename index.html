          <p>Florida's Governor Ron DeSantis and Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo have announced plans to end all childhood vaccine mandates for school attendance, a first in the nation. Dr. Ladapo controversially compared the mandates to "slavery," arguing they infringe on parental rights. The initiative is part of a broader "Make America Healthy Again" commission aimed at promoting medical freedom. This move has drawn sharp criticism from public health advocates and political opponents, who warn it could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases.</p>

          <p>Senator Rand Paul has condemned the Trump administration's $8.9 billion investment for a 10% stake in chipmaker Intel, labeling the move "a step towards socialism." Paul argued against government intervention in the free market, expressing concern that the Republican party is diminishing its free-market principles. The investment is one of several instances of the administration taking direct stakes in private companies, a policy that has found unusual support from figures like Senator Bernie Sanders.

          <p>Federal officials have intercepted a massive shipment of precursor chemicals used to manufacture methamphetamine, which originated from China and was destined for Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel. The seizure involved 1,300 barrels containing chemicals capable of producing over 420,000 pounds of methamphetamine, with an estimated street value exceeding $569 million. This operation highlights a strategy focused on disrupting the drug supply chain at its source rather than targeting the finished product.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage encountered sharp criticism from Democratic lawmakers during a US congressional hearing on censorship and free speech. While invited by Republicans to testify against the UK's Online Safety Act, Democrats like Rep. Jamie Raskin labeled him a "Putin-loving free speech impostor" and a "Trump sycophant." They questioned his commitment to free speech by pointing to instances of Reform UK banning critical journalists from its events.</p>

          <p>Angela Rayner, the UK's Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary, has admitted she underpaid stamp duty tax on an £800,000 flat she purchased. Rayner stated the error was due to incorrect legal advice regarding a complex family trust established for her disabled son. Despite receiving public support from Prime Minister Keir Starmer, she is facing calls for her dismissal from Conservative opponents and has referred herself for an investigation.</p>
