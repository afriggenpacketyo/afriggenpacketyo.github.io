          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has appointed eight new members to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a crucial government panel advising the CDC, after dismissing the previous 17 members.

Kennedy defends his choices as highly credentialed scientists committed to evidence-based medicine, while critics like Dr. Paul Offit express concerns about the expertise and potential anti-vaccine bias of the new committee.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the government cannot deport or detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on foreign policy reasons cited by the Trump administration. The preliminary injunction, issued by a New Jersey judge, prevents the government from deporting Khalil for reasons related to Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination. The judge found that Khalil's career and reputation are being damaged and his speech is being chilled, resulting in irreparable harm. The ruling does not prevent the administration from pursuing deportation based on other alleged issues with his green card application.</p>

          <p>The UK has reached an agreement with the European Union regarding Gibraltar's status post-Brexit, aiming to avoid checks on people and goods crossing the Gibraltar-Spain border. Passport checks at Gibraltar airport will be conducted by both Gibraltar and Spanish officials, ensuring travelers can enter Spain and the EU without further checks. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated the deal protects British sovereignty and supports Gibraltar's economy, while Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer agreed it strengthens UK-Spain relations. All parties have committed to finalizing a UK-EU treaty text on Gibraltar as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p>Crude oil futures rose more than 4% due to heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran, with President Trump expressing doubts about reaching a nuclear deal. Brent crude futures increased by $2.90 to close at $69.77 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude gained $3.17 to settle at $68.15. The U.S. is preparing a partial evacuation of its embassy in Iraq, and the U.S. military authorized the voluntary departure of troops' dependents from the Middle East. Trump stated he is less confident that a deal with Iran can be reached, while Iran's defense minister warned that U.S. bases in the region are within reach of the Islamic Republic's military.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's declaration that the trade war with China is "done" and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's statement that tariffs on Chinese goods will remain at 55%, logistics and retail executives warn that the damage to the supply chain, consumers, and the economy will persist. The 55% tariff is considered too high for U.S. importers to resume full orders, potentially impacting consumer goods companies. While Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested extending tariff pauses for countries negotiating in good faith, the uncertainty continues to weigh on EU exports and consumer demand. The trucking industry, in particular, faces challenges due to reduced domestic manufacturing and produce season headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

The images, released by the European Space Agency, offer new insights into the sun's behavior and magnetic field as it approaches the most active phase of its solar cycle. Scientists discovered that magnetic fields with both north and south polarity are present at the south pole, a phenomenon expected to last only briefly during the solar maximum. The Solar Orbiter's path will continue to tilt, providing even more direct views of the sun's south pole in the coming years.</p>

          <p>U.S. Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. has appointed eight new members to the CDC's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) after dismissing all 17 previous members. Four of the new members have prior experience on committees associated with the CDC or FDA. Kennedy stated that the new members are committed to evidence-based medicine and will demand definitive safety and efficacy data before making vaccine recommendations. The move has drawn concern and suspicion from physician groups, with the American Medical Association calling for a Senate investigation.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and President Donald Trump are defending the mobilization of National Guardsmen and Marines to Los Angeles in response to protests. Hegseth testified before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, while Trump celebrated the Army's 250th birthday at Fort Bragg. Trump vowed to use military force to suppress what he called "anarchy" and stated he would "liberate" Los Angeles. Democrats have objected to the domestic deployment of the military.</p>
