            <h2>Fake Banking Apps Used in In-Person Scams Lead to Loss of Faith</h2>

            <p>A man in the UK lost Â£1,000 worth of tools after being scammed using a fake banking app that mimics legitimate platforms, allowing fraudsters to show a 'successful payment' message without actually transferring funds.  Victims like Anthony Rudd and John Reddock share similar stories of being defrauded in person, leading to significant financial and emotional distress.  Experts warn of the increasing sophistication of scams and urge caution when accepting bank transfers, emphasizing the need for tech companies to address fraud on online platforms and individuals to verify payments in their accounts before handing over goods.  The in-person nature of the scam is particularly alarming, exploiting the trust people place in face-to-face interactions.</p>

            <p>China is shifting its retaliatory tactics against the U.S. by targeting the American services sector and implementing non-tariff measures after deeming further tariff increases a "meaningless numbers game."  These measures include tightening export controls on rare-earth minerals, initiating antitrust probes into U.S. companies, and restricting Chinese airlines from taking deliveries of Boeing jets.  This escalation signals a broader decoupling of the two economies, creating challenges for American businesses operating in or trading with China.  The move highlights China's willingness to leverage various levers to inflict economic pain on the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>During the first televised debate of Canada's election campaign, party leaders clashed over how to respond to U.S. President Donald Trump and his trade policies.  The leaders discussed strategies for navigating the trade war with the US, with the opposition Conservatives accusing the governing Liberals of weakening Canada's position.  Liberal leader Mark Carney touted his experience as a former central banker, while NDP leader Jagmeet Singh criticized both Poilievre and Carney for their economic policies. The debate highlighted the significant impact of US-Canada relations on the Canadian election.</p>

            <p>An island-wide blackout struck Puerto Rico, disrupting preparations for the Easter weekend for the predominantly Catholic population.  The outage, affecting all 1.4 million customers, was caused by a transmission line issue in the southern part of the island.  Luma Energy estimates that restoring power will take at least 48-72 hours, prompting widespread frustration and calls for the government to address the chronic power issues plaguing the island.</p>

Contracts for lifesaving peanut paste have been canceled, and shipments are stalled, leaving approximately 3 million children at risk of death.

            <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced new studies to investigate environmental factors contributing to rising autism rates, dismissing the idea that better diagnoses are the primary driver.  Kennedy stated his determination to find the "environmental exposures" behind the increase and directed the National Institute of Health to launch new studies into potential factors like mold and obesity.  Experts acknowledge that environmental factors could play a role but emphasize that the broadening definition of autism and genetic factors also contribute significantly to the increased diagnoses.  Autism Speaks also released a statement on Wednesday, calling Kennedy comments "extremely disappointing and damaging."</p>

            <p>Japan's export growth in March missed expectations, rising by a modest 3.9%, as trade tensions and tariffs begin to impact the economy.  While exports to the Middle East saw a significant increase, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, experienced a smaller rise.  The data comes as Japan is engaged in trade negotiations with the U.S., with concerns mounting over potential tariffs on key exports like automobiles and steel.  Analysts suggest that Japan's export competitiveness is being challenged by China-made goods, further exacerbating the impact of trade wars. (not investment advice)</p>
