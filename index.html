          <h2>Milwaukee Faces Lead Poisoning Crisis Amid Federal Health Department Restructuring</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 13:30:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Milwaukee is grappling with a lead poisoning crisis, forcing school closures and inspections after children tested positive for high lead levels. The city's old infrastructure, with many schools built before lead paint was banned in 1978, exacerbates the problem. Federal support from the CDC was initially available, but the Trump administration's restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services led to the layoff of the lead exposure team, leaving Milwaukee to navigate the crisis independently. The city has replaced thousands of lead water service lines but needs further funding to complete the project, highlighting the challenges local governments face when federal assistance is lacking. The situation exemplifies how federal changes can impact local responses to public health emergencies.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now leading the Department of Health and Human Services, has declared autism an "epidemic" and launched a federal project to investigate environmental causes. Kennedy argues that genetic research is a "dead end" and that a mysterious toxin introduced in the late 1980s is to blame for rising autism rates. However, many autism scientists disagree, asserting that the increase in autism rates is primarily due to broadening definitions, increased awareness, and better screening. They emphasize that genetics play a significant role, with hundreds of genes associated with autism, and fear that Kennedy's focus could divert resources from promising genetic research and therapies.</p>

          <p>Iran has condemned Austria after a report from Austria's intelligence agency stated that Tehran has developed an advanced nuclear weapons program capable of launching long-range missiles. The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson called the report "lies" and demanded an official explanation from the Austrian government. The Austrian report contradicts U.S. intelligence assessments, which claim Iran has not yet begun a weapons program but has taken steps to be able to produce a nuclear device if it chooses to do so. The report surfaces amid ongoing talks between Tehran and Washington regarding a possible nuclear deal, with the International Atomic Energy Agency also reporting that Iran has increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.</p>

          <p>The popular Mexican band Grupo Firme canceled a performance in California after the U.S. government suspended the musicians' visas. This action follows a series of moves by the Trump administration targeting Mexican artists who play music that glorifies cartel violence. Grupo Firme has recently distanced itself from this facet of the genre, announcing it would no longer sing such music in concerts. The U.S. Embassy in Mexico has stated that visa cases are confidential, and the suspension is the latest in a broader effort to combat the glorification of criminal groups in music.</p>

          <p>Crowds of civilians in Gaza have been rushing aid trucks, according to the World Food Programme (WFP), as hunger and desperation create chaotic scenes. The WFP reported that 77 trucks loaded with flour were stopped along the way, with food taken mainly by hungry people trying to feed their families. The UN says the amount of aid sent in the last week amounts to just over 10% of people's needs after an 11-week aid blockade was eased on May 19. A UN-backed assessment has indicated that Gaza's entire population is at "critical risk" of famine.</p>

          <p>Corporate buzzwords are prevalent in the workplace, but studies show that using jargon impedes trust. Gen Zers, who have grown up getting instant answers from Siri, may lean into buzzwords and cling to them like corporate life rafts. Research has shown that employees who feel like they're lower-status tend to use more jargon. The article suggests that buzzwords are really about people using poetry to distract from the fact that all they're doing is trying to make money, because that's all most buzzwords are — metaphors.</p>

The UK government spokesperson said they are engaging with the US on the implications of the latest tariff announcement to provide clarity to the industry. The US agreed to drop import taxes on UK steel as part of a trade deal with the UK, but the original 25% tariff has been kept in place while the details of the deal are worked out.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced volatility due to President Trump's comments on trade with China and tariff concerns. Nvidia was a standout performer after delivering better-than-expected earnings, while Salesforce faced scrutiny over its focus on AI. The Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge came in cooler than expected for April, but tariff levels could rekindle inflation. The Fed minutes showed that central bankers felt a "cautious approach" to monetary policy was appropriate as the economy could face "difficult tradeoffs" should inflation heat up.

          <p>Over 130 former state and federal judges are urging the government to drop its charges against Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan, calling her indictment an “egregious overreach” by the executive branch. Dugan was indicted for allegedly helping an undocumented migrant evade arrest at her courthouse, facing charges of obstructing a proceeding and concealing an individual. The former judges argue that Dugan is entitled to absolute immunity for her official acts and that the prosecution threatens judicial independence. The state supreme court has suspended Dugan from the bench pending the outcome of the case.</p>

The United Steelworkers union (USW) also criticized Trump's announcement and said it is a "direct attack on Canadian industries and workers."

The psychiatrist emphasizes that parenting doesn't have to be complicated and that it's okay to trust your instincts and do what feels right.

Horgan also talked about how she first turned to writing because she couldn't land any acting roles, hence deciding to write parts for herself.

Confiscating the funds would be a shock to Putin, hurt his pride and undermine support at home for the war.
