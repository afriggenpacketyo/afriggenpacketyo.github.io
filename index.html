        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two North Korean fishermen are stuck in South Korea after their boat drifted south of the maritime boundary, marking the longest period any reluctant defectors have been held. Despite repeatedly expressing their desire to return home, Pyongyang has refused to communicate with Seoul, a sign of displeasure with the South Korean government's hard-line policies. Experts suggest the men's repatriation is unlikely until relations improve, potentially after South Korea's upcoming presidential election. The fishermen's loyalty is questioned, as concern for their families back home may be influencing their public statements, considering the harsh treatment typically given to relatives of defectors. Optimism remains cautious, but some believe a change in South Korean leadership could thaw relations and allow the fishermen to return home.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas, revealing their origins in modern-day Russia between 20,000 and 30,000 years ago. By sequencing genomes of 1,537 individuals from 139 ethnic groups, researchers found that early settlers split into isolated groups, such as Amazonian, Andean, and Patagonian communities, adapting to diverse environments. The study corroborates archaeological evidence and identifies the closest living relatives of Indigenous North Americans as West Beringian groups. This research also highlights genetic traits that affect the health of modern South Americans, offering insights into their vulnerability to infectious diseases and the importance of tailored healthcare.</p>

          <p>Severe storms, including a possible tornado, swept through the Midwest, causing at least seven deaths and widespread damage. St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer confirmed five deaths in her city, with over 5,000 homes affected and 100,000 customers without power. The storms tore roofs off buildings, shattered windows, and downed trees and power lines, leading to traffic gridlock and a city-wide emergency declaration. A tornado struck Scott County, killing two more people and destroying homes, while other areas faced dust storms and threats of large hail. The storms were part of a larger weather system causing extreme conditions across multiple states, including a heat wave in Texas.</p>

The potential closures include Nissan's main Oppama plant and the Shonan plant, which together account for about 30 percent of Nissan's domestic production capacity.

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed by the US Secret Service after posting an Instagram photo that Trump supporters interpreted as a veiled threat against President Trump. The post, which showed seashells arranged to form "86 47," was seen by some as a call to harm the 47th president. Comey stated he was unaware of any violent connotation and removed the post, but Trump and administration officials rejected his explanation. The incident highlights the contentious relationship between Trump and Comey, who has been a vocal critic of the president.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of Venezuelan migrants accused of gang membership under a wartime law, citing concerns about due process. The ruling suggests skepticism among the justices regarding the migrants' protections and sends the case back to a lower court for further examination. This decision comes amid other news, including a transit strike in New Jersey, peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, and ongoing humanitarian concerns in Gaza.

          <p>A recording from a 2023 interview shows former President Joe Biden dismissing Special Counsel Robert Hur's report, which raised concerns about Biden's mental acuity. In the audio, Biden struggled to remember key dates, including his son Beau's death, and his speech was halting at times. Hur's report cited Biden as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory," leading to criticism from Republicans and Democrats alike. This incident adds to the scrutiny surrounding Biden's cognitive abilities and fitness for office.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm blanketed Chicago, causing near-zero visibility and halting flights at Midway International Airport. The National Weather Service issued a dust storm warning, only the second time ever for their Chicago office and the first including the city itself. High winds blowing over dry farmlands carried dust into the air, creating a dramatic scene reminiscent of "something out of the history books." While the storm cleared within 30 to 45 minutes, it caused significant disruptions and left residents in awe of the unusual phenomenon.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs's trial hinges on the testimony of his ex-girlfriend, Cassandra "Cassie" Ventura, who alleges years of abuse and coerced participation in drug-fueled sex encounters. Ventura's emotional testimony details a tumultuous relationship marked by violence and control, with prosecutors attempting to link her experiences to broader charges of sex trafficking and racketeering against Combs. While Combs's attorneys concede to domestic violence, they argue it does not equate to sex trafficking, setting the stage for a complex legal battle centered on consent versus compliance.</p>

          <p>Ammunition makers in Gorazde, Bosnia, fear for their survival due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on goods exported to the United States.
