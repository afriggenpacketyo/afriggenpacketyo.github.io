        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The threat of flash flooding is expected to return to the U.S. Southwest, particularly in southern California and Arizona, as more monsoonal moisture moves into the region. This follows recent deadly floods where a two-year-old child was swept away and later found deceased in Barstow, California. Meanwhile, in the Atlantic, Tropical Storm Gabrielle is continuing to strengthen and is projected to become the second hurricane of the season. While Gabrielle is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., it will generate dangerous surf and rip currents along the East Coast.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandezsantana, has been arrested in connection with a drive-by shooting that targeted the ABC10 television station building in Sacramento. Police reported that at least three rounds struck the building's exterior, hitting a window, though no injuries were reported among the staff. Hernandezsantana was charged with assault with a deadly weapon and shooting into an occupied building before being released on bail. The motive for the shooting is still under investigation, and the incident has been condemned by public officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom, as an attack on democracy.</p>

          <p>Mary "Maggie" Cleary has been named the new acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, an office currently investigating New York Attorney General Letitia James. Her appointment follows the abrupt resignation of her predecessor, Erik Siebert, who sources claim faced pressure from the Trump administration to prosecute James. President Trump publicly stated he fired Siebert for not pursuing the case, which stems from mortgage fraud allegations against James, who previously led a successful fraud lawsuit against Trump. Cleary, a conservative lawyer, takes over an office in tumult over alleged political interference from the White House.</p>

          <p>An armed man was arrested at State Farm Stadium in Arizona after exhibiting suspicious behavior ahead of a memorial service for the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The individual, identified as 42-year-old Joshua Runkles, was allegedly impersonating a law enforcement officer and was carrying a weapon in a prohibited area. The U.S. Secret Service, in coordination with local law enforcement, took Runkles into custody to investigate his intent and purpose for being at the stadium. He has since been booked on multiple charges and released on bond while the investigation continues.</p>

          <p>Police in The Hague, Netherlands, deployed tear gas and water cannons to disperse a violent anti-immigration protest where demonstrators clashed with security forces. The protest, organized by a right-wing activist, saw around 1,500 people block a major highway, with some throwing rocks and setting a police car on fire, leading to thirty arrests and two injured officers. Prime Minister Dick Schoof condemned the violence as "completely unacceptable," a sentiment echoed by right-wing leader Geert Wilders.

          <p>Jane Austen's classic 1815 novel "Emma" has been reimagined for the 21st century in a new stage adaptation by writer Ava Pickett, set in modern-day Essex. The play portrays protagonist Emma Woodhouse not as a Regency-era socialite but as a clever, meddling 21-year-old navigating the world of dating apps, pubs, and nightclubs after returning home from university. This contemporary version explores themes of friendship, social pressure, and self-discovery through the lens of modern technology and relationships. The production aims to highlight the timelessness of Austen's characters and their relatable human flaws, such as jealousy and the search for love.</p>

          <p>Giulia Baccosi, an Italian ship's cook, recounts her harrowing experience of being stranded at sea for 188 days after taking a last-minute job on a cargo schooner in early 2020. What was meant to be a three-month voyage turned into a prolonged ordeal as the COVID-19 pandemic led to global lockdowns, closing ports and borders worldwide. The crew of the Avontuur faced immense challenges, including rescuing migrants off the African coast, dwindling supplies, and the psychological strain of isolation. After navigating hurricanes and rationing food, the ship finally returned to Germany, a journey that profoundly changed Baccosi's perspective on life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of university students across the United Kingdom are forced to work extensive hours in part-time jobs because their government maintenance loans are insufficient to cover basic living costs like rent and food. Research indicates that the maximum loan covers only about half of what is needed for a minimum standard of living, leaving a significant shortfall. Students report working up to 30 hours a week, sometimes in late-night shifts that conflict with their studies, or choosing to commute long distances from home to save money. This financial pressure is causing students to miss out on academic and social opportunities central to the university experience.</p>

          <p>Creatine, a supplement widely known for enhancing muscle mass and athletic performance, is now being explored for its potential cognitive benefits, particularly for alleviating brain fog. While thousands of studies confirm its effects on physical strength, a growing but limited body of evidence suggests it may also improve short-term memory, mood, and focus. Some users, including perimenopausal women who often experience cognitive sluggishness, report positive effects, though experts caution that more research is needed. Scientists note that creatine could help the brain produce more energy, but its effectiveness may depend on individual factors like existing stress or dietary deficiencies.</p>

          <p>The UK government's decision to recognize a Palestinian state is a significant shift in foreign policy, driven by both domestic and international pressures. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's move comes after mounting calls from within his own Labour Party, where many MPs see it as a long-overdue promise, and in response to similar actions by other G7 nations like France. Critics, including the Conservative opposition and Israel's government, argue the recognition is a symbolic gesture that rewards terrorism without addressing key issues like the release of hostages. The decision also places the UK at odds with the United States, highlighting the complex political calculations behind the policy change.</p>

The move blindsided administration officials, who only later discovered that the list included career CIA officials and Democratic congressional staffers. This action has reportedly deepened tensions between Gabbard's office and the CIA, as top Trump advisers felt they were not given an opportunity to vet the list or the evidence used to justify the revocations. An intelligence official claims Gabbard was executing a direct order from the president to remove individuals involved in past Russia-related intelligence assessments.</p>

          <p>The UK's Royal Air Force has conducted its first air defense mission over Poland as part of a NATO response to recent Russian drone incursions into Polish airspace. RAF Typhoon jets were deployed to patrol the skies, signaling the alliance's commitment to defending its eastern flank against what the UK Defence Secretary called "reckless Russian aggression." The mission, dubbed Operation Eastern Sentry, was initiated after 19 Russian drones entered Poland's airspace on a single day, escalating tensions in the region. The action underscores NATO's collective security posture as members bordering Ukraine face repeated violations of their airspace.</p>

          <p>Russia has executed a massive overnight attack on Ukraine, launching over 600 drones and missiles against targets across the country. Ukrainian officials reported that the strikes targeted infrastructure, residential areas, and civilian enterprises, resulting in at least three deaths and dozens of injuries. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the assault as a deliberate strategy of terror, noting that a missile with cluster munitions struck an apartment building in Dnipro. While Russia's Ministry of Defense claimed all its military-industrial targets were hit, Ukraine's air force stated that its defense systems successfully intercepted most of the incoming projectiles.</p>

          <p>The White House has denied that it pressured ABC to suspend late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, despite Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr threatening to review the network's broadcast license. Kimmel's show was pulled indefinitely after he made a remark connecting the alleged killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to the MAGA movement. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the decision was made solely by ABC executives because Kimmel chose to lie to his audience. The suspension has drawn widespread criticism from free speech advocates and political figures, who accuse the administration of engaging in "cancel culture" and intimidating media companies.</p>

          <p>A man suspected of fatally shooting a woman and stealing her vehicle in Carlsbad, California, was killed in a subsequent shootout with police in Laguna Hills. The confrontation occurred outside an In-N-Out Burger, where the suspect exited the stolen SUV and opened fire on approaching officers. The incident began late Friday night when police found a woman with multiple gunshot wounds in an apartment complex parking lot. The stolen vehicle was later tracked by license plate readers, leading to a police pursuit that ended with the deadly exchange of gunfire early Saturday morning.</p>

          <p>An undercover FBI investigation into Tom Homan, the White House border czar, was reportedly shut down by the Trump-appointed Justice Department earlier this year. The probe allegedly recorded Homan accepting $50,000 in cash from agents posing as executives after he indicated he could help them secure government contracts in a second Trump administration. According to sources and documents, the investigation was launched in 2024 but stalled after the election and was officially closed recently. The White House and FBI dismissed the probe as a baseless, politically motivated effort from the previous administration, stating no credible evidence of wrongdoing was found.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party is making a concerted effort to reclaim patriotism, arguing that national symbols like the British flag have been co-opted by the far right. At the party's conference, former leader Tim Farron delivered a passionate speech, draping himself in a flag and urging members to stop being "squeamish" and to wave the country's flags with pride. This new strategy aims to counter the narrative of nationalist groups and position the Liberal Democrats as the party representing true British values of tolerance and unity. The move marks a notable shift for a party that has traditionally shied away from overt displays of national pride.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Attorneys for Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are asking a judge to prevent federal prosecutors from seeking the death penalty. They argue that public statements by Attorney General Pam Bondi and a highly publicized "perp walk" have unconstitutionally prejudiced the case against their client. The defense claims the decision to pursue capital punishment was political and has tainted the legal process, violating Mangione's right to a fair trial. This legal challenge comes shortly after Mangione's lawyers successfully had state-level terrorism charges against him dismissed, though murder charges remain in both state and federal courts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from Yellowstone National Park reveals that its large, free-roaming bison herds are acting as crucial ecosystem engineers, positively transforming the landscape. Contrary to concerns about overgrazing, the study found that the bison's grazing patterns supercharge the nitrogen cycle, creating grasslands with plants that are 150% more nutritious. This behavior helps maintain biodiversity, supports healthier soils, and benefits the entire food web, similar to the effects of wildebeest recovery in the Serengeti. These findings highlight the importance of restoring large animal migrations for strengthening ecosystem resilience and could inform broader conservation efforts across North America.</p>

          <p>A cyber-attack targeting Collins Aerospace, a major provider of aviation software, caused significant disruptions and flight delays at several major European airports, including Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack affected the company's electronic check-in and baggage drop systems, forcing airlines to revert to manual processing and leading to long queues and extended wait times for passengers. The company confirmed a "cyber-related disruption" and stated it was working to resolve the issue. The incident has highlighted the vulnerability of the interconnected and digitized aviation industry to technological failures and cyber threats.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is implementing new restrictions that will limit reporters' access and require them to agree not to publish unauthorized information to maintain their press credentials. According to a new memo, journalists must not disclose classified or "controlled unclassified information" without official approval, a rule that could curtail the use of unnamed sources. The directive also formalizes requirements for reporters to have official escorts in many parts of the building. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth defended the move as a necessary security measure, while the National Press Club condemned it as a "direct assault on independent journalism."</p>
