        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's former President Yoon Suk-yeol has been imprisoned again as prosecutors investigate allegations of insurrection. The charges stem from his declaration of martial law in December 2024, an act the country's Constitutional Court deemed a betrayal of public trust and a denial of democratic principles. A Seoul court approved a new detention warrant over concerns Yoon might destroy evidence related to the case. If convicted on the insurrection charges, the former president could face a life sentence.</p>

          <p>A large-scale overnight Russian drone attack on Kyiv has resulted in at least two deaths and thirteen injuries, according to Ukrainian officials. The attack caused fires across the capital, with drone wreckage striking a residential building in the central Shevchenkivskyi district and severely damaging a primary healthcare center in the Podilsky district. This assault follows another major aerial attack earlier in the week, and residents were urged to remain in shelters. Ukraine's military also issued a warning for a potential ballistic missile threat during the drone strikes.</p>

          <p>A large section of the iconic Sycamore Gap tree, which was illegally cut down in September 2023, has been installed as a permanent memorial. The trunk is now on public display at The Sill National Landscape Discovery Centre in Northumberland, near where the tree once stood. The installation, created by artist Charlie Whinney, allows visitors to touch and interact with the wood. It also features benches inscribed with words from thousands of public submissions expressing grief and hope, reflecting the tree's deep cultural significance.</p>

          <p>Detectives are investigating historical sexual abuse allegations against a convicted former bishop and another former vicar from the Church in Wales. The investigation follows a BBC report where four individuals detailed how their claims of abuse were ignored, prompting calls for an independent inquiry. One victim described being assaulted by former Bishop Anthony Pierce in the 1980s, years before Pierce was promoted. The Church in Wales has apologized for its failings and promised a review of its culture and safeguarding procedures.</p>

          <p>An investigation by Global Witness reveals that some of the world's poorest countries, including Somalia, Haiti, and Yemen, are paying millions to lobbying firms connected to Donald Trump. This spending aims to counteract the effects of significant U.S. cuts to foreign humanitarian assistance. The report shows that many of these nations have started bartering access to crucial natural resources, like minerals, in exchange for potential humanitarian or military support. Within six months of the last election, contracts worth $17 million were signed with Trump-linked firms.</p>

          <p>Sir Jake Berry, a former Conservative Party chairman and cabinet minister, has defected to Nigel Farage's Reform UK party. In a strong condemnation of his former party, Berry stated that both Labour and the Tories have done a poor job of running the country for the past two decades. His move follows other recent defections and is seen as a significant blow to the Conservatives, signaling Reform UK's growing momentum. The defection has prompted a strategic shift within the Labour government, which is now turning its political focus toward countering the rise of Reform.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 50% tariff on all copper imports, set to take effect on August 1, 2025. President Trump justified the move by citing a national security assessment, emphasizing copper's critical role in defense systems, semiconductors, and other key industries. The announcement caused a significant spike in copper prices, with experts noting the U.S. imports nearly half of its copper supply, primarily from Chile. This policy aims to bolster domestic production but could lead to supply shortages and price increases for consumers in the short term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to serve as the interim administrator of NASA. The move follows the president's withdrawal of his previous nominee, entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, just days before a scheduled Senate confirmation vote. Trump cited Isaacman's past political donations to Democrats and his professional relationship with Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX has major NASA contracts, as reasons for the change. Duffy will temporarily lead the space agency during a critical period as it works towards returning astronauts to the moon and future missions to Mars.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. tariff announcements targeting transshipment from Southeast Asia have created significant uncertainty for Chinese manufacturers who have moved operations to the region. Companies that relocated to countries like Vietnam or Malaysia to circumvent previous tariffs on Chinese goods now face a volatile and ambiguous U.S. policy. The lack of clear implementation details for the threatened tariffs is forcing many Chinese exporters to adopt a cautious, wait-and-see approach. This disruption directly impacts their strategies for navigating the ongoing trade war between Washington and Beijing, redrawing the lines of profitability for global supply chains.

          <p>The Trump administration announced it will resume sending defensive weapons to Ukraine, just days after confirming a temporary halt in some shipments. President Trump stated that Ukraine must be able to defend itself amid ongoing heavy attacks from Russia.

The brief pause was part of a broader review of weapons transfers, with the administration expressing concerns about U.S. military stockpile levels.</p>

          <p>President Trump's plan to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports could lead to higher prices for a wide range of consumer products, according to economists and industry experts. Copper is a critical component in electrical wiring, plumbing, appliances, electronics, and electric vehicles. A hefty tariff on the metal, of which the U.S. imports a significant portion, is expected to be passed on to consumers, potentially driving up costs for home repairs and new cars. While the administration argues the tariff will reshore manufacturing, analysts warn it could also trigger inflation and increase energy grid maintenance costs. (not investment advice)</p>

Bishop Alberto Rojas stated that the fear constitutes a "grave inconvenience" for the faithful, who are concerned about potential raids near churches. This decision comes after the Trump administration's intensified immigration sweeps in Southern California have detained thousands, causing significant disruption and anxiety within communities.

          <p>A new study reveals that life expectancy in California has not fully rebounded since the COVID-19 pandemic, remaining nearly a year lower in 2024 than in 2019. While the virus was the initial driver of the decline, drug overdoses and cardiovascular disease are now the primary factors holding back recovery. The study also highlights persistent disparities, with Black and Hispanic Californians experiencing a much slower rebound than white and Asian residents. Income-based gaps also remain stark, indicating that underlying health inequities continue to shape mortality trends in the state even as the pandemic's direct impact fades.</p>
