          <p>Canada has rescinded its planned digital services tax after the U.S. threatened to terminate trade discussions. The 3% levy would have applied to large tech companies like Amazon and Google, and its withdrawal is intended to facilitate negotiations for a new comprehensive economic deal. This move marks a significant reversal from Canada's previous stance and aims to de-escalate trade tensions between the two nations ahead of a July deadline for talks.</p>

          <p>Recent studies suggest that electric vehicles are more likely to induce motion sickness than traditional internal combustion engine cars. Researchers attribute this to the unique characteristics of EVs, such as rapid acceleration and the low-frequency deceleration caused by regenerative braking systems.

          <p>Police in Istanbul detained more than 50 people who attempted to participate in the city's annual LGBTQ+ Pride parade, which the government has banned for years. Despite a heavy police presence intended to prevent the gathering, activists carrying rainbow flags clashed with officers. The crackdown comes amid increasingly harsh rhetoric from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government, which has been accused by human rights groups of fostering a hostile environment for the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

          <p>Pride Month events around the world, from New York City to Budapest, have taken on a strong protest dimension this year amid a rise in political attacks on LGBTQ+ rights. While celebrating their identities, marchers also demonstrated against policies targeting transgender people in the U.S. and government crackdowns on public expression, such as the ban on Pride events in Hungary. The theme of "joy as resistance" was prominent as communities fought for visibility and inclusion.</p>
