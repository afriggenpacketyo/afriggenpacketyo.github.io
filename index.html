          <p>A double-decker bus struck a low bridge in Eccles, Salford, resulting in its roof being completely torn off. The incident injured fifteen people, with three sustaining serious injuries and one in critical condition. Emergency services, including an air ambulance, responded to the scene, and road closures were put in place. This is reportedly the second time a bus has crashed into this specific bridge in just over a year, raising concerns about recurring safety issues at the location.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has stated he will not support a deal for the Washington Commanders to build a new stadium in D.C. unless the team reverts to its former name. He also called for the Cleveland Guardians to change their name back, linking the changes to political and cultural issues. The Association on American Indian Affairs criticized Trump's remarks, stating the former name is an offensive caricature and his comments are a distraction. The team has previously stated it will not change its name from the Commanders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing body of evidence suggests that GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy may effectively treat symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. Patients in studies and anecdotal reports have experienced benefits such as regulated menstrual cycles, weight loss, and reduced testosterone levels. While promising, researchers emphasize the need for larger clinical trials to confirm these effects and address challenges like insurance coverage. The drugs appear to work by improving insulin sensitivity, which is often a core issue in PCOS.</p>

          <p>A detailed report outlines the long and complex relationship between Donald Trump and the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, which spanned from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. The two frequently socialized at parties, with Trump once calling Epstein a "terrific guy" in a 2002 interview. A recent Wall Street Journal report described a 2003 birthday book for Epstein containing a suggestive message from Trump, which Trump has since denied and sued over. While their friendship reportedly ended in 2004, the connection remains a subject of scrutiny, though no accusers have implicated Trump in criminal activity.</p>

          <p>Recent polls in the New York City mayoral race show that democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee, holds a lead but is not guaranteed a victory. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo, running as an independent, is polling competitively, with incumbent Mayor Eric Adams also running independently and Curtis Sliwa as the Republican nominee. President Trump has commented on the race, suggesting Cuomo has a strong chance against Mamdani. The presence of multiple high-profile independent candidates has created an unusually competitive and unpredictable general election in the heavily Democratic city.</p>

          <p>Yostin Mosquera, 35, has been convicted of the double murder of Paul Longworth, 71, and Albert Alfonso, 62, in their London flat. The court heard that Mosquera decapitated and dismembered the men, froze some of their remains, and attempted to dump the rest in suitcases from Bristol's Clifton Suspension Bridge. The murders were described as calculated and premeditated, with one killing captured on video during a sex session. Mosquera had claimed manslaughter and self-defense, but the jury found him guilty of both murders after a trial that the judge acknowledged involved "terrible, brutal events."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are actively trying new strategies to help superstar Mookie Betts break out of a severe, season-long hitting slump. Manager Dave Roberts recently gave Betts an unexpected day off for a mental reset and then moved him to the leadoff spot in the batting order. The hope is that a new position and mindset focused on getting on base will help recalibrate his mechanics. Betts, who is experiencing a career-worst season by several metrics, has expressed frustration, acknowledging that he is searching for answers to his uncharacteristic struggles at the plate.</p>

His extradition is a significant event, marking the first time Ecuador has sent one of its nationals directly to the U.S. to face charges.
