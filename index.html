          <p>A growing number of single individuals, particularly from Gen Z, are utilizing artificial intelligence to enhance their online dating experiences. According to a study by Match.com, one in four singles now use AI tools to help craft messages, filter potential matches, and boost their confidence. Apps like Rizz and Keepler offer AI-driven advice, functioning as a virtual 'wingman' to help users initiate conversations or navigate difficult interactions like ghosting. While some users find these tools helpful for breaking the ice, experts caution against over-reliance, emphasizing that AI should supplement, not substitute, genuine human connection and authenticity.</p>

          <p>Over seven million people in the United Kingdom are facing hosepipe bans as the country endures its third major heatwave of 2025, with temperatures reaching 34.7C. The UK Health Security Agency has issued amber heat health alerts for southern and central England, warning of risks to the entire population, while yellow alerts are in place for the north. Water companies have implemented restrictions due to record-level demand and extended dry conditions. Amid the extreme heat, authorities have also issued wildfire warnings for Scotland and Northern Ireland, urging the public to take precautions to prevent fires.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has initiated a significant reduction-in-force, laying off 1,353 employees as part of a broader Trump administration plan to reorganize the agency and cut its workforce by about 15%. The cuts, affecting both civil and foreign service staff, are part of a larger departure of nearly 3,000 personnel this year. The reorganization aims to streamline operations by consolidating departments, such as creating a single sanctions office. Critics, including Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, argue these sweeping cuts could undermine U.S. national security and diplomatic effectiveness.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the fatal Air India crash in Ahmedabad suggests the plane's engines lost thrust moments after takeoff. The report from India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau indicates that the fuel cutoff switches for both engines moved to the "cutoff" position within one second of each other. The cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, with the other denying he had done so. The crash resulted in the deaths of 241 people on board and at least 19 on the ground, destroying the aircraft and damaging several buildings.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited central Texas to survey the devastation from recent flash floods that have killed at least 121 people, expressing support for the victims and praising the response efforts. During a roundtable, Trump dismissed a reporter's question about the timeliness of warning alerts, calling the query 'evil' and stating that everyone involved did an 'incredible job.' This response contrasts with his past criticism of disaster management in other states. The visit highlights the political dynamics of the crisis, as the administration also faces questions about its plans for FEMA and past cuts to the National Weather Service.</p>

The judge ruled the state's claims were specific enough to proceed, focusing on the app's 'defective and dangerous features' rather than user-generated content.

          <p>Federal immigration authorities arrested around 200 immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally during raids on two licensed cannabis farm sites in Southern California. The Department of Homeland Security executed criminal search warrants in Carpinteria and Camarillo, leading to a tense standoff with protesters at one location. At least one worker was hospitalized with grave injuries after reportedly falling from a roof while hiding from agents. The farm operator, Glass House, stated it does not knowingly violate hiring practices and is providing legal representation for the detained workers amid an ongoing investigation into immigration and child labor violations.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace is expected to be relegated from the Europa League to the lower-tier Conference League due to UEFA's multi-club ownership regulations. The issue stems from John Textor's ownership stakes in both Crystal Palace and French club Lyon, who also qualified for the Europa League. Because Lyon finished higher in their respective domestic league, they are given precedence. Palace's predicament is compounded by their failure to meet a March deadline to alter their ownership structure, a step that rival club Nottingham Forest took to comply with the rules. Forest is now poised to take Palace's place in the more prestigious tournament.</p>

          <p>A massive Antonov An-124 cargo jet, a symbol of Ukrainian aviation, was spotted flying over Kyiv, marking a rare non-combat flight since the 2022 invasion began. The aircraft, registered to Antonov Airlines, had likely been stranded at the Svyatoshino airport in Kyiv for over four years and was being evacuated. It successfully flew over Poland and landed in Leipzig, Germany, where Antonov Airlines relocated much of its operations. The flight through heavily restricted airspace sparked joy among Ukrainians and derision from Russian commentators, who questioned how their intelligence and military failed to detect and intercept the high-profile aircraft.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government recorded a rare budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a significant shift from the typical deficits seen this fiscal year. This unexpected surplus was largely driven by a sharp increase in government receipts, bolstered by a 301% year-over-year surge in customs duties from tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Despite this monthly surplus, the fiscal year-to-date deficit still stands at $1.34 trillion. Persistently high interest rates continue to challenge federal finances, with net interest on the national debt remaining one of the largest government expenditures. (not investment advice)</p>

The author contends that these actions, which resemble McCarthyism and authoritarian tactics, corrode morale and create security risks.

This article outlines three potential options for homeowners aged 62 and older to generate additional funds.
