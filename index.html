          <p>President Trump stated his intention to soon have a majority of his nominees on the Federal Reserve's board, enabling him to push for lower interest rates. This declaration followed his unprecedented move to remove Governor Lisa Cook, a former Biden appointee, citing allegations regarding her mortgages. Cook's attorney confirmed she plans to sue to block her ouster, asserting the president lacks the authority to remove a Fed governor without proper cause. The central bank emphasized the importance of long tenures and removal protections for ensuring independent monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is threatening to withhold millions in federal funding from California, Washington, and New Mexico for failing to enforce English language requirements for truck drivers. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy cited an investigation following a fatal Florida crash involving a foreign driver who allegedly lacked English proficiency. Duffy asserts this is a critical safety issue, enabling drivers to understand road signs and communicate with law enforcement. Governors from the affected states have criticized the move as politically motivated blame-shifting, disputing the administration's claims.</p>

The estimated cash value for the upcoming jackpot stands at $367.9 million, before taxes. The last jackpot winner was recorded in May, underscoring the increasing rarity of a top prize claim as the stakes continue to grow.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, accusing her of mortgage fraud, a move Cook and her attorney immediately challenged as lacking legal basis. Cook, the first Black woman on the Fed board, stated she would not resign and would sue to retain her position, which is protected by a 14-year term and "for cause" removal provisions. The Federal Reserve reiterated the importance of governors' long tenures for independent monetary policy. This action is seen as an early test of presidential power over the central bank's autonomy.

          <p>A massive haboob, a type of dust storm, swept through the Phoenix area on Monday, causing significant visibility reductions, disrupting travel, and leading to power outages. Haboobs are triggered by strong outflowing winds from thunderstorms over dry, dusty regions, with their name originating from the Arabic word "habb," meaning "to blow." These storms can deposit vast amounts of dust and pose serious hazards for drivers, who are advised to pull over and turn off lights. The Phoenix event was followed by heavy rain and high winds, demonstrating the intense weather conditions.</p>

          <p>The debate over federal government control of policing in Washington D.C. is heading to Congress, with lawmakers set to address the city's "home rule" status. President Trump deployed National Guard troops, citing an "emergency" and his authority over D.C.'s local police. Republicans are proposing legislation to extend presidential control and alter the Home Rule Act, while Democrats aim to restore local authority. This political clash highlights the ongoing tension between federal oversight and D.C.'s limited autonomy, with crime rates and the precedent for other cities also key considerations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump stated on Tuesday that he would actively seek the death penalty for all murder prosecutions occurring in Washington D.C., characterizing it as a "strong preventative" measure against crime. This declaration was made during a Cabinet meeting, where he also briefly acknowledged Lisa Cook's impending lawsuit against her removal from the Federal Reserve. Washington D.C. notably abolished its death penalty decades ago, and a 2002 city-wide referendum showed overwhelming opposition to capital punishment. Trump's proposal signals a determined push for more severe federal intervention in local crime policy, likely sparking considerable debate.</p>

Both budget carriers have struggled with changing consumer preferences, oversupply, and rising costs, but Spirit's situation is more critical despite recent debt restructuring.</p>

While both offer significantly higher rates than traditional savings, CDs provide a fixed, guaranteed rate for a set term, whereas high-yield savings accounts have variable rates that can fluctuate. Examples show that depending on the term length, either option might yield slightly more, but the CD offers predictability.

          <p>Ukrainian forces have confirmed that Russian military units have crossed into the eastern industrial region of Dnipropetrovsk, attempting to establish a foothold, though their advance has reportedly been halted. This marks the first large-scale attack in the region, a significant development in the ongoing conflict. The news comes amidst flagging diplomatic efforts to end the war, despite recent meetings between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. While Russia has not officially claimed Dnipropetrovsk, its strategic importance as Ukraine's second-largest industrial center makes any incursion a blow to morale.</p>

          <p>President Trump is intensifying his campaign to influence the Federal Reserve, challenging its traditional autonomy through public attacks and the attempted removal of Governor Lisa Cook. Cook's alleged mortgage irregularities, though unconfirmed, were cited as cause for her firing, which she is legally contesting. Trump aims to secure a majority of his appointees on the Fed's rate-setting committee, potentially reshaping monetary policy for years. This aggressive approach marks a departure from previous administrations' respect for the Fed's independence, raising concerns about the central bank's ability to make long-term economic decisions free from political pressure.

          <p>A Utah judge has ordered the state legislature to redraw its congressional map, ruling that the 2021 lines violated mandatory redistricting standards and a citizen initiative against partisan gerrymandering. This decision could open a winnable seat for Democrats in the Republican-dominated state. The ruling is part of a broader national trend of redistricting battles, influenced by President Trump's efforts to expand Republican House majorities in other states like Texas and Indiana. State lawmakers have 30 days to enact a new map, with potential legal hurdles and appeals expected.</p>

          <p>Iraq's parliament is considering a controversial new law aimed at regulating the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), a powerful paramilitary group. Critics, including the U.S. State Department, warn the law could integrate "terrorist groups" into the official military, strengthening Iran's influence and creating a parallel armed force. Supporters argue it's a way to assimilate armed groups and assert Iraq's independence from Iran's two-decade-long sway. The U.S. has threatened sanctions if the law passes, while Iraqi Prime Minister al-Sudani seeks to balance internal control with external pressures.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive overview of the Menendez brothers' case, who admit to killing their parents in 1989 but claim it was in self-defense after a lifetime of physical, emotional, and sexual assault. Their initial trial resulted in a mistrial, but a second trial led to first-degree murder convictions and life sentences without parole. The article details their testimony of abuse, the prosecution's counterarguments focusing on financial motive and premeditation, and the recent emergence of new evidence, including a letter and a new sexual assault allegation, which their attorneys hope will lead to a new trial or resentencing.</p>

Options include enrolling in a debt management program, which simplifies payments and can improve credit utilization over time. Using a personal loan for consolidation can also boost a credit score by converting revolving debt to installment debt. Strategic balance transfers to low-APR cards and leveraging home equity are also discussed, with warnings about responsible spending to avoid re-accumulating debt. (not investment advice)</p>

This evidence includes a letter from Erik detailing alleged sexual assault by their father and a new allegation from former Menudo member Roy Rossello of sexual assault by Jose Menendez.
