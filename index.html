          <p>China's foreign ministry has indicated it will consider lifting its ban on Japanese seafood imports, responding to Japan's request after discussions on technical conditions for resuming shipments. This development signals a potential thaw in relations between the two countries amidst uncertainties in US trade policies. China's customs officials confirmed progress in bilateral talks regarding the safety of Japanese seafood. Japan has pledged to implement credible measures to ensure its seafood meets China's regulatory standards, marking a move towards resolving trade tensions and restoring seafood exports.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge indicated subdued inflation in April, alongside a slowdown in consumer spending.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major automakers are reintroducing extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs), a type of plug-in hybrid, to address changing consumer demands and bridge the gap between traditional hybrids and full EVs. EREVs utilize battery-powered motors for propulsion, complemented by a small gas engine acting as a generator to charge the batteries. Several automakers, including Ram, Jeep, Volkswagen, Hyundai, and Nissan, plan to launch EREV models with extended ranges, some exceeding 560 miles. Factors driving this resurgence include lower production costs due to smaller batteries, reduced complexity compared to plug-in hybrids, and the alleviation of range anxiety for consumers. </p>

          <p>The White House has strongly criticized federal judges for blocking President Donald Trump's ability to impose global tariffs, deeming it "judicial overreach" and urging the Supreme Court to intervene. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt argued that these judges are undermining the credibility of the United States on the world stage. A Court of International Trade ruling deemed Trump's tariffs "contrary to law," citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant unlimited tariff power. Leavitt defended Trump's rationale for the tariffs, emphasizing the need for domestic manufacturing capacity and secure supply chains, while also noting congressional rejection of a measure to block the tariffs.</p>

The study, which surveyed over 12,400 investors, also found that individuals with emergency savings spend less time worrying about finances and are less distracted at work.

          <p>A new biography, "Wild Thing" by Sue Prideaux, seeks to shed light on the life and myth of Paul Gauguin, examining his journey from birth to death while considering historical circumstances rather than moral judgments. Gauguin's life was marked by early travels to Peru, a successful career in finance, and later, a dedication to art, leading him to Brittany and eventually Tahiti. His art evolved from Impressionistic landscapes to a unique style incorporating elements of Japanese woodcuts and ancient Egyptian art. The article delves into the complexities of Gauguin's personal life, including his relationships and the controversies surrounding his interactions with young women in Tahiti, and explores how his art has been re-evaluated in light of contemporary social values.</p>

          <p>One year after being convicted of falsifying business records related to an alleged hush money scheme, Donald Trump continues to fight the criminal case. A federal appeals court is set to hear arguments on moving the case from state to federal court, a move opposed by the Manhattan District Attorney. Trump's lawyers argue the case involves his official acts as president and should be heard in federal court, especially after a Supreme Court ruling expanding presidential immunity. Despite being sentenced to an unconditional discharge, Trump maintains his innocence, characterizing the prosecution as politically motivated.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused China of violating its trade agreement with the U.S., just weeks after a temporary easing of tariffs was agreed upon. While Trump did not specify the exact nature of the violation, the accusation comes after both countries committed to a 90-day suspension of most levies imposed since early April. Under the agreement, the U.S. reduced tariffs on Chinese goods, and China reduced levies on American imports. Trump expressed his disappointment, stating that China has "TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US."</p>

CEO Oliver Blume has engaged in direct and "constructive" talks with U.S. officials, hoping that significant investment plans will influence Trump's decision on auto import tariffs. The company aims to build on its partnership with Rivian and make further substantial investments, contributing to a potential solution that can be applied universally. This move reflects the challenges faced by the German auto sector, including rising competition from Chinese electric vehicles.</p>

The S&P 500 declined after Trump imposed high tariffs but rebounded after he paused most of those duties, highlighting the impact of Trump's actions on market behavior.
