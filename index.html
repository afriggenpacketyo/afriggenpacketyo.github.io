        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is set to sign a sweeping domestic policy bill, which he promotes as highly popular due to its historic tax cuts. The legislation, passed by Congress along strict party lines, also enacts significant changes to immigration enforcement and introduces cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and food stamps. Despite the administration's praise, multiple national polls indicate that a majority of Americans oppose the bill, which is projected to increase the national debt substantially. Critics have condemned the measure for primarily benefiting the wealthy at the expense of low-income families. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and the European Union are approaching a critical deadline in trade negotiations, with the potential for significant US tariffs on EU goods if no agreement is reached. European capitals are reportedly divided on the acceptable terms, with some leaders urging a quick deal while others resist what they term 'blackmail.' Experts suggest a limited, UK-style agreement might be the most likely outcome, which could still leave baseline tariffs in place. The EU's stance on a digital sales tax on US tech giants has also emerged as a key point of contention in the high-stakes talks. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a July 9 deadline fast approaching, the U.S. and the European Union have yet to secure a comprehensive trade agreement, risking the imposition of U.S. tariffs up to 50% on EU goods. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has stated that a detailed agreement is 'impossible' in the given timeframe, aiming instead for an 'agreement in principle' similar to the U.S.-U.K. deal. This could involve the EU accepting a baseline tariff to allow for further negotiations on specific sectors like automobiles. Analysts remain skeptical of a breakthrough, anticipating continued uncertainty and difficult decisions for the transatlantic trade partners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia launched its most extensive aerial assault on Kyiv since the war began, injuring at least 23 people and causing widespread damage just hours after a phone call between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the timing as a deliberate signal of Moscow's intent to continue the war, while President Trump expressed his disappointment, stating he made no progress toward peace with Putin. The attack coincides with a pause in some U.S. military aid to Ukraine, raising concerns about the country's defensive capabilities amidst escalating Russian aggression and record drone strikes. </p>

          <p>A major blackout struck the Czech Republic on Friday, leaving large areas of the country, including the capital Prague, without electricity. The national grid operator, CEPS, attributed the outage to a fallen power line and reported that service had been restored to most affected areas shortly after the incident. The disruption temporarily halted train services in five of the nation's fourteen districts and briefly knocked Prague's subway system offline. Prime Minister Petr Fiala called the situation 'extraordinary and unpleasant,' while police confirmed they had no information to suggest it was a cyber or terror attack.</p>

          <p>In an unusual intervention, French police waded into the English Channel and used knives to slash an inflatable boat crowded with migrants, including women and children. The incident occurred off a beach near Boulogne as the overloaded vessel struggled in the waves with a stalling motor, creating a dangerous situation. Officers, who typically avoid entering the water, acted after determining the passengers were in immediate peril. This rare move highlights the growing pressure on French authorities to curb the surge in small boat crossings to the UK, though official tactics are expected to focus more on at-sea interceptions.</p>

          <p>Recently surfaced photos of China's advanced J-20A stealth fighter have sparked speculation that the aircraft may be officially unveiled at an upcoming military parade in Beijing. The images reveal a prototype with modified engine air intakes, known as diverterless supersonic inlets (DSI), which are optimized for the new, more powerful WS-15 engines. These design changes are expected to enhance both the fighter's stealth capabilities and its aerodynamic performance. The parade is scheduled for September 3 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, an event where China is anticipated to showcase new military hardware.</p>

          <p>President Trump conveyed his deep disappointment following a phone conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating he made 'no progress at all' toward a peace deal for Ukraine. The call occurred shortly after the White House announced a halt on some U.S. weapons shipments to Ukraine, a decision reportedly made due to concerns over dwindling domestic military stockpiles. Mr. Trump described the conversation as long but ultimately fruitless regarding the war, noting his belief that Putin is not looking to end the conflict. The Kremlin acknowledged the call and stated it pays close attention to the president's statements.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This historical analysis argues that the Continental Army, under George Washington's command, was instrumental in creating the foundations of a unified American national identity. Before the war, the thirteen colonies were disparate and competitive, lacking a shared culture. The army fostered unity by establishing national symbols like a new flag, creating shared traditions such as celebrating Washington's birthday instead of the King's, and forging bonds among soldiers from different regions through common hardship and sacrifice. After the war, many veterans became influential Federalists, advocating for a strong central government, their political views shaped by the challenges they faced due to a weak, decentralized Congress.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reflects on the enduring relevance of Virginia Woolf's 1928 essay, 'A Room of One's Own,' exploring its foundational feminist arguments from a modern, intersectional perspective. The author recounts an initial dismissal of Woolf as a symbol of exclusionary white feminism, but upon reading the work, discovered a powerful and relatable polemic against the suppression of women's voices. The essay argues that while Woolf's work has limitations tied to her era and class, its core ideas about the link between economic independence, personal space, and creative freedom remain profoundly resonant. It also considers how modern challenges, like the scarcity of time, add a new layer to Woolf's thesis.</p>

According to one analyst, momentum for diversifying away from U.S. dollar assets has already been building in several countries.

The practice of spreading sludge, a byproduct of wastewater treatment, on cropland as fertilizer is now under scrutiny for introducing these toxic chemicals into the food supply and re-polluting waterways.

          <p>This essay explores the phenomenon of AI-generated music through the lens of 'The Velvet Sundown,' a seemingly successful but likely artificial band on Spotify. The author argues that the band's innocuous, genre-blending sound is a product of a cultural shift where music has become a background 'vibe' for other activities rather than an object of active listening. Streaming services and algorithmic playlists have flattened musical taste, making soulless, machine-made content not only tolerable but potentially appealing. The existence of such music reflects a move away from art that elicits strong emotion toward content designed to make people feel nothing at all.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the history of 'Disney's America,' a controversial and ultimately failed theme park proposed by Disney in the early 1990s. Envisioned by then-CEO Michael Eisner for a site in Virginia, the park aimed to present a realistic and sometimes painful version of U.S. history, including exhibits on the Civil War and slavery. The proposal sparked a culture war, drawing fierce opposition from historians, environmentalists, and locals concerned about the 'Disneyfication' of history and the park's proximity to the Manassas battlefield. After public protests and congressional hearings, Disney abandoned the project in 1994, marking a significant failure for the company.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new trade pact with Vietnam that includes a 20% tariff on Vietnamese goods and a 40% tariff on items transshipped through the country. This move is seen as a direct effort to combat the practice of Chinese manufacturers rerouting goods through Vietnam to evade hefty U.S. tariffs. However, economists question how Vietnam will enforce the distinction between locally made products and transshipments, as the effectiveness of the policy depends on defining the level of Chinese components that would trigger the higher tariff. The deal sets a precedent for future U.S. trade negotiations with other Southeast Asian nations. (not investment advice)</p>

The tournament's 56 games averaged only 51% of stadium capacity, with many weekday and evening kick-offs struggling to draw crowds to the large venues. Furthermore, many matches were played in extreme heat, with an average heat index of 85°F and some games experiencing 'oppressive' conditions.

          <p>A major archaeological discovery in southwest China provides the first substantial evidence of a 'Wood Age' in East Asia, suggesting wooden tools were widely used 300,000 years ago. Dozens of well-preserved wooden artifacts were unearthed at the Gantangqing site in Yunnan province, a discovery described as 'world-class' by researchers. Because wood decomposes easily, direct evidence of its use by early hominins has been scarce, particularly in this region. This finding, published in the journal Science, fills a significant gap in the understanding of Palaeolithic technology and suggests that wood, not just stone, was a critical material for ancient human ancestors.</p>
