          <h2>New Federal Law Overhauls Student Loan Repayment System and Borrowing Limits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 10:30:33 EDT</div>

          <p>A new federal law signed by President Trump significantly alters the U.S. student loan system. It streamlines repayment options to just two plans: a standard 10-25 year plan and a new income-driven plan with payments lasting up to 30 years. The law also tightens eligibility for Pell Grants, eliminating them for students on full scholarships while expanding them for workforce training programs. Additionally, it imposes new borrowing caps on Parent PLUS loans and eliminates Grad PLUS loans for new students, sparking concern from medical colleges about future financial barriers for students.</p>

          <p>President Trump is visiting Central Texas after catastrophic flash floods killed over 120 people, including dozens of children at a summer camp. The visit occurs as local and federal authorities face questions about the adequacy and timing of their response to the disaster. Unlike his criticism of officials in other states during past disasters, Trump has praised Texas Governor Greg Abbott and focused on providing federal support. The administration has also defended itself against criticism regarding cuts to the National Weather Service and questions about the future of FEMA.</p>

          <p>Aspiring homeowners and those considering refinancing face a challenging market with high interest rates, though options for affordable loans still exist for applicants with strong credit profiles. As of July 10, 2025, the national average for a 30-year fixed mortgage is 6.70%, while a 15-year loan averages 5.88%. To secure the best possible rate, experts advise strengthening one's credit score, paying bills on time, and shopping around to compare offers from various lenders. Borrowers should also consider loan terms and associated fees, as these factors significantly impact the total cost of the loan. (not investment advice)</p>

Mosquera, who has admitted to manslaughter in Alfonso's death by loss of self-control, alleges that Alfonso was responsible for killing his partner, Mr. Longsworth.

On Thursday, these ETFs recorded their largest single-day inflow of 2025, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally was also fueled by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and legislative actions that could increase the federal deficit, which some analysts see as a positive catalyst for the cryptocurrency.

However, this strategy may change as the administration's trade policy evolves.

          <p>The northern Ukrainian city of Sumy, located just 15 miles from the Russian border, lives under constant threat of attack as Russia masses an estimated 50,000 troops nearby. This article details the profound human cost of the war, recounting a deadly April missile strike that killed a celebrated local organist, Olena Kohut, among 35 others. Residents, who bravely defended their city at the start of the invasion, now face frequent drone and bomb attacks. The conflict has also brought other challenges, such as the freezing of U.S. aid that supported local independent media, adding to the city's struggle for survival.</p>

          <p>A new estimate from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that nearly one in three U.S. adolescents had prediabetes in 2023, a significant increase from previous figures. However, some health experts are raising concerns about the findings, noting that the CDC released only a brief summary without a peer-reviewed paper or access to the raw data. The agency also changed its methodology for the analysis without a detailed explanation. While the rise in youth prediabetes is a serious public health issue, critics argue the lack of transparency undermines the credibility of the data from a key health agency.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will now consider a drug's affordability as a key criterion when granting new "national priority" vouchers, which can slash review times to as little as one or two months. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary confirmed the change, aligning the program with the Trump administration's goal of lowering prescription drug costs for Americans. It remains unclear how the FDA will assess affordability, as drug prices are typically set after approval. The voucher program aims to incentivize development in critical areas like cures for Type 1 diabetes and increasing domestic drug manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Timothy Leiweke, a high-profile sports executive and CEO of Oak View Group (OVG), has been criminally charged in a federal bid-rigging scheme. He is accused of conspiring with a competitor to ensure his company would win the contract to build the $388 million Moody Center at the University of Texas at Austin. The indictment alleges that from 2018 to 2024, Leiweke arranged for the rival firm to not bid on the project in exchange for subcontracts, allowing OVG to submit the sole bid. Leiweke, who has since resigned as CEO, faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>Despite the fact that childcare in the United States is a "hellscape" of high costs and low availability for most families, a sustained mass movement demanding major reform has failed to materialize. This article explores the historical, cultural, and political reasons for this inaction, citing a long-standing American view of childcare as a private family issue rather than a public good. While other developed nations have invested in robust childcare systems, the U.S. has been held back by ideological divides. However, the piece notes that new, well-funded parent organizing groups that emerged post-pandemic could signal a potential shift in political will.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration continues to issue tariff threats, Beijing is intensifying efforts to rally its own trade partners to counter U.S. protectionism. Chinese officials have recently emphasized providing development opportunities and greater regional integration to its neighbors. According to analysts, this reflects an increasingly pragmatic approach by China, aiming to build a more unified regional market over time rather than just issuing strongly worded warnings. This strategy is seen as a way to fortify its position and project stability as it prepares for further trade negotiations with Washington, positioning the U.S. as the aggressor.</p>

It focuses on the work of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, who have used forensic genetics to locate and identify 140 grandchildren stolen at birth from political prisoners.
