            <p>According to a sworn filing, a CIA official reviewing John Ratcliffe's Signal app found only administrative content, raising concerns about potential autodeletion of messages despite federal preservation requirements. Hurley Blankenship, CIA’s chief data officer, stated that he could only retrieve "residual administrative content" from Ratcliffe's personal Signal account, including the name of the chat and changes to the app’s settings. Advocacy group American Oversight raised concerns that the settings on some officials’ phones might have triggered the messages to autodelete despite a federal requirement that the communications be preserved. Officials were able to successfully preserve messages from the devices of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.</p>

            <p>Cody Balmer was arrested for allegedly setting a fire at the Pennsylvania Governor's Residence, citing hatred towards Governor Josh Shapiro. Balmer is charged with attempted murder, terrorism, arson, and other counts after he reportedly hopped a fence, broke into the residence, and threw Molotov cocktails inside while Shapiro and his family were home celebrating Passover. Balmer admitted to police that he hated Shapiro and would have attacked him with a hammer if confronted. Damage to the historic residence is estimated to be in the millions, and authorities are investigating how Balmer evaded security.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is initiating investigations into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors to potentially impose tariffs on national security grounds. Notices posted to the Federal Register set a 21-day deadline for public comment, with the administration intending to pursue levies under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. The US heavily relies on chip imports from Taiwan, while drugmakers argue that tariffs could lead to shortages and reduced patient access. Trump has stated he will announce a tariff rate on imported semiconductors soon, with flexibility for some companies. (not investment advice)</p>

The materials will be unloaded at Immingham docks and transported to the Scunthorpe site after a dispute over cargo ownership was resolved. The government seized control of the business to prevent the furnaces from being shut down, which would eliminate the UK's ability to produce virgin steel.

            <p>The Trump administration asserts it lacks the authority to compel El Salvador to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States, despite court orders. This claim follows El Salvador President Nayib Bukele's refusal to voluntarily return Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported. Joseph Mazzara of the Department of Homeland Security stated that DHS cannot forcibly extract an individual from a foreign nation's custody. Bukele dismissed the idea of returning Abrego Garcia, calling him a "terrorist." The Trump administration alleges Abrego Garcia is a gang member based on a 2019 statement.</p>

            <p>Major American tech firms, dubbed the “Silicon Six,” are accused of avoiding nearly $278 billion in US corporation taxes over the past 10 years, paying an average of 18.8% compared to the statutory rate of 29.7%. The Fair Tax Foundation (FTF) claims these companies, including Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, Netflix, Apple, and Microsoft, have “hardwired” tax avoidance into their business models. The report highlights aggressive tax practices, such as inflated tax payments and booking profits in low-tax jurisdictions. The analysis comes as the US tech companies’ influence has been highlighted by the presence of their bosses including Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Apple’s Tim Cook and Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg at Donald Trump’s second inauguration.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's decision to pause reciprocal tariffs was influenced by shifting power dynamics within the White House, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent playing a key role. Bessent, who expressed reservations about tariffs earlier in his career, reportedly swayed Trump by highlighting the bond market's reaction. Experts suggest Bessent's approach, contrasting with the harder-line stances of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and trade adviser Pete Navarro, helped avert an all-out global trade war. Bessent's experience in the bond market allowed him to gain the president's ear and guide him towards a more market-sensitive approach.</p>

            <p>Despite new burdens, PSG insiders have been hugely delighted with Doue's dedication and professionalism. Doue first hit the radar when France won the European Under-17 Championships in Israel in 2022, then he was on the bench for the Olympic final in Paris two years later, coming on after 77 minutes when France lost 5-3 to Spain after extra time. The Olympics arguably contributed to his slow start at PSG, lacking a proper pre-season, but he has been the beneficiary of careful management by Luis Enrique - who has worked individually with Doue, encouraging him through his quiet start. Doue has also had to adjust to life in the Paris goldfish bowl, away from quieter Rennes.</p>

            <p>Harvard University is refusing to comply with demands from the Trump administration regarding diversity programs, admissions, and immigration, risking billions in federal funding. President Alan Garber stated the school "will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights." The Trump administration demanded Harvard end DEI programs, adopt merit-based admissions, and cooperate with immigration authorities. Harvard argues that the administration's requests violate its First Amendment rights and exceed the government's authority. The confrontation follows similar actions against other universities.</p>

Kennedy, Jr.'s history of spreading misinformation about vaccines. Despite Kennedy's public promise to support vaccines, concerns remain about the administration's efforts to address the outbreak.</p>

            <p>China's economy is facing concerns of a potential "summer blue" period, where growth slows down after a promising "open door red" start in the first quarter. This trend has been observed in previous years, with growth declining in the second quarter. The consensus among economists is that China's first-quarter GDP growth will be impressive, but concerns remain about maintaining momentum throughout the year. The article highlights previous instances where initial enthusiasm waned, leading to a slowdown in economic activity.</p>

The lawsuit argues that Trump has illegally usurped Congress' power by claiming trade deficits constitute an emergency. The Liberty Justice Center, representing the businesses, argues that trade deficits are not an "unusual and extraordinary threat." The suit seeks to declare Trump's actions illegal and reaffirm the principle of no taxation without representation. (not investment advice)</p>
