          <p>Chinese academics and writers are increasingly promoting speculative and science fiction as a tool to project the nation's cultural influence and offer alternative future visions. At a recent conference, scholars argued that the genre has been historically dominated by Western, often pessimistic, neoliberal perspectives. In contrast, they suggest that Chinese speculative fiction can explore different societal possibilities and critique the present from a non-Western viewpoint. This push is part of a broader strategy to establish a distinct voice in global cultural conversations about the future.</p>

          <p>A recently ousted high-ranking official from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has raised alarms about the leadership of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Former CDC Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry alleges that Kennedy has avoided expert consultation, even during deadly disease outbreaks, while pushing for significant changes to childhood immunization schedules. Houry described the situation as a "hostile takeover" of the agency, expressing deep concern over the spread of misinformation and the dismantling of scientific integrity within U.S. public health institutions.</p>

          <p>Following the fictional assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, many Black, brown, and queer college students across the U.S. are expressing unease with his portrayal as a national hero. They critique his rhetoric as hateful and worry that marginalized communities are being unfairly blamed for his death, leading to racist threats and harassment. The incident has also sparked significant concerns about free speech on campuses, as some students have faced disciplinary action for mocking his death, raising questions about the limits of expression in a polarized political climate.</p>

          <p>Ahti Heinla, a co-founder of Skype, is now leading Starship Technologies, a company deploying autonomous delivery robots in cities across the U.K., Europe, and the U.S. Heinla claims the six-wheeled robots can deliver groceries and food more cheaply than human drivers, making services viable even in less dense areas. While facing competition and regulatory hurdles that vary by location, the company has already completed eight million deliveries. Heinla argues that these robots address a growing demand for delivery services without displacing human workers, who can focus on more complex jobs.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge in Massachusetts delivered a powerful condemnation of the Trump administration's actions against pro-Palestinian foreign scholars, ruling that their free speech rights had been violated. In his opinion, Judge William Young asserted that the Constitution's First Amendment protections apply to non-citizens and citizens alike, accusing the president of ignoring legal and constitutional norms to suppress dissent. The ruling frames the administration's targeting of immigrants not just as a legal violation but as a threat to fundamental American values that should concern all citizens.</p>

          <p>The introduction of 'Tilly Norwood,' a hyperrealistic AI-generated avatar marketed as a future movie star, has caused a panic in Hollywood. Created by the AI production company Particle6, Norwood's emergence has drawn swift condemnation from actors' unions like SAG-AFTRA, which oppose the replacement of human performers with synthetics. While major talent agencies have publicly stated they will not represent the AI entity, the controversy highlights the industry's deep-seated anxieties over the increasing use of generative AI, particularly its potential to displace background actors and voice performers.</p>

          <p>The families of foreign nationals imprisoned in Venezuela are experiencing growing anxiety as the U.S. increases military pressure on Nicolás Maduro's government. Human rights groups report that dozens of foreigners, including humanitarian workers and business people, are being held on dubious charges, effectively as political hostages. These detentions are seen as a tactic by the Maduro regime to extort concessions from foreign governments that have condemned his leadership. The escalating tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela create a volatile situation, leaving the fate of these prisoners uncertain.</p>

          <p>Chinese director Lou Ye's 'An Unfinished Film' has received international acclaim for its portrayal of a film crew quarantined near Wuhan during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. The movie is praised for its courage in depicting the chaos and confinement of the early pandemic, a period now subject to official silence in China. However, this article argues that while the film powerfully captures the initial lockdown and subsequent anti-lockdown protests, it conspicuously omits the mass deaths that followed the abrupt end of the 'zero COVID' policy, leaving a crucial part of the national trauma unexplored.</p>

          <h2>Gaza Strikes Continue Despite Trump's Cease-fire Push and Hamas's Partial Agreement</h2>

          <p>Despite President Trump's call for an immediate halt to fighting, Israeli forces have reportedly continued to carry out airstrikes across the Gaza Strip. The attacks persist even after Hamas accepted key elements of a U.S.-backed peace plan, including an end to the war and the release of hostages, a position also endorsed by its ally, Palestinian Islamic Jihad. This ongoing violence highlights the fragility of the peace efforts, as Israeli military leaders have instructed forces to prepare for the plan's first phase but have not confirmed a reduction in military operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has called on pro-Palestinian protest organizers to postpone demonstrations planned for the weekend, asking them to "respect the grief of British Jews" following the recent deadly attack on a Manchester synagogue. Government and police officials have echoed this sentiment, expressing concern that the protests will stoke community tensions and divert police resources needed to protect Jewish institutions. While protest groups insist on their right to demonstrate against the situation in Gaza, the timing has created a tense debate over free speech and public sensitivity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Election Commission (FEC) is now down to just two members, leaving it without the required four-person quorum and unable to conduct most of its work. The latest resignation of a Republican commissioner follows two other departures during the Trump administration, including the controversial firing of a Democratic member. This paralysis means the agency cannot start or conclude investigations, issue penalties, or create new rules for campaign finance, effectively leaving no "cop on the beat" to enforce election laws during a period of heavy political spending.</p>

The fan was among many moved from a prime location that the club converted into more profitable corporate seating. This change is part of a broader strategy under minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe to increase revenue and cut the club's financial losses.

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is reportedly considering a new one-dollar coin featuring President Donald Trump to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026. A draft design shows Trump's face on one side and a depiction of him after his 2024 near-assassination on the other, with the words "Fight, Fight, Fight." While a 2020 law allows for commemorative coins for the semiquincentennial, other federal statutes generally prohibit living persons from appearing on U.S. currency, creating a potential legal obstacle for the proposal.</p>

          <p>The aviation industry is pinning its hopes on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to achieve its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, but significant challenges remain. While new mandates in the E.U. and U.K. require a small percentage of jet fuel to be sustainable, some airline executives, like Ryanair's Michael O'Leary, are skeptical that production can scale up to meet future targets. Experts acknowledge that while the technology is proven, creating a commercially viable supply chain, especially for next-generation fuels made from waste, requires immense investment and government support.</p>
