          <p>Several news outlets are covering the aftermath of the Manchester synagogue attack, focusing on Adrian Daulby, hailed as a hero for blocking the attacker. Publications also address the planned pro-Palestine protests, with some criticizing them as a front for antisemitism. Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary, condemns the Met Police's appeal to organizers to stand down, while David Lammy faced anger at a vigil. The Guardian reports that Rachel Reeves is being urged to reconsider Labour's tax promises in the upcoming budget. Optimism here is tempered due to the sensitive nature of the events covered.</p>

          <p>Munich Airport has suspended operations for the second time in 24 hours due to unconfirmed drone sightings in the vicinity. The airport had planned to resume flights, but delayed the restart as a precautionary measure. This follows an earlier incident where a drone was spotted over a nearby military facility. German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt called the drone sightings a 'wake-up call,' emphasizing the need for increased funding and research into drone defense. The incident affected thousands of passengers and caused flight diversions and cancellations.</p>

          <p>Recent incidents of abusive crowd behavior at the Ryder Cup have sparked a debate about whether accepted codes of conduct have changed. A survey indicates a significant percentage of live event workers in the UK have experienced antisocial behavior from audience members. Experts attribute this to factors like deindividuation and convergence, while others argue that concerns about degraded manners are overblown. Some suggest that swift action against disruptive individuals can shape crowd behavior and maintain a balance between passion and civility.

          <p>A defense pact between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan is posing a dilemma for China, given its strong relations with both countries. The pact raises concerns about Saudi Arabia potentially being under Pakistan's nuclear umbrella, which could provoke the US and encourage nuclear proliferation. Analysts suggest Beijing would prefer to avoid further development of this nuclear partnership. The widespread belief that Israel has a nuclear monopoly in the region is fueling concern, especially as America shows reluctance to protect its ally, Qatar.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has accepted Hamas's response to his 20-point peace plan for Gaza, even though it falls short of unequivocal acceptance. Trump is demanding that Israel immediately stop bombing Gaza to facilitate the safe release of hostages. This move puts Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a difficult position, as he views the Hamas response as a rejection of the plan. Trump's decision is influenced by his desire to further the Abraham Accords, win the Nobel Peace Prize, and address rising unfavorable views of Israel's Gaza policy. The Israeli attack on Hamas negotiators in Qatar was a turning point for Trump.</p>

          <p>A University of Oxford study estimates that changing weather patterns caused 1,700 heat-related deaths in Zurich between 1969 and 2018. Researchers found that these deaths are rapidly increasing, despite improvements in cooling and healthcare. The study emphasizes the need for rapid emission reductions by moving away from fossil fuels and animal agriculture. While heat resilience methods have prevented about 700 lives since 2004, the trend of a warming planet poses a significant risk to communities globally.

They argue that the jury's not-guilty verdict on sex trafficking indicates that Combs did not use force or coercion. The lawyers acknowledge the video of Combs assaulting Ventura was damaging but maintain that domestic violence was not the crime he was convicted of. They contend that the lengthy sentence undermines rehabilitation and that Combs has already been punished enough through imprisonment, reputational damage, and civil lawsuits.</p>

Many were not entitled to a pension until recent years, and some retirees are still waiting for clear indication of when they might receive their money. The Fire Brigades Union fought for retained firefighters' pensions, leading to settlements allowing claims dating back to 2000. However, delays in employment tribunals continue to present an obstacle to members receiving what they are owed in a timely manner.

          <p>North Carolina Governor Josh Stein signed "Iryna's Law," increasing checks on criminals out on bail and prohibiting cashless bail for violent crimes and repeat offenders. The law is in response to the stabbing death of Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian refugee, on a Charlotte light-rail train. The suspect, Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr., had a history of arrests and was recently released on a misdemeanor charge. While Stein doesn't fully support the bill, he signed it because it alerts the judiciary to consider violence risks before determining bail. The law also faces criticism for its focus on bail ability rather than the threat posed, and for a last-minute amendment regarding executions.</p>

          <p>Aiman Kaiden competed against other men in London to find the city's best 'performative male,' a trope involving fashion trends and aesthetic choices meant to signal empathy and understanding of women's struggles. Aiman, a musician, admits to some interests that align with the stereotype but participated at the insistence of friends. The contest involved trials like explaining book choices and performing romantic songs. One observer noted that the performative male trend might be a reaction against the growing number of misogynistic, right-wing ideologized men. The event served as a humorous commentary on modern dating and gender politics.</p>

          <p>Despite China's economic slowdown, U.S. and European brands are revamping strategies to attract Chinese shoppers, facing growing competition from local brands. Kraft Heinz hired a local agency to create campaigns, decorating subway stations to mimic ketchup bottles. Adapting to the social commerce ecosystem, especially platforms like Douyin and Xiaohongshu, is a significant challenge for brands. Access to data on consumer buying habits is crucial, with Chinese e-commerce platforms sharing more data than Amazon. The trend sees more brands establishing local R&D centers and product teams to tailor products to local needs.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed a measure allowing over 800,000 ride-hailing drivers to join a union and negotiate for better wages and benefits. This legislation is part of an agreement among Newsom, state lawmakers, the SEIU, and rideshare companies Uber and Lyft. Newsom is also expected to sign a measure supported by Uber and Lyft to significantly cut insurance requirements for accidents caused by underinsured drivers. The collective bargaining measure requires gig companies to bargain in good faith over issues such as driver deactivations, paid leave, and earnings. The new law arrives as Uber and Lyft continue negotiating a settlement with California and the cities of San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego.</p>

          <p>The first-ever Riyadh Comedy Festival, featuring comedians like Dave Chappelle and Bill Burr, has sparked controversy due to Saudi Arabia's human rights record. Some comedians have been criticized for performing at the festival, while others declined invitations. Attendees reported that the shows avoided mentioning the Saudi government but included jokes about sex and cultural norms. Some found the jokes shocking in the conservative country, while others enjoyed them. Human Rights Watch has criticized the festival as an attempt by the Saudi regime to whitewash its abuses. There are concerns about the timing of the festival, which coincides with the anniversary of Jamal Khashoggi's murder.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift released her new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," and is once again turning her lyrical skills into a business strategy. Experts say Swift has always been extremely business savvy and fan-obsessed. The album was inspired by the record-smashing Eras Tour, the first-ever tour to gross more than $2 billion. The company said it only took 11 hours to hit that mark. The album became Spotify's most streamed album in a single day this year. Some tracks seem to reveal new tidbits of her love story with Kelce, a key player in the album's rollout.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to end temporary legal protections for over 300,000 Venezuelan migrants. The high court agreed to freeze a lower court decision that found the Department of Homeland Security illegally terminated the Temporary Protected Status program. Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson dissented. DHS called the order a "win for the American people and commonsense". The National TPS Alliance criticized the order, saying it will upend the lives of law-abiding, hard-working TPS holders. The Trump administration has sought to end programs allowing certain migrants to live and work in the U.S.</p>

Sales of plug-in hybrid cars grew even faster, with electric or hybrid vehicles making up over half of all new car registrations. The SMMT said sales were driven by carmakers offering discounts, a larger choice of models, and the introduction of the government's grant scheme. The number of private buyers of fully electric cars has risen in the past year. The government's electric car grant scheme would help break down one of the barriers holding back people making the switch.</p>
