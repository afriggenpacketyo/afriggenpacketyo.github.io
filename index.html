            <p>Global bond markets faced a roller coaster week, particularly in the U.K., due to investor concerns regarding fiscal outlooks and shifts in market sentiment influenced by President Trump's reciprocal tariffs. U.S. Treasury yields cooled after an initial sell-off, while U.K. 30-year bonds tumbled following a spike. Deutsche Bank Research suggests the market is relieved by the pause on tariffs, assuming a high bar for reinstatement and anticipating potential trade deals with the U.S. This volatility underscores the sensitivity of bond markets to trade policy and economic uncertainty.

            <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson is making another attempt to pass a budget blueprint aligned with President Trump's agenda, facing resistance from Republican hardliners concerned about the national deficit. Johnson claims to have secured the necessary votes after productive deliberations and highlights efforts to cut spending by over a trillion dollars. Senator Thune echoed similar sentiments in support of the budget. Trump expressed optimism, stating that Republicans are working well together on the "Big, Beautiful Bill," as the House faces a tight deadline before the April recess.</p>

            <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy anticipates that third-party sellers on the platform will likely pass increased tariff costs resulting from President Trump's trade policies onto consumers. Despite strategic forward inventory buys and renegotiated purchase orders, Jassy believes sellers may not have sufficient margin to absorb the additional expenses. Amazon has already begun canceling some direct import orders from China due to the tariffs, signaling potential price increases for consumers. This suggests that Trump's trade policies will directly affect the prices of goods sold on Amazon.</p>

            <p>President Trump's tariffs on goods imported from China could significantly increase the cost of iPhones in the US, with some analysts estimating potential price increases of hundreds of dollars. While Apple is exploring diversifying its supply chains, particularly in India, relocating production is a complex and costly endeavor. The extent to which Apple will pass on these costs to consumers remains uncertain, but analysts suggest that the company's strong brand loyalty may allow it to do so without significant backlash. Consumers may consider rival handsets or used devices to avoid higher prices. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The U.S. Air Force has announced that a fighter jet, dubbed "Frankenjet," constructed from recycled parts of two wrecked warplanes, is now fully operational. The F-35A warplane was created by combining the nose of one inoperative jet with another, a project conceived in late 2022 to minimize waste and reduce repair costs. The project took two years and five months, costing $11.7 million, which resulted in $63 million overall in savings for the Department of Defense. The "Frankenjet" has resumed full service as part of the 4th Fighter Generation Squadron's 388th Fighter Wing.</p>

The strike, ongoing for over four weeks, centers on job role losses and pay cuts, leading to significant rubbish accumulation in the city. While some local members reportedly supported a deal, national figures allegedly rejected it, influenced by internal power struggles. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner urged acceptance of an improved deal, but Unite defends its actions, stating it is protecting workers from wage cuts.</p>

Donatella Versace stepped down from her creative director role and became the chief brand ambassador, with Dario Vitale taking over as chief creative officer.</p>

            <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met with families who lost children to measles in West Texas, raising doubts about vaccine safety. Despite his department's efforts to supply MMR vaccines, he reportedly questioned the contents of vaccines. While publicly endorsing vaccines for public health, Kennedy's private conversations suggest continued skepticism. The deaths of the children are being reframed by vaccine skeptics as consequences of medical errors, with alternative treatments being promoted. The incident highlights the ongoing debate surrounding vaccine safety and the role of public officials in shaping public opinion.</p>

            <p>Major League Baseball (MLB) owners are contemplating the implementation of a salary cap and floor as the current Collective Bargaining Agreement expires in December 2026, potentially leading to a lockout. The MLB Players Association has historically opposed a salary cap. The potential change aims to address the growing spending disparity between teams, which critics argue creates competitive imbalance. The move mirrors economic structures in the NFL, NHL, and NBA, and could impact player salaries and competitive balance within the league.</p>

            <p>Colossal Biosciences unveiled genetically modified wolves with traits from extinct dire wolves, sparking debate about the ethics of de-extinction. These wolves are not truly "de-extincted" but rather hybridized modern wolves, raising questions about the responsibility humans have for these novel animals. Critics argue that de-extinction prioritizes spectacle over conservation and poses risks to the animals involved. The project raises concerns about animal welfare and the potential for exploitation by private companies.</p>

            <p>In an economy facing persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn returns exceeding the inflation rate, ensuring savings maintain their buying power. Leading CD accounts provide higher returns that can be locked in for the CD's term, offering a safe investment with FDIC or NCUA insurance up to $250,000. Online banks often offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs. Strategies such as laddering CDs and considering short-term CDs can help maximize savings growth.

Strengthening credit profiles, shopping around for lenders, and choosing the right loan term can improve chances of qualifying for better rates. (not investment advice)</p>
