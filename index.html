            <p>A six-meter-tall Evangelion Unit 01 statue has been erected in Hamamatsu city hall as part of a tourism campaign celebrating the city's connection to the popular anime film. The statue will be accessible to the public until the end of February next year, including weekends and holidays. This initiative follows previous Evangelion-themed campaigns by local railway companies, leveraging the city's association with locations featured in the movie. The campaign aims to attract "anime pilgrims" and boost local tourism and culture, with Mayor Yusuke Nakano expressing interest in partnerships with other cities linked to the series.</p>

            <p>The Indiana legislature has passed a bill to establish a commission to explore adjusting its border with Illinois, potentially acquiring counties seeking to separate from the Chicago area. While Indiana's governor supports the measure, Illinois officials are opposed, and U.S. Congress approval would be required for any boundary change. This effort is fueled by political divisions between the Democratic-controlled Chicago area and Republican-leaning regions in Illinois, mirroring a similar movement in eastern Oregon to join Idaho. The last major boundary change occurred during the Civil War era with the creation of West Virginia.</p>

            <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has stated that the government will reinforce its commitment to environmental policies and accused opponents of the net-zero carbon emissions target of spreading "nonsense and lies." He argues that transitioning to green power will secure social justice and national security, citing the impact of reliance on fossil fuels after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Critics, including some Conservatives and Reform UK, claim the net-zero agenda jeopardizes jobs in traditional industries. Miliband warns that abandoning the agenda would risk climate breakdown and the loss of future clean energy jobs.</p>

The operator, East Japan Railway Co., carried out platform expansion work at Tamachi Station and relocated nearby tracks to prepare for the construction of the new line. The new route is scheduled to open in the fiscal year starting April 2031, improving connectivity between central Tokyo and the airport.</p>

            <p>Taiwan is grappling with a rising number of espionage cases involving individuals closely associated with senior Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) politicians, raising concerns about vulnerabilities in its counter-intelligence systems. At least five people linked to top DPP officials are under investigation for allegedly leaking classified information to mainland Chinese intelligence. These breaches have fueled fears that Beijing's spy networks in Taiwan are intensifying, potentially undermining the administration of William Lai Ching-te and eroding public trust. Beijing views Taiwan as part of China and has increased pressure since Lai took office.</p>

            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a temporary "Easter truce" in the Ukraine conflict, lasting until midnight Sunday, citing humanitarian grounds. Putin ordered a stop to all fighting during this period, expecting Ukraine to reciprocate. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed skepticism, stating that Russian assaults continued and proposed extending the ceasefire beyond Easter to reveal Russia's true intentions. The announcement followed frustration from the Trump administration regarding the pace of peace talks, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggesting the U.S. may "move on" if progress is not made.</p>

The crew spent 220 days in space, orbiting Earth 3,520 times. The return marked the end of an extended crew rotation, with new crew members already launched to replace them.

            <p>Chinese researchers have successfully detonated a non-nuclear hydrogen bomb in a controlled field test. The device generated a fireball exceeding 1,000 degrees Celsius for more than two seconds without using any nuclear materials.

The research team, led by CSSC scientist Wang Xuefeng, highlighted the potential for rapid and widespread flame propagation with minimal ignition energy.</p>
