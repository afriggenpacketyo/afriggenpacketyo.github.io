          <p>Major U.S. stock indexes, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, have achieved record highs, driven by investor optimism regarding a potential U.S.-China trade agreement and anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. This rally marks a significant recovery from a bear market earlier in the year, fueled by a rebound in technology stocks and easing concerns over tariff policies. Despite the positive momentum, some analysts express caution, suggesting that market complacency about trade deals could lead to future volatility. The market also digested new data showing a slight increase in inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld a Texas law that requires commercial websites with sexually explicit content to verify the age of their visitors. In a 6-3 decision, the court ruled that the requirement does not violate the First Amendment's free speech protections, affirming the state's interest in protecting minors from harmful material online. The law allows the Texas attorney general to sue non-compliant sites for significant daily penalties. In response to this and similar laws in other states, some major pornography websites have ceased operations in Texas.</p>

His victory on June 24th is seen as a significant win against the party's establishment. Mamdani's campaign style, which included walking the entire length of Manhattan to engage with voters, has drawn comparisons to former mayor Ed Koch. His progressive platform and grassroots approach have positioned him as a formidable new figure in New York politics, though the article suggests his confrontational style could be a double-edged sword.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has modified his government's proposed welfare reforms after facing significant opposition from his own Labour Party MPs. The initial plan aimed to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to reduce spending, but the stricter criteria will now only apply to new claimants. The government also reversed a planned freeze on the health-related component of Universal Credit for existing recipients and will fast-track a support package to help people find work. The changes are a concession to backbenchers who threatened to defeat the bill.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has limited the ability of federal judges to issue universal injunctions, which have been used to block presidential policies nationwide. The 6-3 decision stemmed from challenges to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship, with the court ruling that such broad injunctions likely exceed the authority granted to federal courts by Congress. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the birthright citizenship order itself, the decision strengthens the executive branch's power to implement policies without being immediately halted across the country. Dissenting justices warned the ruling poses an existential threat to the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Following a Supreme Court ruling, California officials will need to revise state education policies to allow parents to opt their children out of lessons involving LGBTQ characters and themes on religious grounds. The case originated in Maryland but has significant implications for California, which mandates LGBTQ-inclusive curriculum. While the state's learning goals can remain, they will no longer be mandatory for individual families who object. The decision has sparked debate, with critics like the ACLU calling it a drastic break from precedent, while supporters praise it as a victory for parental rights and religious freedom.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has announced it will hear further arguments concerning Louisiana's new congressional map, which includes a second majority-Black district. This decision means the current map, which was challenged as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander by a group of "non-African-American voters," will remain in place for now. The case stems from a yearslong legal battle following the 2020 Census, as lawmakers tried to comply with the Voting Rights Act without relying too heavily on race. The eventual ruling will likely impact the balance of power in the U.S. House during the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

However, some Democratic lawmakers and nuclear experts expressed concern that Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium may not have been destroyed, leaving its breakout time to a nuclear weapon potentially very short.

Supply chain data points to a milder-than-usual peak season for holiday inventory buildup, with fewer shipping containers being imported, particularly on the West Coast.

          <p>An extreme heatwave is sweeping across Europe, with temperatures soaring past 40 degrees Celsius (104 F) in southern countries like Spain, Italy, and Greece.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of the third and final season of Netflix's "Squid Game" argues that the show has shifted away from its sharp critique of capitalism. Instead, the article suggests the season focuses on more superficial observations about human selfishness, using deadlier games as plot devices rather than insightful social commentary. The introduction of a newborn as a competitor is cited as an example of how the show has become a parody of itself. While still watchable for its impressive set pieces, the series is criticized for flattening its protagonist's arc and abandoning the themes of economic anxiety that made it a global phenomenon.</p>

          <p>The debut feature film "Familiar Touch," directed by Sarah Friedland, is being praised for its sensitive and layered depiction of a woman with dementia. The movie stars Kathleen Chalfant as Ruth, a former cookbook author moving into a memory-care facility, in a performance described as commanding and award-worthy. The film avoids common tropes of medical suffering, instead focusing on Ruth's perspective and the complex relationship between residents and caregivers. The review highlights the movie as a social procedural that demystifies the caregiving profession while offering a dignified portrait of a person navigating memory loss.</p>

Newsom is seeking damages nearly identical to the amount Fox paid to settle the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit and has offered to drop the case in exchange for a retraction and on-air apology.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt at $1.17 trillion, many consumers are exploring debt settlement, but this strategy has its limits. While there is no official cap, experts suggest that debt settlement becomes less effective for balances exceeding $100,000. At this level, creditors are more likely to pursue legal action, the lump-sum funds required for settlement become unrealistic for many, and fees from debt relief companies can become prohibitively expensive. For those with overwhelming debt, alternatives like debt consolidation, credit counseling, or even bankruptcy may be more viable options to consider. (not investment advice)</p>

The piece advocates for assuming the worst in others' behavior as a practical approach to life and politics.

          <p>Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis has launched an aggressive turnaround plan to revive the Stellantis truck brand, which has seen sales decline 38% since 2019. The strategy includes reintroducing Hemi V-8 engines, offering a new industry-leading powertrain warranty, and returning to NASCAR. Kuniskis, who returned from a brief retirement, acknowledged that issues with pricing and a problematic redesign of the Ram 1500 contributed to the brand's slump. The plan aims to reclaim significant market share in the highly profitable full-size pickup segment, a crucial component of Stellantis's overall business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Navy Ship Named for Gay Rights Leader Harvey Milk to be Renamed for WWII Hero</h2>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced that the USNS Harvey Milk, a naval ship named for the assassinated gay rights leader, will be renamed the USNS Oscar V. Peterson. The new namesake is a Navy chief who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism during World War II. Hegseth stated the change was part of an effort to remove politics from ship naming, a move made just before the final weekend of Pride Month. The ship was originally christened in 2021 during the Biden administration to honor Milk, who was a Navy veteran.</p>
