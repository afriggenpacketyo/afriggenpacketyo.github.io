          <p>This opinion piece argues that the recent U.S. military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities was a correct and consistent application of President Trump's "America First" foreign policy. The author frames the action not as interventionism, but as a pragmatic and decisive move to defend core American national interests by preventing a hostile regime from acquiring nuclear weapons. The article asserts that the operation was a great act of statesmanship and was overwhelmingly supported by the president's base.</p>

          <p>Data from China's National Bureau of Statistics reveals that profits for major industrial firms fell by 9.1% in May compared to the same month last year. The decline is being attributed to a combination of weak domestic demand, falling prices, and the ongoing trade dispute with the United States. The report indicated that the mining and automotive sectors experienced particularly sharp profit drops during the first five months of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The planned cuts to disability and sickness benefits will now only affect future claimants, protecting current recipients.
