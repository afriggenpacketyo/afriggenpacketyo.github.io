          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing the need to assess the economic impact of President Trump's trade policies. The Fed acknowledged increased uncertainty about the economic outlook, noting risks of higher unemployment and inflation. The central bank's decision reflects a cautious approach as it monitors economic indicators and the potential effects of tariffs on growth and prices.

          <p>Used vehicle pricing jumped to its highest level since October 2023, driven by consumer purchases amid fears of price hikes due to auto tariffs. The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index increased 4.9% year-over-year and 2.7% month-to-month, significantly higher than typical monthly moves. Analysts attribute the strong price appreciation to the anticipated impact of tariffs, as consumers rushed to buy used cars before prices increased.

          <p>Homeowners should consider three key factors before pursuing a $100,000 home equity line of credit (HELOC): it's the cheapest way to borrow home equity now, it's likely to become less expensive in the months ahead, and volatility will need to be priced in. With average home equity levels high, many homeowners may be exploring their borrowing options, but a HELOC's variable interest rate requires careful planning.
