        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's administration is reportedly making significant changes to cryptocurrency regulations, marking a stark contrast to the previous administration's approach. According to the article, these changes include strategic appointments of pro-crypto officials, the creation of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, and the rollback of enforcement-heavy SEC tactics. Industry leaders like Nic Carter of Castle Island Ventures are praising the administration's efforts to provide clarity and a more welcoming environment for crypto firms, including exploring new bank charters and rescinding anti-crypto guidance. However, the Federal Reserve is noted as a potential obstacle, and some concerns linger regarding family involvement in crypto projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Automakers in the U.S. experienced a notable increase in sales during April, driven by consumers rushing to purchase vehicles ahead of potential price hikes due to tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. According to the article, Ford, Hyundai, Kia, General Motors, and Toyota all reported significant year-over-year sales increases, fueled by special discounts and promises not to raise prices immediately. However, analysts warn that this surge may be short-lived, as new vehicle inventories tighten and prices increase, potentially leading to lower sales in the future. The article also notes that while some tariffs were modified, additional levies on auto parts are expected to take effect soon.</p>

          <p>Mike Waltz is expected to leave his position as National Security Advisor following a controversy involving a Signal messaging app group used to discuss U.S. military plans. The article reports that the Signal group, which inadvertently included an editor from The Atlantic, revealed details of messages exchanged between high-level officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, regarding plans for attacks on Houthi forces in Yemen. Waltz's departure would mark the first major official to leave the White House since the beginning of President Trump's second term.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly discontinuing $1 billion in school mental health grants that were initiated during the Biden administration.
