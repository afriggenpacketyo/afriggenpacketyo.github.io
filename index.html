          <p>Russia launched one of its most extensive aerial attacks on Ukraine, targeting Kyiv with a record number of drones and several missiles. The overnight barrage caused widespread damage, injuring at least 23 people and hitting residential buildings and infrastructure across the capital. The attack occurred shortly after a phone call between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, during which no progress was made on ending the war. Ukrainian President Zelensky condemned the strikes as a cynical demonstration of Russia's unwillingness to cease hostilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a precarious U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Iran, analysis suggests the recent American strike on Iran's nuclear facilities was a strategic move to deny long-term weapon development options, not to counter an imminent threat. While intelligence assessments differ on the extent of the damage, the prevailing view is that a formal peace remains unlikely due to deep-seated ideological conflicts. Instead, the U.S. may be facing a prolonged period of containment and deterrence with Iran, characterized by proxy conflicts and cyber warfare rather than diplomatic breakthroughs.</p>

          <p>After a controversial one-year suspension, competitive eating superstar Joey "Jaws" Chestnut is set to return to the Nathan’s Fourth of July hotdog eating contest. Chestnut was barred from the 2024 event after signing a deal to promote a rival plant-based wiener brand, a move that shocked the competitive eating world. His return to the iconic Coney Island event, where he will seek his 17th title, has generated significant excitement among fans and organizers. The resolution of the dispute marks the comeback of the sport's most dominant figure to its premier stage.</p>

          <p>Dozens of cities are replacing traditional Fourth of July fireworks with choreographed drone light shows, citing safety and environmental reasons. Proponents highlight that drone displays reduce fire risks, especially in drought-prone areas, are quieter for people with PTSD and pets, and avoid the debris left by pyrotechnics. While companies producing these shows report booming demand, the shift is not universally popular, with some communities pushing back to "bring back the boom." Some cities are compromising by integrating drones into their traditional fireworks displays for an enhanced spectacle.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar is experiencing its weakest start to a year in half a century, a trend accelerated by President Trump's trade policies and fiscal uncertainty, according to Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff. The dollar's decline, which makes imports and foreign travel more expensive for Americans, is fueled by investor concerns over trade wars, U.S. budget deficits, and the nation's rising debt. Rogoff notes that while a weaker dollar can benefit U.S. exporters by making their goods cheaper, the overall trend signals a potential shift away from the dollar's global dominance.

          <p>Beijing has appointed Xu Qifang, a veteran of the Communist Party's personnel division, as the new executive deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office. This makes him the second-most senior official in the top government body that manages the affairs of the two special administrative regions. Xu, 60, previously served as the deputy chief of the party’s powerful Organisation Department, which oversees appointments of key officials. The appointment signals a personnel shift within the crucial office responsible for implementing Beijing's policies in Hong Kong and Macau.</p>

          <p>The upcoming 2028 Los Angeles Olympics are facing significant challenges, with President Trump's administration potentially weaponizing the event for political purposes. While Trump has pledged support, his administration's hardline immigration policies and antagonism toward California's leadership create an unstable environment. A key concern is the "National Special Security Event" (NSSE) designation, which grants federal agencies like ICE broad latitude, raising fears of crackdowns in a city with a large undocumented population. This political friction, combined with potential travel bans and funding disputes, casts a shadow over the Games.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese state media has issued warnings about the addictive nature of "blind box" toys, urging tighter regulation, but analysts believe market leader Pop Mart will remain resilient. The company, known for its popular Labubu dolls, primarily targets young adults rather than the young children mentioned in the warnings. Furthermore, Pop Mart's rapid international expansion, with overseas sales growing significantly, provides a cushion against potential domestic regulatory headwinds. The "dopamine economy" fueled by the excitement of collecting and the "affordable exclusivity" of the toys continues to drive the company's growth.</p>

          <p>According to Dutch and German intelligence agencies, Russia is engaged in the widespread and intensifying use of banned chemical weapons against Ukrainian forces. The evidence suggests Russian troops are using drones to drop a choking agent, chloropicrin, to force soldiers from trenches before attacking them. Dutch Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans called the trend "concerning" and part of a "large-scale program," urging tougher sanctions against Moscow. The findings, which intelligence officials say are based on their own independent investigations, point to thousands of instances of chemical agent use on the battlefield.</p>

          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network (UKMON) believe that fragments of a small meteor have landed on or around Ben Nevis, the UK's highest mountain. The meteor, which originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, created a bright streak and a loud bang that was witnessed by dozens of people in the Scottish Highlands. Using captured footage and trajectory calculations, UKMON has identified a potential landing area for the meteorites. The organization has appealed to hillwalkers in the vast, mountainous region to keep an eye out for the rare space rocks.</p>

          <p>One year after a historic election win, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government is struggling with a tougher-than-expected political and economic landscape. Starmer's popularity has fallen significantly as major economic promises have failed to materialize, with households still pressured by high inflation and borrowing costs. While the government has secured several international trade deals, it has been plagued by domestic policy U-turns, particularly on welfare, leading to speculation about future tax hikes. The rise of the rival Reform UK party further illustrates a growing public disaffection. (not investment advice)</p>

Authorities have issued evacuation orders for the surrounding area and federal agencies, including the ATF, have been called to investigate. Public records indicate the property, which was licensed by the state but not locally for fireworks storage, is linked to a county sheriff's lieutenant.</p>
