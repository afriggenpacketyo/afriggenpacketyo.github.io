          <p>The 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, the only Black, all-female unit to serve in Europe during World War II, received the Congressional Gold Medal in a ceremony at the U.S. Capitol. Speaker Mike Johnson presented the award to the family of the unit commander, Lt. Col. Charity Adams Earley, in front of over 300 descendants and family members. The battalion, known as the "Six Triple Eight," addressed a backlog of roughly 17 million pieces of mail in three months during their service in 1945, and this honor comes after years of campaigning for recognition of their achievements. This event marks a significant milestone in acknowledging the contributions of Black women in the military, inspiring books, movies, and a renewed passion for service.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shipments of goods from China to the U.S. are sharply declining due to the Trump administration's high tariffs, leading major U.S. retailers to warn about potential supply shortages. U.S. import duties on Chinese products now stand as high as 145%, causing a significant drop in cargo volume at ports like Los Angeles. Retailers had previously rushed to import goods ahead of the tariffs, but now face the prospect of empty shelves and price hikes for consumers. Economists predict COVID-like shortages for consumers and firms reliant on Chinese products, with retailers like Walmart and Target cautioning about potential gaps on store shelves.

          <p>President Trump has continued his practice of publicly criticizing Democrats and the media, assigning new nicknames to his political opponents. He publicly berated Maine's governor for defying his executive order on transgender athletes and clashed with Democrats during his joint address to Congress. Trump also engaged in testy exchanges with reporters, including one from Bloomberg about his tariffs, which he deemed "stupid" questions. Among the new nicknames, Sen. Adam Schiff was dubbed "Watermelon-Head," and Democrats opposing his tariff policies were labeled "PANICANs."</p>

          <p>President Trump marked his 100th day in office with a campaign-style speech in Michigan, highlighting his accomplishments and attacking political rivals. He boasted about a "revolution of common sense" and delivering "profound change," while mocking Joe Biden and criticizing the Federal Reserve's chairman. Trump emphasized progress on immigration, citing a dramatic decrease in illegal border crossings, but softened his stance on auto tariffs after warnings from U.S. carmakers. Despite opinion polls indicating a dip in his approval rating, Trump remains popular among Republican voters, and the Democratic Party is also struggling in polling.</p>

          <p>Point Roberts, Washington, a town heavily reliant on Canadian business, is experiencing significant economic challenges due to the trade war between the U.S. and Canada. Border crossings from Canada have declined substantially, impacting local businesses, and many residents are dual citizens. One business owner cited President Trump's rhetoric and tariffs as major reasons for the drop in Canadian visitors, leading to business closures and concerns about the community's survival. Even if tariffs are reversed, restoring trust with Canadian visitors could be difficult, according to the owner of the Saltwater Cafe.</p>

          <p>The UK government is facing criticism from its climate watchdog, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), for its slow progress in preparing the country for the growing threats of climate change. The CCC's report indicates that progress is either too slow, stalled, or heading in the wrong direction, potentially leaving the UK vulnerable to economic and health impacts. While the government points to investments in flood defenses, the CCC emphasizes the intensifying weather extremes and the need for better preparation. Baroness Brown, chair of the Adaptation Committee at the CCC, expressed concern that the government is not taking the issue seriously enough.</p>

The judge defended the judiciary's nonpartisan nature, emphasizing his oath to discharge duties impartially.

          <p>The Trump administration has partially rolled back some tariffs for carmakers, aiming to alleviate the financial burden of import duties on the U.S. auto industry. Executive orders were signed to remove levies that Ford, General Motors, and others argued would harm U.S. manufacturing by raising production costs. The changes modify tariffs so carmakers paying a 25 percent tariff on auto imports are not subject to other levies, such as those on steel and aluminum. While carmakers welcomed the relaxation, analysts noted that administration policies will still add thousands of dollars to car prices.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order softening some of the automotive tariffs his administration put into place earlier this month. Tariffs of 25% on imported vehicles into the U.S. will continue, but the new measures aim to reduce the overall tariff level on vehicle imports that had resulted from separate levies stacking on top of one another. Under the order, additional 25% tariffs on auto parts that were set to start by May 3 will also still take effect, but vehicles that go through final assembly in the U.S. will be able to qualify for partial reimbursements on those levies for two years.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration plans to ease some tariffs on automakers to ensure the companies aren't hit twice by its tariffs, which now apply a 25% import duty to car parts as well as 25% on steel and aluminum.  The 25% tariff on imported vehicles and auto parts will remain, but automakers won't be subject to the additional 25% import duty on imported steel and aluminum. Reimbursements will also be given to automakers who have already paid the double tariffs, the administration said. Ford CEO Jim Farley expressed support for Mr. Trump's decision to cushion the auto industry from the impact of tariffs.</p>

          <p>Following the Liberal Party's victory in the Canadian election, Prime Minister Mark Carney will continue in his role, addressing key priorities such as the relationship with the U.S. and the economy. The Liberals, however, will form a minority government, requiring them to strike deals with other parties to pass legislation. Carney has pledged to focus on securing Canada's economy amidst U.S. tariff headwinds, including potential tax cuts and streamlined approval processes for energy and mining projects. The new government will also prepare for the upcoming G7 summit in Alberta.</p>
