          <p>President Trump announced a potential 100% tariff on imported semiconductors to encourage domestic manufacturing. The tariff would not apply to companies that commit to building production facilities within the United States. This move follows the 2022 CHIPS Act, which provided subsidies to bolster the U.S. semiconductor industry, and comes amid long-standing national security concerns over reliance on foreign suppliers, particularly from Taiwan. The policy aligns with the administration's broader use of tariffs to promote American manufacturing, a strategy that some economists warn could raise consumer prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A hotel in St. Charles, Illinois, housing Texas Democratic lawmakers was evacuated due to a bomb threat. The Democrats had left Texas to break a quorum and block a Republican-led redistricting bill. No device was found, and everyone returned safely, but the incident has heightened political tensions. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker attributed the threat to a right-wing podcaster who revealed the lawmakers' location and has ordered a state police investigation. The event underscores the escalating conflict over the Texas redistricting effort.</p>

          <p>Six more states—West Virginia, Florida, Colorado, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas—have been granted federal waivers to prohibit the use of SNAP benefits for purchasing junk food like soda and candy. The new rules, effective in 2026, bring the total number of states with such restrictions to twelve. Proponents, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., argue the policy will improve public health by encouraging healthier food choices among the 42 million Americans receiving food assistance. However, some medical experts question the move's effectiveness, stating there is no clear evidence that restricting access will combat chronic health conditions.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles FC has officially introduced South Korean forward Son Heung-min, signing him from Tottenham Hotspur for a reported MLS record transfer fee of $26 million. The 33-year-old star is expected to significantly boost LAFC's performance on the field and expand its global brand, particularly within the large Korean community in Los Angeles and across Asia. Son, who remains a world-class attacker, stated his primary goal is to win trophies with the club. His arrival is seen as a major strategic move for both LAFC and the league, building on the foundation set by previous star Carlos Vela.</p>

          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, predicts a record number of 18-year-old domestic students will be accepted into their first-choice universities this year, even if they narrowly miss their grades. This trend is attributed to universities seeking financial stability from three-year UK undergraduates amid uncertainty surrounding international student enrollment. The development comes as tuition fees in England and Wales are set to rise for the 2025-26 academic year. Experts suggest that the financial pressures on universities have made them more eager to fill their courses, creating a competitive environment that benefits applicants.</p>

          <p>Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani showcased his dual-threat capabilities with a dominant pitching performance and a home run in a game against the St. Louis Cardinals. Ohtani pitched four innings, allowing only one run and striking out a season-high eight batters, while also hitting his 39th homer of the season. Despite his efforts, the Dodgers' bullpen could not secure the win, giving up four runs in the final five innings, leading to a 5-3 loss. The article highlights the immense challenge of excelling as both a pitcher and a hitter, a feat not consistently achieved since Babe Ruth over a century ago.</p>

          <p>The quantity of empty homes in England is increasing, with over 700,000 properties currently vacant, including more than 264,000 classified as long-term empty. This growing issue exacerbates the nation's housing shortage and creates problems for local communities, such as crime and neglect, as exemplified by a resident's experience in Bristol. Housing charities view these empty properties as a missed opportunity to house the homeless, and some are working to renovate them for that purpose. Local government associations are calling for stronger legal powers to take over and repurpose vacant homes more easily.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is anticipated to cut its main interest rate from 4.25% to 4%, marking the fifth reduction since last August and bringing borrowing costs to their lowest point in over two years.

The decision comes despite UK inflation currently standing at 3.6%, above the Bank's 2% target. However, signs of a cooling labor market, including falling payroll numbers and slower wage growth, may be influencing the expected rate change. (not investment advice)</p>

Evidence suggests a precarious settlement, akin to a camp, existed within the devastated city until the 5th century. Researchers believe these inhabitants, unable to relocate, lived in the upper floors of buried structures and scavenged for valuable materials. This discovery challenges the long-held belief that the site was completely abandoned after the cataclysmic event. It provides a new perspective on the immediate aftermath and long-term human response to one of history's most famous natural disasters.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that President Trump consistently projects his own actions onto his opponents, particularly concerning the concept of "rigging." The article asserts that while Trump falsely claims elections were rigged against him, his administration is actively attempting to rig future outcomes through various means. Examples cited include pressuring states like Texas for mid-decade redistricting, attempting to manipulate federal economic data, and using executive power to impose tariffs in a manner the author claims usurps Congressional authority. The piece concludes that these actions demonstrate a pattern of undermining democratic norms and institutions for political gain.</p>

He did not face a ball but managed to run four times before his partner was dismissed, resulting in a narrow six-run victory for India.

          <p>New research published in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests that the true death toll from the January Eaton and Palisades fires in Los Angeles County may be far higher than official figures. The study estimates there were 440 "excess deaths" during the fire period, compared to the official count of 31. Researchers argue that official counts often miss fatalities caused by indirect effects like poor air quality and disruptions to healthcare services. This model-based analysis highlights the hidden public health consequences of climate-driven disasters and the difficulty in quantifying their full impact on a population.</p>

The images starkly contrast the utter devastation following the deployment of the "Little Boy" and "Fat Man" bombs with the vibrant, rebuilt metropolises that stand now. The bombings resulted in the deaths of an estimated 210,000 people by the end of 1945 and led to Japan's surrender in World War II. At a commemorative ceremony, Hiroshima's mayor spoke of the lessons learned and warned against the rising threat of nuclear conflict in the modern world.</p>

          <p>E.l.f. Beauty reported a 30% decline in net income for its fiscal first quarter, a drop the company attributes to the impact of new U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. The cosmetics company, which sources a majority of its products from China, saw its profit fall to $33.3 million. Citing the volatility of the tariff situation, E.l.f. declined to provide a full-year financial forecast. Despite the profit decrease and slowing sales growth, the company's revenue and adjusted earnings per share still managed to beat Wall Street's expectations, demonstrating some resilience in a challenging consumer and trade environment.

          <p>Florida's largest utility, Florida Power & Light (FPL), has petitioned state regulators for a nearly $10 billion rate hike over the next four years. If approved, environmental groups claim it would be the largest utility increase in U.S. history. FPL argues the funds are necessary to ensure grid reliability, diversify energy sources with solar and battery facilities, and reduce long-term fuel costs. However, consumer advocates are pushing back, arguing the hike would exacerbate the state's affordability crisis and disproportionately funnel profits to shareholders, placing an undue burden on residents.
