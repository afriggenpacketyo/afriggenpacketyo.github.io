          <p>Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, facing International Criminal Court charges for crimes against humanity, remains a popular figure despite his arrest and extradition to The Hague. This New York Times article details how his arrest has polarized the Philippines, influencing the upcoming midterm elections. While some Filipinos support the investigation, many of Duterte's followers view him as a victim of political persecution by the current president. His daughter, Sara Duterte, has seen her approval ratings rise amid the controversy, positioning her as a potential presidential candidate, and the case has become a rallying point for his supporters, who demand his return.</p>

Despite political promises to reduce net migration, figures have remained historically high, becoming a key issue in the EU referendum. Brexit aimed to give the government control over immigration, but net migration figures have continued to fluctuate, prompting ongoing debate and policy adjustments.</p>

          <p>The United Nations is utilizing water-based cooling systems in its headquarters to combat rising global temperatures, drawing water from the East River to cool its New York complex, a system that has been in place since the 1950s. This energy-efficient mechanism is being highlighted by energy experts as a viable alternative to conventional air conditioning. The UN also employs similar systems in Geneva and Copenhagen, using water from Lake Geneva and seawater, respectively, to reduce electricity consumption for cooling. Despite the benefits, such systems are not widely adopted due to coordination challenges and the need for market aggregation.</p>

Despite assurances from committee leaders, some Republicans are prepared to oppose the bill if the provision remains, highlighting divisions within the party over abortion-related issues.

Despite only 7% of households owning ACs, India is the world's fastest-growing AC market, potentially tripling electricity production to meet demand.

          <p>Fresh & Ready Foods, based in San Fernando, CA, has voluntarily recalled several premade food items after federal regulators discovered a strain of listeria on its equipment linked to an outbreak first identified last year. The recalled products, sold under the Fresh & Ready Foods, City Point Market Fresh Food to Go, and Fresh Take Crave Away brands, were distributed in California, Nevada, Arizona, and Washington. The company initiated the recall as a precautionary measure, although no illnesses have been directly linked to the recalled food. The outbreak was originally identified in 2024, with at least eight people sickened in California and two in Nevada.</p>
