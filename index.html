        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of consumers are turning to "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services to finance their grocery purchases, which may indicate a shift in consumer habits or, more worryingly, financial strain. This trend raises questions about the underlying health of the economy, as it suggests that some individuals are struggling to afford basic necessities without resorting to short-term loans. While BNPL options can offer flexibility, their increased usage for everyday expenses like groceries could be a sign of deeper financial instability for households. The trend is being closely watched by economists as a potential indicator of broader economic challenges.</p>

          <p>Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has announced his intention to request a vote of confidence in parliament following the victory of conservative nationalist Karol Nawrocki in the presidential election. Nawrocki's win represents a significant setback for Tusk's centrist government, which has been working to strengthen Poland's pro-European orientation. The vote of confidence will test the stability of Tusk's coalition government and its ability to pursue its agenda in the face of growing opposition.

He has embraced this status and used it as motivation throughout his career. Off the court, Curry is involved in various business ventures and philanthropic efforts, including his nonprofit Eat.

          <p>Britain's defence review outlines ambitious plans to transform the armed forces and prepare for potential war, but achieving these goals will require increased funding beyond the current commitment of 2.5% of GDP. The review welcomes the government's ambition to spend 3% by 2034 but suggests that a faster pace may be necessary given the turbulent global landscape. Experts argue that even the government's commitment to building new attack submarines will require an increase in defence spending to at least 3% of GDP. The review identifies Russia as an immediate threat and China as a sophisticated challenge, emphasizing the need for a revolution in military strategy.</p>

However, the two sides remain deeply divided on how to end the war, with Ukraine insisting on a full and unconditional ceasefire and Russia rejecting this demand. Russia prefers to talk about "lasting peace" but continues to demand that Ukraine withdraw from its four partly occupied regions and recognize the annexation of Crimea. Despite the limited progress, the agreement to swap prisoners offers a glimmer of hope for future negotiations.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer believes that shares of off-price retailer TJX are undervalued and represent a buying opportunity. He argues that the stock was unfairly punished despite the company's strong first-quarter performance, where it beat expectations for both revenue and earnings. Cramer highlights TJX's ability to maintain low prices even as other retailers are forced to raise them, making it a standout in a challenging retail landscape. JPMorgan analyst Matthew Boss also raised the firm's price target for TJX, citing confidence in the company's continued market share gains. (not investment advice)</p>
