          <p>Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, and other Wall Street figures are expressing concerns about President Trump's tariffs, warning they could lead to higher inflation and slow the U.S. economy. Dimon stated that tariffs will likely increase inflation and potentially cause a recession. Bill Ackman criticized the tariffs as launching an "economic nuclear war," predicting negative impacts on business investment and international relations. Stanley Druckenmiller voiced opposition to tariffs exceeding 10%, and Dan Loeb highlighted conceptual errors in Trump's tariff formula, urging a resolution based on judgment rather than ideology.

          <h2>Understanding Market Circuit Breakers Amid Stock Price Drops</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exchanges implement trading halts, known as circuit breakers, to prevent market crashes during rapid stock price declines. These halts are triggered when the S&P 500 falls by specific percentages during regular trading hours. There are three levels of circuit breakers: 7%, 13%, and 20% drops, each leading to a 15-minute pause or a suspension of trading for the remainder of the day. The use of circuit breakers aims to allow investors a moment to reassess and prevent panic selling in times of extreme market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has addressed the significance of his consistent choice of wearing purple ties. Powell stated that he prefers purple because it avoids the political symbolism associated with red or blue ties, emphasizing the Federal Reserve's non-political stance. He stressed that the Fed operates autonomously from the White House and makes decisions about monetary policy without political interference. Powell's comments underscore the importance of maintaining the central bank's independence and impartiality.</p>

          <p>A recent poll reveals that most Americans enjoy reading and want to read more, but it's not a top priority. While a majority believe reading is a useful way to learn and relax, other activities like streaming, social media, and spending time with family take precedence. Women and those with higher education are more likely to prioritize reading. Thrillers are the most popular genre, particularly among women and older adults, while men tend to favor nonfiction and historical nonfiction.</p>

          <p>As markets react to President Trump's tariff announcements, experts are addressing questions about the impact on stocks, tariffs, and pensions. A stock market index reflects the total value of publicly listed companies, with larger companies having more weight. Market downturns can affect pensions, but long-term pension investing mitigates the impact. Tariffs are unpopular in the U.S. and could lead to higher prices for consumers. While the situation is complex, it is rational to try to maximize profits and level the playing field. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners can often negotiate home equity loan closing costs to reduce upfront expenses. Negotiating lender-controlled costs like origination fees and title fees is easier than negotiating fixed fees like recording fees. Comparing quotes from multiple lenders and being prepared to ask for discounts can lead to savings. However, it's important to approach negotiations respectfully and be patient throughout the process. (not investment advice)</p>
