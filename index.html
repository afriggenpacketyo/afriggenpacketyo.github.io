          <p>To address China's declining birth rate and bolster its scientific talent, Shanghai has launched a new subsidy program. The initiative, starting with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, provides a one-time research grant of 50,000 yuan (about $7,000) to female researchers under 40 who have recently returned from maternity leave. While the initial scope is limited, the program is seen as a positive step toward supporting women in science and encouraging childbirth among highly educated professionals. This dual-purpose policy aims to create a more "birth-friendly society" while retaining valuable expertise in crucial research sectors.</p>

          <p>An American woman recently released from Taliban custody has issued a dire warning about the health of an elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, who remain imprisoned in Afghanistan. Faye Hall, who was detained with them, stated the couple is "literally dying" due to harsh conditions, malnutrition, and lack of adequate medical care. The couple, who have lived in Afghanistan for years and ran a charity, were arrested in February and still do not know the reason for their detention. International bodies like the UN have called their detention inhumane, raising urgent concerns for their survival.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California legislature has approved a bill that would prohibit most law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from wearing masks that conceal their identities while on duty. The measure, now awaiting the governor's signature, was proposed in response to recent immigration raids where agents covered their faces, causing public fear and confusion. Proponents argue the ban is necessary for transparency and accountability, while opponents, including law enforcement agencies, claim it would endanger officers. The bill allows for exceptions for undercover operations, medical masks, and certain tactical gear.</p>

          <p>Several NATO countries, including Denmark, France, and Germany, are deploying troops and fighter jets to reinforce the alliance's eastern flank. This move follows a significant incident where multiple Russian drones entered Polish airspace, an act Poland's prime minister described as the "closest we have been to open conflict since World War Two." The new mission, named Eastern Sentry, aims to bolster Poland's air defense and send a clear message of solidarity and deterrence. The United States has reaffirmed its commitment to defend all NATO territory amid heightened tensions across Europe.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Cristiano Ronaldo's Potential US Return is Strategically Timed for the World Cup</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article explores the potential reasons behind Cristiano Ronaldo's rumored return to play in the United States after a 12-year absence. The author connects this development to the upcoming World Cup in the US and a shifting political climate under Donald Trump, suggesting it could be a strategic move for both Ronaldo's brand and FIFA. The piece reflects on Ronaldo's long absence, which coincided with sexual assault allegations that have since been legally resolved without charges. A return could signal a clearing of legal and public relations hurdles, providing a major boost to the American-hosted tournament.</p>

          <p>Beijing has condemned the transit of American and British warships through the Taiwan Strait, labeling the mission as "harassment and provocation." The Chinese military's Eastern Theatre Command stated it tracked the vessels and that the action undermines regional peace and stability. This event follows a similar passage by Canadian and Australian warships a week prior, which also drew a sharp rebuke from China. The US and its allies describe these transits as routine operations in international waters, intended to uphold freedom of navigation.</p>

          <p>A concrete wall erected as part of the border demarcation between Armenia and Azerbaijan has split the Armenian village of Kirants, displacing some residents and cutting farmers off from their land. The demarcation, based on old Soviet maps, followed Azerbaijan's 2023 takeover of Nagorno-Karabakh and has been a source of political crisis in Armenia. While the wall has brought a halt to cross-border shooting and increased a sense of security for some, many villagers feel a profound sense of loss and depression. The situation in Kirants highlights the complex human cost of resolving long-standing territorial conflicts.</p>

          <p>In this commentary, Rebecca Solnit contextualizes the recently revealed Jeffrey Epstein birthday album by arguing that the sexual exploitation of young girls was deeply normalized in mainstream culture before the rise of modern feminism. The author cites examples from 1970s and 80s films, the music industry's "baby groupie" culture, and photography that blurred lines between art and exploitation. The article posits that the sexual revolution, without a feminist framework, often served male desires at the expense of young women. It concludes that feminist movements were crucial in challenging these norms and establishing the principles of consent and power dynamics.</p>
