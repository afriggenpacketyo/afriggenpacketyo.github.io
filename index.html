          <p>A psychiatrist with experience working with young adults shares five parenting rules to help navigate the complexities of raising children. The rules emphasize trusting parental instincts, following cultural traditions, focusing on the individual child's interests, prioritizing enjoyment over strict developmental milestones, and being authentic rather than striving for perfection. The psychiatrist suggests that parents should trust their own judgment and cultural heritage rather than relying on influencers or clickbait. Ultimately, the article suggests that love and attention are the most important factors in raising children, and that parents should focus on being themselves and enjoying the journey. Optimism about the future of children is present in the advice. </p>

          <p>Job seekers are facing a challenging hiring environment, described as a 'Glass Wall,' where numerous job postings exist, but applications seem to yield no results. Blake Isaacs, a marketing professional laid off in January, coined the term after sending over 1,000 applications with little success. Experts recommend strategies to overcome this obstacle, including networking, tailoring applications, and leveraging LinkedIn to connect with recruiters and hiring managers.

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has cautioned Asian nations about the growing threat China poses to Taiwan, urging them to increase defense spending and collaborate with the United States to deter potential conflict. Hegseth characterized China as seeking regional hegemony and highlighted its military buildup aimed at potentially altering the balance of power in Asia, referencing a speculated 2027 deadline for military readiness to invade Taiwan. China's embassy in Singapore responded by accusing the US of being the primary source of regional instability, citing military deployments and reconnaissance activities in the South China Sea, as the US urges countries to spend more on their own defense. Hegseth's speech underscored the US commitment to its allies, promising continued support and collaboration to maintain stability in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels. As of May 17, Iran possessed 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, an increase of 294.9 pounds since February, with approximately 92.5 pounds being theoretically enough to produce an atomic bomb if enriched to 90%. The IAEA has expressed serious concern over Iran being the only non-nuclear-weapon state to produce such material, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a statement that Iran is determined to complete its nuclear weapons program. The IAEA reiterated its urgent call for Iran to fully cooperate with its investigation into uranium traces discovered at undeclared sites, amid heightened tensions between Iran and the West.</p>

The Trump administration's anti-vaccine stances have created a culture of fear among scientists, with the National Institutes of Health terminating partnerships and funding for HIV and vaccine research. Researchers first noted the rashes in 2022, and recent studies confirmed the side effect is real and generalizable, but the cause is unknown. Despite the setback, researchers remain hopeful that they will find a solution, such as tweaking the vaccine recipe or combining the mRNA approach with another technology, but they may not be able to eliminate skin reactions entirely.</p>

          <p>The Army is preparing to implement Defense Department guidance to expel transgender service members, according to internal documents. The new directives instruct personnel to intentionally misgender transgender troops and identify those with gender dysphoria based on various criteria. The policy is a reversal from the 2016 policy, and veterans of the armed forces fear that the new changes are worse than the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy. The Army maintains that it will treat all soldiers with dignity and respect, but the new policies are in line with President Trump's executive order stating the values of transgender service members are inconsistent with military cohesion.</p>

Saylor argues that embracing bitcoin by state and media actors will strengthen its decentralized ideals. Despite the corporate world's resistance, Saylor believes the market's reaction to Trump Media and GameStop may stem from structural financing dynamics rather than skepticism toward bitcoin itself, and notes the importance of diversification and protocol.</p>

          <p>A replicated monument to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin has been reinstalled in a Moscow metro station, sparking debate. The original statue, removed in the 1960s during de-Stalinization, depicted Stalin surrounded by admiring figures. While President Vladimir Putin has acknowledged the tragic period of Stalinist purges, an estimated 105 statues honoring the dictator have been erected since he came to power. The restoration has elicited mixed reactions, with some praising it as art and others condemning it due to Stalin's brutal legacy, with some questioning whether the Putin regime has a vision set in the stone of that subway station.</p>
