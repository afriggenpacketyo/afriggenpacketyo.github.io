          <p>Lyle Menendez was denied parole on Friday, ensuring he remains incarcerated alongside his brother Erik, whose parole was also rejected a day prior. Parole Commissioner Julie Garland acknowledged Lyle's exemplary prison conduct, including program work and positive relationships, but cited persistent anti-social personality traits like deception, minimization, and rule-breaking, particularly illegal cellphone use, as key reasons for the denial. The board did give significant weight to his youth at the time of the 1989 murders and the dysfunctional home environment, where the brothers claimed years of sexual abuse by their father. Both Menendez brothers, resentenced to 50 years to life, will be eligible for re-evaluation in three years, though an administrative review could occur within 18 months, with their family expressing disappointment but not discouragement, and Governor Newsom also considering a clemency request.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, has announced a plan for mass deportations of asylum seekers arriving in the UK via small boats, asserting that a "massive crisis" threatens national security and could lead to public disorder. His proposals include withdrawing Britain from the European Convention on Human Rights, banning asylum claims for small boat arrivals, and detaining individuals on disused RAF bases for return to countries like Afghanistan and Eritrea if agreements are reached. Farage believes that clearly communicated detention and deportation will quickly stop the crossings, despite potential legal challenges. Both Labour and Conservative parties have criticized the plan as "pie in the sky" or recycled ideas, as the government faces mounting pressure over record asylum applications, with small boat arrivals increasing by 38% from the previous year.</p>

          <p>The Cheetah Lounge, a nearly 50-year-old iconic Atlanta strip club in Midtown, is slated for closure and redevelopment into a high-rise apartment building with ground-floor retail. This establishment, a fixture in Atlanta's nightlife since 1977 and employing around 300 people, is one of the last such venues in the area. Georgia Tech has been incrementally acquiring properties along Spring Street, with the Cheetah being among the final sales. A company called Core Spaces plans to transform the site into a high-rise apartment with retail on the ground floor, aiming for completion by 2029. While customers express sadness over the loss of jobs and a popular entertainment spot, city council members and Georgia Tech students largely view the development as a positive step for increasing much-needed housing options in the expanding city.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an order blocking the Trump administration from cutting federal funding to dozens of "sanctuary" cities and counties across the U.S., including major hubs like Los Angeles and Chicago. This expands an earlier ruling from April, which deemed President Trump's attempt to freeze funding for local governments limiting cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement unconstitutional. The cities argue that these policies are an abuse of power and violate the Tenth Amendment, allowing local governments to choose not to assist ICE, fostering trust between police and residents regardless of immigration status. The Trump administration asserts that sanctuary policies hinder federal law enforcement and make it harder to arrest undocumented immigrants.</p>

          <p>Millions of dollars are pouring into campaigns surrounding a November ballot measure in California aimed at redrawing congressional districts. This effort, notably backed by a $10 million donation from GOP donor Charles Munger Jr. to oppose the measure, seeks to replace independent commission-drawn districts with new ones that would boost Democratic representation. California Democrats initiated this move to counter Texas Republicans' and former President Trump's efforts to increase GOP congressional members. Proponents argue the ballot measure is America's best chance to fight back against perceived election rigging, while opponents accuse Munger of covertly aiding the GOP. The battle highlights a national mid-decade redistricting struggle ahead of next year's midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Virginia leaders from both Republican and Democratic parties have condemned a racist sign targeting Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears during a protest outside an Arlington County school board meeting. The sign, displayed during a transgender rights rally where Earle-Sears was speaking about bathroom policy, read: "Hey Winsome, if trans can’t share your bathroom, then Blacks can’t share my water fountain." Governor Glenn Youngkin and Attorney General Jason Miyares, both Republicans, denounced the sign, as did Democratic state Senator Ghazala Hashmi and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who called it "racist, abhorrent and unacceptable." The incident highlights ongoing tensions surrounding transgender policies and racial sensitivity in political discourse.</p>

          <p>Malaysia has implemented a ban on exports of unprocessed rare earth metals, aiming to keep these globally prized raw materials onshore for investment in downstream industries. This strategic move signals Malaysia's intent to prioritize its own development needs and exercise geoeconomic agency. The country's Minister of Investment, Trade and Industry stated that foreign investors are welcome if their projects involve local mineral processing, job creation, and technology transfers, allowing processed rare earth metals to be exported. Analysts believe Malaysia's existing processing capabilities, coupled with the US's urgent search for non-Chinese rare earth sources, position the nation to significantly integrate into global supply chains.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong has emerged as the leading listing venue for mainland Chinese companies, surpassing the US in the first eight months of 2025. This marks a significant milestone, with 46 Chinese companies raising US$16.5 billion via IPOs in Hong Kong, compared to 16 listings raising US$740.9 million in the US. The shift is attributed to Hong Kong's more active capital market, higher average share jumps on trading debuts (19.4% vs. 3.6% in the US), and ongoing US-China rivalry, which creates delisting risks for Chinese stocks in the US. This trend highlights Hong Kong's recovery and its growing appeal amidst uncertain regulatory prospects in American markets. (not investment advice)</p>

He was previously indicted for a March 2024 sexual assault and now faces new charges related to a December 2023 incident, where a court employee was found passed out and alone in his chambers for two hours. Prosecutors allege Corona lied to the FBI about his whereabouts and tried to convince a motorcycle dealership employee to falsify company records to support a false alibi. Corona, who retired in April 2024 before the initial indictments, could face up to 80 years in prison if convicted, highlighting a serious breach of public trust and judicial ethics.</p>

          <p>A new European study published in Science Advances offers compelling evidence that air pollution stemming from every stage of oil and gas activity disproportionately harms Black, Latino, Indigenous, and Asian Americans compared to white Americans. This pollution is linked to an estimated 91,000 premature deaths, 10,350 preterm births, and 216,000 new cases of childhood asthma annually across the U.S., with California ranking as the most affected state. The greatest harm originates from "downstream" pollution, like vehicle and factory exhaust. Researchers attribute these stark racial disparities to a legacy of zoning practices, such as "redlining," which relegated certain populations to live near pollution hotspots. The article highlights the critical need to address environmental injustice and accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels.</p>

Ingalls Shipbuilding, the largest supplier of U.S. Navy surface combatants and the largest manufacturing employer in Mississippi, urged its 8,000 employees to shelter in place during the incident, which saw the alleged shooter arrested about an hour and a half later.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has released over 300 pages of redacted transcripts from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's two-day interview with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell regarding the Jeffrey Epstein case. Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year sentence, was interviewed under immunity but without a cooperation deal, as she appeals her conviction. She denied introducing Prince Andrew to Epstein, claimed a famous photo of them was "fake," and stated she "never witnessed" President Trump in inappropriate settings. Maxwell also expressed disbelief that Epstein died by suicide, speculating on an "internal situation" if it was murder. The release follows pressure for transparency and aims to shed more light on Epstein's network.</p>

          <p>An explosion and subsequent fire at Smitty’s Supply, an automotive supply company just north of Roseland, Louisiana, sent large flames and a towering plume of thick black smoke into the sky, prompting evacuations within a one-mile radius and for a nearby elementary school. Miraculously, no injuries were reported in the incident at the facility, which employs approximately 400 people and distributes high-performance lubricants and automotive parts. Tangipahoa Parish President Robby Miller described the absence of casualties as a "godsend." Officials are actively investigating the cause of the fire and assessing any significant chemical risks, with the Department of Environmental Quality and the Environmental Protection Agency on site to monitor the situation and guide the extensive firefighting and containment efforts.</p>

          <p>The FBI conducted searches at the Bethesda, Maryland home and Washington D.C. office of former National Security Adviser John Bolton, confirming "court authorized activity" related to a classified documents investigation. President Trump claimed he learned of the raid from TV, calling Bolton a "lowlife" and "unpatriotic." This action follows Bolton's 2020 memoir, "The Room Where It Happened," which was critical of Trump and led to a Justice Department inquiry into classified information disclosure. Trump's administration previously tried to stop the book's publication and sued Bolton for profits, with a judge noting Bolton "likely jeopardized national security." The Biden administration later closed the probe, but Trump's second term has seen renewed pressure on critics.</p>

          <p>Polling data in the UK indicates a growing political divide between young women and young men, with women aged 16-29 increasingly identifying as left-wing, while men in the same age group lean more towards the right. A 2025 survey showed 20% of young British women as left-wing compared to 13% of young men, with young women also showing stronger support for the Green Party. Researchers suggest factors like higher education rates among women, which correlate with liberal attitudes, and social media's role in offering alternatives to traditional politics. Experts also propose that young men's adherence to traditional masculinity in a changing world may draw them to populist, radical right parties.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered National Guard personnel patrolling Washington D.C. to be armed, reversing a previous decision and escalating the Trump administration's crime crackdown in the capital. President Trump, who took control of the city's police force and deployed approximately 2,000 troops, declared the mission brought "total safety" to DC and hinted at expanding it to Chicago. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson condemned the potential deployment as "uncoordinated, uncalled for, and unsound." While Attorney General Pam Bondi reported over 700 arrests and seized firearms, local officials question the necessity of federal intervention, and polls show the deployment is deeply unpopular with city residents.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration touts over 700 arrests in Washington D.C. as part of its crime crackdown, criminal justice experts caution that arrest numbers alone are not the best indicator of public safety. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro pledged to aggressively prosecute arrests, which have increased significantly compared to previous years. However, experts like Jenn Rolnick Borchetta of the ACLU question the validity and long-term impact of these arrests, noting that many may not lead to charges or convictions. Policing experts describe this "flooding the zone" strategy as potentially leading to more arrests for minor infractions and increasing the risk of police uses of force, rather than fundamentally deterring violent crime.</p>

Abrego Garcia cannot be deported to El Salvador due to fear of gang persecution, a ruling an immigration judge made in 2019.

While local businesses and some residents praise the reduced visible encampments, advocates argue that criminalizing homelessness merely cycles individuals through the system without solving underlying issues like mental health, addiction, and housing shortages. Despite a drop in visible tents, the city's overall homeless population has continued to rise, raising questions about the policy's long-term effectiveness.</p>

While some cafe owners, like Hyun Sung-joo, have resorted to blocking power outlets due to high rents, others cater to Cagongjok with specific amenities.
