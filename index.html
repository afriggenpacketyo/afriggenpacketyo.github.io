          <p>Diplomatic officials from the U.S. and Europe are attempting to de-escalate the Israel-Iran conflict within a two-week timeframe set by President Trump.  Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with European counterparts in Geneva, expressing Iran's willingness to continue discussions.  However, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's ultimate decision remains uncertain, and the ongoing Israeli airstrikes and potential U.S. involvement complicate the situation. The U.S. proposed allowing Iran a civilian nuclear program in exchange for halting uranium enrichment on its soil.</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf's 11-month tenure as Reform UK chairman was marked by both achievements and controversy.  Former colleagues described his management style as demanding and lacking empathy, leading to strained relationships and abrupt dismissals.  Similar issues were reported during his time at Velocity Black, a luxury concierge business he previously founded. While some praised his drive and vision, others highlighted his controlling behavior and lack of empathy. Yusuf denies these claims and attributes the negative feedback to resentment over his success.</p>
