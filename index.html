          <p>A shooting at CrossPointe Community Church in Wayne, Michigan, resulted in one person injured and the death of the alleged gunman. The suspect, identified as Brian Anthony Browning, arrived at the church armed with a long gun and handgun, firing at the building from outside. A parishioner struck the suspect with their vehicle, and church staff members, including a security guard, engaged and killed the attacker. The wounded security guard was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, and police are investigating the motive, noting the suspect's mother is a church member and that he had no prior criminal record. </p>

          <p>The UK government has pledged to allocate 5% of its GDP to national security by 2035, aligning with a new NATO target. This commitment includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for defense-related areas such as resilience and security. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the importance of economic security as a component of national security. The government anticipates reaching 4.1% of GDP spending on national security by 2027, with the "resilience" element achieved by the following year, and the full 3.5% for core defense by 2035, but the exact funding sources for this goal remain unspecified.</p>

          <p>Iran launched a missile attack on the United States’ Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. According to early reports, all Iranian missiles were intercepted, and there were no American casualties or damage. President Trump stated that Iran's response was "very weak" and that he hoped Iran would now pursue peace and harmony in the region. This limited response, coupled with Trump's inclination to hold fire, suggests a potential de-escalation of tensions, reminiscent of the aftermath of the Soleimani killing in 2020.</p>

          <p>The US Supreme Court has overturned a lower court order, allowing the Trump administration to resume deportations of migrants to countries other than their homelands. The ruling reverses the requirement for the government to provide migrants with a "meaningful opportunity" to express potential risks in being deported to a third country. The three liberal justices dissented, accusing the government of unlawful conduct and undermining due process. This decision marks another victory for the Trump administration's efforts to pursue mass deportations.</p>

          <p>Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton reportedly tore his Achilles tendon during the team’s NBA Finals Game 7 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. The injury, which occurred in the first quarter, is expected to sideline him for the 2025-26 season.

          <p>A boat capsized on Lake Tahoe during a fast-moving thunderstorm, resulting in seven fatalities and one person still missing.

          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration permission to resume deporting migrants to third countries without adhering to additional due process requirements previously mandated by a district court judge. This order effectively reinstates expedited removals of unauthorized immigrants to countries other than their own, with planeloads already sent to El Salvador, Guatemala, South Sudan, and Libya. Justice Sotomayor, along with Justices Kagan and Jackson, issued a strong dissent, accusing the court of condoning lawless behavior and undermining fundamental principles of due process.

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran launched missiles against the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. Beyond direct attacks, Tehran could target U.S. military assets across the Middle East, close the Strait of Hormuz, or engage in asymmetric warfare, including terror and cyber attacks. U.S. military bases in Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan, Kuwait, Egypt, and Iraq are potential targets. The Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for global oil transport, could also be a point of leverage for Iran, though such action would carry significant economic and retaliatory risks.</p>

          <p>Approximately 80 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's planned changes to the benefits system. The MPs are concerned about proposals to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments to save £5 billion a year by 2030. The amendment expresses concerns about the number of people expected to be pushed into relative poverty, a lack of consultation, and an inadequate impact assessment on the consequences on the jobs market and people's health. The level of support for the amendment indicates a potential rebellion facing ministers, with a vote on the government's bill due to take place on July 1.</p>

Repkina met Hargrove online, and their whirlwind romance led to an engagement, but she was unaware of Hargrove's ongoing relationship with Chavez. As the relationships became more complex, Chavez issued an ultimatum, demanding Hargrove choose between her and Repkina, leading to Repkina's death. Hargrove was initially convicted of the murder, though the conviction was overturned on appeal due to a flawed search warrant, he was reconvicted in a new trial in June 2025 and resentenced to life in prison.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, officials and experts have given conflicting statements regarding the extent of the damage. While Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed Iran's nuclear program was "obliterated," Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine stated that a full damage assessment would take time. Satellite images show damage to the Fordo, Isfahan, and Natanz facilities, but the true extent of the degradation, especially underground, remains unclear. Experts emphasize the need for IAEA inspectors to access the sites to ascertain the full impact.</p>

Oil prices have already climbed since Israel began threatening to strike Iran's nuclear facilities, and an escalating conflict could further increase energy costs for Americans. There is a risk of disruption to global commerce, particularly through the Strait of Hormuz, which could lead to higher inflation and borrowing costs. The strikes also put American soldiers in harm's way, and there is a possibility that Iran may now see a nuclear weapon as more indispensable for its security.</p>
