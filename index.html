          <p>House Republicans are pushing forward with legislation to enact President Trump’s domestic agenda, including tax cuts, Medicaid changes, and food stamp adjustments, despite Democratic opposition. The "big beautiful bill," as Trump calls it, faces internal GOP dissent regarding the extent of Medicaid cuts and state and local tax deduction limits, threatening its passage. The bill also faces opposition in the Senate from Republicans concerned about its fiscal responsibility, and Democrats are criticizing the healthcare provisions. The article highlights the challenges Republican leaders face in uniting their party to pass this sweeping legislation before the Memorial Day recess.</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation by British maritime authorities found that the Bayesian superyacht, which sank off Sicily last year killing seven people, likely capsized due to intense wind gusts. The report emphasizes the yacht's tall mast as a contributing factor to its instability in high winds, noting that it increased the vessel's vulnerability to capsizing. The article highlights that a young deckhand delayed waking the captain and instead posted a video of the storm on social media. The investigation also reveals that the boat's operating manual lacked critical data about its vulnerability to capsizing.</p>
