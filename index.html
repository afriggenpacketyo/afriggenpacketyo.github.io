          <h2>Genetic Study Fills Gaps in Indigenous Americans' Ancestry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 02:34:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent DNA study has traced the migration of prehistoric humans from Asia to North and South America, offering insights into the origins of Indigenous groups. The research, published in Science, analyzed genomes from 1,537 individuals across northern Eurasia and the Americas, revealing genetic links between modern Indigenous populations and early settlers. The study also found that early settlers split into isolated groups due to geographical barriers, such as the Amazon rainforest and the Andes, leading to distinct genetic traits, including adaptations to high altitudes. This genetic record is crucial for preserving the legacy of endangered groups like the Kawesqar people of Patagonia.</p>

          <p>Severe storms, including a possible tornado, swept through the Midwest, resulting in at least seven deaths and significant destruction. St. Louis was particularly hard-hit, with numerous homes affected and widespread power outages. The storms were part of a larger weather system that also brought tornadoes to Wisconsin, a dust storm to the Chicago area, and a heat wave to Texas. Emergency declarations and curfews were implemented in the most affected areas, with rescue efforts underway to assist those trapped or injured. The National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down in Scott County, resulting in additional fatalities and extensive damage to homes.</p>

          <p>This article from The Guardian outlines the current status of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, highlighting which tariffs are active, paused, or subject to exemptions. While many of the initially proposed tariffs have been scaled back or paused, some remain in effect, including a 10% universal tariff and tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, and China. The White House has made exemptions for goods covered under the USMCA and certain electronics from China. The article notes that Trump continues to threaten additional tariffs on specific industries, leaving the future of trade relations uncertain.</p>

The shots were heard from Deir al Balah, though the source was unknown, amid intense Israeli bombardment overnight. The fighting has prompted some civilians to flee westward, as mediators seek to broker a new temporary truce. Despite the ongoing conflict and high death toll, a decisive victory against Hamas has not been achieved, and the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to deteriorate due to a blockade imposed by Israel.</p>

          <p>Poland is holding presidential elections amid concerns that the pro-European government's reform plans are being blocked by the current president. The election pits left-wing liberal Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by Prime Minister Tusk, against national-conservative Karol Nawrocki, supported by the opposition Law and Justice party. Tusk's government has struggled to implement reforms due to presidential vetoes and a constitutional court filled with PiS supporters, leading to disappointment among voters. The outcome of the election will determine whether the government can advance its agenda, including restoring the rule of law and liberalizing social policies.</p>

When questioned by Peter Doocy about the report's description of him as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory," Biden defended his capabilities and dismissed the special counsel's assessment.

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, causing a dramatic drop in visibility and disrupting travel. The National Weather Service issued a dust storm warning, only the second time their Chicago office has done so, and the first time including the city itself. The storm was caused by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, collecting dust and carrying it into the city. The dust storm caused delays at Midway International Airport and backed up expressways, creating hazardous conditions for drivers. According to the National Weather Service, skies cleared up within 30 to 45 minutes.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs is facing a federal sex trafficking, racketeering, and prostitution case, with his ex-girlfriend Cassandra "Cassie" Ventura's testimony taking center stage. Ventura described years of abuse and coerced sexual acts during their relationship. Prosecutors are using her testimony to build a case that Combs ran a criminal enterprise and coerced her into unwanted sex acts. Combs' attorneys concede that he was abusive but argue that domestic violence is not sex trafficking. The government is trying to prove that Combs used force, fraud, or coercion and that Ventura's consent was not genuine.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates was marked by lavish displays of honor and respect, a stark contrast to the backlash he faces at home.

The trip included extravagant welcoming ceremonies, meetings with friendly audiences, and campaign-style rallies. While some criticized the ethics of accepting gifts, such as a $400 million airplane, Trump's declaration of shifting U.S. policy toward peace and profit was praised.</p>
