          <p>China, the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, has experienced a 1% drop in overall emissions due to its aggressive clean energy initiatives. This decline, reported by Carbon Brief, marks a significant shift as emissions fell despite increased energy use and economic activity. The country has expanded its wind, solar, and nuclear power capabilities, reducing its reliance on coal and gas. This development positions China ahead of schedule in meeting its climate targets and aligns with the Paris climate agreement goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of British mountaineers scaled Mount Everest in under a week using xenon gas to accelerate acclimatization, igniting debate within the mountaineering community. The expedition, organized by Lukas Furtenbach, raises ethical questions about performance enhancement in mountaineering and its impact on traditional climbing practices. The Nepalese government is investigating the use of the gas, which some experts dispute its effectiveness and safety. Critics argue that such methods diminish the achievement of summiting Everest, while Furtenbach plans to offer two-week excursions using xenon gas in the future.</p>

          <p>Scientists are exploring treatments to delay or eliminate menopause, aiming to mitigate health risks associated with estrogen loss. These treatments range from hormone therapy to more invasive procedures like ovarian tissue cryopreservation.

The debate underscores the need to balance medical advancements with societal acceptance of aging.</p>

          <h2>Hells Canyon, Deepest U.S. Gorge, Formed Relatively Recently</h2>

          <p>Hells Canyon, the deepest river gorge in the United States, was likely carved rapidly around 2.1 million years ago due to landscape shifts in Idaho. A new study, analyzing ancient river sediments in canyon caves, revealed the canyon's age. The researchers believe the canyon emerged after a large lake in Idaho drained, leading to increased water flow and canyon formation. The canyon's relatively young age contrasts with the Grand Canyon's older stretches.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs have caused alarm in Japan, a key U.S. ally and export market. The tariffs pose a threat to Japan's economy, prompting Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to describe the situation as a "national crisis." Japan's limited room for maneuver in tariff negotiations, coupled with its strategic reliance on the U.S. for security, constrains its options.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering removing the two-child benefit cap, which restricts means-tested benefits for families with more than two children. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledged the policy has pushed people into poverty but warned that removing it would be costly. The government is expected to announce its decision in the autumn, when it publishes its child poverty strategy.</p>
