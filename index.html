          <p>President Donald Trump concluded his four-day visit to Scotland, engaging in discussions with First Minister John Swinney primarily focused on securing an exemption for Scotch whisky from a 10% US tariff. This tariff significantly impacts the Scottish economy, with whisky exports to the US valued at nearly £1 billion. Beyond trade, the President also opened a new course at his Aberdeenshire golf resort and reiterated his strong opposition to wind turbines, advocating for increased exploitation of North Sea oil and gas. The article captures the dual nature of his trip, combining political diplomacy with personal business interests.</p>

          <p>As the trendy Labubu collectible toy gains popularity, this article highlights its "ancestor," the Monchhichi, and its East German counterpart, the Tiemi. While Monchhichi dolls were a global sensation in the 1980s, their import was banned in communist East Germany. The Tiemi, named after designer Susanne Tieme, was produced in Sonneberg, a historic toy-making town, and became popular across the Eastern Bloc. This piece explores how the Tiemi circumvented authenticity issues by being a distinct, state-produced version, becoming a unique collectible item after German reunification.</p>

          <p>Israel has reversed its policy and allowed more humanitarian aid into Gaza, including food and medicine, following international condemnation over widespread hunger. This article notes that while convoys are moving and air drops have occurred, the UN states the current aid is a mere fraction of what's needed, with pre-war levels being over 500 trucks daily. UNRWA warns that one in five children in Gaza City is malnourished, and over 100 children have died of hunger. The situation remains dire despite Israel's declaration of tactical pauses and efforts to secure aid routes.</p>
