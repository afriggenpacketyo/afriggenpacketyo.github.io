          <p>The struggling Chinese city of Hegang, located in the country's rust belt, is embarking on an ambitious infrastructure project to reverse its economic fortunes. Faced with a declining population and shrinking GDP, the city will begin construction on the 1.2 billion yuan Luobei Airport, scheduled to open in 2027. This investment is part of a broader strategy to leverage Russian trade and new infrastructure to stimulate growth. Experts view this as a significant effort by a smaller city to improve connectivity and overcome the economic challenges posed by inadequate transportation links.</p>

          <p>Despite facing years of stringent U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese technology firm Huawei has successfully pivoted and expanded its business to become a dominant player in the artificial intelligence industry. The company has diversified into numerous complex sectors, including AI chips, data centers, smart cars, and large language models, positioning itself as a formidable competitor to U.S. firms like Nvidia. This strategic shift, initially forced by external pressures, has ironically been bolstered by Chinese state support, turning Huawei into a national champion in the global tech race.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese industries, from electric vehicles to food delivery, are engaged in fierce price wars, driving down costs but creating a complex situation for consumers and the broader economy. While buyers initially benefit from steep discounts and subsidies, these competitive battles can lead to concerns about product quality and safety as companies cut corners. The Chinese government has expressed concern that this "race to the bottom" could harm corporate profits, wages, and tax revenues, and is now vowing to regulate irrational competition to shift the focus from price to technological innovation.</p>

          <p>Toluca secured the Campeón de Campeones 2025 trophy with a 3-1 victory over Club América at Dignity Health Sports Park. Despite an early goal from América's Alejandro Zendejas in the first minute, Toluca responded with goals from Agustín Romero and Paulinho to claim the title. The match, which pitted the winners of the Apertura 2024 and Clausura 2025 tournaments against each other, saw América reduced to ten men after Igor Lichnovsky was sent off. This win continues Toluca's recent success against their rivals, whom they also defeated in the Clausura 2025 final.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling coalition, comprising the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and Komeito, has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament following a tightly contested election. Despite this significant setback, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will not resign, attributing the "harsh result" to voter frustration over rising prices and potential U.S. tariffs. The defeat undermines the coalition's influence, as it follows a loss of majority in the more powerful lower house last year. Analysts note the result could lead to political instability and leadership challenges within the LDP.</p>

          <p>A vehicle was involved in a bizarre and destructive accident in Bohmte, Germany, leaving two people, including a seven-year-old boy, with serious injuries. The car reportedly veered off the road at high speed, crashed through a hedge, and landed on a trampoline in a backyard, striking the child who was playing on it. The impact apparently launched the car into the air, where it became lodged in the attic of a nearby barn approximately three meters off the ground.

Anecdotal reports and small clinical studies suggest that these drugs can improve symptoms like irregular periods, hair loss, and weight gain by enhancing insulin sensitivity and reducing testosterone levels.

          <h2>Poll Finds Declining Support for Trump's Deportation Program as Public Calls for Focus on Economy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that public support for President Trump's large-scale deportation program has fallen, with a majority now disapproving of the policy. The shift appears linked to a perception that the program is targeting more than just dangerous criminals and is being conducted too harshly. The poll also reveals that a large majority of Americans, particularly outside of the president's base, believe the administration should focus more on lowering prices rather than on tariffs or spending cuts. Overall approval for the president has also declined, reflecting growing doubt among the general public. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In one of the deadliest days for civilians seeking aid during the ongoing war, at least 85 Palestinians were killed at various locations across Gaza, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry. The largest number of casualties occurred in northern Gaza near the Zikim crossing, where a U.N. aid convoy encountered massive crowds that came under fire. Witnesses claimed the Israeli military shot into the crowd, while the IDF stated it fired warning shots to remove an "immediate threat." The incident underscores the catastrophic humanitarian crisis and the extreme dangers civilians face when trying to access scarce resources.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' recent struggles continued with a 6-5 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers, completing a season sweep by Milwaukee and marking the Dodgers' tenth defeat in their last twelve games. The loss was compounded by a significant injury concern, as star first baseman Freddie Freeman left the game after being hit by a pitch on his left wrist. While initial X-rays for a fracture were negative, the potential loss of a key player adds to the team's frustration during its worst slump since 2018. The team's defense and bullpen have been notable weak points during the skid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An in-depth analysis suggests the UK's High Speed 2 (HS2) rail project, now billions over budget and years behind schedule, was flawed from the start due to fundamental national challenges. Insiders and experts argue that building major infrastructure on a "small, highly populated, property-owning, democratic island" creates immense hurdles. The project's initial ambition for world-leading speed and frequency drove up costs, while the complex political and planning systems allowed for thousands of expensive changes and delays to appease local and political opposition. These factors raise questions about the UK's ability to execute large-scale projects effectively.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced it will hold a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1984-85 miners' strike. The incident involved thousands of police officers and striking miners clashing outside a coking plant in Rotherham, leading to numerous injuries and the arrests of 95 miners. Those criminal cases later collapsed amid allegations that South Yorkshire Police had falsified evidence. After decades of campaigning, the inquiry aims to finally provide answers and truth for the miners and their communities affected by the historic event.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is set to shutter its primary scientific research arm, the Office of Research and Development (ORD), as part of a broader downsizing of the agency. The ORD provides the foundational scientific analysis for policies on a wide range of environmental hazards, from toxic chemicals to climate change and water pollution. The administration claims the move will save money and better equip the agency for its core mission, while critics argue it will cripple the EPA's ability to use science in its decision-making.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents advice from a parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, identifying "self-connection" as the most crucial skill for a child's success. Self-connection is defined as the ability to understand and trust one's own emotions, needs, and inner voice. The expert argues that this skill builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, and protects mental health. Parents are advised to foster this by validating their child's feelings, welcoming their full personality, and modeling their own emotional awareness, rather than dismissing or micromanaging their child's inner world.</p>
