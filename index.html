        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has frozen approximately $18 billion in federal funding designated for major infrastructure projects in New York City, including the Hudson River Tunnel and Second Avenue Subway. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought stated the hold is to ensure funds are not allocated based on what he termed "unconstitutional DEI principles." This decision was announced amid a federal government shutdown, although officials clarified the freeze is unrelated to the funding lapse and is instead a policy-based action pending further review by the Department of Transportation.</p>

          <p>The Oktoberfest venue in Munich, Germany, was temporarily shut down and evacuated on Wednesday due to a bomb threat, but has since reopened to the public. The threat was linked to a domestic dispute where a 57-year-old man set his house on fire, which was found to be rigged with explosives. The suspect's body was later discovered at a nearby lake with what appeared to be an explosive device. A letter from the suspect contained a non-specific threat against the festival, prompting a thorough search by police with sniffer dogs before declaring the area safe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States federal government officially shut down after Congress failed to pass a funding measure, leading to an immediate political blame game between the two major parties. Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, accused Democrats of obstructing a funding bill, while Democrats like DNC Chair Ken Martin pointed to Republican incompetence. The core of the disagreement revolves around Democratic demands to include healthcare provisions in any funding extension, a move Republicans have resisted. With federal services disrupted, both sides are attempting to control the public narrative over who is responsible for the impasse.</p>

          <p>A significant portion of a 20-story residential building in the Bronx collapsed on Wednesday morning following a reported gas explosion. The incident, which occurred at the Mitchel Houses public housing complex, caused one entire corner of the structure to fall away, sending debris onto the street below. The New York City Fire Department responded to the scene, and while no injuries were immediately reported, search and rescue operations are underway. Officials are investigating the cause, with early reports suggesting a possible collapse of the building's incinerator shaft.</p>

          <p>A family in Hartline, Washington, had a startling experience when their three-year-old son discovered a live World War II-era hand grenade in their front yard. The boy brought the device inside the house to his parents, who immediately contacted the Grant County Sheriff's Office. A bomb squad from the Washington State Patrol was dispatched to the scene, where they confirmed the grenade was live and had been exposed to the elements for a long time. The device was safely removed and disposed of in a rural area, and authorities remain unsure how it ended up in the family's yard.</p>

          <p>The UK's High Court has ruled that PPE Medpro, a company associated with Baroness Michelle Mone and her husband Doug Barrowman, must pay £122 million in damages for breaching a government contract. The court found that the company failed to supply sterile medical gowns for the NHS during the COVID-19 pandemic that complied with the agreed-upon standards. The Department of Health and Social Care had rejected the gowns in 2020 after tests revealed many were not sterile. This judgment is part of a larger controversy surrounding government procurement through a "VIP lane" during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>Indonesia and Pakistan have joined several other Muslim-majority nations in supporting U.S. President Donald Trump's 20-point plan aimed at ending the war in Gaza.

While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accepted the plan, Hamas has not yet responded.

Harris has also repeatedly claimed on her book tour that the 2024 election was the "closest election in the 21st century," a statement contradicted by the results of the 2000 presidential election.

          <p>The current U.S. government shutdown is the latest in a series of funding lapses that have become more frequent over the past four decades. Since 1980, when a new legal interpretation required agencies to cease operations during funding gaps, there have been over a dozen shutdowns. These events, often stemming from intense partisan disputes over policy and spending, have varied in length from a single day to the record 34-day partial shutdown in 2018-2019. Historically, shutdowns have disrupted federal services, furloughed hundreds of thousands of workers, and incurred significant economic costs, including billions in lost productivity and back pay.</p>

          <p>While a government shutdown forces hundreds of thousands of federal employees to be furloughed or work without immediate pay, members of Congress and the President continue to receive their salaries. This is because their compensation is mandated by the Constitution and funded through a permanent appropriation that is not subject to the annual spending bills at the center of the shutdown dispute. In contrast, most federal agency employees are governed by the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits spending without congressional approval. Although federal workers are now guaranteed back pay after a shutdown ends, the immediate financial strain remains a significant issue.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass annual appropriations bills that fund federal agencies, forcing all non-essential functions to cease. This happens because the Treasury Department cannot legally spend money without authorization from lawmakers, as stipulated by the Antideficiency Act. During a shutdown, essential employees like active-duty military and air traffic controllers continue to work without immediate pay, while non-essential workers are furloughed. While entitlement programs like Social Security continue, other government services can be significantly delayed or halted, with economic consequences growing the longer the shutdown lasts.</p>

Medigap plans help cover out-of-pocket expenses like deductibles and copayments that are not covered by Original Medicare. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns have benched veteran quarterback Joe Flacco and named rookie Dillon Gabriel as the starter for their upcoming game against the Minnesota Vikings. The decision comes after a 1-3 start to the season, during which the offense has struggled, ranking near the bottom of the league in scoring. Gabriel, a third-round draft pick, has seen limited action in two games this season but showed promise during the preseason. The move also brings attention to third-string quarterback Shedeur Sanders, a high-profile draft pick who has yet to play in the regular season.</p>

          <p>Microsoft's Chief Technology Officer, Kevin Scott, announced the company's long-term strategy to primarily use its own custom-designed chips in its AI data centers. While Microsoft currently relies heavily on semiconductors from Nvidia and AMD, this move aims to reduce that dependency and optimize its entire system, from networking to cooling, for specific AI workloads. The company has already developed its own chips, such as the Azure Maia AI Accelerator and the Cobalt CPU, and is actively using them. This strategy reflects a broader trend among major cloud computing providers to design their own silicon for greater efficiency and control.</p>

          <p>Walmart has announced a plan to remove synthetic dyes and 30 other ingredients, including certain artificial sweeteners and preservatives, from its private-label food products by 2027. The change will affect approximately 1,000 items across brands like Great Value and is a response to consumer demand for simpler, more familiar ingredients. This move aligns with a broader industry trend and increased federal scrutiny on the health effects of artificial food additives.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin has temporarily suspended abortion services due to a new federal law that blocks providers receiving significant Medicaid reimbursements from participating in the program for one year. While federal Medicaid funds cannot be used for most abortions, clinics rely on these reimbursements for other services like cancer screenings and contraception. By pausing abortions, the Wisconsin affiliate appears to be attempting to maintain its eligibility for Medicaid funding for its other healthcare services. The situation highlights the financial strain placed on providers by the new provision, with clinics in other states also facing potential closures.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has commenced construction on a 27-mile section of border wall in the San Rafael Valley, a biodiverse grassland in southern Arizona. The 30-foot-high steel barrier is replacing lower vehicle barriers and will cut through a critical wildlife corridor, threatening species like jaguars and ocelots by severing their migration routes. Conservation groups and local residents are also concerned about the project's impact on water resources in the arid region, as new wells are being drilled for construction. The project is proceeding despite an ongoing legal challenge over the administration's use of waivers to bypass environmental laws.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has successfully influenced President Donald Trump, resulting in a Gaza peace plan that heavily favors Israel and effectively serves as an ultimatum for Hamas to surrender. The author contends that after months of delay, the U.S.-backed plan allows Israeli troops to remain in Gaza while demanding Hamas disarm, closely aligning with Netanyahu's goal of "total victory." The piece suggests Trump has been consistently outmaneuvered by Netanyahu, who has exploited the president's desire for a deal to prolong the conflict and secure terms advantageous to his right-wing government.</p>

The author contends that this move will cut off a vital pipeline of foreign-trained physicians who disproportionately staff hospitals in rural and underserved communities where American graduates often do not work. Rather than creating jobs for Americans, the policy could lead to clinic closures and reduced medical access, exacerbating a physician shortage caused by decades of underinvestment in domestic medical training.</p>
