          <p>Alibaba's shares experienced a significant drop of over 7% after the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings fell short of expectations. The Chinese e-commerce giant reported revenue of 236.5 billion yuan and net income of 12.4 billion yuan, missing analyst estimates. Despite the miss, revenue was up 7% year-on-year, and net income saw a substantial increase due to the disposal of subsidiaries and changes in equity investment valuations. The company is facing macroeconomic volatility and intense competition in China's e-commerce market, despite efforts to boost sales through partnerships and investments in instant commerce.

However, critics point out that the proposal would exclude millions of children from low-income families and those with immigrant parents, potentially taking the credit away from 4.5 million children who are U.S. citizens or lawfully present, while middle-income families would see the biggest benefit.</p>

From questioning President Obama's birthplace to attacking Senator Ted Cruz's eligibility, Trump has consistently used citizenship as a political tool, often arguing that birthright citizenship encourages mass immigration and strains resources, while experts say immigration actually helps the American economy.</p>
