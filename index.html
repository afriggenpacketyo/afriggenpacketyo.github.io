          <p>A reserve police officer in Old Orchard Beach, Maine, has agreed to leave the United States voluntarily following his arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The officer, a Jamaican national, was taken into custody for immigration violations after attempting to illegally purchase a firearm. Authorities stated he had overstayed his visa, which required his departure in October 2023, making his presence in the U.S. unlawful. The case has raised serious concerns, prompting an investigation into how he was hired by the local police department despite his immigration status.</p>

The 672-tonne structure has been lifted onto giant transporters for the slow, two-day journey to the new city center. This complex engineering feat is the most symbolic part of a wider project to relocate the city, which is at risk from ground fissures.

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly discussing a plan to take a 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, which would make the U.S. government its largest shareholder. The proposal involves converting some or all of the $10.9 billion in grants awarded to Intel under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act into company shares. This potential move is part of a broader effort to revitalize the U.S. semiconductor industry and bolster national security, as Intel has fallen behind global competitors. The discussions come as Intel also secured a separate $2 billion investment from SoftBank, signaling significant external interest in the company's future. (not investment advice)</p>

Actor and investor Ashton Kutcher is part of the consortium and will join the company's board. The move comes after Soho House struggled to achieve profitability since its 2021 stock market listing, with its share value declining amid concerns that its rapid expansion had diluted its exclusive brand. The acquisition aims to put the company on more stable financial footing away from the pressures of public market reporting.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, is churning in the ocean as a major Category 3 storm and is expected to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast this week. While the hurricane is not projected to make landfall in the United States, its large size and strength pose a significant coastal threat. Mandatory evacuations have been ordered for parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks due to the risk of coastal flooding and strong winds. Forecasters are urging the public to heed warnings from local officials, as dangerous ocean conditions are expected to persist for several days.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a prototype of a crewed tilt-rotor aircraft, a design that combines the vertical takeoff and landing capabilities of a helicopter with the speed and range of a fixed-wing plane. Photos show the aircraft hovering in helicopter mode, and its cockpit design suggests it is manned, which would make it China's first such aircraft. This technology is famously used in the U.S. V-22 Osprey. While versatile, tilt-rotor aircraft are known for their significant mechanical complexity, high costs, and historical safety concerns, presenting major challenges for any nation developing them.</p>

          <p>In a powerful first-person account, an academic in Gaza describes the profound difficulty of continuing intellectual work while enduring a severe famine deliberately imposed by an Israeli blockade. The author details the physical and cognitive toll of starvation, where the simple act of reading a paragraph becomes an immense challenge and concentration is constantly broken by hunger. Despite the collapse of infrastructure and the daily struggle for food and water, the article portrays the continuation of academic pursuits as an act of resistance. It is a refusal to be silenced or reduced to a statistic, insisting that knowledge and critical thought persist even in the most dire conditions.</p>

          <p>A delegation of European leaders, including those from Britain, France, and Germany, joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House to present a united front in discussions with President Donald Trump. The summit aimed to steer Trump toward a peace plan that includes a ceasefire as a precondition for talks and to secure robust U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine. While progress was reportedly made on the concept of security assurances, significant differences remain, particularly regarding the necessity of a ceasefire before any comprehensive peace deal is negotiated with Russia. The meeting was framed as a critical effort to safeguard Ukrainian and European security from further Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>Researchers have used Artificial Intelligence to generate facial reconstructions of Welsh convicts who were deported to Australia in the 19th century. A team of volunteers traced the lives of 60 individuals from Anglesey, who were transported for crimes ranging from theft to trampling on a nobleman's turnips. The AI process utilized detailed prisoner records, historical sketches, and, in some cases, photos of modern-day descendants to create the images. This project sheds light on a period when an estimated 162,000 convicts were sent to Australia, forming a foundational part of the country's history.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's defense minister has announced that the country has started serial production of a new cruise missile, reportedly named the "Flamingo," capable of carrying a 1,000-kg warhead. The missile is rumored to have a range of 1,800 miles, which would give Ukraine the ability to strike high-value military and industrial targets deep inside Russia, including production facilities in the Ural Mountains. While official details are scarce, images and specifications that have emerged suggest it is a large and powerful conventional weapon.

          <p>A woman who was sexually assaulted by another passenger on a Qatar Airways flight to London has been denied compensation from the UK's Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme (CICS). Although her attacker was successfully prosecuted in the UK and jailed, her application was rejected because the crime occurred on a foreign-registered aircraft. Current rules only define British-registered aircraft as a "relevant place" for compensation eligibility. Her lawyers are calling on the Justice Secretary to close this legal gap, arguing it is irrational to prosecute a crime in the UK but deny the victim access to the state's compensation scheme.</p>

The analysis suggests that Trump affords Putin a special status, interrupting the meeting with European leaders for a phone call with the Russian president.

The case highlights significant delays in the investigative process by SafeSport, the watchdog for Olympic sports, which suspended Gardner in 2022 but has yet to resolve his disciplinary case. Court records show Gardner was accused of sexually abusing at least three young gymnasts at Chow's Gymnastics in Iowa and secretly recording others in a bathroom at a previous job. The slow and opaque process allowed the accused coach to find other employment outside of sports while the investigation unfolded.</p>

The U.S. model often involves large, clustered operations with thousands of hives and minimal intervention, whereas Chinese practices are typically more hands-on and diversified, which may contribute to better colony health and resilience against stressors that have devastated bee populations elsewhere.</p>

The piece draws a sharp contrast between the swift and severe sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and the muted response to the crisis in Gaza.

          <h2>Judge's Ruling Blocks Two Transfer Players from Competing for USC and UCLA Football</h2>

          <p>A federal judge has denied a preliminary injunction request from two college football players, effectively blocking them from playing for USC and UCLA this season. Offensive lineman DJ Wingfield (USC) and wide receiver Kaedin Robinson (UCLA) had sued the NCAA, arguing its five-year eligibility rule violated antitrust laws by limiting their potential to earn NIL compensation. However, the judge ruled that the NCAA's rule was not commercial in nature and therefore not subject to antitrust scrutiny. The decision is a significant blow to both players and their respective teams, which had counted on them to be key contributors.</p>

          <p>A 67-year-old man is scheduled to be executed in Florida for the 1982 abduction and murder of a woman in Bay County. The man, Kayle Bates, was convicted of kidnapping Janet White from her office, attempting to sexually assault her, and stabbing her to death. If the execution proceeds, it will be the tenth carried out by Florida in 2025, a record for the state in a single year since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. Attorneys for Bates have filed last-minute appeals to the state and U.S. Supreme Courts, but previous legal challenges have been dismissed.</p>

          <p>Following a walk-off loss to the Colorado Rockies, Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts met privately with manager Dave Roberts and president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman. The meeting was prompted by a game in which two poor defensive plays by right fielder Teoscar Hernández contributed directly to the defeat. The discussion has fueled speculation about whether Betts, a six-time Gold Glove winner in right field, might be moved back to the outfield to shore up the team's defense. While Hernández is a key offensive contributor, his defensive struggles have become a growing concern for the team's leadership.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's latest visit to the White House is analyzed as a strategic success in buying more time for his country. In contrast to a previous ill-tempered meeting, Zelenskyy adopted a more conciliatory tone, which appeared to improve the diplomatic atmosphere with President Trump. The discussions centered on security guarantees and the potential for a direct meeting between Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin. While concrete details on a final peace plan remain elusive, the summit allowed Ukraine to avoid being pushed into immediate, unfavorable concessions, effectively maintaining the status quo while diplomatic channels remain open.</p>

          <p>A federal judge dismissed part of a lawsuit concerning a temporary immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades known as "Alligator Alcatraz." The judge ruled that a claim regarding a lack of clarity over which immigration court had jurisdiction was now moot, as the government has since designated a court. However, the judge allowed other claims to proceed, including allegations that the facility violates detainees' First Amendment rights by failing to provide confidential access to their lawyers. The case over legal access has been transferred to a different federal court, while a separate lawsuit challenges the facility on environmental grounds.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to end mail-in voting, stating that an executive order is currently being drafted to ban the practice before the 2026 midterm elections. During a meeting, Trump called mail-in ballots "corrupt" and claimed they are susceptible to widespread fraud, despite evidence to the contrary from security experts. However, the U.S. Constitution grants states, not the president, the authority to regulate elections, making it highly unlikely that such an executive order would be legally enforceable. The move signals a continued focus on election integrity as a key political issue for the administration.</p>

Fellow students and faculty described him as "creepy" and "sexist," with one professor warning colleagues that he might eventually stalk or abuse his own students if he became a professor. The documents detail multiple complaints about his condescending behavior toward women and his tendency to physically block doorways in offices. This pattern of alarming conduct occurred in the months leading up to the November 2022 killings.</p>

China now exports approximately $1.6 trillion to the Global South, over 50% more than its combined total to the U.S. and Western Europe.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India, the world's second-largest supplier of seafarers, currently has the highest number of sailors abandoned on vessels by shipowners. This crisis occurs when owners sever ties, failing to pay wages or provide for the crew's repatriation, often leaving them stranded for months in foreign waters. In 2024, nearly 900 of the 3,133 known abandoned sailors globally were Indian nationals. Experts attribute the problem to the widespread practice of registering ships under "flags of convenience" in countries with lax regulations, which obscures true ownership and allows unscrupulous operators to evade responsibility, trapping crews in complex international legal disputes.</p>
