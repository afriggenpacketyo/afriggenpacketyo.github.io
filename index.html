          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has condemned a U.S. military strike on a submarine in the Caribbean, labeling it "murder" and demanding an explanation. While U.S. President Donald Trump claimed the vessel was carrying illegal narcotics, Petro asserted it was a Colombian boat that was adrift with a distress signal due to engine failure. This incident is the latest in a series of deadly U.S. strikes on ships in the region, which the U.S. defends as necessary to combat drug trafficking. The UN has described these strikes as "extrajudicial executions," and this is the first time survivors have been reported from such an attack.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has issued a warning based on "credible reports" that Hamas is planning an imminent attack on Palestinian civilians in Gaza, which would severely violate the current ceasefire agreement. Washington has informed guarantor nations of the peace deal and stated that protective measures would be taken if the attack proceeds. This alert comes as the first phase of the ceasefire is underway, involving hostage exchanges and prisoner releases. Tensions remain high, with Israel keeping the Rafah border crossing closed until all deceased hostage remains are returned by Hamas.</p>

          <p>Large crowds gathered in major U.S. cities for "No Kings" protests against the policies of President Donald Trump, with demonstrators voicing concerns over his expansion of executive power. Organizers described the events as peaceful, despite allies of the president attempting to link the rallies with far-left movements. Since his return to office, Trump has used executive orders to deploy the National Guard and has called for the prosecution of political opponents, actions critics decry as unconstitutional. Democratic leaders like Senator Bernie Sanders and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer joined the protests, emphasizing their commitment to American democracy.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has accused the United States of conducting long-term and highly covert cyberattacks against its National Time Service Center. The center, affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is crucial for maintaining and distributing China's standard time, which supports vital sectors like communications, finance, and national defense. According to the ministry's statement, the cyberattacks employed sophisticated, state-level espionage tools. The U.S. embassy in China has not yet responded to the allegations, which add to the ongoing technological and political tensions between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Embassy in Trinidad and Tobago has issued an unusual security alert, advising American citizens to avoid U.S. government facilities over the weekend due to a "heightened state of alert." This warning comes amid escalating tensions between the United States and nearby Venezuela following a series of deadly U.S. strikes in the Caribbean targeting suspected drug traffickers. Trinidad and Tobago's homeland security minister confirmed the alert is based on specific threats directed at Americans, potentially linked to the regional situation. Local authorities have implemented enhanced security measures in response to the unspecified threats.</p>

          <p>A graduate student and teaching assistant at Illinois State University was arrested for disorderly conduct and criminal damage to property after an incident on campus. Derek Lopez, 27, was filmed flipping over a table set up by the Turning Point USA student group, which was promoting an event with political comedian Alex Stein. In the video, Lopez is heard saying, "Jesus did it, so you know I gotta do it, right?" before overturning the table and tearing down flyers.

          <p>Despite a massive summer spending spree, Liverpool's performance has dipped, highlighted by three consecutive losses, with some analysis pointing to the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid. While known for his offensive contributions, his absence is reportedly felt in more subtle aspects of the team's play, particularly in building up from the back against high-pressing opponents. The article details how Alexander-Arnold's ability to use his weaker foot and execute long, switching passes provided tactical options that the team currently lacks. New signings like Florian Wirtz are being forced into deeper roles to compensate, potentially limiting their attacking effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Several major companies, including Accenture, Lufthansa, and Salesforce, have recently announced significant job cuts, publicly attributing the restructuring to the integration of artificial intelligence. However, some experts are skeptical, suggesting AI has become a "good excuse" for layoffs that may be driven by other factors, such as overhiring during the pandemic. Fabian Stephany of the Oxford Internet Institute argues that companies might be "scapegoating" the technology to appear innovative while masking less favorable business realities. Recent labor market data from Yale and the New York Fed indicates that AI has not yet caused widespread job disruption.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>It is common for sexual desire to decrease after the initial passionate phase of a long-term relationship, a phenomenon explained by hormonal shifts and psychological factors. According to couple's therapist Andrea Seiferth, the initial hormone cocktail that drives lust is eventually replaced by bonding hormones like oxytocin, which can dampen sex drive. Communication about sexual needs and preferences is crucial for maintaining intimacy. Research also highlights a notable "orgasm gap" in heterosexual relationships, where female pleasure is often not prioritized, which can lead to diminished desire over time if unaddressed through open dialogue and mutual effort.</p>

          <p>Rising temperatures and extreme weather events are putting significant stress on the United Kingdom's native tree populations, with iconic species like the oak struggling to adapt. In response, Forestry England has released a list of thirty tree species, including both native and non-native varieties like the coast redwood, that are expected to thrive in the UK's future warmer climate. Experts warn that human-driven climate change is happening too rapidly for trees to migrate naturally. The strategy of "assisted migration," or intentionally planting species suited for future conditions, aims to create more diverse and resilient forests to safeguard the nation's woodlands.</p>

          <p>Major Chinese airlines, including China Eastern, are now offering free basic Wi-Fi on many domestic routes in a strategic move to attract business travelers back from the country's extensive high-speed train network. China Eastern recently launched the service on all its widebody aircraft serving key domestic hubs like Beijing and Shanghai. The initiative aims to cater to professionals who wish to remain productive while traveling, a key advantage that air travel can offer over rail. This new amenity reflects the intense competition for passengers within China's domestic travel market, where high-speed rail has become a popular alternative.</p>
