          <p>An inquest has heard that Ian Watkins, the former singer of the band Lostprophets, died after being stabbed in the neck at HMP Wakefield. Watkins was serving a 29-year sentence for numerous child sex offenses, including the attempted sexual assault of a baby. The hearing was informed that a post-mortem examination confirmed an incision to the neck as the cause of death. The inquest has been adjourned pending the outcome of a murder trial, for which two men have been charged in connection with the incident. Watkins, once a globally recognized musician, saw his band disband immediately following his 2013 conviction.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, Japan's new and first female prime minister, has announced plans to increase the nation's military spending to 2% of its GDP by March, accelerating a goal previously set for 2027. In her first major policy speech, Takaichi cited growing security concerns due to the military activities of neighboring China, North Korea, and Russia. She emphasized the need to bolster Japan's defense capabilities in response to a destabilized international order and called for stronger security cooperation with Taiwan. The move comes ahead of a planned visit from U.S. President Donald Trump, during which the U.S.-Japan alliance will be a key topic of discussion.</p>

          <p>Economists are expressing concern that a prolonged government shutdown could pose a significant threat to the U.S. economy, potentially tipping it into a recession. The shutdown has already impacted approximately 750,000 furloughed federal workers and threatens to cut off food assistance for millions more. Experts warn that a lengthy impasse could erode consumer confidence and business investment, creating a negative feedback loop, especially as the holiday shopping season approaches. While some economists believe the overall impact would be limited, the lack of key federal economic data during the shutdown is creating uncertainty for policymakers and businesses alike.

          <p>Alaska Airlines has resumed flight operations after a significant IT outage caused a nationwide ground stop for both Alaska and Horizon Air flights. The Seattle-based carrier announced the system restoration late Thursday but warned that further disruptions are likely as it works to reposition aircraft and crews. The outage resulted in over 229 flight cancellations, affecting thousands of passengers across its network. The airline has implemented a flexible travel policy to assist customers whose plans were disrupted by the technical failure. The Federal Aviation Administration often issues such ground stops at the request of airlines to manage systemic issues safely.</p>

          <p>With the ongoing government shutdown, approximately 1.4 million federal employees are going without pay, forcing many to turn to food banks and take out hardship loans to cover basic expenses. For many, Friday was a missed payday, amplifying financial and mental stress for families across the country. While about half of these workers are furloughed, the other half are deemed essential and continue to work without compensation. The economic impact is beginning to ripple through communities with high concentrations of federal workers, affecting local businesses like grocery stores and daycares. The situation highlights the severe personal consequences of the political impasse in Washington.</p>

          <p>Experts on nuclear policy have analyzed the new Kathryn Bigalow film, 'A House of Dynamite,' which depicts a sudden nuclear attack on the United States. While they praise the film's authentic portrayal of the command-and-control systems, such as the presidential 'football' and the emergency video conferences, some question the realism of the attack scenario. Many specialists believe a nuclear conflict is more likely to escalate from a conventional war rather than a surprise strike. They also noted that the film's depiction of missile defense capabilities was plausible but simplified, as current doctrine would involve launching more interceptors. The experts agreed the film is a timely reminder of nuclear dangers.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while the Trump administration has successfully pressured NATO allies to meet their defense spending commitments, a similar focus is now needed to ensure these nations honor their commercial agreements with U.S. companies. The author points to reports of several countries, including Mexico, Kuwait, and Honduras, allegedly owing billions to American contractors or creating hostile business environments. The piece calls for U.S. diplomats and the State Department to actively facilitate the resolution of these commercial disputes. The central argument is that partnership with the United States should require allies to respect their financial obligations to American businesses and workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Baseball analysts are offering their predictions for the 2025 World Series, which pits the Los Angeles Dodgers against the Toronto Blue Jays. Most experts favor the Dodgers to secure a second consecutive title, citing their formidable starting pitching rotation and the star power of players like Shohei Ohtani. The consensus is that the Dodgers' depth and dominant pitching, which held the Brewers to just four runs in the NLCS, will be too much for Toronto. However, the Blue Jays are seen as having a fighting chance if their hot hitters, particularly Vladimir Guerrero Jr., can pressure the Dodgers' starters early and exploit their less consistent bullpen.</p>

          <p>The recent FBI arrests of NBA figures in connection with illegal gambling are being framed as an inevitable outcome of the league's deep financial ties to the sports betting industry. This article argues that by integrating betting odds and promotions directly into its broadcasts and marketing, the NBA has normalized a culture that makes the sport vulnerable to corruption. The piece suggests that scandals involving players manipulating on-court performance for betting purposes, such as the Jontay Porter case, are a direct result of this partnership. The author calls for significant reforms, including stricter regulation and a separation between the game and the gambling industry to protect the sport's integrity.</p>

Mr. Gleave's company was also used as a conduit for other substantial payments to Prince Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson. These revelations add to ongoing scrutiny of the Duke of York's finances, particularly how he funds his lifestyle since stepping down as a working royal.

          <p>The U.S. military has expanded its campaign against drug trafficking by conducting strikes on alleged cartel boats in the eastern Pacific, killing at least 37 people in total across all recent operations. The Trump administration asserts these actions are a necessary defense against cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations, but has not provided public evidence, prompting concern from legal experts and some lawmakers. Critics question the legality of using lethal force in international waters without a congressional authorization for use of military force. The unprecedented scale of the naval deployment has also fueled speculation that the operation's goals may extend beyond counter-narcotics to pressuring Venezuela's government.</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance from cancer survivors on the most effective ways friends and family can offer support during treatment. Rather than broad offers of help, specific actions are recommended, categorized into four key roles: being a 'doctor's appointment buddy' to take notes, a 'procedure pal' for emotional support during treatments, a 'companion' for difficult post-infusion days, and a 'household helper' to manage daily tasks like cooking or laundry. The advice emphasizes taking initiative and reducing the mental load on the patient. Survivors stress that simply being present and asking, 'Where are you with all this today?' can be one of the most powerful forms of support.</p>

The watchdog highlighted that inconsistent definitions, poor data collection, and a lack of national coordination are undermining efforts to protect vulnerable children. According to the report, only 37% of child exploitation cases were correctly flagged on police systems, indicating that opportunities for intervention are still being missed. The findings come amid ongoing controversy surrounding the government's national inquiry into the issue, which has faced multiple setbacks since its announcement.</p>

Specifically, the launch of new gaming consoles and smartphones, along with a high demand for gold jewelry online, drove the positive figures.

          <p>Millions of ordinary Russian private investors find their assets, primarily foreign securities, trapped in European depositories like Euroclear and Clearstream due to sanctions against Russia's financial infrastructure. While these investors are not personally sanctioned and are legally entitled to their funds, the process to reclaim them is prohibitively complex and expensive. Obtaining the necessary licenses from Belgian or Luxembourg authorities often requires legal assistance costing tens of thousands of euros, far exceeding the average frozen amount per investor. This situation effectively blocks access for all but the wealthiest individuals, leaving most small-scale investors in a state of indefinite financial limbo. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A prominent Chinese scholar has called for both China and the United States to exercise self-restraint and stop escalating the 'weaponization' of their economic relationship. Speaking at a summit in Shanghai, Da Wei of Tsinghua University warned against the trend of using trade and technology controls as strategic weapons against each other. His comments come as officials from both nations prepare for a new round of trade negotiations in Malaysia. The remarks reflect growing concern over recent actions, such as Beijing's expanded export controls on rare earth elements, which are seen as a response to Washington's restrictions on semiconductor technology.</p>

This move is part of Comac's broader strategy to disrupt the global aviation duopoly held by Airbus and Boeing. The company's presence at the major industry event provides a significant platform to showcase its aircraft to a global audience, capitalizing on growing trade ties between China and the Middle East.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The by-election result in Caerphilly represents an extraordinary rejection of the UK's two major political parties, with Labour and the Conservatives securing a combined total of just 13% of the vote. This analysis highlights the historic nature of Labour's collapse in a traditional heartland, where it received only 11% support. The contest was dominated by Plaid Cymru, the victor, and Reform UK, which came in a strong second. The outcome raises profound questions for both major parties, suggesting deep voter dissatisfaction and signaling a potential political realignment in Wales that could have significant implications for the next national elections.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes whether Arsenal's exceptionally strong defense could be the key to winning their first Premier League title since 2004. Having conceded just three goals in their first eight games, the team is on a historic pace that could break the record for fewest goals allowed in a season, set by Chelsea in 2004-05. While their attack has been less prolific than in previous seasons, their defensive solidity has placed them at the top of the table. The analysis compares their current performance to past champions, noting that while rare, winning the league with the best defense but not the best attack is possible, as demonstrated by Liverpool in 2019-20.</p>

          <p>An analysis of NHS data reveals that the number of young adults aged 16-24 in England reporting symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) has more than tripled over the past ten years. OCD is now the second-most common mental health disorder in this age group, behind only generalized anxiety disorder. Experts and charities attribute the sharp rise to a combination of increased awareness, societal pressures, and the impact of social media. Many young people report significant difficulties in accessing timely and effective NHS treatment, with some families resorting to expensive private care due to long waiting lists and a shortage of specialist staff.</p>

The investigation into Schiff, a prominent critic of Donald Trump, has been labeled by the senator's lawyer as a 'transparently vindictive effort' with no merit. This development suggests that the politically charged probe, which President Trump had publicly called for, may be unlikely to result in an indictment.</p>

U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum announced the decision, which paves the way for future lease sales in the 1.5 million-acre area. The plan is celebrated by some Alaskan leaders for its economic potential but is fiercely opposed by environmental groups and the Indigenous Gwich'in people, who consider the land sacred and vital to the caribou herds they depend on.
