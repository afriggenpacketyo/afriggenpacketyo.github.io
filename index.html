          <p>Singapore-based hotel tycoon Ong Beng Seng has pleaded guilty to helping former transportation minister Subramaniam Iswaran obstruct a corruption investigation. The case, a rare high-profile scandal in Singapore, involved Ong providing expensive gifts to the minister, including a private jet trip, while engaged in official business. Citing Ong's poor health from a rare cancer, prosecutors have recommended a fine instead of a jail sentence, with the final decision expected on August 15.</p>

          <p>Manchester City's hiring of Pep Lijnders, former assistant to Jürgen Klopp, may signal a significant tactical evolution for Pep Guardiola's team, according to a new analysis. The article suggests Guardiola is adapting to the Premier League's trend towards more direct, high-pressing football by moving away from his signature 'positional play.' This strategic shift is further evidenced by recent signings like Omar Marmoush and Rayan Ait-Nouri, players known for their dynamic, transition-focused abilities rather than methodical passing.</p>

          <p>Germany is grappling with a continued decline in its birth rate, which has fallen to 1.35 children per woman, fueling a national debate over its long-term societal and economic consequences. Experts attribute the trend to a combination of factors, including economic uncertainty, climate change, and high inflation, which disproportionately affect the younger generation's family planning decisions. While some women choose to be childless, research also points to a 'fertility gap,' suggesting that improved family-friendly policies could help bridge the divide between desired and actual family sizes.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotech start-ups Innovent and BeOne are projected to achieve their first full-year profits in 2025, marking a significant milestone for China's burgeoning biotechnology industry. This signals a new stage of maturity for firms that went public under a 2018 Hong Kong rule change allowing pre-revenue companies to list, demonstrating their ability to generate value independently. A key driver for Innovent's anticipated success is its new GLP-1 weight-loss drug, which is expected to contribute substantially to its revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

The U.S. aims to economically isolate Russia and Iran, but China benefits from discounted energy prices and views the demand as a violation of its sovereignty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese defense researchers, drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, has proposed a novel upgrade to improve the survivability of combat drones against missile attacks. The concept involves equipping drones with small, side-mounted rocket boosters that would allow them to execute sudden, high-G evasive maneuvers in the final moments before impact. According to the researchers' simulations, this "terminal evasion" system could increase a drone's survival rate to nearly 90 percent, potentially shifting battlefield dynamics.</p>
