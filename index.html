          <p>New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, also a mayoral candidate, was arrested by ICE agents at a federal immigration court while observing proceedings, sparking outrage and accusations of abuse of power. Lander was taken into custody while escorting a defendant out of court, leading to charges of assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer. Charges were later dropped, and Lander criticized the government's treatment of undocumented immigrants, emphasizing the importance of due process. Governor Kathy Hochul and other officials condemned the arrest, highlighting the need to ensure the safety and accessibility of public resources for all New Yorkers. The incident has ignited debates about immigration enforcement tactics and the rights of public officials to oversee government actions. Optimism remains muted as the event underscores the ongoing tensions surrounding immigration policy and law enforcement. </p>

          <p>China has condemned the United States for its "malign influence" in Latin America after the U.S. announced an $8 million project in Panama to replace communications towers installed by Huawei Technologies with "secure American technology."

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer rushed to pick up papers dropped by US President Donald Trump at the G7 Summit, fearing intervention from White House security. The incident occurred during a discussion about a newly signed UK-US trade deal, with Starmer kneeling to gather the scattered documents. Starmer highlighted the trade deal's importance for Jaguar Land Rover workers and the removal of tariffs on the aerospace sector. However, the deal did not address steel import charges, and opposition parties criticized it as a "tiny tariff deal."

          <p>A federal appeals court in San Francisco is considering whether President Trump can continue deploying the National Guard in Los Angeles to protect federal immigration authorities during enforcement operations. The court appeared skeptical of California's arguments against the federalization of over 4,000 troops. The Justice Department argues that Trump's decision is unreviewable by courts, while California contends that the deployment circumvents Governor Gavin Newsom and escalates tensions. The legal battle centers on whether the president exceeded his authority under Title 10 of the U.S. Code. </p>

          <p>President Trump is considering joining Israel in striking Iranian nuclear facilities, with one potential target being the underground uranium enrichment site at Fordo. The decision follows allegations from Israel that Iran is making rapid progress toward building nuclear weapons, though a U.S. intelligence assessment earlier this year suggested Iran was not currently building such weapons. The issue was discussed in a meeting with Trump's national security team, but there is not full agreement on how to proceed. Trump has issued warnings to Iran on Truth Social, raising questions about the U.S.'s level of involvement in the conflict. </p>

          <p>Republican Senator Mike Lee deleted controversial social media posts about the assassination of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband after facing criticism. The posts, which referenced the attack and featured images of the suspect, were perceived as blaming Minnesota Governor Tim Walz for the shootings. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar spoke with Lee, leading to the removal of the posts. Democrats condemned Lee's comments, calling them dangerous and unacceptable. The incident highlights the heightened political tensions and the need for elected officials to avoid inciting violence. </p>

          <p>JetBlue Airways is implementing additional cost cuts, including further reducing off-peak flights and unprofitable routes, as weaker-than-expected travel demand makes achieving break-even operating margins in 2025 "unlikely." The airline will also pause plans to retrofit older Airbus A320 jets and is assessing hiring plans, potentially combining leadership roles and reducing travel spending. These measures follow the blocking of JetBlue's planned acquisition of Spirit Airlines and its Northeast U.S. alliance with American Airlines. The airline last posted an annual profit in 2019 and is seeking ways to improve revenue and cut costs. </p>

          <p>President Trump met with his national security team in the Situation Room on Tuesday as Israel and Iran continued to exchange strikes. The meeting occurred after Trump abruptly left the G7 summit early, citing tensions in the Middle East. Trump denied contacting Iranian leaders about a potential ceasefire and dismissed an intelligence assessment stating Iran wasn't working on a nuclear weapon. He also issued a stern warning to Iran, instructing them not to harm U.S. troops or assets in the region. The U.S. has remained on the sidelines of the conflict so far, but Trump has not ruled out American participation. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has given 36 countries, mostly in Africa, a deadline to improve vetting of travelers or face a ban on their citizens visiting the United States. The State Department instructed embassies to gauge the countries' willingness to improve travel documentation and address the status of their nationals in the U.S. illegally. This move aims to crack down on visa overstays and potential national security risks. The list includes countries like Egypt, Nigeria, and Syria, and is the latest step in the administration's efforts to tighten immigration controls. </p>

Gunn addressed rumors about Matt Reeves' "The Batman" sequel, confirming it is still in development but delayed. He also reflected on his past scandal and how it influenced his creative process, focusing on creating authentic work rather than seeking approval. </p>

          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion for women, marking the most significant change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, passed by a majority of 242 votes, means women who terminate their pregnancies outside the current legal framework will no longer face criminal investigation. The law will still penalize anyone who assists a woman in getting an abortion outside the legal framework. The move was welcomed by abortion providers and women's rights campaigners, but criticized by anti-abortion groups. </p>

Aid restrictions have plunged families in Gaza into extreme hunger, with half a million people now starving and the entire territory at risk of famine. The U.N. says most of the aid it's been able to bring into Gaza has been taken by hungry crowds off its trucks before they can reach warehouses. </p>
