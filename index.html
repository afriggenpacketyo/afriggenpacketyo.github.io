          <p>The article discusses the increasing use of AI chatbots as a tool for mental health support, particularly for individuals facing long wait times for traditional therapy or those who find it easier to communicate with a non-human entity. People share their experiences with AI chatbots, highlighting both the benefits, such as 24/7 availability and empathetic responses, and the drawbacks, including generic advice and potential biases. Experts express concerns about the lack of human connection, security, and potential for harmful advice, but acknowledge that chatbots can serve as a useful stopgap in an overloaded mental health system, providing coping strategies and support while individuals wait for professional care. The article ultimately suggests that AI support can be a helpful first step, but it is not a substitute for professional care. Optimism_score is 60.</p>

          <p>Portugal's snap elections resulted in a victory for the center-right Democratic Alliance (AD), but the far-right Chega party made significant gains, tying with the Socialists as the country's second political force.

          <p>Conservatives have been holding out against the major tax and spending cut package to implement President Trump’s agenda, arguing it will swell federal deficits. The Moody’s downgrade underscored their concerns. Moody's downgrade of the United States' credit rating has fueled the debate over the Republican tax and spending cut package. Fiscally conservative Republicans are using the downgrade as evidence that their demands for deeper cuts to federal programs are justified. While the downgrade may strengthen their position, it is unclear if it will significantly alter the bill's progress, as Republican leaders face pressure from both fiscal hawks and moderate Republicans.

          <p>Former President Biden’s cancer diagnosis comes as a new book details efforts by aides to shield the effects of his aging from the public and the press during last year’s presidential campaign. The revelation that former President Biden has advanced prostate cancer has generated more questions than answers. The diagnosis has prompted debate among experts in the oncology community over the likely progression of his disease. Scrutiny grows over his decision to run for a second term last year — and whether it cost the Democrats the White House. Optimism_score is 30.</p>
