            <h2>Sullivan Criticizes Zero-Sum View of US-China Relations in Speech</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-16 05:54:53 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Former US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan criticized the zero-sum perspective on US-China relations, arguing that it fails to recognize the complexity and long-term nature of the relationship. Speaking at Harvard, Sullivan emphasized that US leadership should acknowledge that competition with China is a persistent state and not an issue that can be completely resolved. He highlighted the need for managed competition, where both countries coexist and balance their interests. Sullivan also pointed out the US should not expect China to implode like the Soviet Union, emphasizing the importance of understanding the dynamic and enduring nature of this competition.</p>

            <p>Accounting firm EY is under investigation by the UK's Financial Reporting Council (FRC) regarding its audits of the Post Office between March 2015 and March 2018, in relation to the Horizon scandal. The investigation will assess whether EY met its standards, focusing on matters related to the Horizon IT system, which was at the center of wrongful convictions of hundreds of postmasters. EY has stated it takes its responsibilities seriously and will fully cooperate with the FRC. The Fujitsu-developed software's failures led to widespread accusations of false accounting and subsequent legal battles, prompting the FRC's scrutiny of the audits.</p>

            <p>UK inflation decreased to 2.6% in March, down from 2.8% in February, primarily due to falling petrol prices, according to official data. While prices continue to rise, the pace is slowing, and wages are growing faster than inflation. However, analysts predict a spike in inflation from April due to rising bills and business costs, as well as the potential impact of Trump's trade wars on exports and investment. The Bank of England faces a dilemma as strong wage growth may discourage interest rate cuts, despite the slowing inflation.</p>

Abedi, who attacked officers with hot oil and improvised blades, has been moved to Belmarsh prison, while the other six prisoners were transferred to HMP Woodhill. A full, independent review is underway to investigate the incident, which has drawn criticism from survivors and families of victims who believe Abedi was given too many privileges.

They also objected to his "Seinfeld" role, feeling it lacked sanctity in its depiction of sexual acts, highlighting a clash between Warburton's career and his parents' religious beliefs.</p>

            <p>Families are reporting that civil rights investigations in schools are stalling due to recent staff cuts in the U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). Amy Cupp, whose daughter G with disabilities is allegedly being secluded and restrained at school, filed a complaint with OCR but has not received an update after the attorney handling her case was laid off. The lawsuit claims the layoffs have undermined OCR's ability to enforce civil rights laws in schools, potentially leaving students with disabilities without adequate protection. While the Education Department states it is committed to protecting vulnerable Americans, the cuts raise concerns about the accessibility of civil rights enforcement for families.</p>

The state is now investing $300 million to improve its behavioral health care system, addressing issues like facility closures and staff shortages. However, advocates emphasize that housing is crucial for long-term stability and recovery, as many patients cycle through institutions without a clear path to permanent housing.</p>

            <p>Miriam Adelson, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, is criticized for alienating fans by trading star player Luka Dončić and for her political affiliations, particularly her support for Donald Trump and Israel. Her political engagement is described as activism, with significant donations to Trump's campaign. The Mavericks have experienced on-court struggles since the trade, leading to fan discontent and financial damage to the franchise. Adelson's decisions are seen as uncaring about their impact on others, drawing parallels between her support for a divisive presidency and her ownership of the Mavericks.</p>

            <p>An election debate in Canada has been rescheduled to avoid a conflict with a Montreal Canadiens hockey game. The French-language leaders' debate was originally scheduled to start at the same time as the game, which could see the Canadiens clinch a spot in the Stanley Cup play-offs.

            <p>China has appointed Li Chenggang as its new trade envoy, replacing Wang Shouwen, amidst escalating trade tensions with the US. The move comes as Chinese officials criticize the US's "tariff barriers and trade bullying" for impacting the global economic order. Li, a former assistant commerce minister and WTO ambassador, will play a key role in negotiations, as China's economy braces for the impact of US tariffs. While both countries express openness to negotiation, neither has taken concrete steps yet, making Li's role crucial in breaking the impasse. </p>

Sullivan was found unharmed in Gqeberha, where he was abducted, and the South African police's Hawks unit conducted the rescue. Kidnappings for ransom have increased in South Africa, prompting the intervention of the elite police unit after a ransom demand was made. Sullivan, described as a church-planting missionary, moved to South Africa in 2018 to establish a church for Xhosa-speaking people.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Treasury market experienced an unusual sell-off following President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs, forcing him to suspend the duties. The 10-year Treasury yield soared to its highest level since February, while the 30-year bond yield reached its highest since November 2023. The sell-off was unusual as investors typically flock to the safety of U.S. debt during times of uncertainty. Potential sellers include China, Japan's life insurers, hedge funds, and "bond vigilantes," each with their own motivations for reducing their Treasury holdings. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's threatened tariffs have plunged the U.S. into trade wars, with new and intermittent levies increasing uncertainty. Trump's initial trade war targeted China, with tariffs on most of its products, leading to retaliatory tariffs. He also used tariffs to renegotiate the North American trade pact. While President Joe Biden maintained most of Trump's tariffs, Trump's broader tariffs could have greater consequences, with higher prices likely burdening consumers. The timeline includes actions from Trump's inauguration to recent suspensions and investigations, detailing the escalating trade tensions.</p>

            <p>A study suggests that the popularity of disposable e-cigarettes or vapes is declining in the UK ahead of a ban on their sale, scheduled for June 1, 2025. The percentage of 16-24 year olds primarily using disposable vapes has nearly halved in the past year. However, researchers believe users are switching to refillable and rechargeable vapes instead of quitting, potentially limiting the ban's impact on overall vaping rates. The government aims to reduce littering and youth vaping through the ban, but concerns remain about its effectiveness.</p>
