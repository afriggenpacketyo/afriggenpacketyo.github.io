          <p>A massive explosion at a military explosives manufacturing facility in Bucksnort, Tennessee, has left nineteen people missing and several confirmed deceased. The blast completely leveled the factory, owned by Accurate Energetic Systems, which produced high-grade military and commercial explosives. Emergency services, including the FBI and ATF, are on the scene, with the sheriff describing it as one of the most devastating situations he has encountered. The cause remains unclear, and a similar incident occurred at the same location in 2014, resulting in one fatality.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has reappointed Sébastien Lecornu as prime minister, just four days after his initial resignation, in an attempt to end days of political turmoil. Lecornu faces the immediate challenge of forming a government and presenting next year's budget by Monday, despite Macron's lack of a parliamentary majority. France is grappling with significant public debt and a projected budget deficit, with Lecornu warning that restoring public finances is paramount. The reappointment has drawn criticism from opposition parties, highlighting the deep political divisions and instability.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced new 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, effective November 1, citing China's "extraordinarily aggressive position on trade" and new export controls. This move, which includes export controls on critical software, follows China's restrictions on rare-earth minerals crucial for semiconductors. The announcement triggered a significant stock market sell-off, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling. Trump also threatened to cancel an upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, escalating the ongoing trade dispute. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge is intensely questioning the Trump administration's attempts to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man mistakenly deported earlier this year. The judge expressed frustration over the lack of progress in securing a third country for his removal, despite Costa Rica's willingness to accept him. Immigration officials testified about discussions with various nations, including Eswatini and Ghana, though Ghana has publicly refused. Garcia's lawyers argue his continued detention is illegal, citing a 2001 Supreme Court ruling against indefinite detention and alleging a punitive motive behind the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has re-appointed Sébastien Lecornu as prime minister, a month after his initial appointment and days after his resignation, seeking to end the nation's political deadlock. Lecornu accepted the role out of "duty," tasked with forming a government and securing a budget by year-end, with a condition that new cabinet members forgo 2027 presidential ambitions. France faces significant economic struggles, including high public debt and poverty rates, which are concerning financial markets and the European Union. Opposition parties criticize Macron's handling of the crisis, highlighting the fragility of his centrist coalition.</p>

Thousands of Palestinians are returning to northern Gaza, despite widespread destruction and critical shortages of essential supplies.

Trump's threats were a response to China's new restrictions on rare-earth exports, essential for high-tech manufacturing.

          <p>National Guard troops have begun patrols in Memphis as part of a federal task force established by President Trump to combat crime in the city. While operating under the governor's command, this deployment differs from others where the Trump administration directly activated Guard members in Democratic-led cities. The task force aims to reduce crime, enforce immigration laws, and assist local police, with Guard members serving in unarmed support roles as "eyes and ears." Local leaders, including Mayor Paul Young, express caution, questioning the Guard's effectiveness in curbing crime despite welcoming support for community beautification efforts.</p>
