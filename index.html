          <p>President Trump confirmed a second military strike on a boat allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela, resulting in three fatalities. This action follows a similar strike two weeks prior and represents a continued use of lethal military force against criminal enterprises, a strategy enabled by designating drug cartels as terrorist organizations. Critics, including Republican Senator Rand Paul, have questioned the legality and morality of these operations, which bypass traditional law enforcement interdictions and trials. The administration has yet to provide a full legal justification for the strikes.</p>

          <p>The separation between actress Denise Richards and Aaron Phypers has grown more contentious, with Phypers accusing Richards of leaving their mansion "trashed" and filled with her dogs. Richards counters that Phypers and his family damaged the property and prevented her from retrieving her belongings, including her pets. This dispute unfolds amid serious allegations from Richards, who previously obtained a restraining order claiming Phypers was physically and violently abusive during their relationship, accusations he has publicly denied. The legal battle continues to intensify as both parties present conflicting claims.</p>

          <p>President Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should move from quarterly to semi-annual earnings reports to encourage a focus on long-term strategy over short-term profits. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reportedly reviewing the proposal, which could be implemented by a majority vote at the commission without congressional approval. Supporters argue the change would save money and reduce pressure on management, while critics contend it would decrease transparency and deprive investors of timely information about public companies.

          <p>Stephen Miran, President Trump's nominee for the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, has cleared a key procedural vote in the Senate, setting him up for final confirmation. Miran's appointment has drawn criticism from Democrats due to his intention to remain as chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisors while serving at the Fed. This dual role raises significant concerns about the central bank's political independence, especially as it considers potential interest rate cuts amid pressure from the administration.

          <p>Valentino Luchin, a well-known 62-year-old chef in the San Francisco Bay Area, was arrested for allegedly robbing three different banks within a single day. Police say he passed notes to tellers demanding money at each location before being identified and apprehended. This is not Luchin's first encounter with such charges; in 2018, he admitted to robbing a bank, citing severe financial struggles after his restaurant closed. He now faces multiple new charges of robbery and attempted robbery.</p>

          <p>Researchers are releasing a non-toxic, fluorescent pink dye into the Santa Monica Bay to study ocean circulation patterns and their effect on water quality. The study, led by UCLA and Heal the Bay, aims to understand how a man-made breakwater from the 1930s may be trapping pollutants and contributing to the area's consistently poor water quality ratings. By tracking the dye's movement, scientists hope to gather data that could lead to solutions for improving the health of one of California's most notorious "beach bummers."</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China is capitalizing on a shift in the global order, gaining momentum as the world moves away from a unipolar, US-led system for the first time since the Cold War. Citing examples like Kenya's de-dollarization and new energy pipelines, the author suggests Beijing's influence is expanding across Africa, Europe, and Asia. However, China faces its own economic challenges, including slowing export growth, which means it cannot yet replace the purchasing power of the West. The piece questions how Beijing will use its growing power to reshape global trade and development.</p>

          <p>President Trump responded to the killing of a Dallas motel manager, Chandra Nagamallaiah, by blaming the presence of the suspect, a Cuban national, on the previous administration's immigration policies. The suspect, Yordanis Cobos-Martinez, was under a final deportation order but remained in the U.S. because Cuba refused to accept him due to his criminal record. Trump used the brutal crime to emphasize his administration's hardline stance on immigration enforcement and the deportation of non-citizens with criminal histories. The case highlights the complexities of international deportation agreements and their impact on domestic public safety.</p>

The deal is intended to resolve long-standing U.S. national security concerns over the app's ownership by the Chinese company ByteDance and potential access to American user data.

          <p>Tesla's board is proposing a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth nearly $900 billion if he grows the company to an $8.5 trillion valuation. The plan is seen as an attempt to incentivize Musk to dedicate his full attention to Tesla amidst his growing portfolio of other companies and political activities. Musk, who currently owns about 13% of Tesla, had expressed a desire to increase his stake to around 25%. The proposal underscores the board's belief that Musk's personal involvement is critical to the company's extraordinary market valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite a recent 3-0 derby loss to Manchester City and growing external pressure, senior club officials reportedly remain supportive of Amorim.

The analysis by the California Budget and Policy Center adjusts for the state's high cost of living, particularly housing, which is the primary driver pushing millions into poverty. The rate has climbed significantly from a low of 11% in 2021, a period when expanded pandemic-era public benefits temporarily alleviated financial hardship.

This landmark legislation, officially the Public Office (Accountability) Bill, aims to end the "culture of cover-ups" seen after the 1989 Hillsborough football stadium disaster, where 97 fans died. Campaigners, including families of the victims, welcomed the news, expressing hope that the law will prevent other families from enduring the prolonged struggle for truth and justice that they faced for decades. The bill will be introduced to Parliament on Tuesday.</p>

          <p>The introduction of the Hillsborough Law marks a pivotal moment for campaigners who have fought for justice for 36 years since the 1989 stadium disaster. This article explains that the law was conceived to address two key injustices exposed by the long-delayed inquests: the lack of a legal duty for public authorities to cooperate transparently and the gross imbalance in legal funding between state bodies and victims' families. The legislation aims to create a "duty of candour" and ensure parity of legal funding, preventing future cover-ups and ensuring a level playing field for those affected by state-related tragedies.</p>

          <p>A second instance of an endangered orca carrying its dead newborn has been observed in Washington's Salish Sea, highlighting the species' struggle for survival. The whale, identified as J36, was seen pushing her deceased female calf, which was estimated to be near full term. This behavior mirrors that of another orca, Tahlequah, who famously carried her dead calf for 17 days in 2018. The Southern Resident orca population is down to just 73 individuals, facing threats from pollution, vessel noise, and a critical lack of their primary food source, Chinook salmon.</p>

          <p>Amazon is rolling out an AI feature called "Hear the Highlights," which provides short, AI-voiced audio summaries of product information and customer reviews. The tool uses a large language model to distill content from product descriptions, web information, and thousands of user comments into a concise audio clip. While this could help shoppers navigate vast numbers of reviews, it also raises questions about whether AI can capture the nuance and specific details that human readers often seek. The move represents a potential shift from relying on individual human experiences to AI-curated information for purchasing decisions.</p>

          <p>Shares of CoreWeave, a cloud infrastructure provider for AI, jumped nearly 8% following the disclosure of a purchase agreement with Nvidia worth at least $6.3 billion. Under the deal, Nvidia is obligated to buy any of CoreWeave's unsold computing capacity through April 2032. CoreWeave, which is backed by Nvidia, is a major customer for the chipmaker's GPUs, renting out the high-demand hardware to its own clients. The agreement signals strong confidence in CoreWeave's role in the expanding AI ecosystem and has helped its stock triple since its IPO in March. (not investment advice)</p>

The appointments come just before a key meeting to decide on recommendations for fall COVID-19 boosters.

          <p>Social justice activist Reverend William Barber condemned the "brutal, ugly" assassination of Charlie Kirk while also calling for a denunciation of all political violence. Speaking on the anniversary of the 1963 Birmingham church bombing, Barber appeared to critique Kirk's brand of right-wing Christianity, labeling it "religious nationalism." He argued that true faith must challenge injustice and warned against using religion as a cover for immoral policies or to "sanctify wrong." Barber stressed that if people were not bothered by political violence until Kirk's death, that selective outrage must also be challenged.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News poll shows Zohran Mamdani with a significant lead in the New York City mayoral race, primarily driven by voters' overwhelming concern about the city's unaffordability. The poll indicates that voters desire a candidate who can bring change over one with experience, a sentiment that benefits Mamdani and leaves incumbent Mayor Eric Adams far behind. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo is more competitive among voters whose top issue is crime. The poll also reveals that President Trump is a factor, with a majority of voters preferring a mayor who would oppose him.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis argues that while President Trump's deployment of federal forces in Washington, D.C., may have coincided with a short-term dip in crime, it could have long-term negative consequences. The heavy-handed approach risks poisoning the relationship between the community and police, disrupting the local economy, and undermining successful community-led violence intervention programs that have lost funding. Experts suggest that any sustainable crime reduction relies on trust and economic stability, both of which are being threatened by the federal surge. The piece concludes that the crackdown could ultimately engineer the very disorder it claims to be fighting.</p>
