        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has utilized new "golden share" rights to block U.S. Steel from shutting down its Granite City, Illinois, plant. This power, a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel, grants the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. The move, which saved nearly 800 jobs, marks the first use of these rights and highlights the administration's increasing intervention in the private sector. This intervention aligns with President Trump's promises to protect American steelworkers and manufacturing jobs.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a nearly two-hour phone conversation, described by both sides as productive and constructive, covering trade and technology control. The call has raised hopes for increased stability in U.S.-China relations, with Trump announcing plans for a meeting at the APEC summit and a visit to China early next year. Despite the positive tone, analysts remain cautious, pointing to ongoing friction over issues like Taiwan, the South China Sea, and potential U.S. tariffs related to China's purchase of Russian oil.</p>

          <p>In her new book "107 Days," former Vice President Kamala Harris acknowledges reservations about the participation of transgender athletes in women's sports. She states agreement with concerns about biological factors like muscle mass, suggesting a common-sense approach is needed to ensure fairness without demonizing transgender individuals. This revelation provides insight into her previously unstated position on a culturally significant issue that played a role in the 2024 election. The article notes her campaign's struggle to counter political attacks on this topic.</p>

          <p>The United States appears to have shifted to a less public approach regarding its naval warship transits through the sensitive Taiwan Strait since President Trump's return to office. While such operations were regularly announced under the previous administration, there have only been three known transits this year, which were confirmed only after media inquiries. Beijing, which has historically protested the "public hype" of these freedom-of-navigation operations, has noted the change. Chinese observers suggest this is a tactical shift by the U.S. rather than a substantive change in its policy toward the region.</p>

          <p>A growing number of American students are applying to universities in Europe, the UK, and Asia, driven by the high cost of U.S. higher education and domestic political turmoil. Data shows a significant increase in interest, with applications to UK universities from the U.S. rising 14% this year. Students are attracted by lower tuition fees abroad but also express concerns about safety and the political landscape in the United States.

          <p>More than 1,000 people crossed the English Channel in small boats on Friday, reaching a new record for this point in the year with over 32,000 arrivals in 2025. This occurred on the same day the UK government confirmed it had deported two men to France under a new "one-in-one-out" agreement. The deal allows the UK to return a migrant to France in exchange for accepting another with a strong asylum case. While ministers hope the plan will act as a deterrent, critics have called the small number of returns so far "pathetic."</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released and returned to the UK after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, who had lived and run a charitable training program in the country for decades, were detained in February for allegedly breaking Afghan laws, though the specific reasons were never disclosed. Their release was secured following negotiations brokered by Qatar. Despite their ordeal, the couple and their family have expressed a desire to return to Afghanistan to continue their work if possible.</p>

          <p>American consumers are facing higher grocery bills, with food prices experiencing their fastest monthly increase since 2022. According to food industry analyst Phil Lempert, three primary factors are driving this inflation: the Trump administration's tariffs, the effects of climate change on agriculture, and a shortage of farm workers. These pressures increase costs for producers, who then pass them on to consumers through higher prices or "shrinkflation," where package sizes are reduced. Consumers are adapting by seeking deals and trying to reduce food waste to manage their budgets.</p>

This reaction stems from concerns that the Fed may be easing its focus on inflation at a time when the economy remains steady. The increase in long-term yields directly impacts consumers by raising the cost of mortgages, auto loans, and credit card debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democrats are voicing concern over large banners displaying President Donald Trump's portrait and the slogan "American Workers First" on several federal buildings in Washington D.C. A report from Senator Adam Schiff alleged at least $50,000 in taxpayer funds were used for the banners, which critics have compared to propaganda in authoritarian states. Republicans have defended the displays, pointing to signage used during the previous administration to promote its initiatives. The controversy highlights the debate over the use of federal resources and the perceived politicization of government agencies.</p>

          <p>Meta has unveiled its new $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display smart glasses, the company's first consumer glasses featuring a built-in translucent display. The device allows users to see simple visuals like messages and photo previews in their field of view, controlled by hand gestures via a high-tech wristband. A hands-on trial revealed the technology is novel, particularly the gesture controls for actions like adjusting volume, but the display can be difficult to focus on. The glasses represent a significant step in Meta's long-term vision of moving computing from smartphones to wearable displays.</p>

          <p>Bad Bunny's 10-week concert residency in his native Puerto Rico has drawn hundreds of thousands of fans to the island, creating a new model of immersive concert tourism. While the event celebrates Puerto Rican culture and was expected to boost the local economy, it also raises complex questions. The influx of visitors strains resources and contributes to a tourism-driven economy linked to rising housing costs and gentrification, issues Bad Bunny himself has highlighted in his music. The residency thus embodies the tension between celebrating a place and the potential negative impacts of inviting the world to it.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that the Trump administration's aggressive immigration raids, while intended as a crackdown, are actually highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive immigration reform. The raids have negatively impacted key sectors of the economy like agriculture and construction, causing labor shortages and economic disruption. This has led even some Republican lawmakers in California to call for a more nuanced approach, focusing deportations on criminals and creating a workable permit process for essential immigrant laborers. The author suggests the economic self-sabotage of current policies makes the practical case for reform clearer.</p>

          <p>Several German states are updating their centuries-old burial laws to reflect modern wishes, with Rhineland-Palatinate enacting the most significant changes. The new legislation will permit river burials in the Rhine, allow families to keep a loved one's urn at home, and sanction the creation of "memorial diamonds" from ashes. These changes cater to a growing trend towards more personalized and secular forms of mourning, as cremation rates rise and traditional cemetery use declines. While the move is supported by funeral directors, it has drawn criticism from Christian churches.</p>

          <p>A report that President Trump has paused a $400 million weapons aid package to Taiwan is fueling speculation that he is using the island as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations with China. The timing of the reported pause, just before a phone call between Trump and Xi Jinping, has alarmed analysts. During his second term, Trump has expressed a cooler stance on supporting Taiwan compared to his first. Critics worry it creates an opportunity for Beijing to pressure Taiwan and could signal a shift in U.S. commitment to the island's defense.</p>

          <p>A recent article highlights that a significant portion of the U.S. population faces daily financial stress, with over half worrying about money every day. The report outlines three basic indicators of financial health: not living paycheck-to-paycheck, not worrying about finances daily, and having some retirement savings. Meeting just one of these criteria places an individual ahead of roughly 50% of Americans, underscoring widespread financial insecurity. For instance, 41% of Americans have no retirement savings at all, a figure that rises to 61% for young adults. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To help consumers determine if a car purchase is affordable, financial experts suggest using the "20-4-10" rule as a guideline. The rule recommends making a down payment of at least 20%, financing the car for no more than four years, and ensuring total monthly transportation costs do not exceed 10% of your monthly income. Adhering to this framework can help buyers avoid becoming "upside down" on their loan and prevent transportation costs from consuming too much of their budget. It serves as a strong starting point for making a sound financial decision. (not investment advice)</p>
