          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has voiced concerns that the artificial intelligence market is currently in an investment bubble, drawing parallels to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. While affirming his belief in AI's long-term importance, he noted that investor overexcitement is creating pockets of overvaluation for companies with weaker fundamentals. His comments align with similar warnings from other financial experts who have pointed to the rapid surge in AI-related spending and valuations. This perspective adds a layer of caution to the otherwise bullish outlook on the AI industry's growth trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Union diplomats in Beijing are reportedly considering skipping an upcoming Chinese military parade commemorating the end of World War II. According to sources, the potential boycott is due to the confirmed attendance of Russian President Vladimir Putin, which is seen as problematic amid Moscow's intensified aggression in Ukraine. The event is a significant showcase for China's military capabilities and global influence, making the potential absence of EU representatives a notable diplomatic statement. This situation highlights the ongoing geopolitical tensions between the EU, China, and Russia.</p>

          <p>Peter Navarro, a trade advisor to former President Donald Trump, has publicly called for India to halt its procurement of Russian crude oil, arguing that these purchases are undermining international sanctions against Moscow. In an op-ed, Navarro described India's actions as "opportunistic" and stated that continued trade with Russia is incompatible with being a strategic partner of the United States. His remarks follow the Trump administration's recent imposition of additional tariffs on India over this issue. India has defended its position, citing energy security needs and pointing out that other nations continue to trade with Russia.</p>

          <p>Chinese semiconductor company Cambricon Technologies is planning to raise nearly 4 billion yuan (US$560 million) to fund further development of its artificial intelligence chips. This move aims to bolster the company's position as a domestic challenger to industry leader Nvidia and supports China's broader goal of technological self-sufficiency. The fundraising plan has received approval from the Shanghai Stock Exchange and comes as Cambricon's stock price has surged over the past year. The company is benefiting from government directives for publicly owned computing hubs to source a majority of their chips from domestic producers.</p>

          <p>The city of Helsinki, Finland, has successfully recorded a full year with zero traffic-related fatalities, a significant achievement for a city of its size. This success is attributed to its "Vision Zero" program, which involves comprehensive smart city planning, including reducing speed limits to 30 km/h on most streets and utilizing data to identify and fix dangerous intersections. The initiative also focuses on improving infrastructure for pedestrians and cyclists and enhancing public transportation to reduce the number of cars on the road. Helsinki's model serves as a case study for other major cities aiming to improve road safety.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul, during his first official trip to Japan, has emphasized a strengthened partnership between the two nations to address what he termed China's "increasingly aggressive" behavior. Wadephul called out Beijing for threatening to unilaterally change borders in the Asia-Pacific and for its critical support of Russia's war in Ukraine, stating the conflict would not be possible without Chinese dual-use goods. The meeting between the G7 members highlighted shared values of democracy and the rule of law. Both nations underscored the need for close cooperation to counter threats to the established international order.</p>

Raducanu will be partnering with Spanish star Carlos Alcaraz, while Draper is teaming up with American Jessica Pegula in the newly formatted, 16-pair tournament. The two-day event, which precedes the main singles tournament, has drawn some criticism for its standalone scheduling. Draper and Pegula are the top-seeded pair due to their high singles rankings, competing for a total prize pool of $1 million at Flushing Meadows.</p>

          <p>Netflix is set to remove a significant number of movies and television shows from its streaming library, including the critically acclaimed but graphic 2018 film "The Nightingale" and the iconic TV series "Lost." Directed by Jennifer Kent, "The Nightingale" is noted for its brutal depiction of violence and sexual assault in 19th-century Tasmania, which caused walkouts during its theatrical run. The departure of "Lost," a cult classic that recently celebrated its 20th anniversary, will also be a notable absence for subscribers. This regular content rotation includes both licensed titles and, increasingly, some Netflix Originals.</p>

While the hurricane is not expected to make direct landfall on the U.S. mainland, the National Hurricane Center warns it will generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. Eastern Seaboard throughout the week. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for the Turks and Caicos and parts of the Bahamas, which are expected to experience heavy rain and potential flash flooding. The storm's intensity is fluctuating due to an eyewall replacement cycle, but it is forecast to remain a dangerous major hurricane for several days.</p>

          <p>This opinion article by Nesrine Malik argues that the Israeli military is deliberately targeting and killing talented Palestinian journalists in Gaza to silence their reporting and control the global narrative of the conflict. The author contends that these journalists are not militants, as sometimes claimed, but are professional, dignified reporters who have been systematically failed by their Western media colleagues. The piece highlights the personal stories of several killed journalists and suggests their credibility is a threat to Israel's justifications for its military actions. It calls for a re-evaluation of how Israeli military claims are reported by international media.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have successfully converted human stem cells into dopamine-producing brain cells and transplanted them into mice with depression-like symptoms. The study, published in Cell Stem Cell, found that the grafted cells helped reduce behaviors associated with anxiety and anhedonia, the inability to feel pleasure. This development provides proof-of-concept for a potential new cell therapy to treat neuropsychiatric disorders like major depression. By directly targeting and repairing dysfunctional neural circuits involved in mood regulation, this method could offer a new avenue for patients with treatment-resistant depression.</p>

          <p>As Ukrainian and European leaders meet with Donald Trump to discuss a peace deal with Russia, the focus remains on the devastating human cost of ceding territory. Recent reporting from the frontlines reveals that entire communities have been eradicated, with civilians bearing the brunt of a conflict that has seen casualties reach a three-year high. For many Ukrainians, the concept of a "land swap" is not a simple transaction but the permanent loss of homes, livelihoods, and a way of life. There is widespread skepticism that any ceasefire with Russia would be lasting, with many believing it would only be a temporary pause before further aggression.</p>

          <p>Zimbabwe is experiencing a sharp increase in malaria cases and deaths this year, a crisis that experts link directly to U.S. aid cuts initiated by the Trump administration. The funding withdrawal debilitated the country's primary malaria research and prevention program, leading to a resurgence of the once-contained disease. Between January and May, malaria-related deaths more than tripled compared to the previous year, and total cases are approaching 120,000. Without sufficient funding for control measures like mosquito nets and medicine, health officials warn that lives are being lost and that the situation could spiral further, exacerbated by climate change creating more favorable breeding conditions for mosquitoes.</p>

          <h2>Shanghai Composite Index Reaches 10-Year High Amid Strong Investor Interest</h2>

          <p>Chinese stocks have rallied, with the Shanghai Composite Index climbing to its highest level in a decade as investors shift capital from low-yield bonds and deposits into the equity market. The key index rose 0.9 percent to close at a level not seen since August 2015, reflecting a strong risk-on sentiment among mainland investors. This turnaround follows years of underperformance, with the appeal of stocks growing as returns on fixed-income products diminish. The yield on China's 10-year government bond has risen, while companies on the CSI 300 Index offer a more attractive average dividend yield. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests European Leaders Aim to Guide Trump's Approach in Ukraine Peace Talks</h2>

          <p>The hastily arranged White House meeting between President Trump, President Zelenskyy, and multiple European leaders is an unprecedented diplomatic moment aimed at shaping a potential peace deal for Ukraine. European leaders have reportedly worked to build individual relationships with the unpredictable U.S. president precisely for a moment like this. Their strategy is expected to involve flattering Trump for creating the opportunity for peace while gently warning against a deal that capitulates to Russia. A key objective is to gain clarity on what was discussed between Trump and Putin, particularly regarding security guarantees and potential territorial concessions.</p>

          <h2>China's Annual Report Criticizes U.S. for Using Human Rights as a Political Tool</h2>

          <p>China has released its latest annual report on human rights in the United States, accusing Washington of using the issue as a "bargaining chip" and a "prop for political theatre." The report criticizes the U.S. for what it describes as a deeply unequal society, systemic racism, and the politicization of its justice and electoral systems. It specifically points to the 2024 election year as being "fraught with political violence" and controlled by money. The document alleges that immigrants are used as scapegoats by political parties, reflecting China's ongoing effort to counter U.S. criticism of its own human rights record.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expanding its federal law enforcement presence in Washington, D.C., with National Guard troops from West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio set to be deployed to the city. This move follows an initial deployment aimed at addressing crime, a policy that has been met with criticism from crime prevention workers who argue it fails to address systemic issues. The expansion of this controversial policy has put other Democratic-led cities on alert, with mayors vowing to protect their jurisdictions from similar federal interventions. The deployment marks a new phase in the administration's approach to crime in the nation's capital.</p>

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words and phrases this year, including several terms born from internet culture and popularized by younger generations. Among the new entries are "skibidi," a nonsense word from a viral YouTube series, "delulu," a shortened form of delusional, and "tradwife," describing women who adopt traditional gender roles. Other additions like "lewk" (a distinctive look) and "inspo" (inspiration) reflect the significant influence of online trends on the evolution of the English language. Lexicographers noted that such terms are only added when they demonstrate lasting power and widespread use.</p>
