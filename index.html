Minnesota Governor Tim Walz expressed his dismay on X, describing the incident as a "horrific" event that transformed a celebration into a moment of fear and sadness, extending his thoughts to all those affected by the senseless violence.

Hamas proposed releasing 10 living Israeli hostages and 18 dead hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.

          <p>The Philippines' National Greening Program (NGP), one of the world's largest reforestation efforts, faces questions regarding its effectiveness, with satellite data and field reports suggesting that it is not truly restoring forests. An analysis of satellite images indicates that deforestation occurs on NGP land, with native trees being cleared to grow cash crops. Communities managing the sites often have short-term access and are required to grow single cash crops, leading to unsustainable practices. The investigation suggests a pattern of "greenwashing," where commodities are falsely grown under the sustainable banner.</p>

          <p>Germany is experiencing severe drought conditions due to exceptionally dry soil, particularly in the north and northeast, with the period from February to mid-April 2025 being the driest in 100 years. The lack of rain is impacting agriculture, groundwater levels, and even retail prices, with plants already showing signs of drought stress. Experts warn that increasing global warming will exacerbate the problem, leading to more frequent and intense droughts. The German Association of Towns and Cities has urged citizens to conserve drinking water, highlighting the severity of the situation.</p>

          <p>Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst faced intense questioning from constituents during a town hall regarding her support for President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Attendees focused on proposed cuts to safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP, leading to heated exchanges. When someone in the crowd stated that "People are going to die," Ernst responded, "Well, we all are going to die," which elicited disapproval from the crowd. The GOP budget package would provide tax cuts to the wealthy and slash funding for social programs, facing pushback in the Senate over concerns about its impact on the national debt.</p>

          <p>Delaying Medicare enrollment can result in penalties that increase premiums for life; however, individuals covered by an employer-provided health insurance plan through an employer with 20 or more employees can generally delay applying for Medicare without being penalized. Delaying enrollment allows continued contributions to a health savings account, which are no longer allowed upon Medicare enrollment. It is recommended to confirm coverage with the employer's benefits department. This article also clarifies the differences between the home sale exemption and 1031 exchanges, highlighting the conditions for each. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has criticized the introduction of a new rule clamping down on front wing flexibility at the Spanish Grand Prix, calling it "a waste of money." The FIA imposed a stiffer load test on front wings to limit their movement for aerodynamic advantage. Hamilton said the rule has changed nothing, with wings still bending and teams spending more money to make new ones. Hamilton noted that he drove it on the simulator, and it's pretty much exactly the same, potentially suggesting that the money could have been better spent on other areas.</p>

However, many autism scientists believe Kennedy is looking in the wrong place, as genetics are the most important driver of autism's development. Scientists have identified hundreds of genes associated with autism, building a convincing case that genetics are the primary cause. Researchers fear Kennedy’s fixation on outside toxins could distract from genetic research that has facilitated the development of exciting new therapies.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee is grappling with a lead poisoning crisis, with several schools temporarily closed and students testing positive for high lead levels. The city's aging school buildings, built before lead paint was banned, are the primary source of the exposure.

Milwaukee is now conducting its own inspections and blood testing clinics, but lacks the federal expertise to guide their epidemiological investigations.
