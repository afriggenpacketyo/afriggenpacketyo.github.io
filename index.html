          <p>McDonald's reported mixed quarterly results, revealing the largest decline in U.S. same-store sales since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The fast-food giant's U.S. same-store sales dropped by 3.6% due to bad weather and cautious consumer behavior. To counter this, McDonald's plans to introduce value meals and popular menu items like snack wraps to attract customers back to its restaurants. Internationally, same-store sales also experienced a slight dip in international operated markets but showed growth in developmental licensed markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the role of sport in Nazi Germany, where physical education was prioritized to promote health and fitness for a productive national economy and military readiness. Individual sports were secondary to collective activities that emphasized strength and fortitude, with compulsory exercises in Nazi mass organizations. The Nazis initially criticized international competitive sport but later used the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin as an opportunity to present themselves as a peaceful and strong state. The article also discusses the exclusion of Jews from sports and the impact of Nazi ideology on women's physical activities.</p>

          <p>Moorcroft Pottery, a renowned pottery firm based in Burslem, has ceased trading after more than 100 years, resulting in the loss of 57 jobs. The company's directors attributed the closure to increasing energy costs and falling sales, which have severely impacted the pottery industry in Stoke-on-Trent. Industry commentators and union representatives have called for government support to address the challenges facing the ceramics sector. Moorcroft Pottery, known for its colorful depictions of wildlife and geometric patterns, had a long history of royal patronage and international recognition.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk described his first 100 days in Washington leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as "very, very intense," noting progress but acknowledging it hasn't been "as effective as I'd like."

Musk stated that achieving this goal would require significant political will and dealing with numerous complaints. He characterized the bureaucracy's default mode as spending what was spent last year plus 5% indefinitely, making change difficult.</p>

          <p>Local elections in England are the first major test of the political climate since the Labour Party swept to power last year, with Reform U.K. expected to capitalize on voter frustration. Both Labour and the Conservative Party are struggling, leaving room for smaller parties like the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. Voters will elect council members and regional mayors, and a special election will replace a Labour lawmaker who resigned. The results are expected to reveal shifts in political sentiment and the performance of various parties.</p>
