          <p>The Israel Defense Forces announced that the remains of a deceased hostage were transferred from Gaza into Israel via the Red Cross. This event is part of a broader U.S.-brokered peace plan that includes the return of all hostages, both living and deceased. The transfer occurred after U.S. envoys met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to keep the fragile peace process on track following recent violence. The IDF has urged Hamas to uphold the agreement and facilitate the return of all remaining deceased individuals.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese have signed a significant agreement to bolster the supply of critical minerals and rare earths. The deal outlines a pipeline of projects valued at up to $8.5 billion, aimed at creating a secure supply chain independent of China. This strategic partnership comes as the U.S. seeks to counter China's dominance in the global rare earths market, which is essential for defense, technology, and electric vehicle manufacturing. The collaboration includes joint investments and the development of new processing facilities in Australia.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mona Hanna, a pediatrician known for exposing the Flint water crisis, has launched a pioneering program called Rx Kids to combat child poverty. The initiative provides no-strings-attached cash payments to every expectant mother in Flint, offering $1,500 during pregnancy and $500 per month for the baby's first year. Funded primarily by private donors, the program is based on global evidence showing that such aid helps families afford essentials like rent, food, and baby supplies. The model has garnered bipartisan support and is being considered for expansion.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has overturned a lower court's ruling, removing a legal barrier that prevented the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Oregon. The administration argued the deployment is necessary to protect a federal immigration facility and execute federal laws, a justification the appeals court found likely to be lawful. Local and state officials have strongly contested the federal government's characterization of the situation in Portland as violent and uncontrolled. The decision represents a significant development in the ongoing conflict between federal and local authorities over protest management.</p>

          <p>Texas Tech University officials have announced an end to the unofficial fan tradition of throwing tortillas onto the field during football games. The decision follows recent penalties against the team and a new Big 12 Conference policy that imposes fines and warnings for such actions. Athletic director Kirby Hocutt and coach Joey McGuire stated that the school would no longer encourage or permit the practice, which dates back to the 1990s. Fans caught violating the new rule could face a $100,000 fine and lose their ticket privileges.</p>
