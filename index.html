          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 50% tariff on all copper imports, scheduled to take effect on August 1, 2025. This decision follows a national security assessment identifying copper as a critical material for numerous defense and technology applications, including semiconductors, military hardware, and data centers. The U.S. currently imports nearly half of its copper, primarily from Chile, making this a significant trade policy shift. Analysts suggest this move is part of a broader strategy to protect domestic industries and secure vital supply chains for national defense. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has suspended six agents for their conduct related to the attempted assassination of Donald Trump in July 2024. The suspensions, ranging from 10 to 42 days, affect personnel from supervisory to line agent levels. This disciplinary action follows an independent Department of Homeland Security review which found that law enforcement breakdowns left Trump vulnerable. The report described the Secret Service as having become "bureaucratic, complacent, and static," leading to the resignation of its director, Kimberly Cheatle, shortly after the incident.</p>

          <p>China's space program has achieved a significant milestone, with two satellites appearing to dock in geosynchronous orbit, over 22,000 miles above Earth. This maneuver between the Shijian-21 and Shijian-25 satellites is believed to be a test of in-orbit refueling technology. While this capability has peaceful applications, some analysts note it could also be used to disable other nations' satellites. The development comes as the U.S. Space Force also pursues similar refueling technology and highlights the escalating technological competition in space between the two countries.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intent to impose a 50% tariff on all Brazilian imports, linking the trade measure to the ongoing criminal prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. In a letter, Trump called the prosecution a "Witch Hunt" and an "international disgrace," demanding an end to the legal actions. This move is unique among recent tariff threats, as it is explicitly political rather than purely economic, especially since the U.S. maintains a trade surplus with Brazil. Brazilian President Lula da Silva has stated that his country will respond with countermeasures if the tariffs are enacted.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against California, arguing the state's animal cruelty laws for egg-laying hens are unconstitutional and contribute to high egg prices nationwide. The suit seeks to block state laws that mandate cage-free systems and more space for hens, claiming they are preempted by federal law and constitute unnecessary red tape. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the action aims to free American families from "oppressive regulatory burdens." Governor Gavin Newsom's office dismissed the lawsuit as a political move, while supporters of the laws maintain they are crucial for preventing inhumane conditions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to eliminate at least 2,145 senior-level positions at NASA, targeting employees with specialized skills and management experience. According to internal documents, this move is part of a broader effort to reduce the size of the federal government through buyouts and early retirements. The proposed cuts have alarmed former NASA officials, who warn they will deprive the agency of critical expertise and cede U.S. leadership in space to competitors like China.

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered new historical sexual abuse allegations against two former senior members of the Church in Wales, including a previously convicted bishop. Victims have come forward stating their claims were ignored for decades, with one case showing concerns were raised about the bishop 13 years before his promotion. The revelations have prompted calls for a full independent inquiry into what critics describe as a systemic culture of concealment and failed safeguarding. The Church in Wales issued an apology and has committed to an external audit and a review of its internal culture.</p>

          <p>The cost of all-inclusive family package holidays from the UK has risen significantly for popular destinations like Spain, Cyprus, and Turkey. According to data compiled for the BBC, the average price for a week in Cyprus in August has increased by 23% compared to last year. The United Arab Emirates saw the largest jump at 26%. Travel industry experts attribute the price hikes to higher operational costs for hotels and airlines, including energy, food, and wages. In response, some holidaymakers are opting for shorter trips or mid-week travel to manage expenses.</p>

          <p>Communities across the U.S. are raising alarms about the environmental impact of the rapidly growing data center industry, which powers AI and cloud computing. In Georgia, residents living near data centers owned by companies like Meta and QTS report issues such as sediment-filled well water and runoff polluting local creeks. These facilities are massive consumers of water, which is used to cool their servers. While tech giants like Amazon Web Services state they are investing in water stewardship, local activists are increasingly challenging the industry's expansion, citing its strain on local resources.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against California, alleging the state's policies allowing transgender athletes to compete in women's and girls' sports violate Title IX. The complaint argues that these policies constitute illegal sex discrimination by depriving female student athletes of equal opportunities. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the lawsuit aims to protect fairness in women's sports. A spokesperson for California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned the suit as a political stunt, highlighting the ongoing national debate over transgender participation in athletics and federal regulation.</p>

As the demand for powerful GPUs for AI workloads grows, so does the need for effective cooling solutions. Finding commercial options inadequate for its scale, AWS developed the 'In-Row Heat Exchanger' (IRHX) to be integrated into its data centers. This move allows AWS to efficiently support dense computing systems like Nvidia's GB200 NVL72 rack, continuing its strategy of building in-house hardware to optimize performance and costs.</p>

          <p>In a 4-0 Club World Cup semi-final defeat, Real Madrid appeared disorganized and was thoroughly outplayed by a cohesive Paris Saint-Germain team.

The article suggests that PSG, led by the relentless Ousmane Dembélé, has successfully moved past its era of individualism.

          <p>A Utah judge has scheduled a September 5 execution by firing squad for Ralph Leroy Menzies, a 67-year-old inmate convicted of a 1986 murder who now has dementia. The decision comes despite his lawyers' arguments that his cognitive decline makes him unable to rationally understand his punishment, a standard the Supreme Court has previously considered. The judge had earlier ruled Menzies competent but scheduled a new hearing to evaluate his worsening condition. The case highlights the complex legal and ethical questions surrounding the execution of prisoners with severe cognitive impairments.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin reached a new all-time high, briefly trading above $112,000 on Wednesday afternoon. The surge in the world's largest cryptocurrency was partly attributed to a broader rally in technology stocks, led by Nvidia's ascent to a $4 trillion market capitalization. Although Bitcoin has been trading in a narrow range recently, this new record reflects continued bullish sentiment in the market. Analysts suggest that increased corporate buying and potential progress on U.S. crypto legislation could fuel further upward momentum for the digital asset through the summer.

          <p>The Trump administration is grappling with controversy stoked by right-wing conspiracy theories surrounding the late Jeffrey Epstein. Before taking office, several high-ranking officials had promoted the idea that a "deep state" was concealing explosive information about Epstein's connections. However, the Department of Justice recently stated there is no secret information to release, a declaration that has only fueled further suspicion among believers. This situation creates a political challenge, as the administration must now contradict the very theories some of its own members once championed.</p>
