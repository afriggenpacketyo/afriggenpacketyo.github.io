          <p>President Donald Trump declared he would only engage in another meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin if a tangible deal to resolve the war in Ukraine appears likely, expressing a disinterest in unproductive discussions. He voiced disappointment that the Ukraine conflict has persisted longer than the recent Israel-Hamas peace agreement, also recalling his successful mediation between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Furthermore, Trump outlined plans for an upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, aiming to finalize a comprehensive trade deal and address the critical issue of fentanyl.

          <p>A mass shooting at a large house party in North Carolina tragically resulted in two fatalities and left seven others in critical condition, with a total of 13 individuals sustaining gunshot wounds. The Robeson County Sheriff's Office reported that over 150 people fled the scene before authorities arrived, who were initially responding to a complaint about loud music. The victims identified as deceased were Jessie Locklear Jr., 49, and Nehemiah Locklear, 16. Sheriff Burnis Wilkins condemned the incident as a senseless act of gun violence involving teenagers, alcohol, and firearms, urging anyone with relevant information to assist in the investigation.</p>

The storm's core is currently near Kingston, Jamaica, packing maximum sustained winds of 90 mph. Experts warn Melissa could escalate into a major hurricane by Sunday, bringing up to nearly three feet of rainfall to vulnerable mountainous regions.

          <h2>Trump Imposes Additional 10% Tariff on Canada Over Reagan Trade Advertisement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-25 17:12:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced an additional 10% tariff on imports from Canada, citing a "fraudulent advertisement" by the province of Ontario that featured former President Ronald Reagan criticizing tariffs. Trump asserted that Canada was "caught, red handed" for allowing the ad to air during the World Series, despite an understanding that it would be pulled. This move further escalates existing trade tensions, as Canada already faces significant tariffs, including 35% on many goods and 50% on steel and aluminum. The dispute is rooted in claims by the Reagan Foundation that the ad misrepresented Reagan's 1987 speech on trade barriers.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people gathered in Valencia, Spain, to protest one year after devastating floods claimed 229 lives, demanding the resignation of regional leader Carlos Mazon.

Mazon has defended his government, citing a lack of information and the unforeseeable magnitude of the disaster, but a judicial investigation into the emergency response is currently underway.

Criminologists strongly advocate for the use of victim surveys, rather than police report statistics, to achieve more accurate and comparable cross-national data.

          <p>The historic removal of four hydroelectric dams from the Klamath River, representing the largest project of its kind in US history, has become a powerful inspiration for river restoration efforts globally. Indigenous youth from across the basin made history by being the first to kayak the river's entire length in over a century, symbolizing a new era for the vital ecosystem. Just one year post-removal, coho and Chinook salmon have remarkably returned to the headwaters, and native flora and fauna are flourishing, surpassing initial expectations. The "Paddle Tribal Waters" program, which connects Indigenous students worldwide, aims to disseminate this success story, demonstrating that large-scale river restoration is indeed achievable.</p>

          <p>California's Proposition 50, a ballot initiative proposing to redraw congressional district lines, is garnering substantial support by strategically positioning itself as a direct countermeasure to Donald Trump and Republican gerrymandering tactics.

          <p>A comprehensive four-year study conducted in Southern California revealed that nearly one in five urinary tract infections (UTIs) were directly linked to E. coli strains originating from contaminated meat, with turkey and chicken being the most frequently implicated sources. Researchers utilized genomic attribution to meticulously trace the infections, observing higher contamination rates in lower-income ZIP codes and larger "value packs" of meat. Experts emphasize that while most UTIs are effectively treatable, severe cases can escalate to life-threatening conditions, and these findings highlight how agricultural practices and policy decisions profoundly impact human health.
