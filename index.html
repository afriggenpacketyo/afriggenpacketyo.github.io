          <p>Mark Zaid, a lawyer who represented a whistleblower in Donald Trump's first impeachment case, is suing the Trump administration for revoking his security clearance, alleging it was unconstitutional retaliation. Zaid argues that the action was taken in response to his representation of Brian Murphy, a former Department of Homeland Security intelligence chief. The lawsuit claims violations of the Administrative Procedures Act, the First Amendment, and parts of the Fifth Amendment, asserting that the revocation was a politically motivated attack on the right to represent clients without fear of retribution. Zaid seeks reinstatement of his clearance and a ruling against the constitutionality of Trump's decision.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping's military modernization efforts are being undermined by an ongoing purge of top military officials, raising concerns about the competence and reliability of his commanders. This purge, involving the removal of defense ministers and senior officers, particularly within the Rocket Force, casts doubt on China's readiness for a potential invasion of Taiwan by 2027. The internal turmoil, potentially stemming from corruption or ideological differences, may weaken Xi's appetite for war, providing Taiwan and the United States with time to strengthen their defenses. While China's military has made significant advancements, battlefield leadership and political interference remain critical challenges.</p>

Government jobs are now seen as secure and stable, despite being lower-paid and more constrained than private sector roles.

          <p>A severe humanitarian emergency is unfolding in Gaza as Israel's blockade has cut off humanitarian aid and commercial supplies for over two months, leaving two million Palestinians surviving on minimal food. Relief organizations report increasing signs of starvation, with indicators detected in urine samples. Sean Carroll of American Near East Refugee Aid argues that Israel is exploiting aid as a tool of war, violating international law and potentially aiming to expel Palestinians. He calls for open humanitarian corridors and a political agreement ensuring Palestinian security and self-determination, emphasizing that sustainable peace requires dignity and mutual security.</p>

          <p>Germany is still painstakingly searching for its fallen soldiers 80 years after World War II, with the remains of 107 Wehrmacht soldiers recently interred in a forest near Berlin. The German War Graves Commission has been working for decades to find, exhumed, and rebury German soldiers across Europe. The search for the dead is a reminder that the conflict's legacy is physical and unfinished, with more than 2 million German soldiers remaining unaccounted for. The Commission frames its mission as one of identifying the fallen and ensuring they are not left to vanish without a name.</p>
