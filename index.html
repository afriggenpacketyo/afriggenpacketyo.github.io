          <p>The European Parliament denied a request from conservative members to hold a minute of silence for assassinated American activist Charlie Kirk. Parliament President Roberta Metsola cited procedural rules, stating that such tributes must be formally submitted at the beginning of a plenary session, and offered to schedule one for October. The decision sparked protests from right-wing lawmakers, who contrasted the refusal with the parliament's previous decision to honor George Floyd, accusing the institution of hypocrisy.</p>

          <p>Political figures from across the American political spectrum have condemned the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. President Trump, who announced the death, blamed "radical left" rhetoric, while former presidents Biden, Obama, Bush, and Clinton all decried the political violence. The event also caused procedural disputes in the House of Representatives over how to honor Kirk, highlighting the nation's deep political polarization. Tributes from colleagues and friends mourned his death and praised his influence on young conservatives.</p>

          <p>More than a day after the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, President Donald Trump has urged his supporters to react peacefully. This call for calm followed an earlier, more inflammatory address where he blamed the "radical left" for the killing. Trump stated that Kirk was an "advocate of nonviolence" and that he wished to see people respond in that manner. Meanwhile, authorities have reported making "big progress" in the investigation, though the gunman remains at large.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison after finding him guilty of plotting a military coup. The court ruled that he led a conspiracy to remain in power after his 2022 election loss to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The verdict, which also bars him from public office until 2033, was delivered by a 4-1 vote from the panel of justices. Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest, has called the trial a "witch hunt."</p>

          <p>Teaching unions in England are raising concerns that an increasing number of children are starting reception class lacking fundamental skills, such as being toilet-trained or speaking in full sentences. A survey of over 1,000 primary school teachers revealed that 92% have observed a decline in speech and language abilities among new students in the last two years. Experts suggest social isolation and increased screen time may be contributing factors, leaving schools to address developmental gaps that impact a child's readiness to learn.</p>

          <p>A child and baby nutritionist has provided practical advice for parents dealing with fussy eating, a common developmental phase affecting over half of children. The expert suggests five key strategies to make mealtimes less stressful, including allowing children autonomy to choose what they eat and not labeling foods as "good" or "bad." Other tips include prioritizing enjoyment at the dinner table, being mindful of a child's fluctuating appetite, and involving them in food preparation to foster familiarity and acceptance.</p>

His supporters, many of whom are young conservatives, remember him as a bold defender of Christian values who gave them the confidence to express their views. Conversely, critics recall his provocative and controversial stances on social issues, though both sides have largely united in condemning the political violence that led to his death.

          <h2>Wildlife Officials Warn of Invasive Hammerhead Worm Spreading Along East Coast</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife is warning the public about the hammerhead worm, a toxic and invasive species from Asia that is spreading in the state. These worms are destructive predators of earthworms, which can disrupt local ecosystems and impact native plant growth. Officials advise against squishing or cutting the worms, as this causes them to multiply through regeneration. Instead, they should be captured and either frozen for 48 hours or drowned in soapy water before disposal.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has predicted that Spirit Airlines will go out of business, stating that the ultra-low-cost carrier business model is no longer sustainable. Speaking at an industry conference, Kirby argued that the model, which relies on low base fares and numerous fees, is disliked by customers and cannot succeed long-term. His comments come as Spirit Airlines recently filed for bankruptcy for the second time in a year amid weak demand and high costs, while larger rivals expand into its markets.

Cramer contended that softer economic data, which could prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, is fueling the rally and that bearish money managers will need to become buyers to avoid underperforming.

Qatari officials were enraged by the strike, calling it "state terror," especially since Hamas's presence in Doha was established at Washington's request to facilitate negotiations.</p>

The author contends that this narrative ignores the significant history of far-right domestic terrorism in the U.S., including events incited by Trump himself. While acknowledging a rise in violence from the far-left, the piece asserts that data shows far-right extremists still account for the majority of attacks and that Trump's rhetoric creates a dangerous environment by selectively condemning violence.</p>

This resilience has characterized his career rise from the French second division to the Premier League and now the Champions League. His recent £55m transfer from Brentford to Newcastle was contentious, as Wissa publicly pushed for the move.</p>
