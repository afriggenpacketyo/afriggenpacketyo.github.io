        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has approved a quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut, placing its benchmark rate in the 4.00%-4.25% range in response to a slowing labor market despite persistent inflation. The decision, which saw one dissent in favor of a larger cut, was accompanied by projections indicating two more reductions could occur before the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell characterized the move as "risk management," aiming to position monetary policy more neutrally amid ongoing economic uncertainty and rising downside risks to employment.

          <p>Following the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, churches across the country are addressing the event and its graphic depiction in viral videos as many people reconcile with the traumatic loss. Pastor Ryan Visconti of Generation Church in Arizona noted that Kirk's death was particularly impactful as many viewed him as a brother in Christ, and the graphic nature of the murder scarred those who witnessed it. The article highlights the profound effect on younger generations who followed Kirk's campus activism, suggesting his willingness to die for his beliefs may inspire deeper exploration of his message.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva stated he has "no relationship" with U.S. President Donald Trump, citing a breakdown in communication between the two leaders. Lula criticized Trump's recent imposition of 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods as "eminently political," asserting that American consumers will ultimately bear the cost. He contrasted his lack of dialogue with Trump against his historically strong relationships with other world leaders, emphasizing that Trump's ties are with former president Jair Bolsonaro, not with Brazil as a nation.</p>

          <p>The state visit of U.S. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump to the U.K. has highlighted the role of "fashion diplomacy," with wardrobe choices from both the American and royal delegations drawing significant attention. Key looks included Melania Trump's striking yellow banquet dress and wide-brimmed purple hat, which observers interpreted as statements of support for her husband's agenda. The Princess of Wales, Catherine, also made a notable appearance in a golden gown and the historic Lover's Knot Tiara, underscoring the pageantry and symbolic messaging embedded in such high-profile diplomatic events.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has commenced his second state visit to the United Kingdom, a historic event for a modern U.S. leader, by meeting with King Charles III at Windsor Castle. The visit includes full royal pageantry, such as a ceremonial reception and a formal state banquet, intended to highlight the strong U.S.-U.K. relationship and celebrate the upcoming 250th anniversary of America's founding. While the official events proceeded with high honors, thousands of protestors gathered in London to demonstrate against the president's visit, carrying anti-Trump signs and Palestinian flags.</p>

          <p>Recent tax legislation under President Donald Trump, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), is creating a more complex tax code with numerous carve-outs that favor specific groups at both ends of the income spectrum. The laws extend benefits to the wealthy through pass-through deductions and reduced estate taxes, while also introducing new loopholes for tipped workers and those earning overtime, creating significant disparities for salaried, middle-class professionals. This shift reduces horizontal equity, shrinks the overall tax base, and encourages structuring work and business to avoid taxes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spanish authorities have arrested 19 individuals on suspicion of murder and torture after more than 50 people went missing from a migrant boat traveling from Senegal to the Canary Islands. Survivors reported that during the perilous journey, some passengers were accused of being "witches" following engine failures and food shortages, leading to violent attacks where victims were beaten and thrown overboard. The wooden vessel, which originally carried about 300 people, was rescued with 248 survivors, highlighting the extreme dangers faced by migrants on this route.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old solo hiker sustained serious but non-life-threatening injuries to his chest and arm after being attacked by a bear on the Turbid Lake Trail in Yellowstone National Park. The hiker encountered the animal in what officials are calling a "surprise encounter" and was able to deploy bear spray during the attack before being evacuated to a hospital. Because the attack was not considered the result of unnatural behavior, park officials have stated that the bear, believed to be a grizzly, will not be captured or killed. The trail remains closed pending further investigation.</p>

While the measure passed citywide, it failed in his district, where many residents argued the closure negatively impacted their quality of life and traffic safety. Engardio is the fifth elected official in the city to be ousted by a recall vote in the last four years, reflecting a still-potent electorate and ongoing tensions over urban development and transportation policies.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Financial Exploitation Prevention Act, is moving through Congress with the goal of providing new tools to combat the financial abuse of seniors and other vulnerable adults. The legislation would allow financial institutions, such as mutual funds, to temporarily delay transactions they suspect are part of a fraudulent scheme, giving them more time to investigate and protect potential victims. With older Americans losing over $28 billion annually to such crimes, the proposal aims to create stronger safeguards within the financial industry to prevent these losses.

          <p>Chrysler is recalling 163,735 Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs from model years 2022 through 2025 due to an issue where door trim pieces may detach while the vehicle is in motion. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the detached trim could create a road hazard for other drivers, thereby increasing the risk of a crash. The issue is related to a vehicle assembly problem, not a parts defect, and dealers will inspect and replace the trim for free.

He argued that while a courtside seat at a basketball game can cost thousands, the average concert ticket is only $72, suggesting there is still room for price growth in the live music industry.

          <p>The South Carolina Supreme Court has unanimously upheld the state's congressional voting map, ruling that partisan gerrymandering does not violate the state constitution. The lawsuit, brought by the League of Women Voters, argued that Republican legislators had unconstitutionally drawn the 1st District to ensure a GOP advantage. However, the court determined that since no state laws prohibit partisan gerrymandering, the issue is a "political question" outside its jurisdiction, effectively solidifying the current map and dealing a blow to redistricting reform advocates in the state.</p>
