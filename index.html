          <p>Shares for department store Kohl's saw a dramatic surge, echoing the meme stock rallies of previous years. The stock price experienced wild fluctuations without any clear corporate news, driven by chatter on social media forums like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. Analysts note the company's fundamentals remain weak, attributing the volatility to high short interest and retail investor enthusiasm rather than a change in business performance. This activity draws parallels to past events involving companies like GameStop and Bed Bath and Beyond. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senedd member Laura Anne Jones has left the Conservative Party to join Reform UK, becoming the party's first representative in the Welsh Parliament. The announcement, made by Reform leader Nigel Farage, has been met with anger from Welsh Conservatives, who stated voters would feel let down. Jones cited that she felt the Conservative Party was unrecognizable and that Reform was better attuned to the public's concerns, hinting at a potential leadership role within Reform's Welsh branch.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson has announced a pilot program to increase the security allowance for members of Congress in response to a heightened threat environment. Lawmakers will receive an additional $20,000 for residential security and $5,000 for monitoring services through the end of the fiscal year. The decision follows the recent shooting death of a congressional intern and attacks on two Minnesota state lawmakers, prompting calls for enhanced protection for public officials and their families.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is implementing a new policy to effectively ban people from living in recreational vehicles by imposing strict citywide parking limits. The measure, championed by the mayor as a "cleanup" effort, targets hundreds of RVs that serve as homes for those unable to afford housing. While the city is offering a temporary permit program for some current residents who agree to seek traditional housing, critics argue the policy is cruel and will displace vulnerable people without providing enough viable shelter options.</p>

          <p>This opinion article laments the announced cancellation of "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert," framing it as a significant loss for political comedy and cultural discourse. The author argues that while CBS cites financial reasons, the timing, following Colbert's criticism of parent company Paramount's settlement with Donald Trump, seems pointed. The piece posits that Colbert's show served a vital function in the Trump era by providing a mainstream platform for expressing moral outrage and calling out political falsehoods, a role traditional news media often struggles to fill.</p>

Al-Hijri is a divisive figure; critics label him a belligerent warlord escalating conflict, while supporters see him as a defender of the Druze community against the new Syrian government. His hardline stance and rejection of ceasefires have made him central to the region's instability, highlighting the deep sectarian tensions and lack of consensus within the Druze community in post-Assad Syria.</p>

          <p>A new AARP survey reveals that a growing majority of retirees are heavily reliant on Social Security, while overall public confidence in the program's future is declining. About two-thirds of retirees now depend on their monthly payments, a significant increase from 20 years ago.
