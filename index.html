          <p>A gunman killed four people, including an off-duty NYPD officer, in a shooting at a Midtown Manhattan office building that houses Blackstone and the NFL. The suspect, wearing body armor and carrying a high-powered rifle, reportedly barricaded himself on an upper floor before being found deceased from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The incident prompted a massive police response and lockdown, with witnesses describing scenes of chaos as they hid inside the building. The motive for the attack remains under investigation by authorities, who are reviewing surveillance footage and processing the scene.</p>

          <p>Ryne Sandberg, the celebrated Chicago Cubs second baseman and a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame, has passed away at the age of 65 after a battle with prostate cancer. Remembered for his nine Gold Gloves, 1984 National League MVP award, and the iconic "Sandberg Game," he was a cornerstone of the franchise for nearly his entire 16-season career. His legacy includes not only his on-field excellence but also his post-playing career as a manager and a beloved team ambassador. The Cubs and the wider baseball community are mourning the loss of a player known for his integrity and dedication.</p>

          <p>Israel has permitted more humanitarian aid into Gaza following international pressure over images of widespread starvation, but the United Nations warns it is merely a fraction of what is required. Convoys and airdrops are delivering food, yet the need far outstrips the supply, with the UN stating at least 500 trucks are needed daily. Desperation is so severe that residents are looting convoys in what aid agencies term "self-distribution." Despite Israel announcing daily humanitarian pauses in fighting, the UN reports that one in five children in Gaza City is malnourished, highlighting the catastrophic scale of the crisis.</p>

          <p>Intense rainstorms in northern China have resulted in the deaths of at least 30 people in the outer districts of Beijing. The severe weather has prompted the evacuation of over 80,000 residents from the capital city. According to state media reports, the fatalities occurred in the hilly, outlying districts of Miyun and Yanqing. The situation is ongoing as authorities continue to manage the effects of the heavy rainfall and assess the full extent of the damage.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has issued new guidance affirming the rights of federal employees to express their religious beliefs at work, including attempting to persuade colleagues about their faith. The memo from the Office of Personnel Management states that workers can discuss religion and display religious items, provided they stop if asked. While building on a 1997 Clinton-era policy, critics like the Freedom From Religion Foundation argue it unconstitutionally encourages proselytizing and could lead to workplace harassment. The guidance is part of a broader administration effort to bolster religious freedom protections for federal workers.</p>

Uribe, who served from 2002 to 2010 and was known for his hardline stance against Farc rebels, has consistently maintained his innocence and is expected to appeal the verdict.</p>

          <p>School districts nationwide are facing a potential crisis in student mental health services due to the Trump administration's abrupt discontinuation of millions in federal grant funding. The Department of Education cited issues with diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives as the reason for the cuts, which has left programs in states like Connecticut at risk of laying off counselors. A CBS News analysis reveals that 47 states already fall short of recommended counselor-to-student ratios, a problem especially acute in rural areas.

          <p>In Hancock County, Georgia, which has the highest rate of child food insecurity in the U.S., recent cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are placing immense pressure on local food banks.

The food bank is bracing for a surge in demand following federal budget cuts to SNAP and other programs that supplied food from local producers.

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing arguments over the legality of aggressive immigration enforcement tactics used by ICE agents in Southern California, including "roving patrols" and street-side arrests. A lower court judge had already blocked these operations, stating they likely violate the 4th Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches. During the hearing, 9th Circuit judges intensely questioned the Justice Department's lawyer about the constitutionality of the sweeps, which critics argue indiscriminately target people based on race and location. The case could set a major precedent for the limits of federal immigration authority.</p>

          <p>A garment factory in the southern African nation of Lesotho, which once produced Trump-branded golf shirts, is on the brink of collapse due to high U.S. import tariffs. The industry, a cornerstone of Lesotho's economy and its largest private-sector employer, has been devastated by the tariffs, which threaten the duty-free access it previously enjoyed under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa). Workers face reduced hours and potential job losses, highlighting the severe real-world consequences of U.S. trade policy on developing nations. The uncertainty has contributed to Lesotho declaring a national "state of disaster."</p>

          <p>A shooting at the Grand Sierra Resort and Casino in Reno, Nevada, has left three people dead.

Authorities have stated that the motive is unknown and there appears to be no connection between the suspect and the victims. The resort, a prominent venue in Reno, condemned the "senseless violence" as the community grapples with the tragic event at the popular tourist destination.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a new trade agreement, averting the threat of much higher tariffs from the Trump administration. The deal establishes a 15 percent tariff on many EU imports, lower than the 30 percent that had been proposed, and includes tariff-free trade on certain goods like aircraft. Additionally, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and increasing its investment in the U.S. The agreement is one of several the administration is pursuing ahead of an August 1 deadline.

          <p>This article from The Atlantic analyzes President Donald Trump's tendency to form opinions and policy based on what he sees on television, rather than on intelligence briefings or expert advice. Using his recent comments on the starvation in Gaza as an example, the piece argues this approach makes him susceptible to manipulation and misinformation. While it can sometimes align him with public sentiment, his trust in television, particularly cable news, creates a narrow and potentially distorted view of complex global events. This reliance raises concerns about the basis for his decision-making.</p>

A company named Finlete raised over $315,000 from fans who invested in Clase's career in exchange for a percentage of his income. If Clase is found to have bet on baseball, he could face a lengthy suspension or a lifetime ban, which would void his contract and nullify these fan investments.

Harrison Bader of the Minnesota Twins, a premium defender who is also having a solid offensive season, has emerged as a strong candidate. The move would aim to address the defensive shortcomings in the Dodgers' current outfield and better align the team for a deep postseason run.</p>

The 2016 case, in which a jury awarded Hogan $140 million for the publication of a sex tape, became a landmark moment in the discussion of privacy rights in the digital age. While it didn't set new legal precedent, the verdict served as a powerful jolt to the media, reinforcing the limits of First Amendment protections. The case established that even for public figures, newsworthiness does not grant an unlimited right to invade personal privacy.</p>
