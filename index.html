          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered a "binge drinking culture" and serious misconduct at Bangor Cathedral, leading to the early retirement of the Archbishop of Wales. Former choristers and staff described inappropriate events, including a "seven last shots of Christ" drinking game on Good Friday and instances of sexual assault at a cathedral-hosted Oktoberfest. The reports highlight a failure in safeguarding and governance, prompting the Church in Wales to implement new policies and conduct further reviews into the diocese.</p>

          <p>The 90-day pause on President Trump's sweeping "liberation day" tariffs is set to expire, creating renewed uncertainty for global markets and US businesses. Despite White House claims that dozens of new trade deals would be secured, few have materialized, and the administration may soon impose steep rates on numerous countries. Economists and business leaders are concerned about the impact on inflation and supply chains, as existing tariffs are already elevating costs for consumers, highlighting the administration's unpredictable trade strategy.

          <p>A protest against mass tourism and gentrification in Mexico City's popular Roma and Condesa neighborhoods turned violent, with some participants smashing storefronts and harassing foreigners. The demonstration began peacefully, with marchers calling for stricter housing laws and rent controls to combat the displacement of local residents by an influx of "digital nomads" and tourists. The unrest highlights growing local resentment over soaring living costs and the cultural impact of the city's increasing popularity as a destination for foreigners.</p>

          <h2>Critics Condemn Connecticut Law Allowing Towing Companies to Quickly Sell Seized Vehicles</h2>

          <p>A Connecticut law is drawing criticism for allowing towing companies to seize and sell vehicles just 15 days after being towed, a practice opponents call predatory. Residents in working-class neighborhoods report being targeted for minor infractions like expired registrations, then facing exorbitant fees to retrieve their cars on short notice. One company has been accused of systematically targeting apartment complexes, leading residents to form neighborhood watches to protect their vehicles from what they describe as a legal but unjust system.</p>

          <h2>Trump Signs Sweeping Tax and Spending Bill into Law on Independence Day</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed his signature "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" into law during a Fourth of July ceremony, enacting a sweeping package of policy changes. The legislation makes his 2017 tax cuts permanent while also boosting defense and border security funding and making significant cuts to federal safety-net programs like Medicaid. While the administration touts the law as a victory for the country, Democrats have condemned it, warning it primarily benefits the wealthy and will add trillions to the national debt.
