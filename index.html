          <p>A 42-year-old man allegedly stabbed eleven people at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, in what authorities described as a random act. The attack occurred near the checkout area, leaving six victims in critical condition and five in serious condition. A suspect was quickly taken into custody with assistance from a deputy and other shoppers who also provided aid to the injured. Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Walmart issued statements condemning the violence, while the FBI is providing support to the local sheriff's office investigation.</p>

          <p>Four individuals, including a husband and wife, were arrested in Fort White, Florida, on charges of aggravated child abuse involving nine children. The victims, aged 7 to 16, were allegedly kept in plywood cages, beaten, and sprayed with vinegar as punishment. Prosecutors claim the four adopted children were treated unfairly compared to the biological siblings and were ordered to lie about the abuse. An investigation began after a church member reported concerns, leading to the removal of all children from the home.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Official's Remarks on Ancient Kingdoms Rekindle Historical Sensitivities with South Korea</h2>

          <p>A senior official in China's Jilin province has called for a clearer presentation of the history of ancient kingdoms that existed in the region, reigniting a sensitive historical debate with South Korea. The issue centers on the Fuyu, Gaogouli, and Bohai kingdoms, which China claims as part of its history, while they are known internationally by their Korean names: Buyeo, Goguryeo, and Balhae. The official's comments emphasize a Chinese perspective on the kingdoms, which arose in the second century BC, potentially straining diplomatic ties over contested historical narratives.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Government Faces Online Pushback for Suppressing Coverage of Deadly Attacks</h2>

          <p>The Chinese government is increasingly censoring news about mass attacks, such as recent incidents where drivers struck pedestrians, leading to public complaints online. Since a particularly deadly attack in November, authorities have tightened information control, often releasing minimal details or scrubbing reports from the internet entirely. Experts suggest this may be an attempt to prevent copycat crimes or cover up local security failures. Despite the censorship, some citizens are demanding transparency, challenging the Communist Party's strategy of controlling information to prevent social unrest.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival civilian-led government, a move that threatens to further entrench the country's 27-month civil war. The new administration, led by RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government and stokes fears of a permanent partition of the nation. This development follows an agreement between paramilitary, rebel, and civilian groups aiming to establish a secular "New Sudan." The UN has warned this could fragment the country and undermine peace efforts.</p>

          <p>A Florida jury found former ballerina Ashley Benefield guilty of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield, rejecting her claim of self-defense. Prosecutors argued she killed him to gain sole custody of their daughter, while the defense portrayed a history of abuse and fear. The trial featured testimony about their turbulent relationship, allegations of poisoning, and a previous incident where Doug fired a gun in their home. Benefield, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison, now faces having to explain the events to her daughter.</p>

          <p>Approximately 400 passengers on a high-speed ICE train were trapped inside a tunnel near Vienna for over six hours following a power failure. The train, traveling from Vienna to Hamburg, lost power shortly after its journey began, causing the lights and air conditioning to fail. The evacuation was complicated when some passengers reportedly left the replacement train and began walking in the tunnel, forcing a secondary power shutdown for safety. All passengers were eventually evacuated via emergency exits and transported back to Vienna by bus, with two people receiving on-site medical treatment.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge has been placed on the injured list with a flexor strain in his right elbow but has avoided a more serious ligament injury. An MRI confirmed no acute damage to his ulnar collateral ligament, providing relief to the team and its fans. Judge, who leads the majors in batting average, received a PRP injection and is expected to be out for 10 days to two weeks. He first felt the pain after making a strong throw from the outfield and hopes to return initially as a designated hitter.</p>

          <p>Beyond his legendary music career, the late Ozzy Osbourne is being remembered for his role as a reality television icon on the MTV show "The Osbournes." Airing from 2002 to 2005, the series pioneered the "reality sitcom" format, offering an unfiltered look at the domestic life of the rock star and his family. The show's blend of mundane family frustrations with a rock-and-roll lifestyle captivated audiences and paved the way for future celebrity-driven reality TV. It portrayed the "Prince of Darkness" as a lovable, often confused father, creating a new dimension to his public persona.</p>

          <p>Floribert Bwana Chui Bin Kositi, a 26-year-old customs official in the Democratic Republic of Congo, is on the path to becoming a Catholic saint after being murdered in 2007. He was killed after refusing to accept bribes to allow a shipment of spoiled, potentially poisonous rice to enter the country. The Catholic Church has declared him a martyr, recognizing that he died for his Christian values of honesty and justice. His story of integrity in a region rife with corruption has been highlighted by Pope Francis as an example for young people to resist "the filth of corruption."</p>

          <p>As England fans prepare for the tense Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the intense physical and emotional reactions people experience while watching sports. Hormones like adrenaline and cortisol surge during critical moments, causing elevated heart rates and a "fight or flight" response, which is a normal sign of caring deeply. To manage these effects, experts suggest getting good rest, having a clear match-day plan, and using movement to release energy. They advise reframing the anxiety as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that provides a rare license to express strong emotions.</p>

          <h2>San Francisco Experiences its Coldest Summer in Decades with Unrelenting Cool Weather</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 18:52:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures running below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the 60s. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system, which is sitting farther west over the Pacific than usual. This has led to persistent cloud cover and increased coastal upwelling, a process where strong winds bring deep, cold ocean water to the surface, further cooling the air. The drizzly, gray weather is expected to continue, locking the Bay Area into its unusually cool summer pattern for now.</p>
