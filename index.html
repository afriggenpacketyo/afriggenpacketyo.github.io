        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the second Test at Edgbaston, India is poised for victory over England, largely due to captain Shubman Gill's exceptional batting. Gill followed a first-innings 269 with another 161 runs, allowing India to declare and set England a near-impossible target of 608. By the close of day four, England was struggling at 72-3, having lost key wickets including Joe Root. With India favored to level the series, England faces the difficult choice of attempting a record-breaking chase or playing for a draw, a strategy they have typically avoided under their current leadership.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has formed approximately 150 miles off the coast of South Carolina, leading to tropical storm warnings for coastal regions of both North and South Carolina. The storm currently has sustained winds of 40 mph and is moving very slowly, with forecasts predicting it will make landfall on Sunday. Authorities anticipate some additional strengthening before it reaches the coast, bringing heavy rainfall, potential flash flooding, and high rip currents through Monday. The National Weather Service expects rainfall totals of two to four inches, with some areas possibly receiving up to six inches.</p>

          <p>Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip on Saturday resulted in dozens of Palestinian deaths, with conflicting reports on the exact number of casualties. The violence occurred as Israel's government began examining its response to a US-backed ceasefire proposal that Hamas has reportedly agreed to in principle. Many of the casualties were reported among civilians queuing for food aid, highlighting the severe humanitarian crisis in the region. The Israeli Security Cabinet is scheduled to meet to discuss the ceasefire plan, which represents a critical juncture in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Severe flash floods in central Texas have resulted in a "mass casualty event," with at least 27 people confirmed dead, including nine children, and dozens more missing. The Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes, catching residents and officials by surprise. A children's summer camp, Camp Mystic, was severely affected, with between 23 and 25 campers still unaccounted for. Rescue operations are extensive, involving over 160 air rescues, as Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a disaster declaration to mobilize state resources for the affected counties.</p>

Burns argued against sanitizing history, stating that understanding the founders' flaws, like owning slaves, makes their achievements more powerful and accessible.

The email claimed a new spending bill signed by President Trump eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most recipients. However, the legislation only provides a temporary tax deduction, not a full elimination of taxes, a limitation due to the bill's passage via reconciliation. Former SSA officials and Democratic lawmakers have condemned the communication as a misleading, political statement from a traditionally apolitical agency. (not investment advice)</p>

Participants expressed frustration over a perceived lack of progress on key promises, such as immigration, and felt the party had not been entirely straightforward with its plans. While some voters showed sympathy for the government's challenges, many were concerned by recent U-turns, viewing them as a sign of weakness or a lack of direction.

Democracy watchdogs warn that even if these threats are not legally executed, the act of making them is an attack on freedom itself.

          <p>The proliferation of digital payment systems with pre-set tipping options has led to "tipflation," where customers feel pressured to tip in situations where they previously would not have. This phenomenon, which accelerated during the pandemic, is causing confusion and irritation among consumers who are now faced with tip requests for everything from fast-food pickups to self-service kiosks. Experts note that the design of these payment interfaces often defaults to suggesting tips of 15% or more, influencing customer behavior. This shift is changing long-standing social norms around gratuity and creating awkwardness at the point of sale.</p>

The strikes could convince Pyongyang that the U.S. is an unpredictable and untrustworthy force, thereby terminating any remaining possibility of denuclearization. Experts suggest North Korea will likely respond by making its nuclear arsenal more mobile and resilient, prioritizing second-strike capabilities and investing in hardened underground facilities.

The machine is a crucial artifact in the history of modern computing, as its innovative design solved the immense challenge of typing a language with tens of thousands of characters instead of an alphabet. The typewriter broke down characters by shape, a concept that underlies how Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are typed today. Now acquired by Stanford University, the machine represents a pivotal moment in preserving non-alphabetic languages in the digital age.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Parisians are officially allowed to swim in the Seine River, following a $1.5 billion cleanup project. The swimming ban, in place since 1923 due to pollution, was lifted at designated, lifeguarded zones, drawing eager crowds to the iconic waterway. Mayor Anne Hidalgo celebrated the milestone, which fulfills a long-held dream for the city and comes after extensive efforts to improve water quality to meet European standards. The opening provides a welcome relief from recent high temperatures and marks a historic moment of urban renewal for the French capital.</p>

          <p>At Oregon State University's Big Fish Lab, scientists are working to change the public's negative perception of sharks while studying their crucial role in marine ecosystems. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team researches hundreds of sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay, examining their stomach contents to understand their diet and the overall health of the bay. This research provides vital information, as the health of these apex predators is a key indicator of the ocean's well-being. Despite public fascination with sharks, the scientists note that securing financial support for this essential conservation research remains a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has elaborated on his idea for a new political party, suggesting the "America Party" could strategically focus on a small number of pivotal House and Senate races. By winning just a handful of seats, he argues the party could hold the deciding vote on contentious legislation, given the narrow partisan margins in Congress. This proposal comes amid a public feud between Musk and President Trump over a new spending bill. Musk, who previously supported Trump's 2024 campaign, is now positioning himself as a political challenger to the two-party system.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened a massive new luxury tourist resort in the coastal city of Wonsan, a project that took nearly a decade to complete amid sanctions and pandemic delays. The Wonsan-Kalma Coastal Tourist Area features hundreds of buildings, including high-rise hotels and amenities, designed to attract foreign currency. However, the country remains largely closed to most foreign tourists, with the exception of small, controlled groups from Russia, a new strategic ally. The resort's opening highlights the regime's dual pursuit of economic development and military ambition, while its viability remains questionable due to North Korea's ongoing isolation.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's unexpected decision to skip the BRICS summit in Brazil has fueled speculation about potential political turbulence within China and growing rifts within the bloc of emerging economies. While the official reason given was a "scheduling conflict," analysts suggest it could signal internal power struggles or reflect rising tensions with other BRICS members like India. Xi's absence, with Premier Li Qiang attending instead, is seen by some as a sign of weakness, while others argue it shows China's confidence in its dominant position within the fragmented group.

          <p>A doctor working in a public hospital describes how new work requirements for Medicaid will create insurmountable bureaucratic hurdles for the most vulnerable patients. The author argues that many patients, such as those who are homeless, have cognitive disabilities, or lack internet access, will lose their coverage despite being medically exempt. This "time tax" of paperwork and verification is projected to cause nearly 12 million Americans to lose insurance. The article contends that the policy is designed to save money by disenfranchising people from care they are entitled to, which will ultimately hurt patients and strain safety-net hospitals.

          <p>President Trump has issued an executive order that will increase entry fees for international visitors to U.S. national parks, with the additional revenue intended for infrastructure improvements. The order also gives preferential access to U.S. citizens for permits and lotteries. Furthermore, the directive revokes Obama-era and Biden-era policies promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the management and storytelling within national parks. This move aligns with the administration's broader effort to dismantle DEI programs across the federal government, shifting the focus of park management away from telling diverse stories.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the hobby-centric culture of Denmark, a business professor embarked on a year-long experiment to try 17 different hobbies, from pottery to pickleball. The experience fundamentally changed her life, helping her kick a doomscrolling habit, feel less lonely, and redefine self-care. She found that engaging in activities for her brain, creativity, and physical health forced her to set better boundaries and build new communities. The author concludes that actively pursuing hobbies, rather than waiting for work-life balance to appear, is a key secret to a more fulfilled and happy life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the mixed verdict in Sean "Diddy" Combs's sex-trafficking trial highlights the legal system's inability to adequately address complex cases of intimate partner violence and coercive control. The author suggests that while Combs was found guilty on lesser charges, the acquittal on the most serious counts demonstrates that existing legal frameworks are ill-equipped for such situations. The article notes that prosecutors often turn to trafficking charges due to longer statutes of limitations and more severe penalties, as domestic violence laws can be outdated. The outcome is presented as another instance where justice for survivors of abuse is not fully served.</p>

          <p>Florida was the most popular state for retirees in 2023, attracting a net influx of over 44,500 residents aged 60 and older, according to a new analysis of Census Bureau data. This continues a trend, though the number is lower than in 2022. North Carolina and Arizona followed as the next most popular destinations. The state's appeal is attributed to its tax-friendly policies, including no state income, estate, or inheritance tax, as well as its sunny weather and numerous recreational opportunities for seniors. In contrast, California saw the largest exodus of retirees. (not investment advice)</p>
