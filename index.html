          <p>Recent US airstrikes, dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer," targeted three major Iranian nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, raising fears about potential radiation leaks. While the targeted facilities are primarily for uranium enrichment and not active reactors, experts warn of chemical hazards from potential uranium hexafluoride gas releases. The International Atomic Energy Agency has not detected increased radiation levels in the region, but the full extent of the damage and the fate of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile remain uncertain. The strikes have heightened geopolitical tensions and concerns over nuclear safety.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Wipha is gaining strength and expected to become a typhoon before making landfall on China's southern coast. The storm has already caused significant disruption in Taiwan, leading to flight cancellations and heavy rainfall after passing through the Philippines. Authorities in Hong Kong and China's Hainan province are bracing for impact, with warnings of gale-force winds and potential flooding. Cathay Pacific has canceled numerous flights, and major infrastructure like the Hong Kong-Macao bridge is being closed in preparation for the storm's arrival.</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died from injuries sustained after being pulled into an active MRI machine at a facility in Westbury, New York. The man was reportedly wearing a large metallic chain around his neck when he entered the MRI room, causing the powerful magnet to draw him into the machine. The incident has highlighted the critical importance of safety protocols, as MRI magnets are always active and attract metallic objects with immense force. Experts emphasize that while such accidents are extremely rare, strict screening procedures are essential to prevent them.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Trump administration, particularly through Health Secretary Robert F.

The author criticizes RFK Jr.'s decision to stop recommending COVID-19 boosters for certain groups and downplaying the severity of a measles resurgence, which has reached a 33-year high. The article contends these actions are eroding public trust in health agencies and contributing to a dangerous decline in vaccination rates.

          <p>According to a Charles Schwab survey, the average American believes a net worth of $839,000 is necessary to feel financially comfortable. However, financial experts caution that focusing solely on this metric can be misleading and disconnected from one's actual financial reality. They argue that net worth is just a snapshot in time and doesn't capture the full picture of financial health, such as cash flow and alignment with personal values. True financial comfort, they suggest, comes from managing money in a way that supports one's life goals and emotional well-being, rather than chasing a specific number. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The prospect of President Trump attempting to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell would trigger a complex and unprecedented legal battle with uncertain consequences for the economy. Legal experts believe Trump lacks the authority to remove Powell without "cause," a standard that would be difficult to meet and likely challenged in court, potentially reaching the Supreme Court. Such a move could severely damage the Federal Reserve's independence, create market volatility, and paradoxically lead to higher long-term interest rates if investor confidence in the central bank's inflation-fighting credibility is eroded. The conflict is seen as a political maneuver by Trump to scapegoat the Fed for any economic downturns. (not investment advice)</p>

The author argues that the goal of cheap groceries is fundamentally at odds with other progressive policies Mamdani and his allies support, such as a near-doubled minimum wage, expanded worker benefits, and ethically-driven food procurement standards. These policies would inevitably increase operating costs, which would likely be passed on to consumers, undermining the core premise of the proposal.

          <p>Boxing icon Manny Pacquiao is set to return to the ring at age 46, facing 30-year-old welterweight champion Mario Barrios in Las Vegas. After a four-year absence from competitive fighting, Pacquiao insists his passion and determination are stronger than ever, aiming to become the second-oldest champion in boxing history. Despite criticism for receiving an immediate title shot, Pacquiao and his trainer Freddie Roach are confident his rigorous training and experience will overcome the age and height disadvantage. The fight card will also feature the professional debut of his son, Emmanuel Pacquiao.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has taken a significant step toward regulating cryptocurrencies with President Trump signing the "Genius Act" into law, which establishes new rules for stablecoins. The legislation, passed with bipartisan support in the House, is seen as a landmark moment for the crypto industry, which has long advocated for a clearer regulatory framework. The bill mandates that stablecoin issuers maintain full reserves and implement anti-money laundering protocols. While supporters hail it as a pro-growth measure that will cement U.S. dominance in crypto, critics worry the rules are too weak and heavily influenced by industry lobbying.

Critics point to Kennedy's unscientific views on vaccines as particularly dangerous amid a resurgence in measles cases.

          <p>The concept of the "Gen Z stare," a blank or unresponsive look from young people in conversation, has become a viral topic of intergenerational debate. Older generations describe it as disconcerting, while many Zoomers are either unaware of it or dismiss it as a reaction to their elders. Experts suggest the phenomenon may be partly a classic case of older generations complaining about the young, but also acknowledge it could be exacerbated by modern factors. The rise of digital-first communication and social development during pandemic lockdowns may have impacted how Gen Z interacts face-to-face, leading to what can be perceived as social rejection.</p>
