          <p>Larne Leisure Centre was attacked during a third night of violence in Northern Ireland, following unrest in Ballymena where 32 officers were injured and six people were arrested. The leisure centre had been providing emergency shelter for families displaced by the disturbances, which began after a protest over an alleged sexual assault in Ballymena. Masked youths threw objects at vehicles and the leisure center, causing extensive damage and forcing staff to barricade themselves inside. Police deployed dogs and water cannons in Ballymena to control crowds throwing smoke bombs, fireworks, bottles, and bricks.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the government cannot deport Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on foreign policy reasons cited by the Trump administration. The preliminary injunction, issued by a New Jersey judge, prevents the government from deporting or detaining Khalil, a green card holder who was detained in March. The ruling focuses on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that Khalil's presence would compromise U.S. foreign policy interests, with the judge stating that Khalil's career and speech are being irreparably harmed. The judge is giving the government a chance to appeal, but this marks a setback for the Trump administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to repeal environmental regulations on coal and natural-gas power plants, which is part of a broader effort to stimulate the fossil fuel industry. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) plans to repeal regulations on power plants' carbon emissions and tighten regulations on mercury and other toxins. Environmental groups are expected to sue to block the rule changes, arguing they violate environmental laws and disregard scientific evidence. Scientists warn that human-driven climate change is worsening, but the Trump administration is taking actions that could exacerbate the problem.</p>

          <p>Huntington Park Mayor Arturo Flores, a Marine veteran, addressed Marines deployed to anti-immigration raid protests in Los Angeles, emphasizing their oath to the American people, not a dictator or president. His plea came during a press conference led by Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, as over 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines were stationed in Los Angeles due to protests sparked by ICE raids. Flores criticized the militarization of immigration enforcement and the deployment of Marines on U.S. soil, calling it political theater rooted in fear. The protests were triggered by ICE raids in Huntington Park and downtown Los Angeles, resulting in over 300 detentions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has seemingly reversed course on a policy that would have restricted visas for Chinese students, stating that they are welcome at U.S. colleges and universities. This comes after U.S. officials indicated they would aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, particularly those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. Trump's announcement, made on Truth Social, was part of a brief outline of a trade deal with China. The potential policy shift has caused uncertainty among universities, which rely on international students for tuition fees and campus diversity.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the Trump administration is open to extending the 90-day tariff pause for top trading partners who demonstrate "good faith" in ongoing trade negotiations.

This suggests a potential shift in the administration's approach, as officials previously insisted on terms of an agreement before extending the pause. The tariff pause, announced on April 9, is set to expire in less than a month.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's EPA plans to repeal climate pollution limits on fossil fuel power plants, aiming to boost the economy while protecting the environment. The proposal would eliminate rules finalized during the Biden administration that required coal and natural gas-fired power plants to reduce carbon dioxide pollution. The EPA argues that U.S. power plants contribute a small portion of global emissions and that reducing it further would have little effect on public health. Environmental groups have criticized the proposal, arguing it is bad for public health and climate.</p>
