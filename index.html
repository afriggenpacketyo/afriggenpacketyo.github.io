          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to help the country defend itself against Russia's ongoing aggression. This decision reverses a temporary pause on some weapon shipments, which was reportedly part of a broader review of U.S. military stockpiles. The Pentagon confirmed the move, stating it aligns with America First defense priorities aimed at securing a lasting peace. The announcement followed recent calls between Trump, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, and Russian President Putin, with Trump expressing disappointment in his conversation with Putin.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Chinese students are choosing Singapore over the United States for their higher education, citing cultural similarities and safety concerns. Difficulties in cultural adjustment and parental worries about security in the U.S. are prompting this shift. Singapore is seen as an attractive alternative due to its high economic and diplomatic openness, warm climate, and familiar cultural environment. Industry experts predict this trend will continue, with Singapore likely to see an increase in applications from Chinese students seeking overseas education.</p>

          <p>The number of fatalities from the devastating flash floods in central Texas has tragically risen to over 100, with many individuals still reported missing. Search and rescue operations are ongoing in the mud-caked riverbanks of the Guadalupe River, though hopes of finding more survivors are diminishing. The disaster heavily impacted Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp, where at least 27 campers and staff were among the deceased. The White House has defended the National Weather Service's response against criticism that budget cuts may have hampered disaster warnings.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has begun phasing out the mandatory shoe removal rule for passengers in standard security lines at several U.S. airports. The change, confirmed by sources, is initially being implemented at airports including Baltimore/Washington International and Fort Lauderdale International, though travelers at other major hubs have also reported not having to remove their shoes. This adjustment relaxes a post-9/11 security measure that was officially adopted nationwide in 2006 following the attempted "shoe bomber" plot. Travelers with TSA PreCheck were already exempt from this requirement.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 9-1 defeat against the Milwaukee Brewers, largely due to a catastrophic first inning from pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Yamamoto gave up five runs and was pulled from the game after recording only two outs, marking the shortest start of his MLB career. The inning was plagued by a three-run homer, poor defense including a critical error by Mookie Betts, and walks, putting the Dodgers in a hole they couldn't escape. The loss was the team's fourth consecutive defeat, highlighting struggles for the shorthanded lineup.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has voted to advance a permanent ordinance aimed at preventing "renovictions," where landlords evict tenants under the guise of substantial remodels to charge higher rents. The new rule would prohibit landlords from using a remodel as a just cause for eviction unless they have a specific Government Agency Order to vacate the unit for safety reasons. The city is also developing regulations that would require landlords to provide relocation assistance or comparable temporary housing for tenants during legitimate renovations.

          <p>The deadly Texas flash floods, which killed over 100 people, resulted from a combination of geography and severe weather that struck while many were asleep. The region's topography, prone to rapid runoff, was inundated by moisture from a former tropical system and other weather patterns, causing the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes. Officials are now facing scrutiny over the timeliness of warnings and evacuations, with some survivors saying they received no alerts.

          <p>Among the victims of the Texas flash floods were two sisters from Dallas, 13-year-old Blair and 11-year-old Brooke Harber, who were staying with their grandparents near the Guadalupe River. Their bodies were recovered 15 miles downriver, found holding onto each other, a poignant symbol of their bond in their final moments. The girls, described as active and faithful members of their school and church community, were not at Camp Mystic but were in a cabin that was washed away. Their grandparents remain unaccounted for, adding to the family's and community's profound tragedy.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw was named to his 11th career All-Star team, this time as a "Legend Pick" by the MLB Commissioner. The selection, which recognizes his career achievements, came as a surprise to Kershaw, who has made only nine starts this season after returning from surgery. He expressed gratitude for the "tremendous honor," acknowledging that his performance this season alone might not have warranted the selection. This special designation has previously been used for other future Hall of Famers like Albert Pujols and Miguel Cabrera toward the end of their careers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has postponed a broad increase in import tariffs but has sent letters to 14 nations, including Japan and South Korea, detailing the specific levies they will face starting August 1. The move comes as a 90-day pause on the tariffs was set to expire. The letters outline rates ranging up to 40% for some countries, though Trump indicated the rates could be modified based on diplomatic relationships. The administration argues the tariffs protect American businesses, but economists warn they could raise consumer prices and negatively impact trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have decided not to prosecute individuals who participated in the city's Pride parade in late June, even though the event had been officially prohibited by the government. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, which was fueled by Budapest's mayor declaring it an official municipal event, potentially exempting it from the ban. Despite the government's anti-LGBTQ+ agenda and threats of fines, the march attracted a record crowd of over 200,000 people. The mayor, however, still faces a police investigation for organizing a prohibited gathering.</p>

          <p>A report from the chief inspector of prisons in England and Wales has warned that the prison system is being destabilized by an uncontrolled flow of smuggled drugs. Criminal gangs are reportedly using drones and other methods to supply contraband to inmates, fueling criminality inside prisons that inexperienced staff cannot contain. The report found that overcrowding and a lack of rehabilitative activities contribute to drug use among bored prisoners. The watchdog called the failure to tackle the issue a threat that needs to be addressed at the highest levels of government.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Education has formally refused to comply with a Trump administration directive to bar transgender girls and women from competing in female sports. The federal government's Office for Civil Rights had determined California's inclusive policy violates Title IX and gave the state a deadline to change it, threatening an "imminent enforcement action." State officials rejected this analysis, setting up a significant legal and political confrontation over the interpretation of civil rights law and states' rights. The clash centers on differing views of whether Title IX's protections based on sex extend to gender identity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the deadly flash floods in Texas, experts are highlighting that California is also vulnerable to similar catastrophic events, particularly from intense atmospheric river storms. While the specific weather patterns may differ, California's geography, with its hilly topography and numerous low-lying areas along rivers, presents significant risks. Past events, like the 2023 winter storms and the 2018 Montecito debris flows, demonstrate this danger. Climate scientists note that climate change is increasing the risk of extreme precipitation, making it crucial for the state to bolster its flood protection and public awareness efforts.</p>
