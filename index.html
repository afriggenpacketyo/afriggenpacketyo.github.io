        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the FDA announced plans to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year, contingent on voluntary cooperation from food companies. The agencies intend to revoke authorization for two synthetic food colorings and collaborate with the food industry to eliminate six others found in various common foods. While the plan relies on an 'understanding' with food companies to meet consumer demand, the International Association of Color Manufacturers has expressed concerns about the timeline, while the Consumer Brands Association indicated willingness to work with the administration. Studies suggest that these dyes may be linked to health conditions like ADHD, but scientists say the evidence is not fully clear. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fast-spreading wildfire in New Jersey's Ocean County has led to mandatory evacuations for hundreds of residents in Ocean Township, Lakewood, and Lacey Township, with the fire having consumed 8,500 acres and only 10% containment as of Tuesday night. Approximately 3,000 people have been evacuated, and over 1,320 structures are threatened. The cause of the fire, which began at the Greenwood Forest Wildlife Management Area, is still undetermined, with no injuries reported but some businesses damaged. Road closures are in effect, including parts of the Garden State Parkway and Route 532, and thousands of customers experienced power outages due to the wildfire.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lowered its 2025 GDP growth forecasts for major Asian economies like China and India, citing trade tensions and high policy uncertainty. The IMF also reduced Japan's growth forecast and lowered its global growth projection for 2025, attributing the downturn to tariffs announced by the U.S. and its trading partners. This adjustment follows a broader trend of research firms and banks cutting growth forecasts for Asian economies, influenced by increased U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and a worsening global economic environment.

          <p>New government measures will empower police chiefs in the UK to automatically dismiss officers who fail background checks, a move aimed at boosting public confidence in policing following concerns raised after the murder of Sarah Everard by a police officer.

The Home Secretary has emphasized the necessity of these changes to restore trust in policing, ensuring that only officers of the highest standards are allowed to serve and removing those who pose a risk or are unfit for duty.</p>

Higher tariffs are expected to impact exports to the US, the biggest market, causing producers to trim capital expenditure. This could lead to a reduced expansion of battery energy-storage systems (BESS) in China. The sector is already dealing with a price war after years of overproduction, which has led to a significant drop in export prices.</p>
