          <p>David Huerta, president of the Service Employees International Union California, will have his felony obstruction charge reduced to a misdemeanor following his arrest during a protest of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid. Supporters, including the AFL-CIO and Governor Gavin Newsom, had condemned the original charge as a politically motivated abuse of power by the Trump administration. Huerta's legal team stated they will seek a speedy trial to vindicate him, framing the case as an act of retaliation intended to suppress dissent and punish opposition.</p>

The club, which secured only one point in five league matches under his leadership, is now searching for its third manager this season. Former Everton boss Sean Dyche and ex-Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini are reportedly being considered as potential replacements to steer the team away from the relegation zone.</p>

          <p>A viral social media trend known as the "Great Lock-In" encourages people to use the autumn season to establish healthier routines and reset before the holidays. Experts advise starting with small, realistic goals, such as a short daily walk or adding more produce to meals, to build confidence and momentum. The focus is on progress rather than perfection, avoiding burnout by pacing oneself and anchoring new habits in daily life. The ultimate goal is to make these positive changes sustainable beyond the season by integrating them into a long-term lifestyle.</p>

          <p>In a speech at the 'No Kings' rally, journalist Mehdi Hasan condemned Republicans for labeling the protest a "hate rally" while, in his view, they frequently engage in hateful rhetoric themselves. Hasan, an immigrant, asserted his love for America's diversity and democratic principles, positioning himself and fellow immigrants as passionate defenders of the nation's values. He sharply criticized former President Donald Trump, concluding with a pointed joke that Trump's two immigrant wives prove that immigrants are willing to do jobs that even Americans won't.</p>

Criminologists argue this "migrantization" of crime is misleading, as risk factors like poverty and lack of prospects are the true drivers of crime, not nationality.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has sharply criticized the federal government for proceeding with a live-fire military demonstration at Camp Pendleton that necessitates the temporary closure of Interstate 5. Newsom accused the President of putting ego over public safety, calling the decision to fire live artillery rounds over a major highway dangerous. The California Highway Patrol ordered the closure due to "extreme life safety risk," forcing thousands of travelers to find alternate routes and causing significant delays on a critical economic corridor.</p>

          <p>Work has begun to repair the external power supply to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which has been reliant on backup diesel generators for four weeks. The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, stated that both Russian and Ukrainian forces established ceasefire zones to allow for the complex repairs, which are crucial for nuclear safety. The plant, Europe's largest, is not in service but requires constant power to cool its reactors and prevent a catastrophic incident. This marks the 42nd time power lines have needed restoration since the start of the war.</p>
