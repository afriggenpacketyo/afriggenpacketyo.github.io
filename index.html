          <p>A dermatologist recommends consuming antioxidant-rich foods to reduce skin cancer risk, emphasizing that diet plays a smaller role compared to sunscreen and avoiding sun exposure. Antioxidants such as selenium, zinc, carotenoids, and vitamins A, C, and E can counteract damage caused by UV exposure. They combat oxidative stress, may prevent the spread of cancerous cells, and help boost internal sun protection. Tips include eating a colorful diet, drinking green tea, and savoring dark chocolate.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore vetoed a bill that sought to study and recommend reparations for the harms caused by slavery and racial discrimination. Moore stated that the state had already sufficiently studied the legacy of slavery and that it was time for action rather than another study. This decision sets him apart from other Democratic governors who have approved similar measures. The bill aimed to research the number of Maryland residents with enslaved ancestors and recommend reparations, including apologies, monetary compensation, or assistance with housing and education.</p>

Kentucky’s governor, Andy Beshear, said at a briefing in London, Kentucky, that “at least 18” of the deaths were in his state. The storms were part of a weather system on Friday that killed seven people in Missouri and spawned more than two dozen tornadoes in Missouri, Kentucky, Illinois and Indiana, left several hundred thousand customers without power in the Great Lakes region and brought a punishing heatwave to Texas. The storms hit after the Trump administration massively cut staffing of NWS offices, with outside experts worrying about how it would affect warnings in disasters such as tornadoes.</p>

          <p>President Zelenskyy met with US officials in Rome, part of increased diplomatic efforts ahead of a call between President Trump and Putin on ending the war in Ukraine. The intensified diplomacy came as Russia launched its largest drone barrage against Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, after the first direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv in years failed to yield a ceasefire. Russia fired a total of 273 exploding drones and decoys, Ukraine's air force said Sunday. Of those, 88 were intercepted and a further 128 lost, likely having been electronically jammed. The attacks targeted the country's Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions.</p>

          <p>Strawberry growers in the UK are reporting a 'stonking start' to the season, with warmer days and cooler nights resulting in sweeter fruit. A combination of warm days and cool nights are known to make strawberries sweeter. The lower night temperatures allow them to rest and put the energy they have gained during the day into producing more natural sugars. While some people may prefer to keep it classic with cream, there are other options available for those who are looking to be more adventurous. Scientists have said climate change was a major factor in this weather.</p>
