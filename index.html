          <p>UK punk duo Bob Vylan sparked outrage after leading chants of "death to the IDF" during their Glastonbury Festival performance. Prime Minister Keir Starmer labeled the act "appalling hate speech," and festival organizers issued a statement condemning the comments for crossing a line into incitement. The BBC, which broadcast the set live, faced criticism and announced the performance would not be available on its iPlayer service.

          <p>Actor Vin Diesel has indicated that the final installment of the "Fast & Furious" franchise, slated for April 2027, could feature the return of Paul Walker's character, Brian O'Conner. Walker passed away in 2013 during the filming of "Furious 7," and his role was completed using a combination of archival footage, CGI, and his brothers as stand-ins. Diesel stated that bringing back the character was one of his conditions for the finale, aiming to reunite the core duo of Dominic Toretto and Brian O'Conner. This potential digital revival raises ongoing debates about posthumous performances in film.</p>

They claim that reconstruction is largely superficial, confined to main streets for propaganda purposes, while the rest of the city remains devastated. Additionally, they report that Ukrainian children are being subjected to indoctrination in schools, where they are taught a Russian version of history.</p>

          <p>A controversial provision to mandate the sale of hundreds of thousands of acres of public land in 11 Western states has been withdrawn from a Republican tax and spending bill. The measure, championed by Senator Mike Lee of Utah, faced significant bipartisan backlash from lawmakers and conservation groups who feared the privatization of cherished natural spaces. Lee stated he pulled the provision due to an inability to guarantee the land would be sold only to American families and not foreign interests or large corporations. Conservation advocates celebrated the move as a victory but remain vigilant against future threats to federal lands. (not investment advice)</p>

In his retirement announcement, Tillis lamented that bipartisanship and independent thinking have become an "endangered species" in Washington, making his decision not to run again an easy one.

Following a narrow procedural vote, Democrats initiated delay tactics, including forcing a full reading of the nearly 1,000-page bill. The process is expected to culminate in a "vote-a-rama," an overnight session of unlimited amendment votes, as Republicans push to pass the bill before the July 4th holiday.

          <p>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro held a large rally in Sao Paulo to protest his ongoing trial before the country's Supreme Court. Bolsonaro is facing charges of conspiring to stage a coup to overturn the 2022 election results, which he denies, claiming he is a victim of political persecution. Thousands of supporters attended the demonstration, despite Bolsonaro being barred from running for office until 2030 for a separate conviction of abusing his power. If convicted in the coup trial, the former leader could face a significant prison sentence.</p>

This local trend reflects a broader warning from German federal police about the radicalization of very young people.

          <p>President Trump announced that his administration is developing a plan for a "temporary pass" for some immigrant workers, particularly in the agricultural sector. In a Fox News interview, he explained the pass would allow farmers to retain experienced workers who may have entered the country improperly, suggesting farmers could have more control over the process. This proposal marks a potential shift in the administration's immigration enforcement strategy, which has recently wavered on whether to exempt industries like farming and hospitality from worksite raids. The plan aims to address farmers' concerns about losing essential long-term employees.</p>

Drawing on the history of battle damage assessment (BDA), the author explains that early evaluations are often incomplete. Given the sophisticated aircraft, precision-guided munitions like the 15-ton GBU-57 bomb, and extensive intelligence on the targets, the cumulative effect of the campaign was probably severe. This expert judgment aligns with conclusions from external analysts and even partial concessions from Iranian officials, suggesting a significant setback for Tehran's nuclear ecosystem.</p>

          <p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has signed a decree initiating Ukraine's withdrawal from the Ottawa Convention, which bans the use and production of anti-personnel landmines. This move, which requires parliamentary ratification, follows similar actions by other Eastern European nations and comes as Ukraine seeks more ways to counter Russia's offensive. In a separate development, the Ukrainian military confirmed the loss of an F-16 fighter jet and its pilot during an effort to repel a large-scale Russian aerial attack. This marks the third F-16 loss for Ukraine since the full-scale invasion began.</p>
