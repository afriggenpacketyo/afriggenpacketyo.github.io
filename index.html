          <p>Amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, Israel has reportedly killed three Iranian generals and intensified strikes on the Isfahan nuclear site. European leaders are engaged in diplomatic talks with Iranian diplomats in Geneva in an attempt to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. French President Emmanuel Macron emphasized the real risk of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons, while officials from the UK, Germany, and France acknowledged the lack of major breakthroughs but expressed openness to future discussions. The situation remains precarious as diplomatic efforts continue alongside military actions. The article provides a comprehensive overview of the complex dynamics between the involved nations.</p>

          <p>Six B-2 stealth bombers were deployed from Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri en route to Guam, potentially carrying bunker-buster bombs. These bombs are capable of targeting Iran's heavily fortified nuclear site, Fordow, which experts believe only the U.S. can destroy from the air. President Trump is expected to receive intelligence briefings regarding possible actions against Iran, amidst public disagreement with the Director of National Intelligence. Despite the U.S. not taking direct action, sanctions have been imposed on Tehran for procuring proliferation-sensitive machinery from China.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior Israeli officials suggest their military campaign against Iran could lead to regime change, significantly impacting the global oil market. Oil prices have risen approximately 10% since Israel's attack, but remain below $80 per barrel due to undisturbed oil supplies. Analysts warn of a growing risk of supply disruption, potentially triggering price spikes if the conflict intensifies. Historically, regime changes in major oil-producing countries have led to significant oil price increases, as seen during the Iranian revolution of 1979. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article highlights five reasons to appreciate air conditioning, emphasizing its importance beyond mere comfort. Air conditioning saves lives by mitigating the dangers of extreme heat, improves productivity in workplaces and schools, and enhances sleep quality. It has also enabled advancements in industries like film and microchip production, and has facilitated the growth of cities in otherwise uninhabitable regions. While acknowledging the environmental impact of air conditioning, the author advocates for more efficient units powered by cleaner energy sources, framing A/C as a necessity in a warming world.</p>

          <p>Sue Baker, a heart failure patient with a LVAD, underwent a pioneering heart-liver transplant to address her high antibody levels, which posed a risk of organ rejection. The liver transplant was intended to lower her antibody levels, making her eligible for a heart transplant. The surgery, a first for a patient with an LVAD, was successful, and Baker also donated her healthy liver to another patient in a domino operation. While the surgery has paved the way for similar treatments, Baker now faces financial difficulties due to medical bills and the sudden death of her husband.</p>
