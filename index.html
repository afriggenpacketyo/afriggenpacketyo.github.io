          <h2>Generational Swimming Rivalry Between Summer McIntosh and Katie Ledecky to Highlight World Championships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 03:00:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming world swimming championships in Singapore are poised to feature a major rivalry between Canadian teenager Summer McIntosh and American veteran Katie Ledecky. McIntosh, who is in exceptional form after breaking multiple world records, aims to win five individual gold medals, a feat only Michael Phelps has accomplished. Their most anticipated race is the 800m freestyle, an event Ledecky has dominated for over a decade but where McIntosh poses a credible threat. This showdown is seen as a potential generational shift in women's swimming, setting the stage for future Olympic competitions.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for international consensus on the governance of artificial intelligence, emphasizing the need to balance development with security. Speaking at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, Li announced a new Chinese-led body to foster global AI cooperation and prevent the technology from being controlled by a few nations. This call comes amid escalating tech competition with the United States, which has imposed restrictions on high-end chip exports to China. The premier criticized monopolistic control and advocated for open access to AI technologies for broader global benefit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Welsh women's rugby team achieved their first win under head coach Sean Lynn by defeating Australia in Brisbane, providing a significant morale boost ahead of the Rugby World Cup. After an early Australian try and a weather delay, Wales responded with two tries from Nel Metcalfe to take the lead. Despite a late first-half try from Australia, Wales extended their lead and held on with strong defense in the second half for a 14-12 victory. The performance against the world's sixth-ranked team is an encouraging sign for Wales before the two teams meet again for a final warm-up match.</p>

          <p>The pro-life group 40 Days for Life is celebrating the announced closure of two Planned Parenthood facilities in Houston, Texas, this fall, including what the group describes as the largest abortion facility in the Western Hemisphere. The organization's CEO, Shawn Carney, called the closures a "tremendous victory" for the pro-life movement, attributing it to the post-Roe v. Wade legal landscape in states like Texas. Planned Parenthood cited rising costs, staffing shortages, and low reimbursement rates as reasons for the shutdowns. The closures occur amid ongoing political and legal battles over funding for the organization.</p>

          <p>Spain's women's national soccer team is set to face England in the Euro 2025 final, marking a significant transformation since their 2023 World Cup win. That victory was overshadowed by a sexism scandal involving the former federation president, Luis Rubiales, which led to player boycotts and demands for systemic change. Nearly two years later, players and journalists report a much-improved, more professional environment, allowing the team to focus solely on their performance. This final offers La Roja a chance to win their first European Championship and celebrate a major title without the controversy that marred their previous triumph.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recovery of the luxury goods market is facing several headwinds, creating a mixed outlook despite some positive signs from industry leader LVMH. Key challenges include a drop in sales in Japan due to a weaker yen, which contrasts with a surprising sales spike in the U.S., potentially driven by consumers buying ahead of new tariffs. Consequently, many European luxury brands are planning price increases to offset these tariff costs. The market also shows significant divergence between product categories, with items like high-end leather goods and jewelry performing differently across major brands. (not investment advice)</p>

This divergence is reinforcing the perception among many African nations that China is a more reliable and beneficial partner.

          <p>Taiwanese voters are participating in a large-scale recall election targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT).

The outcome could potentially shift the balance of power in the legislature, where the ruling Democratic Progressive Party currently lacks a majority. The KMT has condemned the recalls as political retaliation, while the elections have intensified tensions over Taiwan's relationship with Beijing.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 win against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. Despite being without Mookie Betts, the team continued a recent trend of improved run production ahead of the trade deadline. Teoscar Hernández was a key contributor, drawing a bases-loaded walk and later hitting a two-run homer, while Andy Pages also had a strong performance with a double and a sacrifice fly. The improved hitting backed a solid start from pitcher Emmet Sheehan and a scoreless effort from the bullpen, giving the team a positive start to their road trip.</p>

          <p>China's quantitative hedge funds are successfully recruiting top scientific and engineering talent from the United States, capitalizing on university funding cuts and stricter visa policies under the Trump administration. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are offering competitive salaries to attract PhD candidates and graduates who might have otherwise stayed in the U.S. This influx of brainpower is crucial for the rapidly growing Chinese quant sector, which is increasingly harnessing artificial intelligence and looking to expand globally. The trend highlights a significant shift in the global competition for elite talent in the finance and technology sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>House Democrats Formally Request Epstein's 'Birthday Book' Reportedly Containing Trump Contribution</h2>

          <p>Two Democratic congressmen, Ro Khanna and Robert Garcia, have formally requested that the estate of Jeffrey Epstein provide a copy of a "birthday book" compiled for the late sex offender. The book reportedly contains messages from many powerful individuals, including a crude poem and doodle attributed to Donald Trump, which he has denied creating. The lawmakers argue the book's contents are essential for congressional oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation and the Trump administration's decisions regarding related files. They have asked for an unredacted copy of the book by August 10.</p>
