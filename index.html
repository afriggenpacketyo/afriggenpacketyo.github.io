          <p>Senate Republican Leader John Thune is pushing to pass President Trump's megabill, facing opposition from GOP members and Elon Musk. The bill extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts, increases military and border security spending, and cuts Medicaid and SNAP, potentially adding $3 trillion to the deficit. House Republicans are also threatening to derail the bill over state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap changes. Musk has criticized the bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination," while Trump expressed disappointment, stating that Musk previously understood and supported the bill. Optimism surrounding the bill's success remains uncertain given the conflicting views and potential impact on the deficit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. trade deficit experienced a record drop in April as demand for imports decreased, reversing a surge that occurred before President Trump's tariff announcements. Imports fell by 16.3%, while exports rose by 3%, leading to a deficit of $61.6 billion. Despite the decrease, the year-to-date deficit is still 65.7% higher than the same period in 2024, with the largest goods imbalances involving China, the European Union, and Vietnam. President Trump indicated that further trade talks with China are expected soon following a call with President Xi Jinping. (not investment advice)</p>
