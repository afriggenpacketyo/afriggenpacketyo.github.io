          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 14:37:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to request the unsealing of grand jury transcripts from the Jeffrey Epstein case. This move follows a report about a letter from Trump in a book belonging to Epstein, which the president claims is fake. While some Republicans have praised the decision, critics argue that releasing only the transcripts is insufficient, demanding access to other evidence like videos and FBI interview notes. The Justice Department has previously stated its review found no evidence of a 'client list' or blackmail material.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global insurance industry recorded $84 billion in losses in the first half of the year, the most expensive six-month start since 2011. A significant portion of these losses, over $30 billion, stemmed from severe convective storms in the United States, which included numerous tornadoes and damaging hail. A single storm outbreak in March is projected to cost insurers nearly $7.7 billion. With California wildfires also contributing massively, reports indicate the industry is on track to exceed $100 billion in total annual losses, establishing a new market reality.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, securing access to valuable offshore oil reserves in Guyana. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. Chevron's CEO expressed satisfaction with the ruling, which affirms that such rights do not apply to corporate-level mergers. The company anticipates some job reductions as it integrates Hess into its operations.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, savers are weighing the benefits of long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) against more flexible money market accounts. While money market accounts currently offer slightly higher interest rates, these rates are variable and subject to change with market conditions. In contrast, CDs provide a fixed, guaranteed return for the duration of their term, which may offer more security for risk-averse individuals. The choice depends on a saver's priority between flexibility and guaranteed long-term returns (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new report has shed more light on the historical friendship between Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, focusing on a 2003 'birthday book' message allegedly from Trump. The article details their frequent socializing in the 1990s and early 2000s, including Trump's 2002 description of Epstein as a 'terrific guy.' While Trump denies the authenticity of the birthday book message, it adds to the public record of their association, which reportedly ended after a dispute in 2004. The piece provides context on their relationship before Epstein's subsequent legal troubles.</p>

Her decade-long 'Missing Princes Project' reportedly uncovered evidence suggesting the elder prince, Edward, later re-emerged as the pretender Lambert Simnel.

          <p>Meta has announced it will not sign the European Union's voluntary AI code of practice, arguing that its provisions are an overreach that will hinder innovation. The company's global affairs chief stated that the code introduces legal uncertainties and goes beyond the scope of the EU's AI Act, which could throttle the development of advanced AI models in Europe. While some companies like OpenAI have committed to the code, others, including ASML and Airbus, have also raised concerns, creating a divide in the tech industry's response to the new regulations.</p>

          <p>The traditional royal 'swan upping' ceremony on the River Thames has revealed a positive trend for the swan population, with numbers beginning to recover after a significant decline. The five-day census found 115 young swans, a notable increase from the 86 counted last year, suggesting a reversal of the 45% drop seen over the past two years. The decline was attributed to avian flu and human cruelty. While the numbers are still below previous highs, the results offer a hopeful sign for the conservation of this iconic royal bird.</p>

          <p>An atypical weather system is bringing a chance of scattered showers and thunderstorms to Southern California, along with a significant risk of dry lightning. Meteorologists warn that these conditions could easily ignite wildfires, as lightning can strike outside of areas receiving rain. The rare July monsoonal moisture, fueled by a low-pressure system in Mexico, is expected to move across the region through the weekend. Officials are urging residents to remain vigilant and stay indoors if they hear thunder due to the deadly potential of lightning strikes.</p>

          <p>According to reports, President Trump is demanding a minimum tariff of 15% to 20% on all goods imported from the European Union. This represents an escalation in U.S. demands during ongoing trade negotiations, which appear to have stalled with an August 1 deadline approaching. The EU had hoped for a deal with a lower baseline tariff, similar to the one with the United Kingdom.

          <p>Planned Parenthood is legally challenging a provision in President Trump's recent tax bill that would cut off Medicaid funding to its clinics. Attorneys for the organization argued in federal court that the cuts would harm vulnerable patients by targeting providers that primarily offer family planning services. The law, which affects clinics receiving over $800,000 from Medicaid in 2023, is currently on hold due to a temporary restraining order.

Because Social Security benefits are protected from creditors, recipients have a stable foundation for pursuing solutions. Strategies such as credit counseling and hardship programs offered by card issuers can provide viable paths to reducing debt without requiring new loans (not investment advice).</p>

The statement alleged that the tribunal had led to threats against staff. The case centers on a disagreement between the nurse and the doctor, which led to the nurse's suspension and a subsequent internal hearing that cleared her of misconduct.</p>

Tax professionals are awaiting clarification from the IRS, expected in October, on which specific occupations will qualify for the break. The legislation already excludes certain professions like actors and musicians, and further uncertainty exists around how unreported cash tips will be handled under the new rule.</p>
