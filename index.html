          <p>Casey Michel's New York Times article discusses the increasing concerns surrounding the Trump family's financial dealings with foreign entities and the parallels with past administrations. The article highlights the Trump family's exploitation of the presidency for personal gain through ventures like the Executive Branch club, cryptocurrency deals, and investments facilitated by Jared Kushner. Michel draws comparisons to Hunter Biden's activities and the Clinton Foundation's acceptance of foreign funds, suggesting a pattern of politicians leveraging their positions for financial benefit. The author criticizes Trump's dismantling of counter-kleptocracy measures and advocates for stricter legislation to prevent foreign influence and corruption, suggesting measures such as banning foreign deals for family members of high-ranking officials and enforcing existing anti-corruption laws.

          <p>Dan Richards' New York Times article compares the contrasting approaches of Europe and the United States towards night train travel. Europe is experiencing a renaissance in sleeper train networks, driven by environmental concerns and the desire to compete with short-haul flights. The European Union plans to significantly increase high-speed rail traffic by 2030. In contrast, the United States is reducing funding for public infrastructure and prioritizing cars, planes, and unproven technologies like the Hyperloop. The article argues that investing in rail networks could improve mental health and provide a more sustainable alternative to car dependence, but America continues to favor highways and individual transportation. </p>

          <p>A CBS News "48 Hours" report details the investigation into the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs in Minneapolis, where bloody, bare footprints at the crime scene provided a crucial clue. Initially, suspicion fell on Arthur Gray, Childs' roommate, but he had a solid alibi. Years later, DNA evidence led investigators to Jerry Westrom, a businessman and hockey dad. Despite Westrom's denial, his DNA matched samples found at the scene, and forensic analysis confirmed that the bloody footprints belonged to him. Westrom was convicted of first-degree murder, bringing closure to a decades-long search for justice.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly utilizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to finance infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative. This model involves granting Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing, addressing African governments' debt concerns. Examples include projects in Kenya and Zambia, where Chinese companies would contribute a significant portion of the funding and operate the infrastructure for a minimum of 25 years to recoup their investment through toll fees. This approach is viewed as a sustainable way to continue infrastructure development in Africa. </p>

The proposed changes aim to address a $12 billion state budget shortfall, attributed to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump and increased healthcare costs. The plan would suspend access to full Medi-Cal services for undocumented adults over 19 starting January 1, while those with an ‚Äúunsatisfactory‚Äù immigration status would be charged $100 monthly starting in 2027.
