          <p>Following the circulation of a viral video, Glendale police have arrested two men in connection with the theft of a wedding gift box containing approximately $60,000. Armean Shirehjini is suspected of taking the box from the reception, while Andranik Avetisyan was identified as the alleged getaway driver. During the arrests, authorities recovered about $10,000 in cash, 26 checks, and seized several firearms and drugs. The investigation is ongoing to determine if the couple was specifically targeted or if this was part of a larger pattern of similar crimes.</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques a Wall Street Journal piece by Rahm Emanuel, which proposed that viewing China as a potent external threat could help restore internal cohesion to American politics. The author argues that this premise is flawed and that blaming China for America's deep internal divisions is misguided. The piece asserts that the U.S. cannot attribute its own political chaos or the re-election of Donald Trump to an external adversary, suggesting the nation must look inward to address its societal fractures.</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed the recent immigration raid at a Hyundai plant, suggesting that foreign workers could be temporarily allowed in the U.S. to train Americans on complex manufacturing tasks. However, he maintained that companies must respect immigration laws and that the detained workers were present illegally. Separately, the president threatened federal intervention to address crime in cities like Chicago and Boston, dismissing data showing that other cities in red states have higher crime rates and vowing to "clean them up."</p>

Zelenskyy argued the meeting provided the Russian leader with a valuable international platform without benefiting Ukraine or advancing peace. He emphasized the need for increased pressure from the U.S. and European allies to end the war, reiterating that any potential peace talks cannot occur on Russian territory while Ukraine is under attack.</p>

          <p>Spain's Carlos Alcaraz won his second U.S. Open title, defeating Italy's Jannik Sinner in a match that was delayed due to heightened security for President Trump's attendance. Many spectators were still in long lines outside the venue when play began, and the president's appearance in a luxury suite drew a mixed reaction of cheers and boos from the crowd. The U.S. Tennis Association reportedly asked broadcasters to avoid showing off-court disruptions, though videos of the crowd's reaction quickly spread on social media.</p>

          <p>The trial for Ryan Wesley Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate President Trump in September 2024, is set to begin in Florida. Prosecutors allege that Routh hid in bushes at Trump's West Palm Beach golf club and fired an SKS semiautomatic rifle before being apprehended. The incident is one of two attempts on Trump's life that year, raising concerns about political violence. Routh has pleaded not guilty and has made the unusual decision to represent himself in court.</p>

          <p>After facing backlash for a social media post suggesting he was preparing to "go to war" with Chicago, President Trump clarified his intentions. He stated, "We're not going to war. We're going to clean up our cities," but reiterated his plan to potentially send National Guard troops to metropolitan areas to combat crime and assist with deportations. The remarks have been condemned by Democratic leaders in Illinois and Chicago, who view the plan as an unconstitutional occupation of their city.</p>

          <p>Superchief Gallery, an independent art space in downtown Los Angeles known for championing counterculture artists, is facing a potential closure this month if it cannot raise sufficient funds. The gallery's co-founder attributes the financial hardship to a drop-off in corporate sponsorships and a decline in art sales, reflecting a broader economic downturn affecting many local businesses. This potential closure adds to a growing list of establishments that have shuttered in the area as it struggles to rebound from the pandemic.</p>

          <p>Florida's health department has clarified its controversial plan to eliminate mandates for some childhood vaccinations required for school attendance. The policy, which will not take effect for about 90 days, would initially apply to vaccines for illnesses like chickenpox and hepatitis B, while mandates for measles and polio would remain unless changed by legislation. The move has drawn sharp criticism from the American Academy of Pediatrics and other health experts, who warn it is reckless and could lead to preventable disease outbreaks.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that if the Supreme Court strikes down President Trump's tariffs, the government would be forced to issue massive refunds to the businesses that paid them. While expressing confidence that the administration's tariff plan will be upheld, Bessent acknowledged that a negative ruling could require refunding up to $1 trillion, which would be "terrible for the Treasury." The administration has asked the court for an expedited ruling on the case, which challenges the president's authority to impose such broad levies.</p>

The GOP views the measure as a Democratic attempt to gerrymander the map and are mobilizing a significant campaign to defeat it in the upcoming November special election. For a party that has long been in the minority in California, fighting Proposition 50 has become a unifying survival mission.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, University of Oxford professor Ian Goldin pushed back against the idea that globalisation is dead, arguing instead that it is "alive and well in Asia." He contends that the region's rapid economic growth and success in eliminating extreme poverty are direct results of its integration into the global economy. According to Goldin, while the nature of globalisation is becoming more fragmented and regional, its center of gravity is shifting toward Asia as the U.S. becomes more insular.</p>

He advises investors to focus on company fundamentals rather than trying to trade based on the president's sound and fury. (not investment advice)</p>
