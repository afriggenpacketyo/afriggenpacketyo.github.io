          <p>The remnants of Typhoon Halong brought hurricane-force winds and catastrophic flooding to coastal communities in western Alaska, pushing entire houses off their foundations and causing significant infrastructure damage. Villages like Kipnuk and Kwigillingok reported up to 20 people potentially unaccounted for, with water levels surging 6.6 feet above the highest tide. Rescue aircraft were swiftly dispatched to aid the isolated affected areas, where roads and boardwalks were inundated. Governor Mike Dunleavy expanded the state's disaster declaration, assuring residents that comprehensive help is actively being mobilized to address the profound and immediate impact of this severe weather event.</p>

          <p>Financial journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin, author of "1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History," warns of unsettling similarities between today's market and the pre-crash era of 1929. He suggests the current economy is artificially buoyed by the AI boom, questioning its sustainability and predicting an inevitable market crash, though unsure of its timing or depth. Sorkin highlights concerns over increased market speculation, rising debt, and the erosion of regulatory "guardrails" designed to protect investors since 1929. He also notes a push to "democratize" investing by allowing more access to riskier private markets and cryptocurrencies, echoing past mistakes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Violent clashes erupted in Gaza between Hamas militants and the Doghmush clan, resulting in dozens killed, including 52 clan members and 12 Hamas militants. The fighting occurred just hours before an expected hostage release and Prime Minister Netanyahu's address, which called the release "the beginning of a new path." Locals reported panic as families fled, with the Doghmush clan accusing Hamas of exploiting the ceasefire to target them over alleged cooperation with Israel. Hamas's Interior Ministry announced a "clemency framework" for militia members not involved in bloodshed, while three anti-Hamas militias declared support for President Trump's peace proposal.</p>

          <p>Arianne Zucker, a prominent actress on “Days of Our Lives,” has reached a settlement in her 2024 lawsuit, which alleged severe sexual harassment and discrimination on the set of the long-running soap opera. The lawsuit specifically accused former executive producer Albert Alarr of engaging in inappropriate physical contact and making sexually charged comments towards her and other female employees. Zucker also claimed she faced retaliation, including a pay cut and the removal of her character from the show, after voicing her concerns. While Alarr's attorney maintained a denial of the allegations, the settlement was finalized to bring an end to the protracted legal dispute.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced a notable decline following a resurgence of trade tensions and accusations between China and the United States. China declared it was "not afraid of" a trade war after President Trump threatened additional 100% tariffs on Chinese imports, a direct response to Beijing's new export controls on rare earth minerals. This escalating geopolitical friction triggered significant market drops, including a 2.35% plunge in South Korea's Kospi and a previous 2.71% fall in the S&P 500. Although Trump later offered a conciliatory message, the persistent uncertainty underscores a volatile global economic landscape for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared the war in Gaza "over" while traveling to a peace summit in Egypt, asserting confidence that the ceasefire would hold. This declaration comes as Germany prepares to pledge at least €100 million for Gaza's reconstruction, with Development Minister Reem Alabali-Radovan emphasizing the need for international cooperation due to the immense scale of destruction. The UN development agency noted Gaza's housing destruction is the worst since World War II. The US president is set to meet hostage families in Israel before the summit, where 20 living hostages are expected to be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.</p>

Psychologist Dr. Marisa Franco highlights "relational loneliness" and advises reframing social connection as a muscle that strengthens with use.

During an experimental stress test, participants' nose temperatures decreased by 3-6 degrees, a physical reaction to divert blood to eyes and ears for danger detection. This non-invasive technique, which measures a robust biological marker, could revolutionize stress research by monitoring recovery and identifying individuals at risk of anxiety or depression. The method is also being developed to assess stress in non-communicative individuals and animals, with calming effects observed in chimpanzees watching baby chimp videos.</p>

The region faces famine and devastated infrastructure, with essential services severely impacted. Despite the despair, some residents express a glimmer of hope that life will slowly return as people begin to rebuild amidst the ruins, embracing the truth of their new reality.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping signals India's strategic move to hedge its bets and potentially reset historically fraught ties with China. Modi emphasized partnership over rivalry and the need for strategic autonomy, avoiding a "third country lens" for bilateral relations. This rapprochement, including the resumption of direct flights, subtly jabs at the unexpectedly tough stance of US President Donald Trump on India. Both leaders envision their nations as anchors of a multipolar world, fostering a "cooperative pas de deux of the dragon and the elephant" to promote Global South solidarity.</p>

          <p>Indianapolis Colts backup quarterback Anthony Richardson suffered an orbital fracture during warmups before Sunday’s game against the Arizona Cardinals, sidelining him unexpectedly. The injury occurred when an elastic exercise band, used for pre-game preparations, snapped and struck him in the face, leading to his immediate hospitalization. Richardson, the No. 4 overall pick in 2023, has experienced a challenging NFL career marked by both inconsistency and previous injuries. This unfortunate mishap compounded the Colts' pre-game difficulties, as their No. 1 cornerback, Charvarius Ward, also sustained a concussion during warmups.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer identifies a significant, overlooked risk to the stock market rally: a surge in secondary stock offerings from highly speculative, unprofitable companies, reminiscent of the dot-com bubble burst in 2000. He cautions that retail investor enthusiasm has driven up shares of these "Denizens of Sherwood Forest" companies, which are now capitalizing on high valuations by issuing new stock. This influx of supply, coupled with soft demand, could inundate the market and bleed into other sectors. Cramer advises caution on these speculative plays, despite his overall confidence in some established companies. (not investment advice)</p>
