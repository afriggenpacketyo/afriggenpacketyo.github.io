          <p>The UK is hosting a series of events from May 5th to 8th to commemorate the 80th anniversary of VE Day, marking the end of World War II in Europe. Celebrations include a military procession from Whitehall to Buckingham Palace, featuring over 1,300 armed forces personnel and members of the public, accompanied by a Red Arrows flypast. The Royal Family is hosting a tea party for war veterans, and communities across the country are organizing street parties to echo the jubilant celebrations of 1945. Additionally, the Tower of London will unveil an art installation of 30,000 ceramic poppies, and various musical performances and services will be held nationwide to honor the occasion.</p>

          <p>The Berkshire Hathaway board has unanimously voted for Greg Abel to succeed Warren Buffett as CEO, effective January 1, 2026, while Buffett will continue as chairman. This decision, revealed during the company's annual shareholder meeting, assures shareholders that Abel, the current vice chairman of noninsurance operations, will oversee company operations and capital deployment. Buffett's continued presence as chairman is expected to aid Abel, 62, with significant acquisition opportunities, given Berkshire's substantial cash reserves. The announcement had minimal impact on Berkshire shares, which remain strong with a market value exceeding $1.1 trillion.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas Raiders draft pick Ashton Jeanty revealed he was a victim of a prank call after being selected, where someone falsely informed him he was being traded to the Dallas Cowboys. The incident, disclosed on the "Stacking the Box" podcast, involved a caller claiming Jeanty was headed to Dallas, a team he dreamed of playing for due to his Texas roots. This prank call is part of a larger trend affecting NFL prospects, including Shedeur Sanders, with investigations revealing the son of Atlanta Falcons defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich as a perpetrator.

          <p>President Trump has announced plans to impose 100% tariffs on movies made outside the US, claiming it's a measure to protect America's film industry and combat "messaging and propaganda." The move, which he describes as addressing a "National Security threat," aims to incentivize filmmakers to return to Hollywood by eliminating incentives offered by other countries. However, the details of the tariff remain unclear, particularly regarding American production companies filming abroad and streaming services. Industry unions warn that this could severely harm the sector and prompt retaliatory tariffs from other countries, potentially reducing profits for American films overseas.</p>

While he criticizes Trump's attempts to use the government to suppress critics, he also stresses the importance of reclaiming the House and Senate. Ossoff faces challenges from both sides, including criticism from Democrats for not confronting Trump strongly enough and attacks from Republicans who view his 2020 election as a fluke.</p>

          <p>A debate is emerging about whether popular culture is in decline, despite the internet providing unprecedented opportunities for artistic expression. Some critics argue that creativity is stagnating due to Hollywood's reliance on reboots, the influence of partisan culture wars, and the distracting effects of technology. Others point to innovative artists who are blending genres and using technology in new ways. The article explores these opposing viewpoints, examining whether the current cultural landscape represents a genuine decline or a period of transformation, and whether a new artistic renaissance is on the horizon.</p>

          <p>Despite Western sanctions, Russia's economy has shown surprising resilience, but the imposition of secondary sanctions by the United States could change this. President Trump's threat to target entities doing business with Russia, particularly in the banking sector, could significantly impact Russia's economic partners like China and India. While China has become Russia's primary trading partner, India plays a key role in absorbing Russian oil exports. The effectiveness of these sanctions depends on enforcement, with some Russian banks already establishing payment systems to evade Western oversight.</p>

This trend, supported by the expansion of telehealth and the inclusion of more licensed counselors and social workers as providers, suggests that talk therapy is becoming more accessible.

          <p>Sweeping cuts to disaster management by the Trump administration will result in more American lives lost due to the diminished capacity of agencies to predict, prepare for, and respond to disasters, warns emergency management expert Samantha Montano.

          <p>Amid concerns about potential cuts to healthcare and services for disabled Americans, advocates are drawing on the history of the disability rights movement for strategies to push back. Ari Ne'eman, a disability rights advocate, points to the successful fight against Reagan-era rollbacks as a model, emphasizing the importance of both grassroots mobilization and reframing disability rights priorities to appeal across the political spectrum. He stresses the need to monitor potential cuts to home and community-based services and the impact on disabled individuals and their families.
