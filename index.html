          <h2>UK Postal Regulator Approves Royal Mail's Plan to Reduce Second-Class Deliveries</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 03:25:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ofcom has approved Royal Mail's plan to reduce second-class letter deliveries to five weekdays, eliminating Saturday service, effective July 28. This significant reform aims to cut costs and ensure the financial sustainability of the Universal Service Obligation amidst declining letter volumes. While first-class deliveries will maintain a six-day-a-week schedule, new regulatory targets include delivering 90% of first-class mail next-day and 95% of second-class mail within three days. Royal Mail welcomed these changes, expecting implementation over 12-18 months, yet consumer groups like Citizens Advice have voiced strong concerns, arguing that merely cutting services and relaxing targets will not inherently improve service reliability or address existing performance issues.</p>

          <p>Kyiv experienced a massive overnight Russian attack involving 18 missiles and approximately 400 drones, primarily targeting the capital. President Volodymyr Zelensky confirmed at least two fatalities and 16 injuries, with drone wreckage hitting residential buildings and causing fires across the city. This assault follows a previous large-scale aerial attack, underscoring the ongoing intensity of the conflict. The article notes that prospects for a diplomatic breakthrough remain remote, with leaders like Germany's Chancellor and US President Donald Trump expressing skepticism about immediate peace efforts. The focus among Kyiv's allies is shifting towards enhancing air defense and imposing new sanctions on Russia.</p>

          <h2>Macron's State Visit to UK Overshadowed by Trump's Escalating Tariff Threats</h2>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's three-day state visit to the UK, marked by significant pomp and pageantry, is being overshadowed by concerns over US President Donald Trump's unpredictable tariff regime. Trump recently announced steep tariff hikes on 14 countries, with more expected, including a 50% levy on Brazil and copper imports. While the EU awaits clarity on its own potential tariffs, hopes are rising for a US-EU trade deal this week, though major stumbling blocks remain. The article highlights the diplomatic efforts to navigate these economic pressures, with the UK aiming to strengthen its post-Brexit relationship with France amidst the broader global trade uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The upcoming "Superman" film, starring David Corenswet, is set to portray a "battered Superman" symbolizing a resilient America, with director James Gunn focusing on "universal morality" over American exceptionalism. Gunn, an outspoken critic of Donald Trump, aims for the superhero to protect the weak globally, sparking "anti-woke" backlash from right-wing commentators and calls for a boycott. The article highlights the character's historical roots as an "undocumented alien" created by Jewish immigrants in response to rising antisemitism, a theme reiterated in recent comics and pertinent to current US immigration debates. This interpretation fuels the ongoing culture war, where superhero universes are seen as reflecting ideological divides.</p>

Song is accused of firing AR-15 style rifles at correctional and police officers during an organized attack involving 10-12 individuals, who also used fireworks and graffiti. Authorities allege Song purchased four of the guns found, two of which were used at the scene.

The incident occurred approximately six miles into the 7-mile-long tunnel, which is designed to carry treated wastewater. Despite initial fears of tragedy, all workers managed to scramble over 12 feet of loose soil to reach a tunnel boring machine and were then transported to safety, with no major injuries reported. Authorities are investigating the cause, and work on the nearly $700 million project has been paused indefinitely until the site is deemed safe.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German carmaker Volkswagen has temporarily halted deliveries of its electric van model, the ID.Buzz, to the US market. This decision is reportedly influenced by the significantly increased US tariffs of 27.5% on European-built cars, a sharp rise from the previous 2.5% under the Trump administration. An additional factor is a recall issued by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) because the third-row seats do not meet federal safety standards, requiring three seatbelts instead of the current two. Volkswagen is responding to this by reducing the size of the seats. The article highlights that the company faces challenges with declining North American deliveries, even as its overall global deliveries have seen a slight increase.</p>

The article explains that these policies result in significantly lower rents and often higher quality housing compared to the private market, also dampening private rental prices.

Trump emphasized copper's critical role in various defense and technology sectors, including semiconductors, aircraft, and missile defense systems, and its status as the second most used material by the Department of Defense. This announcement caused copper prices to surge, although London Metal Exchange futures later dipped, reflecting a growing premium for US copper. The article notes that while the administration aims to bring copper production home, experts warn that increasing domestic capacity will take years or even decades, potentially leading to shortages and price increases in the interim.

          <p>Poland has reinstated spot border checks with Germany, following a similar move by Germany in October 2023, creating difficulties for residents in the border region. This decision by Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk is a response to Germany's toughened migration policy, which allows German police to refuse entry to asylum seekers. The article highlights that these checks, along with the emergence of self-proclaimed "citizen patrols," are disrupting daily life, causing tailbacks and impacting cross-border travel for work, shopping, and social visits. Concerns are rising that this move further restricts the freedom of movement previously guaranteed by the Schengen Agreement, despite the region's history as a model for EU integration.</p>

          <p>Roy Barclay, a man on Suffolk Police's most wanted list, murdered Anita Rose after evading authorities for two years, raising serious questions about police accountability. Barclay, who was wanted for breaching parole after a violent assault conviction, maintained a significant digital footprint, including bank card usage and hundreds of Google Maps reviews, some near the murder scene. The article highlights that despite these online clues, Suffolk Police did not issue a public press release about his wanted status until January 2024, just months before the murder. A voluntary partnership review will now investigate how police and probation services handled the search for Barclay, aiming to provide answers for Anita's family.</p>

          <p>China is intensifying efforts to stabilize its labor market and boost household incomes by offering one-off employment subsidies to companies and social organizations that hire unemployed individuals aged 16 to 24. This measure, effective until the end of the year, provides up to 1,500 yuan per new hire, provided they sign formal contracts and pay full insurance contributions for at least three months. The initiative is funded through China’s unemployment insurance reserves. The article notes that this comes amidst persistent labor market pressures, sluggish economic growth, fierce domestic competition, and the ongoing trade war with the United States, with an additional 10 billion yuan allocated to expand public works programs for job creation.

          <p>Chinese nationals in Africa, particularly traders, are facing an escalating risk of kidnappings, with multiple recent incidents reported across South Africa, especially in Gauteng and the Eastern Cape provinces. Analysts suggest that Chinese traders are targeted due to a perception that they operate their businesses outside formal banking systems and may carry large sums of cash. The Chinese embassy in South Africa has issued a warning, urging women to avoid going out alone and to inform relatives and friends of their whereabouts if unable to travel with others. The article notes that this rise in kidnappings comes amid a general increase in such crimes in South Africa this year, alongside a fatal home invasion and robbery targeting Chinese nationals in May, highlighting a growing safety concern for this community.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta, alleging that the state's chicken and egg farm regulations contribute to historically high egg prices nationwide. The lawsuit claims California's anti-animal cruelty laws, which mandate minimum space requirements for hens, create "unnecessary red tape" and violate the federal Egg Products Inspection Act's call for "national uniformity" in safety standards. The article notes that the administration argues California cannot impose these requirements on eggs from other states. This legal action highlights a recurring conflict, as similar lawsuits against California's farm regulations have previously failed, including one that reached the Supreme Court.</p>

The attack, involving rocket-propelled grenades, caused significant damage and loss of propulsion. The Houthis claimed the vessel was heading to Israel, and the US embassy in Yemen reported they "kidnapped many surviving crew members." The article highlights that since November 2023, the Houthis have targeted around 70 merchant vessels, sinking four and seizing one, claiming support for Palestinians in the Gaza conflict.

This potential deal would significantly expand Ferrero's presence in the US breakfast cereal market. The article notes that WK Kellogg has faced financial struggles and significant debt, having been spun off from its former parent company, Kellanova, in 2023. The industry faces challenges from shifting consumer preferences towards healthier options and rising costs, compounded by pressure from the Trump administration regarding artificial coloring in cereals.

The article notes that the Conservatives are pushing for more stringent reforms than the government's recently watered-down legislation, proposing to limit access to Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and health-related Universal Credit to British citizens, with exceptions for those covered by international agreements.

The article states that Africa's 23 billionaires have seen their combined wealth surge by 56% in the past five years, reaching $112.6 billion, and that nearly half of the world's most unequal countries are in Africa. Oxfam contends that government policies are biased against the poor, allowing the super-rich to accumulate more wealth, and calls for progressive taxation. The report suggests that an additional 1% tax on the wealth and 10% on the income of the richest 1% could raise $66 billion annually, sufficient to fund free education and universal electricity access.</p>
