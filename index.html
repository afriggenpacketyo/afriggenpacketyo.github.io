          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate over 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees who were previously subject to a reduction in force. The judge's preliminary injunction emphasized the department's need to fulfill its functions and obligations as mandated by Congress. The U.S. Department of Education had announced the staff cuts on March 11, leading to a lawsuit filed by 21 states two days later. The American Federation of Teachers also sued to save the agency after President Trump signed an executive order aimed at dismantling the Education Department.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecasted a 60% chance of an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season for 2025, estimating 13 to 19 named storms. This forecast is influenced by factors like neutral El NiÃ±o conditions, warmer ocean temperatures, and weak wind shear. NOAA officials emphasized advancements in forecasting technology, allowing for more accurate predictions. Residents in storm-prone areas are urged to prepare proactively by creating plans and gathering supplies, with the hurricane season officially running from June 1 to November 30.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 4-4 deadlocked ruling, prevented Oklahoma from establishing the nation's first taxpayer-funded religious charter school. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case. The ruling upholds the Oklahoma Supreme Court's decision that such schools would violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. This decision is a setback for the religious freedom movement, but it does not set a binding precedent nationwide, leaving the door open for future reconsideration of the issue.</p>

          <p>In a narrow 215-214 vote, the House passed President Trump's domestic policy bill, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, after an all-night session marked by intense negotiations. The bill, addressing tax, defense, and energy priorities, faced opposition from both hardliners and blue-state Republicans. Key changes included adjustments to Medicaid work requirements and renewable energy tax credits. Speaker Mike Johnson touted the bill as a victory, while Democrats criticized it as a "reckless tax scam;" the bill now moves to the Senate, where it is expected to face resistance.</p>

          <p>The House passed a tax bill that includes changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), raising the cap to $40,000 but phases out over $500,000. The provision, enacted via the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, could still face pushback in the Senate. The increased deduction would benefit taxpayers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California. However, the bill would also reduce itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, which could lower the benefit of the higher SALT cap.</p>

Pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration and the Senate's advancement of crypto legislation are also supporting the market.

          <p>A White House report, the product of a presidential commission led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., identifies ultraprocessed foods, chemical exposures, lack of physical activity, stress, and excessive prescription drug use as key drivers of a chronic disease crisis, particularly among children. The report criticizes the overmedicalization of American children and the pharmaceutical industry's influence, advocating for more research into disease causes and prevention. While diverging from standard government thinking, the report reflects a consensus among government agencies and officials, urging a shift from reactionary treatment to proactive health measures.

The last is what's frequently called California's "EV mandate," a rule that aims to phase-out gas powered cars and require all new vehicle sales in California be zero emissions by 2035.</p>
