          <p>The European Union is proactively identifying economic "chokepoints" it can use as leverage against global powers like China in an era of increasing economic warfare. Trade officials are building a database of dependencies to move from a reactive to a proactive stance, leveraging Europe's own strengths. This new "economic security doctrine" is a response to a world where established trade rules are eroding, with the EU feeling pressure from both U.S. trade tariffs and China's control over critical materials. The strategy aims to deter economic bullying and protect the bloc's interests.</p>

          <p>Eyewitnesses have described the shocking scene of a terror attack outside a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism. A man, later identified and shot dead by police, drove a car into pedestrians and then began stabbing people, killing two and injuring three. Accounts detail the attacker attempting to breach the synagogue doors with a knife before being neutralized by armed officers who arrived swiftly. The community is in shock, with many worshippers having been locked inside the synagogue for safety during the chaotic and violent event.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's Bukayo Saka has been recalled to the England national football squad for upcoming matches against Wales and Latvia after recovering from a hamstring injury. However, manager Thomas Tuchel has notably excluded prominent players such as Jude Bellingham, Phil Foden, and Jack Grealish from the latest selection. The decision reflects Tuchel's strategy of maintaining continuity with the team that performed well in a recent 5-0 victory against Serbia. While the exclusion of in-form players like Foden and Grealish is surprising, it signals the manager's preference for rewarding recent success and team cohesion.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly terror attack outside a Manchester synagogue, UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood expressed disappointment that pro-Palestinian protests proceeded, labeling the decision as "un-British." She urged demonstrators to "step back" from future marches, linking the heated rhetoric on the streets to the violent outcome of the attack. The UK's Chief Rabbi, Sir Ephraim Mirvis, echoed these concerns, stating that such demonstrations are dangerous and contain antisemitism. The discussion highlights the intense debate in the UK over freedom of protest versus community safety and the potential for incitement.</p>

          <p>Direct air travel between China and India is scheduled to resume, marking a tentative step toward normalizing relations that have been strained. India's largest airline, IndiGo, announced it will restart services between Kolkata and Guangzhou, with plans for more routes pending approval. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs stated the resumption of flights is expected to enhance people-to-people exchanges between the two nations.

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair has been named by President Trump as a key figure in a proposed "Board of Peace" to manage post-war Gaza. Blair, who was instrumental in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, brings diplomatic experience but also carries significant controversy from his decision to support the 2003 Iraq invasion. His involvement has drawn mixed reactions, with some Palestinian officials cautiously welcoming the effort while Hamas and others have strongly denounced him. Critics in the UK and internationally remain skeptical, citing his polarizing legacy and the potential for the plan to be viewed as an imposed Western solution.</p>

          <p>Following the elimination of federal funding for public media, South Dakota Public Broadcasting is facing a severe budget crisis, forcing it to slash its newsroom and cancel local programming. The network has cut its journalism staff from eleven to four and dropped its signature daily public affairs show, "In the Moment." This move highlights the disproportionate impact of the funding cuts on rural stations, which often serve as a primary source of local news. While private donations have surged in what some call "rage giving," station officials worry this support is not sustainable for long-term operations.</p>

He argues that while China is a rising power, it is also brittle due to internal issues like debt, a shrinking population, and repressive policies. The article proposes five strategies to avoid conflict: maintain dialogue to prevent miscalculation, fortify regional alliances, pursue mutual interests like curbing fentanyl, and renew American strength at home.

          <p>Grand Duke Henri of Luxembourg, 70, is abdicating after a 25-year reign, with his 43-year-old son, Guillaume, set to be enthroned as the new head of state. The transition of power in the world's last grand duchy will be marked by a ceremony at the Grand Ducal Palace attended by European royalty and political leaders. While the role of the Grand Duke is largely representative, the change in leadership is a significant event for the small but wealthy European nation. The transition began in 2024 when Grand Duke Henri expressed a desire to "slow down," ensuring a smooth succession.</p>

          <p>PGA of America President Don Rea Jr. has issued a formal apology for the inappropriate and profane behavior of some fans during the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black. The event was marred by vulgar chants and personal abuse directed at European players, particularly Rory McIlroy and his wife. Rea, who had initially downplayed the incidents, condemned the behavior as "disrespectful" and "inappropriate" in a letter to PGA members. The apology comes after significant criticism of the PGA's initial response and acknowledges that the conduct crossed a line, reflecting poorly on the organization and the sport.</p>

          <p>A Finnish court has dismissed charges against the captain and two officers of the oil tanker Eagle S, who were accused of damaging undersea power and internet cables in the Baltic Sea. The court ruled that Finland lacked the jurisdiction to prosecute the case under its criminal law. The crew was accused of dragging the ship's anchor for approximately 90 kilometers, severing five cables in December of last year. The incident is one of several recent disruptions to undersea infrastructure in the region, raising concerns about potential sabotage, though the crew maintained their actions were unintentional.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has issued a stark warning that the potential U.S. supply of long-range Tomahawk cruise missiles to Ukraine would represent a "completely new stage of escalation" in the conflict. While acknowledging the missiles pose a threat, Putin asserted that Russia's air defense systems would counter them and that their use would be impossible without direct U.S. military involvement. His comments follow reports that the Trump administration has approved sharing intelligence for long-range targets with Kyiv and is considering sending the advanced weaponry, which would significantly enhance Ukraine's strike capabilities.</p>

          <p>As the annual Nobel Prize announcements approach, this article examines their modern-day relevance, acknowledging them as the "Mount Everest of science" for popularizing major discoveries. However, it also delves into significant criticisms, such as the tendency to promote a "genius scientist" myth that overlooks the collaborative nature of modern research. The piece highlights the prizes' historical lack of diversity, with a strong bias toward male laureates from Western institutions. While the awards successfully capture public imagination, they also face calls to be more inclusive and better reflect the global scientific community.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is set to enter its third day, with the Senate scheduled to reconvene on Friday to consider two competing stopgap funding bills.

The political stalemate continues with both sides blaming the other for the lapse in funding. Meanwhile, President Trump commented on his meetings with Democratic leaders, describing them as pleasant in private but different in their public statements, highlighting the deep political divisions.</p>

          <p>The EAT-Lancet Commission has released an updated report promoting a "planetary health diet" rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, with significantly less meat and dairy, to benefit both human health and the environment. The report suggests such a shift could prevent millions of premature deaths and drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions. However, the findings are facing a backlash from what a new investigation calls a "targeted and coordinated campaign" of online misinformation, allegedly linked to the meat and dairy industries.
