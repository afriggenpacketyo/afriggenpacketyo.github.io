          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, effectively blocking the Trump administration from proceeding with its plans to sharply reduce jobs and reorganize the structure of several major federal agencies. The order halts further reductions in force and any reorganization of the executive branch for the duration of the lawsuit. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's efforts to streamline and downsize the federal workforce, ensuring stability for affected employees and agencies. The judge's ruling provides a temporary reprieve while the court considers the merits of the case.</p>

          <p>Following its narrow passage in the House, the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" is facing strong opposition from Democrats, who claim it disproportionately benefits the rich while harming low-income individuals. The bill extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts and increases spending on military and border security but makes cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, and other assistance programs. The CBO estimates the bill will add $3.8 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, with preliminary analyses suggesting that the lowest-income Americans will experience a decrease in resources while the highest earners will see an increase. Democrats argue that the bill strips away healthcare, exacerbates hunger, and increases poverty, while Republicans defend it as removing "waste, fraud, and abuse" and protecting the "most vulnerable Americans."</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, accusing it of a "campaign of retribution" after the Department of Homeland Security revoked the university's ability to enroll international students. The lawsuit alleges that the administration's actions are in retaliation for Harvard exercising its First Amendment rights and controlling its governance and curriculum. Harvard claims it complied with the administration's requests for information on student visa holders, but the administration deemed the response "insufficient" without providing a clear explanation. The university argues that the ban would erase a quarter of its student body and destabilize its existence, as international students contribute significantly to the university and its mission.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that he is "recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union" starting June 1, citing stalled trade negotiations and unfair trade practices. The announcement, made on Truth Social, immediately caused U.S. stock futures to sink and European stock markets to fall by 2%. Trump's decision is a reversal in momentum after recent preliminary trade "deals" with China and the United Kingdom had encouraged investors. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the EU's proposals were not of the same quality as those from other trading partners, hoping the tariff threat would spur further negotiation.

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated a program to terminate immigration court cases of certain migrants to facilitate their arrest and fast-track their deportation. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) prosecutors are requesting immigration judges to dismiss cases, allowing ICE agents to arrest individuals and place them in "expedited removal" proceedings. This process bypasses lengthy immigration court proceedings, potentially affecting nearly one million migrants who entered the U.S. under the CBP One program. While those placed in expedited removal can be deported without a court hearing, they are entitled to an interview with an asylum officer if they fear persecution in their home country.</p>

The moves followed a volatile week for bonds, initially driven by fears that Trump's budget bill would worsen the U.S. deficit, which had pushed yields to levels not seen since 2023.

          <p>Mark Dial, a former Philadelphia police officer, has been acquitted of murder charges but convicted of voluntary manslaughter and related counts in the shooting death of Eddie Irizarry during a traffic stop. The jury reached the verdict after deliberating for nearly three days. The charges stemmed from an August 2023 incident in which Dial fatally shot Irizarry, who was sitting in his car. Dial's attorneys argued that he acted in self-defense, believing Irizarry was holding a gun, while prosecutors maintained that Irizarry was holding a knife near his leg.</p>

          <p>Saving money in an economy with persistent inflation can be a challenge, but certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a solution with higher returns than the current inflation rate. CDs allow savers to lock in high rates for the term of the CD and come with FDIC or NCUA insurance on balances up to $250,000. The current national average CD yields range from 1.69% to 1.99%, while top CDs offer rates between 4.00% and 4.41%. Strategies for securing a good CD rate include looking at online banks and considering short-term CDs. (not investment advice)</p>

States and cities banned chokeholds and no-knock warrants, mandated body cameras, and rewrote de-escalation guidelines, but these changes have had little impact on accountability or the number of killings by police officers. Killings by police officers have actually risen from just over 1,000 in 2019 to around 1,200 in 2024. The Trump administration dropped efforts to investigate or oversee nearly two dozen police departments, and attention to reform has faded as the murder rate rose in 2020 and 2021.</p>

          <p>The House Republicans passed a bill that would cut Medicaid and deny health care to millions of Americans, undermining the progress made by Obamacare. The bill proposes adding a work requirement to Medicaid, which would strip benefits from working-age adults without children who cannot prove they work at least 80 hours a month. The CBO estimates that this change would cause 7.7 million Americans to lose health insurance by 2034. Critics argue that the work requirement is a paperwork requirement that punishes people for failing to fill out forms and that the changes to the exchanges would probably deprive an additional six million people of health insurance.</p>

          <p>A new study has revealed that clownfish are shrinking in response to severe heat waves, suggesting this may be an adaptation to survive hotter ocean temperatures. Scientists scuba diving off the coast of Papua New Guinea measured clownfish during a heat wave in 2023 and found that most of the fish got shorter. The study, published in Science Advances, indicates that being small has advantages in a hot climate, potentially helping clownfish meet their bodies' energy requirements. The fish that shrank had a much higher chance of survival, adding complexity to the otherwise depressing effects of climate change on the world's oceans.</p>
