          <p>National Public Radio (NPR) has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump over his executive order to cease all federal funding for the nonprofit broadcaster. NPR argues that the order violates the First Amendment's protections for speech and the press, as well as Congress' authority. The lawsuit contends that Trump's order aims to punish and control NPR's news coverage, which the administration deems biased. NPR and other public radio stations argue that the order threatens the existence of a public radio system vital to millions of Americans for news and information.</p>

          <p>Sherron Watkins and Cynthia Cooper, who exposed accounting fraud at Enron and WorldCom, argue against Republican lawmakers' proposal to eliminate the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (P.C.A.O.B.). They emphasize the destruction caused by unchecked power, collusion, and manipulated financial statements, recalling the collapse of Enron and WorldCom, which led to significant job losses and market destabilization. The authors underscore the importance of the P.C.A.O.B. as an independent regulator ensuring audit quality and preventing conflicts of interest, noting its bipartisan support since its creation in 2002. They caution that eliminating the board would increase the risk of corporate disasters and shift costs to the public, urging Congress to maintain this vital safeguard. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) suggests that the official unemployment rate may be painting an overly optimistic picture of the U.S. economy. LISEP's "true rate" of unemployment, which stood at 24.3% in April, encompasses not only unemployed workers but also people who are looking for work but can't find full-time employment, as well as those stuck in poverty-wage jobs. The measure seeks to capture labor market nuances that other economic indicators miss, such as Americans who are left behind during periods of economic expansion. The report indicates that millions of households are struggling to maintain a "minimal quality of life."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration and House Republicans are attempting to curb immigrant families' access to safety net programs. While Republicans state they want to remove incentives for illegal immigration, experts say the changes would largely affect children who are U.S. citizens but whose parents are undocumented or authorized to live in the U.S. The proposed tax bill would limit the availability of the child tax credit to parents with Social Security numbers, affecting roughly two million children. The bill would also tighten eligibility for federal health insurance programs and cut off federal tuition assistance and food stamps for many immigrants.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to terminate all remaining federal government contracts with Harvard University, worth a reported $100 million. The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) claimed that Harvard "continues to engage in race discrimination" in its admission process and other areas of campus life. The GSA has called on top procurement officials at federal agencies to review the contracts for termination. This action follows the administration's recent ban on Harvard enrolling international students, which was temporarily blocked by a federal judge.</p>

Experts are urging the U.S. government to support the truckers with strike pay and other aid to promote human rights and potentially cause regime change from within. The core issues driving the strike, which began on May 18, include working conditions, reduced insurance coverage, lack of roadside assistance, graft in cargo allocation, and expensive spare parts. The U.S. is currently engaged in talks with Iran’s regime to dismantle its illegal nuclear weapons program in exchange for sanctions relief.</p>

          <p>Businesses are finding a workaround to minimize the impact of tariffs by using a decades-old piece of legislation known as the "first sale rule." This rule allows U.S. importers to use the price of the first sale in a number of transactions to calculate customs duties, potentially saving significant costs. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales, the sales must be at arm's length, there must be proof the item was destined for the U.S., and there must be documentation of the first sale price. While the rule has been around since 1988, it has gained renewed attention under the Trump administration's tariff regime.</p>

The renewed interest in nuclear is driven by some of the costs associated with renewables.

          <p>European sales of Tesla vehicles plunged 49% in April, as the U.S. electric car maker faces reputational damage and increased competition. Tesla has faced brand damage due to CEO Elon Musk's political involvement with U.S. President Donald Trump, with protests erupting at dealerships across Europe. At the same time, Tesla is battling rising competition from traditional automakers and Chinese players. European consumers are also showing a preference for hybrid electric vehicles, while Tesla only sells full battery-powered vehicles.</p>

          <p>Conductor John Mauceri experienced a rapid 40-pound weight gain in a matter of weeks, leading to a diagnosis of pericardial constriction, a rare condition where the sac around the heart thickens and prevents it from fully opening. Mauceri's symptoms emerged after contracting COVID-19 and included swelling in his legs and abdomen, fatigue, and shortness of breath. After multiple tests, Dr. Adam Skolnick suspected pericardial constriction, which was confirmed through open-heart surgery performed by Dr. Eugene Grossi. Following the surgery, Mauceri quickly lost weight and regained his health, returning to conducting orchestras after a year-long recovery.</p>

          <p>NPR and three Colorado public radio stations have filed a lawsuit against the Trump White House over the president's executive order purportedly barring the use of Congressionally appropriated funds for NPR and PBS. The lawsuit argues that the administration is usurping Congress' right to direct how federal money will be spent and to pass laws. NPR's CEO, Katherine Maher, called Trump's early May executive order "textbook retaliation" and an existential threat to the public radio system. The lawsuit states that the order targets NPR and PBS expressly because, in the President's view, their news and other content is not 'fair, accurate, or unbiased.'</p>

Both are moderate Democrats who often attack the left wing of their party, share similar plans for addressing mental health, and oppose rent freezes while supporting charter schools. The two also share over 200 donors, including powerful real estate leaders. Accusations of corruption and ethics investigations have also plagued both politicians, further fueling the comparison.</p>

          <p>Despite Donald Trump's opposition to wind power, some Texas Republicans are embracing it as a vital source of income for rural areas. Rancher and former state lawmaker John Davis has allowed wind turbines on his property, providing economic opportunities for his family and community. While Trump has called wind turbines "ugly" and barred clean energy projects on federal lands, recent polling shows most Republican voters in Texas oppose moves to squash the state's booming renewable energy sector. Davis and others are pushing back against bills in the Texas legislature that threaten to reverse the state’s position as a clean energy leader.</p>

The IMF cautioned that global trade tensions, volatile financial market conditions, and the challenge of containing day-to-day spending mean the Chancellor will face difficult choices to balance taxation with spending in the long term.

Farming industry experts said beef prices in particular have been rising due to high demand and low supply caused by lack of government support. The increase in production costs and the national minimum wage are also pushing up overall costs, which could be passed onto consumers.</p>
