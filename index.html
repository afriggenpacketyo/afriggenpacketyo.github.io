          <p>Probationary federal employees are in limbo following mass firings initiated by the Trump administration, which are now subject to legal challenges. Thousands were terminated, but court rulings have led to reinstatements, leaving workers on administrative leave. The Justice Department is seeking Supreme Court intervention, while some employees find relief through the Merit Systems Protection Board. Workers express stress and confusion, unsure whether to seek new jobs or await further agency updates, highlighting concerns about the administration's handling of civil service regulations and the potential erosion of worker protections.</p>

          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has criticized Manchester United fans for directing insulting chants towards Phil Foden's mother during a recent Premier League match. Guardiola expressed his disappointment, labeling the behavior as a "lack of class" and emphasizing that it reflects poorly on the individuals involved, not the club itself. He lamented the exposure faced by public figures like managers and players and condemned the lack of integrity in involving family members in such insults. The game concluded in a draw, positioning City fifth in the league standings.</p>

          <p>A 52-year-old Chinese woman detained by US border patrol in Arizona for overstaying her visa died by suicide, prompting scrutiny of detention conditions. Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal alleges that border patrol agents failed to conduct required welfare checks prior to the woman's death. Surveillance footage reportedly showed the woman creating a noose, but medical assistance was delayed for nearly two hours. The incident raises concerns about detainee well-being amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, with Jayapal calling for answers regarding the alleged procedural failures.</p>

          <p>The start of a Champions Cup rugby match between Sale and Toulouse was delayed by 40 minutes after a parachutist became stuck in the stadium roof. While two paratroopers successfully landed on the pitch to deliver the match ball, Captain Yannick Trouillet went off course and his parachute became snagged in the stadium's awning. Supporters were moved from the area below as stadium staff worked to free the captain, using post protectors and an inflatable rugby pitch to cushion a potential fall.

          <p>A Justice Department attorney, Erez Reuveni, has been placed on administrative leave for allegedly failing to vigorously defend the Trump administration's deportation of a Maryland man to El Salvador. Reuveni reportedly struggled to answer questions about the deportation's circumstances and acknowledged a lack of evidence justifying the action, leading Attorney General Pam Bondi to announce his removal from the case. The judge in the case called the detention "wholly lawless" and ordered the man's return, while the administration appealed.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has a golden opportunity to fund climate-smart agriculture practices, such as planting perennials and using cover crops, which simultaneously reduce emissions and improve climate resilience. These practices benefit farmers economically through pest control and improved water retention, but initial costs require state support. While agriculture accounts for 8% of California's emissions, it has only received 5% of cap-and-trade funds, with only 2% allocated for continuous support. The legislature is urged to dedicate 15% of the State Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to climate-smart agriculture programs, empowering farmers to lead in climate action.</p>

          <p>President Trump's imposition of tariffs on foreign autos and imports has triggered a global sell-off and recession fears, wiping out trillions in wealth. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick defends the tariffs as a national security measure to protect American industries, while critics warn of potential economic damage. The move has prompted retaliatory tariffs from China and sparked debate within the Republican party, with some senators seeking to reclaim congressional authority over trade policy. The situation raises concerns about inflation, market stability, and the long-term impact on the U.S. economy.</p>

Similarly, mainstream media is acknowledging the possibility of a lab leak as the origin of COVID-19 and investigating President Biden's mental decline, topics previously dismissed as conspiracy theories.

          <p>A Minecraft Movie has stormed the box office, grossing an estimated $300m globally during its opening weekend. The film, based on the popular video game, was heavily delayed but finally hit the big screen on Friday. The estimates place the film's earnings well above its reported production budget of $150m. The box office numbers come despite reviews for the film being mostly underwhelming. It does not appear to have stopped families showing up in force to see it.</p>

          <p>Southampton's season has been troubled from the start. They lost eight of their opening nine games this term, and after 23 games had just one victory to their name. Saints have the same amount of points after 31 games (10) as Derby County did in 2007-08, with Rams going on to achieve 11. Derby's campaign remains the worst in Premier League history, although it's a record Southampton could still beat. "We have to avoid that record, do our best. It cannot happen," added Juric.</p>

          <p>Health officials have issued a measles exposure alert for individuals who traveled on an Amtrak train to Washington, D.C., earlier this month. The infected person rode the southbound Amtrak Northeast Regional 175 train on March 19, from 7:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m., arriving at Union Station, the city's main train station, the health department said. A health department spokesperson did not share where the individual boarded the train, but Amtrak transit schedules show the route started in Boston, reached New York City a little before 7:30 p.m., and stopped in numerous other cities along the East Coast, including Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore, before reaching D.C.</p>

          <p>Despite Trump’s reposting of a video that claimed he’s purposely crashing the stock market, the president’s top economic adviser on Sunday denied that’s his strategy. Pressed by Stephanopoulos on the post, Hassett said the White House respected the Fed’s independence and denied that Trump was trying to pressure it to lower rates. “It is not a strategy for the markets to crash. It's a strategy to create a golden age in America for the American worker. That's his strategy,” Hassett said.</p>

          <p>The Dodgers have placed starting pitcher Blake Snell on the injured list due to left shoulder inflammation. The move is a blow to the team's starting rotation, and the severity of Snell's injury is unclear.

The Dodgers have depth options in triple-A, but Snell's absence will be felt in the team's pitching rotation.</p>

          <p>Under the Trump administration, billionaires like Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are wielding unprecedented influence over US national security. Their companies, SpaceX and Blue Origin, are playing significant roles in placing spy satellites into Earth orbit, potentially making the intelligence community beholden to them. This marks a radical change in US spy operations, traditionally controlled by career government officials and established defense contractors. This article examines the potential consequences of this shift, including concerns about greed and the erosion of traditional oversight.</p>

          <p>Marine Le Pen, leader of France's National Rally, has denounced her embezzlement conviction as a "witch hunt" at a rally in Paris. She was found guilty of helping to embezzle EU funds and banned from running for office for five years, though she is appealing the decision. Le Pen's supporters view the ruling as a politically motivated attempt to eliminate her from the 2027 presidential race. The conviction has sparked debate about the fairness of the justice system and the future leadership of the National Rally.</p>
