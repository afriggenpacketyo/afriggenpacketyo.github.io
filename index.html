          <p>Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have signed a mutual defense agreement, reinforcing their long-standing security relationship. This move is interpreted as Riyadh's strategy to diversify its security partners, reducing its traditional reliance on the United States amid growing geopolitical tensions. The pact comes as Gulf states express increasing uncertainty about the U.S.'s role as a security guarantor in the region. Analysts suggest China may view this development favorably, potentially creating new opportunities for arms sales in an increasingly complex security landscape.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships identifies nine key behaviors that help children develop strong social skills. Rather than focusing on memorized phrases, the approach emphasizes creating an environment of emotional safety and authentic connection at home. Key practices include openly discussing feelings, modeling empathy in daily life, and treating mistakes as learning opportunities. The article suggests these foundational interactions are more effective than direct instruction for raising emotionally intelligent and socially adept individuals.</p>

          <p>A cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a key technology provider, has caused significant disruption at major European airports, including Heathrow, Berlin, and Brussels. The attack on the company's MUSE software has impacted electronic check-in and baggage drop systems, forcing airports to resort to manual processes and leading to numerous flight cancellations and delays. This incident is the latest in a series of high-profile cyberattacks on major industries, highlighting the vulnerability of shared digital systems. Experts emphasize the need for improved resiliency and better information-sharing to combat such cross-border threats.</p>

          <p>Recent moves by the UK, Canada, and Australia to recognize a Palestinian state have brought the issue to a critical juncture, yet significant obstacles remain. The article explores the practical challenges, including the lack of a defined territory and the deep political division between the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza. While international support for a two-state solution grows, Palestinian politics has stagnated, with no elections since 2006. The question of who would lead a unified Palestinian state remains a central and unresolved issue.</p>

          <p>California has passed a new law, effective January 2026, prohibiting most on-duty law enforcement officers, including federal agents from ICE, from wearing face masks. The legislation, a response to federal agents wearing masks during immigration raids in Los Angeles, aims to prevent what Governor Gavin Newsom termed "secret police" tactics. The law includes exceptions for specific situations like undercover operations or protection against disease and wildfires. The Department of Homeland Security criticized the move, calling it an attempt to endanger officers, highlighting the ongoing friction between state and federal authorities on immigration enforcement.</p>

Ferguson case. This landmark decision declared state-sponsored segregation in public schools unconstitutional, marking a pivotal moment in the American civil rights movement. While the ruling did not immediately end segregation, it provided the legal foundation for dismantling systemic racial discrimination in the United States.</p>

The mural features historical church figures, 19th-century immigrants, and portraits of present-day arrivals, serving as a statement on treating all people with dignity.

          <p>This article draws parallels between the role of women in historical fascist regimes, like Nazi Germany, and the rhetoric of contemporary right-wing movements in the U.S. It argues that strongman politics often relies on promoting traditional domesticity, framing women's roles as mothers and homemakers as essential to national strength. This ideology is now being spread through the "womanosphere" of online influencers who promote traditional femininity and anti-feminist views. The analysis suggests these movements launder regressive policies as aspirational lifestyles, encouraging women to absorb the impact of a shrinking social safety net under the guise of self-sufficiency.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK's Liberal Democrat party, has called Elon Musk a "criminal," accusing him of inciting violence and failing to adequately police harmful content on his social media platform, X. Davey's comments follow a video message from Musk to protesters at a far-right rally in London, where he told them to "fight back or you die." The Liberal Democrats are calling for an investigation into Musk and X by the UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, for potential breaches of the Online Safety Act, and plan to summon him before Parliament.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has fully divested its stake in the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD, concluding an exceptionally profitable investment. The company first purchased shares in 2008 for $230 million at the urging of Charlie Munger, and the value increased by approximately 3,890% during the holding period. Berkshire began selling its shares in August 2022, with Buffett citing a desire to reallocate the money to investments he felt better about, possibly influenced by geopolitical risks associated with China. The final sale was confirmed through a financial filing by a Berkshire subsidiary. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several U.S. states are forming regional collaboratives to strengthen public health guidance as national health agencies face politicization and issue conflicting recommendations. The Northeast Public Health Collaborative and the West Coast Health Alliance aim to coordinate on issues like vaccine policy, emergency preparedness, and lab capacity. This trend reflects a shift where states are increasingly creating their own evidence-based recommendations, decoupling from federal agencies like the CDC. The result is a growing patchwork of health regulations across the country, creating disparities in access to care and public health protections.</p>

          <p>The United States recently held a trilateral multi-domain military exercise, named Freedom Edge, with allies Japan and South Korea, notably without the presence of a U.S. aircraft carrier. This departure from past practice has led to varied interpretations among analysts. Some suggest the move could be an attempt to de-escalate and improve relations with China and North Korea. Others believe it reflects the Trump administration's strategy of requiring Asian allies to take on a greater role in regional security and the containment of China within the first island chain.</p>

          <p>Apple has taken control of all core chips in its latest iPhones, introducing new custom hardware designed to enhance on-device AI capabilities. The new A19 Pro chip features neural accelerators on each GPU core, and the company also debuted its own wireless (N1) and modem (C1X) chips, reducing reliance on suppliers like Broadcom and Qualcomm. This strategic shift allows Apple to optimize for power efficiency and performance, with a focus on running AI workloads directly on the device for improved responsiveness and privacy. The move signals Apple's commitment to building a powerful on-device AI ecosystem.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many women lack basic knowledge about their own fertility, leading to misconceptions about when to start a family and the effectiveness of treatments like IVF. Fertility doctors and other experts argue that this knowledge gap could be addressed by incorporating comprehensive fertility education into school sex-ed programs. Such curricula would teach students not only about pregnancy prevention but also about the factors affecting fertility, such as age and lifestyle. While some states are beginning to mandate lessons on menstruation, broader efforts face political and financial hurdles, despite evidence that young people desire more complete information about their reproductive health.</p>

          <p>In a discussion, The Atlantic's Anne Applebaum and Russian pro-democracy advocate Garry Kasparov draw parallels between the Trump administration's actions and the rise of autocracy in other countries, such as Russia. They point to the pressure on the media, exemplified by the suspension of Jimmy Kimmel's show, as a classic move from an autocrat's playbook to silence satire and criticism. Kasparov warns that while the U.S. has strong institutions, they are not immune to being undermined, particularly if Congress fails to act as a check on executive power. They argue that 2026 will be a critical election for the future of American democracy.</p>

Organizations that train queer candidates, like the LGBTQ+ Victory Institute, report a significant surge in participation. These candidates, mostly Democrats but also some Republicans, are motivated to counter anti-LGBTQ+ policies and advocate for their communities.

          <p>Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has emerged as the most popular party in a new opinion poll, marking a new high point for the group. The poll, conducted by the Insa institute, places the anti-immigration party at 26%, one point ahead of the ruling conservative CDU/CSU bloc. The AfD, which is officially classified as a "confirmed right-wing extremist endeavor" by Germany's domestic intelligence agency, has seen its support grow significantly since the last federal election.

Despite Berlin's reputation as a fast course, the winning times were off world-record pace, likely due to unusually warm and humid conditions in the German capital.
