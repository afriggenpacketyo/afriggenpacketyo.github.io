        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK, France, and Germany have reactivated a "snapback" provision from the 2015 nuclear deal, reimposing comprehensive UN sanctions on Iran. This move follows accusations of Iran's "continued nuclear escalation" and lack of cooperation with international inspectors. The action complicates diplomatic efforts, as Iran deems the sanctions illegal and unjust, especially after recent US and Israeli strikes on its nuclear facilities. The European powers maintain that this is not the end of diplomacy but a necessary step due to Iran's repeated breaches of the agreement.</p>

          <p>UK Labour leader Keir Starmer has condemned Reform UK's proposal to eliminate indefinite leave to remain as both "racist" and "immoral." He argued that the policy would unjustly target individuals legally residing and contributing to the UK, potentially tearing the country apart. Starmer differentiated between removing illegal migrants and targeting lawful residents, suggesting Reform UK voters are not racist but are frustrated with years of Conservative government failures. Reform UK defended its plan, stating it ensures migrants contribute to society and that only British citizens should access welfare.</p>

          <p>The UK government will underwrite a £1.5 billion loan to support Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and its suppliers following a prolonged production halt caused by a major cyberattack. The attack, which occurred at the end of August, has cost the automaker an estimated £50 million per week and threatened the solvency of smaller businesses in its supply chain. Business Secretary Peter Kyle stated the loan guarantee is intended to protect thousands of jobs across the UK. This marks a significant instance of government intervention to mitigate the economic fallout from a cybersecurity incident on a major manufacturer.</p>

          <p>According to Gaza's Health Ministry, the number of Palestinians killed in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war has now exceeded 66,000, with over 168,000 injured. The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-run administration, reported that 79 of these deaths occurred within the last 24 hours. Israel's military offensive continues as its Prime Minister is scheduled to meet with the US President.

          <p>A new memoir by King Charles III's former butler, Grant Harrold, reveals details about Prince Philip's notoriously blunt and often profane communication style. Harrold recounts hearing the late Duke of Edinburgh exclaim, "Thank f--- that’s over," after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding. The article compiles anecdotes from various sources illustrating Philip's impatience and unfiltered opinions, which were often feared by palace staff but also seen by some as a genuine and endearing quality. His remarks were a well-known part of his public persona throughout his life.</p>

          <p>A recently published campaign memoir by Kamala Harris is causing friction within the Democratic party, potentially complicating a future presidential run. The book contains mild criticisms of President Biden and details perceived slights from potential 2028 rivals like governors Gavin Newsom, Josh Shapiro, and Gretchen Whitmer. Loyalists to Biden and others in the party have bristled at the timing and content, viewing it as a self-serving account that avoids personal blame for her campaign's defeat. The article suggests that by revisiting past grievances, Harris may be burning political bridges.</p>

          <p>The biznaga, a species of barrel cactus, is facing extinction in Mexico due to its use in a traditional crystallized candy called acitrón. Despite a government ban on its sale, the candy remains popular and is widely available in markets, especially for use in the national dish, chiles en nogada. Biologists explain that the cactus grows extremely slowly, making commercial farming impractical and leading to illegal harvesting from the wild. Some chefs are now promoting sustainable alternatives, like candied squash, to preserve the endangered plant while honoring culinary traditions.</p>

          <p>Faced with soaring housing prices, which have risen 56% since 2020, a growing number of Americans are co-buying homes with friends or relatives. This trend is particularly prevalent among younger generations and single individuals who are priced out of the market on their own. Combining incomes allows buyers to overcome the significant "couple's advantage" in housing affordability, unlocking more purchasing options. While the strategy offers a financial solution, experts advise co-buyers to create formal legal agreements to navigate potential future complications regarding property ownership and shared expenses.</p>

The author argues that while their methods differ, their goals are aligned, as both leaders are hostile to the EU, liberal democracy, and international law, and both support hard-right populist movements across the continent. The piece suggests this parallel assault aims to undermine European security, prosperity, and progressive values, creating a significant threat to the continent's stability.</p>

          <h2>Zurich Votes on Proposal to Ban Gas-Powered Leaf Blowers</h2>

          <p>Citizens of Zurich, Switzerland, are voting in a referendum on a proposal to significantly restrict the use of leaf blowers and vacuums to curb noise and air pollution. If passed, the measure would completely ban gas-powered models within the city. Electric devices would be permitted only from October to December without special permission. Supporters of the ban cite the machines' loud noise, the fine dust they spread, and their harm to microorganisms, recommending rakes as an alternative. Opponents argue the ban is an example of excessive regulation that would create unnecessary difficulties.</p>

          <p>The case of Benjamin Elliott, a Texas teenager who fatally stabbed his twin sister Meghan in 2021, is explored as his defense claims he was sleepwalking during the act. After stabbing his sister, Benjamin immediately called 911 in distress, stating he thought he was dreaming. Prosecutors could find no motive or evidence of conflict between the twins, who were described as extremely close. A sleep disorder expert who studied Benjamin supports the defense, noting a family history of sleepwalking, but prosecutors remain skeptical and have proceeded with a murder trial.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that a majority of companies are at risk of incurring "AI debt," the future costs of correcting poorly implemented artificial intelligence systems. As businesses rush to adopt AI, many lack the necessary infrastructure, training, and oversight, leading to issues like security risks, poor data quality, and wasted resources. This can result in digital burnout for employees who must deal with AI-generated "workslop" and unmanageable workloads. Experts advise a more thoughtful, strategic approach, including piloting AI tools, to avoid the significant financial and human costs of sloppy execution.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's proposal to significantly increase H-1B visa fees could inadvertently boost the technology sectors in the Middle East, particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. As the U.S. potentially becomes more restrictive, Gulf nations are actively trying to attract top global talent with high compensation packages, a tax-friendly environment, and long-term "golden visas." These countries are investing billions into becoming global AI hubs and offer a business-friendly climate that could outcompete other regions for skilled professionals. This shift could reshape the global distribution of tech expertise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the recent "framework consensus" for TikTok's U.S. operations is not the clear victory for the United States that it appears to be. While the deal places American data and servers under U.S. control, it still leaves TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, as the single largest shareholder of the American operation. The author suggests that this arrangement allows China to retain significant leverage and influence over the platform. The article concludes that what seems like a win for the Trump administration could ultimately be a major strategic triumph for China.</p>
