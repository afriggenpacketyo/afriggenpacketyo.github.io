          <p>This article highlights several key news stories, including a report from The Daily Telegraph alleging the Trump administration is restricting Ukraine from using long-range US-made missiles against Russia. This move is reportedly intended to compel Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, although Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated his country has developed its own advanced weapons. Domestically, a Times/YouGov poll reveals that nearly three-quarters of UK voters disapprove of Sir Keir Starmer's handling of asylum seekers housed in hotels, underscoring significant public concern. Additionally, the Daily Mail previews Virginia Giuffre's posthumous memoir, which promises to expose "intimate, disturbing, and heartbreaking details" about systemic failures in trafficking.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific stock markets experienced a notable rally on Monday, tracking gains seen on Wall Street, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's indications that the central bank might begin easing monetary policy next month. This optimistic outlook, stemming from Powell's annual speech in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, spurred significant increases across the region. South Korea's Kospi index rose by 0.67% and the small-cap Kosdaq advanced 1.91%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a 0.69% increase. Investors are now keenly awaiting Singapore's consumer price index reading for July, with Reuters-polled economists forecasting a 0.6% year-over-year rise, consistent with the previous month.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-24 22:23:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency following a significant rise in the state's infant mortality rate, which has reached its highest level in over a decade and is nearly double the national average. This crisis disproportionately affects Black infants, who are more than twice as likely to die before their first birthday, with racial gaps widening. The state's plan to address this includes expanding prenatal services in underserved counties, establishing a regional obstetric care system, and bolstering home visiting programs. However, federal funding cuts to crucial maternal and infant health initiatives and Mississippi's decision not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act are complicating efforts to combat these deeply entrenched systemic inequities.</p>

While a transformer was damaged and a fire also broke out at a fuel export terminal in the Leningrad region, the plant fire was quickly extinguished, and radiation levels remained normal with no injuries reported. The UN nuclear watchdog acknowledged media reports but had not independently confirmed the incident, emphasizing the need to protect all nuclear facilities. Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to intercept 95 Ukrainian drones, while Ukraine's air force reported shooting down or jamming 48 Russian drones and decoys.</p>

          <p>Some National Guard members deployed in Washington D.C., fewer than 50, have been authorized to carry their service weapons starting Sunday night, a significant escalation in President Trump's law enforcement crackdown. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued the directive, reversing previous guidance that troops would remain unarmed. The Joint Task Force in D.C. stated personnel will operate under established Rules for the Use of Force, allowing force only as a last resort against imminent threats. This move comes as nearly 2,000 Guard members are stationed in the city, with local officials arguing the initiative is unnecessary given declining violent crime rates.</p>

This diplomatic discord follows Macron's rejection of similar accusations from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding France's intention to recognize a Palestinian state.

          <p>Chinese property giant Evergrande has been officially delisted from the Hong Kong stock market, concluding its spectacular fall from grace under the weight of immense debt. Once a leading real estate firm, its shares were suspended following a winding-up order in January 2024, after its valuation had already plummeted by over 99%. The company's demise, triggered by Beijing's 2020 rules to control developer borrowing, has severely impacted China's economy, contributing to widespread layoffs and suppressed consumer spending as property values declined. Experts suggest the property slump remains the biggest drag on the economy, with a full recovery potentially years away despite government efforts to stimulate the market.</p>

Individuals like Gabriela, whose family suffered extreme violence, face difficulties proving asylum claims under US law, which narrowly defines persecution grounds. While the Biden administration repealed some Trump-era restrictions on gang violence asylum, the underlying law remains unchanged, leaving many in limbo. Concerns are rising that Trump's designation of some cartels as terrorist organizations could inadvertently lead to the rejection of asylum claims from victims forced to provide "material support."</p>

          <p>The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in southern France has recognized over 70 medical miracles in 163 years, attracting millions of pilgrims annually. The Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, led by Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, conducts decade-long investigations into thousands of claimed cures. Doctors and researchers scrutinize cases to determine if a severe disease was cured instantaneously, completely, and lastingly, with no possible medical explanation according to current knowledge. While skeptics question historical rigor, analyses, including one published in 2014, have found the office's conclusions credible, with four living miracle recipients testifying to their enduring health.</p>

          <p>New evidence, including a chilling video of a Saudi national filming the U.S. Capitol and an airplane sketch, has surfaced from the 9/11 investigation, raising serious questions about information sharing. The material, seized from Saudi operative Omar al-Bayoumi's UK apartment in 2001, was never shared with FBI field agents or top intelligence officials like the CIA director. Retired investigators assert this evidence could have built a stronger case against Bayoumi, whom they now believe was an al Qaeda facilitator. The revelation suggests the 9/11 Commission was not fully informed, prompting Senators to demand answers from the FBI regarding this critical intelligence failure.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused President Trump of "manufacturing a crisis" to justify deploying federalized National Guard troops to Chicago, overriding local leaders. This plan, which follows deployments in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, has drawn strong opposition from Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who call it an abuse of power and a flagrant constitutional violation. Trump insists Chicagoans are "screaming" for help, despite local statistics showing significant reductions in violent crime. The Pentagon confirmed planning is underway, but Democrats argue Trump is playing games with American lives and distracting from his unpopularity.</p>

          <p>Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse has been abruptly ousted as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), a move for which no official reason was given, sparking significant concerns about the politicization of intelligence within the administration. This removal notably follows the DIA's preliminary assessment of military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, which indicated a setback of months, directly contradicting President Trump's assertion that Iran's program was "completely and totally obliterated." A senior defense official confirmed the ousting, while Democratic Senator Mark Warner criticized it as treating intelligence as a loyalty test. The incident has reportedly caused widespread apprehension among DIA employees regarding the integrity of their work.</p>

          <p>A homeowner's association (HOA) issued a warning to a resident, prohibiting them from charging a Tesla in their driveway, not due to the electric vehicle itself, but because the Level 1 charging cable was deemed unsightly. The HOA's letter cited "electrical chords running along the ground" as not permitted, referencing NEC 625, which governs EV charging. However, many online commenters and experts pointed out that NEC 625 does not ban standard Level 1 charging when equipment is used as intended. The incident highlights common HOA overreach and the tension between property rules and evolving technology, with the board's focus seemingly on aesthetics rather than safety.</p>

          <p>A new case of the flesh-eating screwworm parasite has been identified in a person in Maryland who recently traveled from Guatemala, marking a significant development as the outbreak spreads northward from Central America. This parasitic fly lays eggs in wounds, with larvae burrowing through living flesh, potentially fatal if untreated, and poses a devastating threat to cattle and wildlife. The case comes amidst criticism of the USDA for its slow response in increasing sterile fly production, a method that eradicated screwworm from the US in the 1960s. The confirmed human case is expected to impact the beef and cattle futures market, already experiencing record-high prices.</p>

The Pickett Fire in California grew to over 10 square miles, with only 11% containment, threatening approximately 500 structures and prompting evacuation orders for 190 people. Concurrently, Oregon's Flat Fire escalated to nearly 34 square miles with no containment, affecting 4,000 homes and leading to evacuation notices for 10,000 residents. Air quality alerts are in effect across multiple counties, and while a single event cannot be directly tied to climate change, scientists note human-caused warming contributes to more intense heatwaves and destructive wildfires.</p>
