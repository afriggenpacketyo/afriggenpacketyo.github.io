          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. announced a 10% year-over-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand ahead of potential negative impacts from higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. The automaker's global production also rose by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. Despite U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of additional tariffs on cars produced outside the United States, Toyota stated it would not pass the cost onto consumers, though analysts believe this may be difficult in the long term. The company anticipates a significant drop in net profit for the business year due to these tariffs and a stronger yen (not investment advice).</p>

The U.S. Court of International Trade halted the 10% tariffs imposed on virtually every U.S. trading partner, as well as tariffs on China, Mexico, and Canada. The court rejected the administration's justification based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), stating that the law does not grant the president blanket authority to set tariffs.

          <p>The San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) has decided not to proceed with its proposed "Grading for Equity" strategy following significant backlash from the community. The strategy, presented during an SFUSD Board of Education meeting, aimed to offer professional development in standards-based grading. Under the proposed system, final exam scores would primarily determine semester grades, while homework, weekly tests, and tardiness would not impact the grade, additionally altering the letter-grade system to allow lower scores to receive higher grades. Amid criticism from the mayor, lawmakers, and the community, the SFUSD clarified that no changes to grading practices have been implemented, emphasizing its commitment to high standards and student success.</p>

          <p>China is intensifying its efforts to bolster advanced manufacturing, a strategy that could conflict with the Trump administration's goals of boosting domestic production of high-tech products and addressing trade imbalances. President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed plans for manufacturing-led growth, emphasizing self-reliance in advanced sectors. This approach, criticized by the U.S. for distorting competition through state subsidies, aims to transform China into a leading high-end manufacturer in areas like electric vehicles and semiconductors. Experts suggest that China is unlikely to scale back its manufacturing strategy, anticipating continued trade tensions and tariff rates between the U.S. and China (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has criticized Reform UK leader Nigel Farage's economic policies as "fantasy" economics, likening him to former PM Liz Truss. Starmer argues that Reform's unfunded tax cuts could trigger an economic meltdown and increase mortgage costs, similar to the fallout from Truss's mini-budget in 2022. Reform UK, which made gains in recent local elections, has proposed tax breaks for married couples, scrapping the two-child benefit cap, and restoring winter fuel payments for all pensioners. Economists have questioned the feasibility of Reform's plans, particularly raising the income tax threshold, without specifying funding sources (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Chinese startup DeepSeek has quietly launched an upgraded version of its R1 artificial intelligence reasoning model, intensifying competition with companies like OpenAI. The company did not make an official announcement, but the upgrade was released on the AI model repository Hugging Face. DeepSeek gained prominence earlier this year when its open-source R1 reasoning model outperformed rivals, raising concerns about overspending by U.S. tech giants on AI infrastructure. The upgraded model is a reasoning AI, meaning it can execute more complicated tasks through a step-by-step logical thought process and benchmarks closely with OpenAI's models.</p>

          <p>The Women's US Open, backed by a $12 million purse, is occurring during a period of transition and challenge for the LPGA. Following the departure of former commissioner Mike Whan, the LPGA has faced setbacks, including sponsor issues and a failed merger attempt with the Ladies European Tour. The new commissioner, Mollie Marcoux Samaan, resigned at the end of last year amidst player pressure, with priorities for her successor including rebuilding trust with players, sponsors, and fans. New commissioner Kessler speaks of pillars to underpin his new regime, starting with "building trust; trust with our players, trust with our sponsors, trust with our fans, and trust with our team".</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has criticized Israel's military conduct in Gaza, calling it "beyond comprehension," prompting a muted response from the Israeli government. Experts suggest the remarks have resonated deeply within Israel, particularly given Merz's historically cautious stance on criticizing Israel. While other European nations had voiced bolder criticism of Israel's conduct in Gaza, "Chancellor Merz has so far been very restrained," he added.

Manager Ron Washington employed unconventional strategies, including intentionally walking Aaron Judge twice in the first two innings, but the Angels could not generate any runs.

Harvard is a test case for how to deal with the White House, administration officials said.
