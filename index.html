          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced the cancellation of approximately $500 million in federal funding for 22 mRNA vaccine development projects, including those for COVID-19 and influenza. Kennedy stated that the administration determined mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for respiratory viruses, a claim strongly disputed by leading infectious disease experts. Critics, such as Dr. Paul Offit and Dr. Michael Osterholm, condemned the decision, warning it is not based on scientific evidence and will leave the country vulnerable to future pandemics.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from repurposing over $4 billion in FEMA disaster relief funds. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge stated the move could cause "irreparable harm" to communities vulnerable to natural disasters like floods. This decision temporarily safeguards funding for critical infrastructure projects while the court further reviews the legality of the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has filed a lawsuit seeking to remove Democratic State Representative Gene Wu from office, labeling him the "ringleader" of a legislative walkout. Over 50 Democrats fled the state to prevent a quorum, thereby blocking a vote on a Republican-backed congressional redistricting plan. The lawsuit argues this constitutes abandonment of office, while Democrats maintain they are fulfilling their constitutional duty to oppose a gerrymandered map. Abbott is asking the state's Republican-dominated Supreme Court for an expedited ruling on the matter.</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) announced it will expand its detention capacity by housing 1,000 detainees at the Miami correctional center, a maximum-security prison in Indiana. The move is part of a broader expansion of immigration jails under the Trump administration. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem dubbed the facility the "Speedway Slammer," echoing the controversial naming of a similar facility in Florida. Civil liberties groups have previously raised concerns about inhumane conditions at the Indiana prison, including prolonged darkness and live electrical wires in some cells.</p>

When asked if Vance was the heir-apparent to the MAGA movement, Trump agreed, noting his position as vice president gives him an advantage. Trump also mentioned that Secretary of State Marco Rubio could potentially team up with Vance, and acknowledged other strong contenders within his administration. The comments came as Trump signed an executive order related to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.</p>

          <p>A state-owned Chinese company is making significant progress on the Mes Aynak copper mine in Afghanistan, with production potentially starting this year after a 17-year delay. The project, awarded in 2008, was stalled by security issues, the presence of ancient archaeological sites, and landmines. To address concerns, the Taliban government announced a switch from open-pit to more expensive underground mining to better protect the historical relics. The mine is located on one of the world's largest untouched copper deposits, representing a major economic opportunity for the region.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy had effectively closed the asylum system to individuals entering the country illegally, a measure the administration credited for a sharp drop in border crossings. The court ruled that while the government can pause access to asylum, it cannot ignore other laws protecting migrants from being returned to countries where they face persecution or torture. This decision reopens pathways for humanitarian claims, though claimants will likely remain detained.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has released two new open-weight language models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, making its model parameters publicly available for the first time since 2019. These models are designed as lower-cost alternatives for developers and researchers to customize, rivaling similar offerings from Meta and Mistral. The company stated it conducted extensive safety testing to prevent malicious use. The release marks a significant step for OpenAI in contributing to the open-source AI ecosystem, allowing the models to run on a wide range of hardware, from laptops to cloud servers.</p>

          <p>New research from Rwanda, based on 20 years of data, indicates that social relationships between female mountain gorillas are more crucial than previously thought. The study found that when a female gorilla moves to a new social group, she actively seeks out and joins other females she already knows, even if they have been separated for many years. This behavior highlights the importance of these same-sex bonds, or "friendships," in navigating the social hierarchy and mitigating aggression from resident females. The findings offer insight into the evolutionary roots of social movement.</p>

          <p>A weeklong manhunt has ended with the arrest of Austin Robert Drummond, the suspect in the killing of four family members in rural Tennessee. Drummond is accused of killing his girlfriend's parents, grandmother, and teenage uncle before abandoning the couple's infant in front of a stranger's home. The arrest occurred after a shelter-in-place order was issued in Jackson, Tennessee, following sightings of the suspect. Authorities described the killings as a targeted attack and are now holding Drummond on multiple charges, including four counts of first-degree murder.</p>

          <p>Despite significant technological advancements, public perception of weather forecasting accuracy remains mixed, a phenomenon this article explores. Modern forecasts are over 90% accurate for the next day, yet challenges persist due to the atmosphere's chaotic nature, where tiny errors can lead to vastly different outcomes. Communicating vast amounts of data and uncertainty to the public in a concise format is a major hurdle. The future of forecasting lies in AI, which promises greater accuracy and longer-range predictions, but also presents new challenges in interpreting and communicating increasingly complex information.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned two advertisements from fashion retailer Zara for featuring models who appeared to be "unhealthily thin." The watchdog ruled the images were "irresponsible," citing one model's "gaunt" appearance and another's "protruding" collarbones as a focal point. Zara, which has since removed the ads, stated that both models had medical certificates confirming their good health. This ruling follows similar bans on ads from other major retailers like Marks & Spencer and Next for similar concerns over model health.</p>

          <p>A major UK debt adviser, Money Wellness, is urging the government to introduce a statutory school clothing grant for low-income families in England, similar to programs in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. A study found that only about one-fifth of English councils offer any financial support for school uniforms, creating a "postcode lottery." With uniform costs averaging over £340 for primary students, many families face significant financial strain. The call for consistent national support aims to ensure no child is disadvantaged based on their location.</p>

The economic thinktank projects the government is on track to miss its debt reduction target by over £41 billion, due to weakening economic growth and the reversal of planned welfare cuts. Niesr recommended a "moderate but sustained increase in taxes" to close the gap and reassure investors, suggesting the chancellor faces a difficult choice between her spending, tax, and borrowing pledges.

In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to face tight supply, which has kept prices elevated.
