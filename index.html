          <p>Japan has strongly requested that China take measures to prevent future close encounters between military aircraft after a near miss involving a Chinese J-15 warplane and a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force patrol plane over international waters in the Pacific. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi conveyed Japan's "serious concern" to China through diplomatic and defense channels, emphasizing the potential for collision due to the Chinese aircraft's maneuvers. Japan is on alert for increased Chinese military activity, including simultaneous operations of China's aircraft carriers in the Pacific, and will continue surveillance to defend its territory. The incident occurred when the Chinese fighter jet approached as close as 45 meters to the Japanese plane. </p>

          <p>The United States is set to partially evacuate its embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, due to heightened security risks amid rising tensions with Iran. Non-essential embassy staff and their dependents will be removed following reports that Israel is prepared to launch an operation into Iran, potentially triggering retaliatory actions against U.S. sites in Iraq. Despite the evacuation, U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff is still scheduled to meet with Iranian officials in Muscat for talks on Iran's nuclear program. President Trump reiterated that the U.S. does not want Iran to develop nuclear weapons and is growing less confident that Iran will halt uranium enrichment.</p>

China has been more reserved in its comments, stating that representatives will submit a report for President Xi Jinping's approval. Trump shared initial details on his Truth Social platform, stating that a U.S.-China accord was "done," though specifics remain limited. </p>

          <p>A U.S. nuclear weapons expert, Jeffrey Lewis, has shared satellite images of a suspected new uranium enrichment facility under construction in Yongbyon, North Korea. The images, taken in April, support earlier claims by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) regarding the construction of a new structure with features similar to an existing enrichment plant in Kangson. The new facility includes a large central hall where centrifuges could be installed, along with surrounding office and support spaces. Lewis noted similarities in layout and dimensions when comparing the facility to a satellite image taken during the construction of the Kangson enrichment facility in 2002.</p>

          <p>The Karen Read trial concluded with defense expert Dr. Andrew Rentschler disputing the prosecution's claims about the death of John O'Keefe. Rentschler testified that O'Keefe's injuries were inconsistent with being struck by Read's SUV, stating that the lack of broken bones on O'Keefe's right arm indicated the injuries did not align with an SUV strike at approximately 24 miles per hour. Special prosecutor Hank Brennan questioned Rentschler's testing thoroughness, highlighting the shattered taillight pieces found near O'Keefe. The jury will begin deliberations on Friday after receiving instructions from the judge and listening to closing arguments, with legal analysts noting the importance of closing arguments for both sides.</p>

          <p>With U.S. restrictions limiting China's access to advanced semiconductors for artificial intelligence, Beijing is focusing on developing domestic alternatives, particularly through Huawei. U.S. curbs impact the entire semiconductor value chain, from design and manufacturing equipment to memory chips, prompting China to invest heavily in closing these gaps. While China has made progress, it still lags behind in key areas; Huawei's Ascend 910B GPU is nearly a full generation behind Nvidia's export-restricted chips, but is closing the gap. SMIC, China's largest chip foundry, is behind TSMC in manufacturing capabilities, and faces challenges in acquiring advanced chipmaking equipment from companies like ASML. (not investment advice)</p>

While Japan has improved women's participation in the economic arena, it still lags behind other advanced economies, with Italy ranking significantly higher at 85th.

          <p>Activist David Hogg has stepped down from his position as a Democratic National Committee (DNC) vice chair, citing a "fundamental disagreement" with the party apparatus about the role of the vice chair. Hogg, who will not run in the upcoming elections, intends to focus on his PAC, Leaders We Deserve, which supports aligned candidates in Democratic primaries. DNC chair Ken Martin lauded Hogg's record and wished him well despite escalating tensions, while Hogg expressed respect for his fellow officers. The DNC re-do election is still scheduled to proceed, though it remains unclear if Malcolm Kenyatta will automatically win the candidate ballot since he is now unopposed.</p>

          <p>A strip club in Kharkiv, Ukraine, has become a place of solace for traumatized soldiers amid the ongoing conflict with Russia. Dancers at the Flash Dancers club act as confidantes to soldiers, listening to their experiences and providing comfort. Some soldiers share videos from the battlefield, while others sit alone at the bar, crying. Despite the club's attempts to maintain boundaries, the war often creeps inside, with many regulars being wounded and some killed in action.</p>

However, some departments, including the Foreign Office and the environment department, will face cuts in day-to-day spending.

The review comes as the US urges allies to increase military spending, with the UK agreeing to spend 2.5% of GDP on defense by 2028 and 3% by the next parliament.
