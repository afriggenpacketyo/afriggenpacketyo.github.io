          <p>President Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs represents a culmination of his decades-long advocacy for protectionist trade policies.  The move, while fulfilling a longstanding goal, is considered a significant risk, with economists warning of potential negative consequences for the US and global economy.  The massive tariffs are predicted to raise prices for American consumers and increase the likelihood of a global recession.</p>
