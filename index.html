          <p>France's Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu has resigned after only 27 days in office, marking the shortest tenure in the history of the Fifth French Republic. This move plunges the nation deeper into political paralysis, which began after President Emmanuel Macron's centrist coalition lost its parliamentary majority in snap elections. Lecornu cited the inability to form a functional government due to partisan gridlock, prompting far-right leader Marine Le Pen to call for new elections. The ongoing instability has exacerbated France's economic woes, including a growing debt crisis and a recent credit rating downgrade.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has condemned the Trump administration's decision to deploy 400 members of the Texas National Guard to Illinois without his consent, labeling the move "Trump's Invasion." Pritzker stated he was not directly contacted by federal officials and called on Texas Governor Greg Abbott to refuse cooperation. The deployment comes amid ongoing clashes between protesters and federal agents in Illinois, with the administration citing the need to protect federal employees. This action follows an ultimatum where the administration threatened to federalize the Illinois National Guard if the state did not deploy them.</p>

          <p>Three men have been imprisoned for their roles in violent protests outside a hotel housing asylum seekers in Epping, Essex. The disorder, which prosecutors said was motivated by hostility towards the asylum seekers, involved sustained attacks on police officers over four hours. The men admitted to violent disorder, which included pushing, punching, and kicking officers during demonstrations that required a £1.54 million policing operation. The judge noted that the protests were planned on social media with calls to "mask up and bring rage," leading to significant disruption and fear in the local community.</p>

          <p>Dr. Tsion Firew, an emergency room doctor in Rwanda, shares her personal and professional struggle during the country's first Marburg virus outbreak in 2024. Faced with a highly contagious and deadly disease that killed many of her colleagues, she sent her young children abroad and battled extreme exhaustion and fear to treat patients. The article highlights Rwanda's successful response, which achieved the lowest death rate ever recorded for a Marburg outbreak by rapidly implementing testing, isolation, and experimental treatments. Dr. Firew reflects on the importance of trusting science and public health measures, contrasting the effective response with global health misinformation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy is presenting a confusing and contradictory picture, leading some analysts to describe it as a "rolling recession" where different sectors experience downturns at different times. While overall GDP growth remains strong, driven by a boom in AI investment, key areas like manufacturing, housing, and agriculture are contracting. The recent government shutdown, rising consumer debt, and slowing wage growth are increasing financial distress for many households, even as the national unemployment rate remains relatively low. This economic fragmentation makes it difficult to determine the country's overall financial health, creating widespread uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan's ambitious Indigenous Defence Submarine (IDS) program is facing significant challenges as sea tests for its prototype vessel, the Hai Kun, have fallen behind schedule. The submarine, a key component of Taiwan's strategy to bolster its asymmetric naval capabilities, has spent an unexpectedly long time in dry dock for maintenance between surface navigation tests. These delays are raising concerns about whether the program can meet its targets for shallow and deep dive trials.

          <p>Chuck Collins' new book, "Burned by Billionaires," argues that the American economic system is intentionally designed to funnel wealth upward, exacerbating inequality. While most Americans face stagnant wages and rising costs, the wealth of billionaires has surged, largely due to a stock market that benefits a small fraction of the population. Collins details the "wealth defense industry" of lawyers and accountants who help the rich minimize taxes, as well as the political influence used to protect these advantages. The book also explores how private equity, controlled by the ultra-wealthy, extracts value from essential sectors like healthcare and housing, directly impacting everyday Americans.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to repeal the Clinton-era "roadless rule," a landmark conservation policy that has protected 58 million acres of pristine national forests from road construction and logging for over two decades. The administration argues the rule is overly restrictive and an obstacle to development, aiming to increase timber harvesting from national forests significantly. Environmental advocates warn that this move threatens critical ecosystems that provide clean drinking water for millions of Americans, serve as habitats for endangered species, and store vast amounts of carbon.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court's 2024 ruling granting former presidents immunity for official acts could have significant negative consequences for international law and the prosecution of global crimes. Historically, the legal trend has moved away from absolute immunity, notably since the Nuremberg trials and the Pinochet case, which established that former heads of state could be held accountable for international crimes like torture. However, the Supreme Court's decision creates a new precedent that could be adopted by authoritarian states to shield their leaders from accountability. This move contradicts decades of U.S.-led efforts to ensure that no one, regardless of their power, is above the law.</p>

          <p>The animated film 'KPop Demon Hunters' has become Netflix's most popular movie of all time, driven by its hit soundtrack and a story that authentically embraces K-pop culture. The movie follows a girl group, Huntr/x, who lead double lives as demon slayers, battling a rival boy band of demons. Initially passed over for distribution by Sony, its creator studio, the film's success is attributed to its immersive approach, which avoids condescending explanations of K-pop for Western audiences. Its popularity highlights a historic failure in Hollywood to create successful scripted K-pop features, often due to an "outsider's gaze" in storytelling.</p>

In 2008, a young Kershaw and an aging Maddux were both in the Dodgers' bullpen during the playoffs. Despite his continued effectiveness, Kershaw accepted the new role due to the team's deep roster of healthy starting pitchers. The decision highlights Kershaw's team-first mentality as he seeks a final championship, finishing his career in a supporting role rather than as the ace.</p>

          <p>The South African anti-immigration group "Operation Dudula" is escalating its xenophobic campaigns, recently targeting migrant children by demanding their exclusion from public schools. Founded in 2021, the populist movement blames foreigners for crime, unemployment, and strained public services, gaining support by promoting a "South Africans First" narrative. The group is known for vigilante tactics, such as blocking migrants' access to hospitals and conducting unauthorized ID checks. Critics argue that the movement scapegoats migrants for systemic government failures and inequalities that have persisted since the end of Apartheid, while supporters claim they are protecting their civil rights.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is set to deport another 11 people to Eswatini, a southern African kingdom with which they have no connection, under a controversial third-country removal agreement. This follows a previous deportation of five men to Eswatini in July, who were then held in a maximum-security prison. Human rights lawyers and NGOs have condemned these deals, arguing they violate migrants' rights by sending them to unfamiliar countries without due process. The Trump administration has expanded these agreements to ramp up deportations, sending individuals to nations like Rwanda, Uganda, and El Salvador, even when they face risks in their home countries.</p>

          <p>Israeli and Hamas negotiators are set to begin indirect talks in Egypt, raising cautious optimism for an end to the war in Gaza and the release of remaining hostages. The discussions will center on a 20-point peace plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, which Israel has accepted. Hamas has reportedly agreed to key points, including the release of all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and transferring Gaza's control to an international body. However, disagreements remain over Hamas's disarmament. Amid the diplomatic efforts, Israeli strikes in Gaza have continued, though at a reduced intensity.</p>

          <p>Japanese beverage giant Asahi has partially restarted operations at its six breweries in the country after a cyberattack forced a complete shutdown. The hack disrupted the company's ordering and delivery systems, leading to warnings of beer shortages from major retailers like 7-Eleven. While the production systems themselves were unaffected, the inability to process orders halted manufacturing. Asahi, which owns international brands like Peroni and Grolsch, stated that only its Japanese operations were impacted. The company is working to restore its systems fully but has not provided a clear timeline for complete recovery.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is endangering the public by lowering its hiring standards in a rush to expand its agent workforce. The agency has reduced the minimum age to 18, eliminated an age cap, and shortened training time, all while no longer requiring a high school diploma or law enforcement experience. The author warns that these changes could lead to inexperienced and poorly trained agents making life-altering decisions, potentially repeating past mistakes of other rapidly expanding federal agencies that saw spikes in corruption and misconduct. The piece calls for a return to stricter requirements to ensure public safety.</p>

          <p>Welsh singer Charlotte Church, now 39, has described the intense media scrutiny she faced as a teenager as a "travesty" and "insane." Church, who rose to fame at age 11, recalled constant press intrusion and stories that were misconstrued to create a "fallen angel" narrative. She previously received substantial damages after it was revealed that the News of the World newspaper had hacked her phone and medical records when she was 16. Church believes her defiance and fury at the time helped protect her from internalizing the shame the press attempted to impose on her.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Supreme Court's conservative supermajority has consistently failed to act as a check on President Trump's power, repeatedly ruling in his favor in a manner similar to courts in authoritarian states. The author contends that the justices have ceded significant power to the executive branch, allowing the administration to gut federal agencies and bypass Congress, thereby undermining the rule of law. The piece suggests the court's actions may stem from ideological agreement, a desire to appease the president, and an overconfidence that U.S. democratic institutions are not truly in danger, comparing Chief Justice John Roberts to an appeasing Neville Chamberlain.</p>

The article focuses on the case of Robert Roberson, facing execution in Texas, who was diagnosed as a psychopath during his sentencing phase based on the checklist, with the expert witness comparing him to Adolf Hitler. Researchers and lawyers argue the test can be subjective and prejudicial, terrifying jurors into imposing harsher sentences based on a scientifically dubious prediction of future dangerousness.

          <p>The concept of empathy is being debated, with some questioning if it can be harmful despite being widely seen as a virtue. Stanford psychology professor Jamil Zaki explains that empathy has three parts: emotional, cognitive, and compassionate concern. While empathy is crucial for social connection and personal well-being, it can also lead to burnout and biased decision-making when it is not channeled into positive action. Zaki argues that empathy is not a fixed trait but a skill that can be developed, suggesting that practicing small acts of goodwill and approaching disagreements with humility can help strengthen this vital human capacity.</p>
