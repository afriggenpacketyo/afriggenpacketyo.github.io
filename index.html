          <p>The UN Security Council is scheduled for an emergency session following Estonia's report that three Russian MiG-31 jets briefly entered its airspace. Tallinn, requesting the meeting for the first time in its 34-year UN membership, condemned the incursion as a "brazen violation" and part of a broader Russian escalation, though Moscow denies the charge. German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul supported Estonia, while Italian NATO jets reportedly escorted the Russian aircraft out. The incident highlights escalating tensions and security concerns in the region, with Russia's veto power as a permanent council member complicating potential resolutions.</p>

          <p>Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and Trade Minister Piyush Goyal are visiting the US for talks with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other officials. These meetings aim to mend strained relations following Washington's increased tariffs on Indian goods, a response to India's Russian oil imports, and new H-1B visa fees. India seeks to protect its agricultural sector in trade negotiations, while Prime Minister Modi advocates for self-reliance by urging citizens to shun foreign goods. The H-1B visa changes, particularly a $100,000 fee, have significantly impacted Indian tech workers and stocks, causing uncertainty for skilled talent mobility.</p>

          <p>Evelyn Palla has been named the new chief executive of Germany's state-owned rail operator, Deutsche Bahn (DB), succeeding Richard Lutz, who was dismissed due to mounting reliability and infrastructural issues. Palla, previously head of DB Regio, is the company's first female CEO, with her appointment welcomed by the train drivers' union and passenger advocacy groups. Despite persistent punctuality problems, public transportation use in Germany increased slightly in 2025, though the initial boom from the Deutschlandticket is waning as prices rise. The new CEO faces the challenge of improving DB's performance and regaining public trust.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, packing 230 km/h wind gusts, has made landfall over Panuitan Island in the Philippines' northern Cagayan province, prompting thousands of evacuations.

Schools and government offices, including in Manila, have been shut as the typhoon, locally known as Nando, is expected to barrel west towards southern China. The event occurs as the nation already grapples with weeks of intense monsoon flooding.</p>

          <p>World leaders are gathering at the UN General Assembly in New York to discuss a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, co-hosted by France and Saudi Arabia. This summit aims to revive peace efforts amid intensified Israeli operations in Gaza and recent recognitions of Palestinian statehood by the UK, Canada, and Australia. German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul emphasized the need for an immediate ceasefire, more humanitarian aid for Gaza, and the unconditional release of hostages. Meanwhile, the Allenby Bridge Crossing between the West Bank and Jordan has reopened for passengers but remains closed to Gaza aid shipments after an attack on Israeli soldiers.</p>

The project involves moving the existing Northern Runway by 12 meters to bring it into regular use, increasing annual flights from 280,000 to 389,000 by the late 2030s. While welcomed by the government for job creation and investment, the expansion faces strong opposition from climate campaigners who label it a "disaster for the climate crisis."

Many women report a decrease in libido and other side effects like vaginal dryness or mood swings, often without prior warning from doctors or packaging. Research suggests the pill can increase sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), which binds to free testosterone, thereby reducing sexual desire. However, libido is influenced by multiple factors, and studies show varied experiences, with some women reporting no change or even an increase due to pregnancy prevention. Experts highlight the evolution of pill formulations and the ongoing stigma around women's health as contributing to confusion.</p>

          <p>Families in south Wales are campaigning to raise awareness about Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), a rare, inherited neurological disorder that has formed a "cluster" in the region. Previously thought to be rare outside Japan, DRPLA causes progressive memory loss, impaired movement, seizures, and personality changes, with no known cure. Rachel Cowley shares her daughter Jessica's severe deterioration from the condition, while Zoe Hoes advocates for earlier testing and support for affected families. Experts note a generational shift towards more aggressive disease presentation and highlight the diagnostic challenges due to its rarity, emphasizing the need for increased awareness and access to genetic testing.</p>

          <p>A growing number of countries, now a majority worldwide, recognize Palestine as a state, with recent endorsements from the UK, Canada, Australia, and Portugal. This article details the historical path to recognition, noting that many nations formally acknowledged Palestine after the PLO's 1988 declaration, with a significant surge in the 2000s and 2010s. The shift in Western policy, particularly since the 2023 Gaza conflict, has seen countries like Ireland, Norway, and Spain formally recognize Palestinian statehood, despite strong opposition from the US and Israel. Full UN membership, however, remains elusive due to Security Council vetoes.</p>

The September 19 event, designed by artist Cai Guo-Qiang to resemble a dragon, sparked criticism online for contradicting Arc'teryx's conservation image and potentially harming the fragile ecosystem and sacred mountains. The Canadian firm stated the stunt was "out of line with Arc'teryx's values" and pledged to assess its environmental impact, using biodegradable materials.

          <p>A new report reveals that leading polluting countries, including China, the U.S., and India, plan to produce over twice the amount of fossil fuels by 2030 than is consistent with limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees Celsius. This "Production Gap Report" highlights a widening disparity between climate pledges under the Paris Agreement and actual production plans. China is a major contributor to this increase due to slower planned coal reductions. The article notes that while the report uses data from the Biden administration, proposed Trump policies aim to further boost U.S. fossil fuel production, raising concerns for global climate efforts.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) estimates that US tariffs imposed in August could slash up to one-fifth of Vietnam's exports to the United States, potentially costing the country $25 billion. This makes Vietnam the hardest-hit nation in Southeast Asia by the tariffs, which primarily affect goods produced by multinational companies. Following the tariffs, Vietnam's exports to the US fell 2% in August from July, with footwear seeing a 5.5% drop. The World Bank has consequently revised down Vietnam's growth forecasts, indicating a significant economic challenge for the nation. (not investment advice)</p>
