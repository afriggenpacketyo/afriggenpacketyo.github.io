          <h2>Experts Dispute RFK Jr.'s Focus on Environmental Toxins as Primary Cause of Autism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s focus on environmental toxins as the primary cause of autism, a view that is challenged by many autism scientists. These scientists assert that the increase in autism rates is largely due to expanding diagnostic criteria, increased awareness, and improved screening, not a novel environmental toxin. Genetic research has identified hundreds of genes associated with autism, building a strong case for genetics being the most significant driver. Experts worry that Kennedy's emphasis on environmental factors could divert resources from promising genetic research, which is leading to the development of new therapies for severe autism. The scientific community largely agrees that autism is a complex disorder with multiple variables, and genetics play a critical role.</p>

This program, championed by President Trump, aims to deposit $1,000 from the government into investment accounts for newborn Americans. The provision to create these accounts has already passed the House as part of a larger budget bill and is currently awaiting Senate approval. The program would seed index fund accounts with $1,000 in government funds for U.S. citizens born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced plans to sue the Trump administration for deploying the National Guard to Los Angeles without consulting him. Newsom criticized the deployment as illegal and inflammatory, accusing Trump of escalating the situation. The National Guard was sent to downtown Los Angeles amid protests and clashes following immigration enforcement operations. Newsom has requested the federal government to rescind the deployment, arguing that there is no need for the National Guard's presence.</p>

          <h2>Poland Reconsiders Black Hawk Helicopter Purchase Due to Ukraine War Lessons</h2>

          <p>Poland, a NATO member, has put on hold its plans to purchase 32 Black Hawk helicopters, citing the lessons learned from Russia's war in Ukraine. Polish military officials suggest that the conflict has highlighted the vulnerability of helicopters and the need to prioritize other military assets, such as drones and tanks. This decision reflects a shift in defense priorities based on the evolving nature of modern warfare. While Poland has not abandoned helicopters entirely, it is reevaluating its investment strategy in light of the war's impact.</p>

          <h2>Wyoming Hospital Challenges Private Equity Logic with Community-Driven Approach</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 10:03:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details the story of a Wyoming hospital that is challenging the conventional wisdom of private equity in rural healthcare. After a private-equity firm's cost-cutting measures led to the decline of their local hospital, residents of Riverton decided to build a new, community-owned hospital. Through a combination of local fundraising, government loans, and a commitment to community-driven healthcare, they are creating a model that prioritizes patient care over short-term profits. The project highlights the importance of local knowledge and investment in making decisions for a community's healthcare needs.</p>
