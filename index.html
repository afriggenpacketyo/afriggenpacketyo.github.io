          <p>At least 27 people, including nine children, have died in devastating flash floods in Texas. Among the victims identified through family members are an eight-year-old girl, Renee Smajstrla, who was attending Camp Mystic, and Jane Ragsdale, the director of the nearby Heart O' the Hills camp. The floods, caused by torrential rain, swept through multiple summer camps located along the Guadalupe River. Authorities report that dozens of children from Camp Mystic remain unaccounted for as extensive search and rescue operations continue in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is in a strong position to win the second Test against England, largely thanks to a remarkable batting performance from captain Shubman Gill. After scoring 269 in the first innings, Gill added another 161, allowing India to set England a near-impossible target of 608 runs. By the end of day four, England's top order had faltered, leaving them at 72-3. With a successful chase highly unlikely, England faces the difficult task of batting for a draw to maintain their series lead, a strategy at odds with their typically aggressive approach.</p>

          <h2>Experts Explain the Science Behind 'Old People Smell' and How to Manage It</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 14:28:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The phenomenon often described as "old people smell" is a real biological process, according to experts. The distinct scent is primarily caused by the compound 2-nonenal, which is produced as lipids on the skin break down with age and is not easily removed by regular washing. Other contributing factors can include medications, hormonal changes, and diet. While a sudden change in body odor could indicate a health issue, experts suggest that age-related scent can be managed through a holistic approach including an antioxidant-rich diet and proper skincare.</p>

          <p>The Madre fire, located in a rural area of San Luis Obispo County, has grown to nearly 80,000 acres, making it the largest wildfire in California this year. The blaze, which is only 10% contained, has forced over 200 people to evacuate and threatens about 50 structures. More than 600 firefighters are battling the fire, which is fueled by high heat and wind and is currently threatening the Carrizo Plain National Monument. Officials are concerned as a significant heat wave is forecast for Southern California, increasing the risk of further fire activity.</p>

They also advise avoiding alcohol and heavy, high-sodium meals before bed, as these can negatively impact both sleep quality and cardiovascular health.

          <p>The Trump administration has deported eight men with serious criminal convictions to South Sudan, a conflict-ridden nation where none of them hold citizenship. The men, originally from countries including Cuba, Mexico, and Vietnam, were sent to the African nation following a prolonged legal battle that reached the Supreme Court. Human rights advocates and lawyers for the men condemned the move as "punitive and unconstitutional," expressing fears the men could face torture or other harm. The administration defended the action as a victory for U.S. safety and security.</p>

          <p>The rise of digital payment systems with pre-set tipping options has led to "tipflation," where customers feel pressured to tip more often and in more situations, from coffee shops to self-service kiosks. This technological shift, accelerated during the pandemic, has created confusion about when and how much to tip. Experts note that while the prompts can increase tips, they can also irritate customers who feel guilted into paying more. The article explores the psychology behind tipping and suggests that the new digital norms are changing a long-standing social custom.</p>

          <p>Security analysts are concerned that recent U.S. military strikes on Iran could reinforce North Korea's belief that a nuclear arsenal is essential for its survival. Experts suggest Pyongyang may view the U.S. as an untrustworthy and unpredictable force, concluding that denuclearization would leave them vulnerable to a similar fate. This perception could effectively terminate any remaining possibility of denuclearization talks. Instead, North Korea might be driven to further develop and disperse its nuclear capabilities to ensure a credible second-strike option against potential aggression.</p>

          <p>A non-alcoholic "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on TikTok, with users claiming the mix of coconut water, juices, magnesium, and salt can lower the stress hormone cortisol. However, medical experts are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence to support these claims. Doctors note that cortisol levels fluctuate naturally and are rarely a target for reduction outside of specific medical conditions like Cushing's Syndrome. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, they caution that its stress-reducing effects are unproven and likely a placebo.</p>

          <p>A prototype of the "MingKwai" typewriter, an innovative Chinese-language machine invented by linguist Lin Yutang in the 1940s, has been discovered after being lost for decades. The machine is historically significant as its design, which breaks down Chinese characters by shape rather than sound, laid the conceptual groundwork for modern Chinese computing. Scholars are excited by the find, as the typewriter represents a pivotal moment in preserving a complex, non-alphabetic language for the digital age. The restored machine will soon be on public display at Stanford University.</p>

On Saturday, swimmers flocked to newly opened swimming spots near the Eiffel Tower, celebrating the return of a "childhood dream" for many residents.

The team studies various shark species in Washington's Willapa Bay, examining their stomach contents to understand their diet, health, and the overall condition of the marine ecosystem. By demonstrating the crucial role sharks play as apex predators, the researchers hope to garner more support for conservation efforts. They argue that a healthy shark population is a key indicator of a healthy ocean.</p>

He posited that winning just a few pivotal House and Senate seats would be enough to act as the deciding vote on contentious legislation, given the narrow partisan margins in Congress. This follows a public feud with President Trump over a new spending bill, which prompted Musk to threaten to form a new party to challenge the Republican-Democrat duopoly. (not investment advice)</p>
