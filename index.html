          <h2>Scotland's Waste Export to England Expected Due to Landfill Ban</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 01:15:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict that Scotland will export up to 100 truckloads of waste daily to England following the implementation of a landfill ban at the end of the year. The Scottish government acknowledges a current lack of sufficient incinerator capacity to handle the diverted waste. While the ban aims to reduce methane emissions from biodegradable waste, the short-term impact will be increased emissions from transporting waste to English landfills. Domestic recycling rates in Scotland have seen minimal improvement over the past decade, further exacerbating the issue.</p>

          <p>CEOs of major energy companies, Baker Hughes and Woodside Energy, are closely monitoring the escalating tensions between Iran and Israel but are refraining from making firm oil price predictions.

While geopolitical events historically influence oil prices, the energy executives remain cautious about forecasting future price movements.

          <p>Demonstrators in Barcelona and Mallorca used water pistols on tourists to protest the negative impacts of mass tourism, including rising housing costs and the loss of local character. Protesters argue that the influx of tourists is pushing residents out and replacing traditional businesses with tourist-oriented establishments. Activists in other European cities like Venice and Lisbon joined the coordinated effort, calling for a reevaluation of the economic model driving overtourism. While some tourists laughed off the water squirtings, the protests highlight growing discontent with the industry's impact on local communities.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has added China's Huawei and SMIC to its trade blacklist, further aligning its policies with the United States amid rising tensions with Beijing. The International Trade Administration of Taiwan included Huawei and SMIC on its "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," requiring licenses for domestic firms to ship products to these entities. This move reinforces existing export restrictions and aims to tighten loopholes, as both companies are already on a US trade blacklist. The new domestic export controls could also increase penalties for potential breaches in the future.</p>

          <p>A BBC Panorama investigation reveals thousands of injuries at funfairs and amusement parks in England, Scotland, and Wales over the past decade, raising concerns about industry safety. The investigation highlights issues with the regulation of ride inspections, citing accidents, criminal convictions, and safety warnings linked to a specific inspector. Jade Harrison, injured on a ride in 2019, shares her experience and the subsequent findings of inadequate safety measures. The industry's trade council has suspended the inspector in question, but an insider describes the current safety scheme as "not fit for purpose," advocating for a major overhaul of safety protocols.</p>

This initiative follows the release of a report by Baroness Louise Casey on group-based child sexual abuse, and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced a full national statutory inquiry into grooming gangs.

          <p>Israel's actions in Gaza and its recent attacks on Iran are viewed as a dangerous attempt to restore its reputation after the global backlash from the events following October 7, 2023. The assault on Gaza exposed Israel's views and intentions, prompting intervention from Iran and its proxies. This has stretched justifications for Israel's actions beyond plausibility, breaking trust with allies and undermining regional stability. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is accused of using the war to bolster his political career, making Israelis less safe and further capitalizing on insecurity.</p>

          <p>Analysts warn that Donald Trump's proposed “revenge tax” could deter foreign investment into the United States. Section 899 of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would allow the US to impose higher taxes on foreign entities connected to jurisdictions with “unfair foreign taxes” on US individuals and companies. This measure, targeting digital service taxes and diverted profits taxes, could alienate foreign investors and undermine the dollar's safe-haven status. UK companies, particularly those listed on the FTSE 100 with significant US revenue exposure, could be particularly vulnerable, potentially leading some to consider redomiciling in New York.

          <p>President Donald Trump directed ICE to expand deportation efforts in America's largest cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. This order follows a week of anti-ICE protests in major cities, some of which turned violent. Trump claims these cities are using undocumented immigrants to expand their voter base and grow the welfare state. Critics argue that the administration is separating families and targeting non-criminal workers, while the administration asserts it is prioritizing the deportation of criminal illegal aliens. The move has sparked debate about the role of immigrant labor in the economy.</p>

Complaints have risen by almost 400% in the past five years, with common issues including repairs, costs, managing relations, and moving or selling properties.

          <p>Shares of Santos, an Australian oil and gas producer, surged after it received a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion from an Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company-led group. The takeover bid, led by ADNOC's investment arm XRG, follows two previous proposals from the same consortium. The consortium, which includes Abu Dhabi Development Holding Co and Carlyle Group, has offered a cash price of $5.76 per Santos share, a premium from its previous closing price. Santos' board intends to unanimously recommend shareholders vote in favor of the transaction, provided no superior proposal emerges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan is shifting from a reactive to a preemptive cyber defense posture, urging private firms to take proactive steps to protect key systems and sensitive data. New legislation allows the government to track online communications and shut down harmful servers, obliging companies to report cyberattacks. The government plans to introduce a full-fledged preemptive defense system by 2027, aiming for online safety on par with the United States. The country has come under cyber threats mainly from China, North Korea, and Russia, along with criminal groups, with authorities working to increase the number of trained cybersecurity workers.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, faces increasingly limited options as the conflict with Israel escalates. The recent Israeli air offensive has prompted defiance from Tehran, but neither appears likely to halt the attacks. Khamenei's coalition of Islamist militias has been shattered, and Iran's air defenses are seemingly ineffective. Khamenei, a pragmatic and ruthless revolutionary, has always sought to avoid such situations. His strategy of relying on proxies to project power across the region and deter Israel has collapsed under the weight of Israeli attacks.</p>

It'll likely be an incremental start for Ohtani as he looks to add more pitches and innings in the weeks ahead.</p>

          <p>Iran and Israel continued exchanging missile attacks, with neither country backing down as their conflict raged for a third day. Israel said Iran struck its oil refineries, killed the intelligence chief of its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and hit population centers. Israel launched a major campaign, and the death toll has risen to 224 people. The exchange of fire comes as talks on Iran's nuclear program in Oman between the U.S. and Iran were called off.</p>

          <p>China’s economic data sent mixed signals in May, with US tariffs continuing to weigh on the country’s manufacturing and exports, but domestic consumption picked up slightly in the run-up to a major online shopping festival. Retail sales rose by 6.4% in May, compared with the 5.1% growth observed in April. As of May 31, China’s trade-in program had generated about 1.1 trillion yuan in sales this year, according to the Ministry of Commerce. However, some regions have halted their programs in recent weeks due to depleted funds. (not investment advice)</p>
