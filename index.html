          <p>A gunfight at a large outdoor gathering in Danville, Virginia, resulted in one fatality and injuries to four others. The incident occurred on private property early Sunday morning, prompting a police response following reports of multiple shots fired. Officers discovered 22-year-old Jay'Shaun Tiejae White dead at the scene, while another man believed to be the driver was hospitalized with a gunshot wound. Three additional gunshot victims, two men and a woman, arrived at the hospital separately and are receiving treatment as the Danville Police Department continues its investigation, seeking information from the public regarding the circumstances surrounding the shooting. The initial investigation suggests that gunshots were exchanged between the Chrysler and other individuals at the gathering. Optimism is low given the tragic outcome of the event.</p>

          <p>Ukraine launched a large-scale drone attack on airfields in five Russian regions, resulting in fires affecting several aircraft, according to Russia's Defense Ministry. Ukrainian security sources claimed the operation, supervised by President Zelenskyy, took over a year and a half to execute and destroyed 40 military bombers, while the White House claimed to be unaware of the attack beforehand. Simultaneously, explosions caused bridges to collapse and trains to derail in western Russia, with one incident resulting in multiple fatalities and injuries. As ceasefire talks are set to resume in Turkey, Zelenskyy emphasized the need for a complete ceasefire and the return of prisoners and abducted children. The events highlight the escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Advisers to President Trump assert that tariffs will remain in place despite ongoing legal challenges, even if the administration has to find alternative ways to implement them. A federal appeals court has temporarily paused a ruling that deemed Trump's tariffs an overreach of authority, but a potentially difficult legal battle lies ahead. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick insists that "tariffs are not going away," while National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expresses confidence that the Supreme Court will uphold the tariffs. The administration argues that overturning the tariffs would undermine negotiating leverage with other nations, while critics worry about the economic consequences of the tariffs.

          <p>Senior officials at the Department of Veterans Affairs have reportedly ordered VA physicians and scientists to seek clearance from political appointees before publishing in medical journals or speaking publicly. This directive followed the publication of an article in the New England Journal of Medicine by two VA pulmonologists warning about the potential health risks to veterans due to cancelled contracts and staff reductions. The VA's assistant secretary for public affairs emphasized the need to follow VA policy, while the authors of the article maintain that their publication complied with existing regulations. Critics argue that this move fits a pattern of censorship by the Trump administration, which they say is waging a "war on science."</p>

          <p>Joe Root's unbeaten 166 led England to a three-wicket victory over West Indies in Cardiff, securing the three-match series with a game to spare. Root surpassed Eoin Morgan to become England's leading run-scorer in one-day internationals, guiding his team to a target of 309 with seven balls remaining. Despite early wickets falling, Root's partnerships with Harry Brook and Will Jacks propelled England towards victory, while Alzarri Joseph's fierce spell kept West Indies in contention. Earlier, Keacy Carty's century and half-centuries from Brandon King and Shai Hope set up West Indies' total, but England's sloppy fielding gave them opportunities.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has withdrawn the nomination of Jared Isaacman, President Trump's pick to lead NASA, just days before a Senate confirmation vote. Trump stated he would announce a new nominee who is "Mission aligned, and put America First in Space." Isaacman, a veteran private astronaut with ties to Elon Musk's SpaceX, had donated to Democrats throughout his career. Musk responded to the news, praising Isaacman as "someone so competent and good-hearted." The decision leaves NASA without a confirmed administrator, prompting a search for a new leader aligned with the president's vision for space exploration.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that the U.S.-China trade dispute would be resolved when President Trump and President Xi Jinping speak, despite recent tensions. Trump accused China of violating their trade agreement, but Bessent suggested the issue might be a "glitch" in the Chinese system. He acknowledged that critical minerals are being withheld, but emphasized the U.S. is seeking to de-risk without decoupling from China. The comments come amid broader concerns about China's military threat to Taiwan and potential visa revocations for Chinese students. The situation is tense, but there is hope for resolution.</p>

The operation relied on small, hand-held first-person view drones trained using artificial intelligence to target the weakest points of the bombers, showcasing Ukraine's ingenuity and determination.
