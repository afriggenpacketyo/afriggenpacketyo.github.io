          <h2>House Approves Spending Cuts After Delays Caused by Debate Over Epstein Files</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 00:28:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives has passed a $9 billion package to rescind funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting, sending the measure to President Trump's desk just before a deadline. The vote was delayed for hours due to a contentious debate surrounding the release of files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, with Democrats demanding a vote on the matter. Republicans ultimately advanced the spending cuts through a procedural vote, while also offering a non-binding resolution supporting the release of the Epstein documents to appease internal party divisions on the issue.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Congress has approved a $9 billion spending cut package, which includes the total elimination of $1.1 billion in federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. This move directly impacts NPR and PBS, with network leaders warning of an "irreversible loss" and potential shutdowns for many local stations, especially those serving rural and underserved communities. The cuts, championed by the Trump administration, also target about $7 billion in foreign aid and have passed despite bipartisan concerns over the rescission process and the impact on vital services like emergency alerts.</p>

          <h2>Brazilian President Lula Denounces Trump's Tariff Threats as 'Unacceptable Blackmail'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has strongly condemned President Trump's threat to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian goods, labeling it "unacceptable blackmail." Trump has linked the proposed tariffs to the ongoing legal case against former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, demanding charges be dropped. Lula asserted that any attempt to interfere in Brazil's independent judiciary is a grave attack on its national sovereignty. The dispute highlights escalating tensions between the two nations ahead of Brazil's next presidential election, where Lula may run for re-election.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on turning 35 and letting go of the childhood expectation that adulthood brings all the answers. Instead, the biggest lesson has been that most people are simply "winging it" through a continuous process of becoming. Using the French comedy series "Bref" as a bookend to his own journey as an immigrant in France, the author explores themes of regret, identity, and the importance of chosen family. He concludes that while life at 35 is more incredible and the world more troubling than imagined, the goal is to build a meaningful life without clear answers.</p>

          <p>An Israeli military strike has hit the Holy Family Catholic Church in Gaza, resulting in the deaths of at least three people and injuring ten others, including the parish priest. The church was sheltering hundreds of displaced civilians, including both Christians and Muslims. The Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem condemned the targeting of innocent civilians, while the Israeli government expressed deep regret, stating that "stray ammunition" accidentally hit the church and that an investigation is underway. The incident has drawn international condemnation, including from Pope Leo XIV, who renewed his call for an immediate ceasefire.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 21:15:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's ongoing criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stems primarily from the central bank's decision to maintain relatively high interest rates to combat inflation. The president, who has reportedly discussed firing his handpicked chair, argues that rates should be cut to boost economic growth. The Federal Reserve operates independently to manage the economy through monetary policy, balancing its dual mandate of maximizing employment and stabilizing prices. Any attempt by a president to fire a Fed chair for policy disagreements would be legally untested and could destabilize financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted raids at a Home Depot and other locations in Sacramento, arresting 11 undocumented immigrants in a move intended to challenge California's sanctuary laws. A Border Patrol chief recorded a video in front of the state capitol, stating, "There is no such thing as a sanctuary state." Governor Gavin Newsom's office condemned the raids as illegal racial profiling and an abuse of power. The enforcement action follows a recent federal court order blocking agents from using racial profiling for warrantless arrests in parts of California.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has reversed a previous ban, announcing that Juul can resume selling its tobacco- and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes. The agency stated that Juul's studies sufficiently demonstrate that its products are less harmful for adult smokers who switch completely from traditional cigarettes. The decision, which was met with strong opposition from anti-tobacco groups, comes after years of legal and regulatory battles where Juul was blamed for sparking the teen vaping crisis. Juul will now be one of only two companies authorized to sell menthol-flavored vapes in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna has stated his department has "no choice" but to comply with federal judicial warrants from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for inmates in county jails. Luna clarified that these transfers are legally mandated for criminal warrants and are distinct from civil detainer requests, which the department does not honor under sanctuary policies. He emphasized that the department does not assist ICE with street-level enforcement operations, seeking to reassure communities fearful of the recent federal immigration crackdown across the county.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to switch from high-fructose corn syrup to cane sugar in its signature soda, a move he claimed would result in a better taste. The announcement, which the company has not fully confirmed, is seen as a political win aimed at his base and health-conscious figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. However, this article notes that from a health perspective, the change is largely symbolic, as nutritional science shows nearly identical metabolic effects between cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup, both of which contribute to health issues when consumed in excess.</p>

          <p>A university in Dalian, China, has expelled a female student for allegedly "damaging national dignity" through "improper interactions with foreigners," sparking a significant public debate. The decision, which many connect to online videos of the student with a Ukrainian gamer, has drawn widespread criticism on Chinese social media. Commenters have questioned the university's right to police a student's private life and have raised concerns about misogyny and rising nationalism. The state-run newspaper The Paper also criticized the university for potentially violating the student's privacy rights.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon alter its long-standing restrictions on liquids in carry-on luggage. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning the current 3.4-ounce limit and that a change could be the "next big announcement." This follows her recent decision to eliminate the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during standard security screening. The potential change is linked to the deployment of new, more advanced CT scanners at airport checkpoints that can better detect security threats.</p>
