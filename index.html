          <p>The CEO of Oak View Group, Tim Leiweke, has been indicted on a federal criminal charge for allegedly conspiring to rig the bidding process for a major University of Texas arena project. The indictment accuses Leiweke of colluding with a competitor to have them drop their bid in exchange for valuable sub-contracts. While Leiweke's spokesperson has stated he is innocent and will vigorously defend his reputation, his company and another firm are expected to pay millions in penalties under non-prosecution agreements with the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve's June meeting show that while most officials believe interest rate cuts will be necessary this year, there is significant disagreement on the timing and extent of the reductions. Policymakers are divided between concerns that new tariffs could fuel inflation and signs of a weakening labor market and slowing economic growth. The summary indicates a cautious, wait-and-see approach, with opinions ranging from cutting rates as soon as this month to holding off entirely for the rest of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to Gaza's civil defense agency, two overnight Israeli airstrikes in the Gaza Strip have killed 20 people, a toll that includes six children. The first strike reportedly hit a tent in Khan Younis, while a second targeted a camp in the northern part of the territory. This report comes amid a broader context of ongoing regional conflicts, including attacks in the Red Sea and discussions about a potential Gaza ceasefire. The Israeli military has stated that it is currently looking into the report of the deadly airstrikes.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump allocates a historic $75 billion in extra funding to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to expand its immigration crackdown. The legislation provides $45 billion to nearly double the capacity of the detention system and $30 billion to hire thousands of additional deportation officers and support staff. This massive infusion of funds is intended to facilitate the administration's planned large-scale deportation campaign, drawing sharp criticism from opponents who warn of severe humanitarian consequences.</p>

          <p>Five days after catastrophic flash floods struck Central Texas, at least 150 people are still unaccounted for in Kerr County alone, with fading hopes of finding more survivors. The disaster has already claimed at least 119 lives statewide, with the majority of fatalities occurring in the Kerrville area. Governor Greg Abbott has vowed that extensive search and rescue operations, involving helicopters and drones, will persist until every missing person is found, though he acknowledged the list of the missing could grow.</p>

          <p>The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has formally found Russia guilty of committing widespread human rights abuses during its invasion of Ukraine. The landmark ruling condemns actions such as the abduction of Ukrainian children, the use of sexual assault as a weapon of war, and Russia's role in the 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17. While the Kremlin dismissed the verdict as "null and void" and its enforcement is unlikely, Ukraine has celebrated the decision as a symbolic and historic victory on the international stage.</p>

Scientists believe the activity is likely caused by the movement of water within the Earth's crust above the magma chamber, not by rising magma, and does not indicate an impending eruption.</p>

          <p>As part of the investigation into a deadly fireworks warehouse explosion in Yolo County, California, authorities have searched a San Francisco home linked to the CEO of the company involved. The July 1 blast at a warehouse operated by Devastating Pyrotechnics killed seven people, many of whom were part-time workers. The State Fire Marshal's Office and local law enforcement are conducting the probe, while an attorney for the CEO, Kenneth Chee, maintains his client's innocence.</p>

          <p>This article explores the psychological impact of the Los Angeles wildfires, noting that many victims are experiencing a form of delayed grief months after the disaster. As the initial crisis of survival subsides, the full emotional weight of the loss is now setting in for many. A therapist explains this is a common phenomenon, as the psyche postpones the grieving process out of necessity, and offers coping strategies such as connecting with others who share the experience and making time to process the difficult feelings.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes whether a $10,000 deposit would earn more in a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) or a money market account in the current financial climate. While today's money market rates are slightly higher, they are variable and likely to fall with anticipated interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. In contrast, a long-term CD allows a saver to lock in a fixed interest rate for the entire term, providing a guaranteed return that could ultimately be more advantageous. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's emergency "shadow docket" saw a surge of activity in the last term, largely due to urgent appeals from the Trump administration. Despite a recent landmark ruling intended to curb the use of nationwide injunctions by lower courts, legal experts believe the high court will likely continue to face a steady stream of emergency requests. A concurring opinion by Justice Brett Kavanaugh even appeared to encourage more direct appeals to the Supreme Court for interim relief in major federal cases, signaling the trend may persist.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has continued his aggressive global trade reset by sending letters to the leaders of at least seven more countries, including the Philippines, Algeria, and Iraq, dictating new tariffs on their imports. This action follows a similar move two days prior that targeted 14 other nations, with the new import duties ranging from 20% to 40% and set to take effect on August 1. The administration claims the tariffs are necessary to eliminate trade deficits, a justification that many economists dispute.</p>

          <p>This article provides an in-depth analysis of the factors that culminated in Christian Horner's removal as Red Bull's Formula 1 team principal after two decades. His departure is attributed not just to recent controversies but to a long-brewing power struggle within the company, the loss of key technical staff like Adrian Newey, and a series of questionable management decisions. The team's recent decline in on-track performance and lingering concerns over the future of star driver Max Verstappen likely finalized the decision.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old boy has been arrested in connection with the Rancho fire in Laguna Beach, California, on suspicion of starting the blaze with fireworks. The wildfire prompted the evacuation of approximately 100 homes in a canyon area before crews were able to contain it at four acres, with no structures damaged. According to city officials, police obtained video evidence that clearly showed the juvenile suspect lighting a firework and then fleeing the scene, which led to his arrest on potential felony charges.</p>

          <p>President Trump's threatened 50% tariff on copper has created a major distortion in the U.S. market, leading to a glut of the metal and a record price premium compared to global benchmarks.

Analysts predict that this price bubble will eventually deflate as the surplus is absorbed, especially given that underlying U.S. manufacturing demand for copper remains weak.
