          <p>During a meeting with the Canadian Prime Minister, President Trump digressed to criticize the construction of former President Obama's Presidential Center in Chicago, calling it a 'disaster' and blaming 'woke' construction practices and DEI initiatives for significant cost overruns and delays. Trump claimed that Obama wanted to be politically correct instead of hiring tough construction workers. The Obama Foundation refuted Trump's claims, stating that the project is on track and will be an economic engine for Chicago. The foundation also emphasized the use of union labor and expects the center to open in 2026.</p>

          <p>Israel's security Cabinet has reportedly approved a plan named 'Gideon's Chariots' to broaden its military offensive in Gaza, potentially including the forcible displacement of the civilian population and the occupation of the territory. The plan involves the IDF seizing control of Gaza, displacing civilians to the south, dismantling Hamas, and establishing a new aid mechanism. Prime Minister Netanyahu stated that the offensive aims to defeat Hamas, and the population will be moved for its own protection, however, the forced displacement of civilians during armed conflict is a war crime under international law. The United Nations estimates that 70% of the territory is either part of a 'red zone' or under 'evacuation orders'.</p>

          <p>NBC Sports will utilize an AI-generated voice of the late Jim Fagan, the iconic narrator of NBC programming in the 1990s, for its coverage of NBA games beginning with the 2025-26 season. Fagan's family granted permission to use AI voice synthesis technology to recreate his voice for title sequences, show opens, and promotional elements. NBC Sports President Rick Cordella expressed excitement about honoring Fagan's legacy and introducing his voice to a new generation of fans.

          <p>The U.S. Senate confirmed Frank Bisignano, a tech CEO and Trump donor, as the commissioner of the Social Security Administration, despite concerns from former commissioners and advocates about proposed restructuring and mass layoffs at the agency. Democrats raised concerns about Bisignano's alleged communication with Elon Musk's team, known as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is believed to be involved in restructuring the agency. Advocates fear that changes like office closures and job cuts will lead to longer wait times for services. Bisignano stated that he believes the issues stem from the interim commissioner, not the DOGE team itself.</p>

This move comes after accusations that the senate delayed disciplinary action against pro-Palestinian demonstrators, with some trustees alleging antisemitism within the senate. The review aims to reclaim authority and address criticism from the Trump administration, which has cut $400 million in federal funds.

          <p>During a meeting with US President Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly stated that Canada 'won't be for sale, ever' and that Canadians have no desire to join the United States. The leaders also discussed trade, with Trump suggesting potential renegotiation of the USMCA trade deal. Carney's Liberal Party recently won Canada's election on a platform of resisting Trump's tariff policies and forging a new economic and security relationship with the United States. Canada remains a key trading partner for the U.S.</p>

          <p>Barbara Corcoran is selling her New York City penthouse, which she first visited in 1992 and purchased 23 years later. Corcoran says she immediately knew she had to have it.

Corcoran says she's always had a knack for choosing properties to buy based on how they make her feel, even if it means purchasing sight unseen.</p>

The Houthis, who have been targeting shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, have launched numerous attacks on commercial vessels. The US had intensified air strikes against the Houthis in recent months.</p>
