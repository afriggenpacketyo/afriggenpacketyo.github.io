          <p>Shares in Japanese retail giant Seven & i Holdings fell over 7% after Canadian firm Alimentation Couche-Tard withdrew its $47 billion takeover offer. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i's leadership for its decision to abandon the deal. The Japanese company, which operates 7-Eleven, expressed disappointment and disputed the Canadian retailer's statements. Analysts suggest that Japan's protectionist business environment and the company's national importance made the acquisition highly unlikely from the start. (not investment advice)</p>

He emphasized the ongoing threat that explosive remnants of war pose to civilians, particularly children. His visit follows his mother's iconic 1997 walk through an Angolan minefield, which brought global attention to the issue. The Halo Trust has cleared 120,000 landmines in the country, but an estimated thousand minefields remain from the nation's long civil war, continuing to cause death and injury.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. According to sources, she was dismissed under Article 2 of the Constitution, which outlines presidential powers. Comey was a prominent prosecutor who helped lead the cases against Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein, and more recently, the prosecution of Sean "Diddy" Combs. Her father, James Comey, was terminated as FBI director by President Trump in 2017 during the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports fell by 0.5% in June year-over-year, marking the second straight month of decline and missing economists' expectations for a rise. The drop is largely attributed to weakening shipments to major partners, with exports to the U.S. falling 11.4% and to China by 4.7%. The situation is exacerbated by an impending 25% U.S. tariff on Japanese imports, with no trade deal in sight. Concerns are growing that these trade headwinds could push Japan's export-reliant economy into a technical recession as it faces another potential quarterly contraction. (not investment advice)</p>

This contrasts with the administration's public focus on deporting the "worst of the worst" offenders.

          <p>Financial analysts are warning of significant market instability if President Trump attempts to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. A research note from Wolfe Research predicts such a move would be "significantly negative for markets," potentially causing an equity selloff and a spike in long-term yields. The legality of the president firing a Fed chair for policy disagreements is unclear and would likely lead to a court battle, possibly reaching the Supreme Court. The analysis highlights the critical role of an independent central bank in maintaining economic stability, contrasting it with countries where central banks are politicized.

          <h2>Federal E-Verify System's Vulnerability Exposed by Workplace Immigration Raids</h2>

          <p>Recent federal immigration raids on businesses are highlighting significant vulnerabilities in the E-Verify system, which is designed to confirm employment eligibility. An Omaha business owner, whose facility was raided, stated he used E-Verify for all employees but was still penalized, with investigators finding that many workers had used stolen identities. Experts say the system is easy to fool because it vets paperwork, not people, making it ineffective at stopping identity theft. Critics call it a "wink-and-nod" system that allows politicians to appear tough on immigration without imposing major costs on the economy.</p>

          <p>The Senate has passed bipartisan legislation aimed at preventing thousands of veterans from losing their homes to foreclosure. The bill addresses a gap created when the Department of Veterans Affairs ended a previous homeowner assistance program, leaving many veterans with unaffordable options. The new law will allow veterans who have fallen behind on mortgage payments to move the missed payments to the end of their loan term, making their loan current. This solution was praised by veterans' groups and the mortgage industry as a crucial fix for a problem that had left veterans with fewer protections than other homeowners.</p>

The notes, which pleaded for help and provided contact information, guided the search-and-rescue team to their location. The mother also took other crucial steps, such as having her son blow a whistle in a distress pattern, which contributed to their safe recovery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of 20 states has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, seeking to block the termination of a key FEMA program for natural disaster mitigation. The lawsuit argues that the administration acted unlawfully by shutting down the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, a decision they claim rests with Congress. The BRIC program funded local projects like stormwater control systems and elevating buildings in flood-prone areas. The states contend that its termination jeopardizes projects already in development and leaves communities at higher risk from natural disasters.</p>

          <p>An $8 billion class-action lawsuit filed by investors against Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders has begun in Delaware. The lawsuit alleges that the company failed to disclose the risks associated with the 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal, where user data was misused for political consulting. Shareholders claim that Facebook officials violated a 2012 FTC consent order by continuing to share personal data without user consent. The plaintiffs are seeking to have Zuckerberg and others reimburse Meta for the resulting $5.1 billion FTC fine and other legal costs, which they estimate total over $8 billion.</p>

          <p>Advocates for older adults are expressing concern that a new domestic spending bill passed under the Trump administration could jeopardize vital social programs. Federal funding for services that combat social isolation among seniors, such as companionship programs, meal deliveries, and health monitoring, could be at risk of significant cuts. Social isolation is linked to increased risks of dementia, heart disease, and premature death. Program directors worry that losing federal support could force them to shut down, potentially leading to increased institutionalization and a decline in well-being for vulnerable seniors.</p>

His position directly contradicts that of President Trump, who recently dismissed the scrutiny as a politically motivated "hoax." Pence pushed back on this claim, noting the investigation spanned multiple administrations and that the American people deserve to see the facts of the case.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's justification for clawing back $7.9 billion in foreign aid, citing "waste, fraud and abuse," is facing scrutiny due to a lack of supporting evidence. Former and current officials, including the fired USAID inspector general, state that the administration has not provided proof for its claims and that the cuts appear politically motivated. Reviews of USAID programs reportedly targeted keywords like "gender" or "climate" for termination rather than assessing program effectiveness. Critics argue that dismantling the agency and its oversight makes it harder to monitor funds and that the process lacks transparency.</p>

          <p>Early assessments of the investigation into last month's fatal Air India crash suggest the plane's captain may have moved switches that cut fuel to the engines, according to the Wall Street Journal. A cockpit voice recording captured the first officer questioning the captain about moving the fuel switches to the "cutoff" position moments after takeoff from Ahmedabad. A preliminary report confirmed the switches were moved but did not state how, leading to a loss of thrust that the plane could not recover from at low altitude. The crash killed 241 of the 242 people on board and 19 people on the ground.</p>

          <p>The average cost for parents in Britain to place one child in a holiday club for the six-week summer break has now reached £1,076, according to new figures from the charity Coram. Prices have risen due to high demand and a shortage of more affordable council-run programs, with some regions seeing price hikes of up to 13% compared to last year. Many working families depend on this form of childcare, but the upfront cost can be a significant financial strain, especially for those who receive benefits in arrears. The lack of available places, particularly for older children and those with special needs, further complicates the issue.</p>
