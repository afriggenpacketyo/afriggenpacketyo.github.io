            <p>An American pastor, Josh Sullivan, kidnapped in South Africa during a church service, was rescued after a "high-intensity shootout" between police and his captors, resulting in three suspects dead. The Hawks, South Africa's elite police unit, acted on verified intelligence to locate Sullivan, who was found unharmed in a vehicle. Sullivan, a missionary who moved to South Africa in 2018 to establish a church, was kidnapped last week, and a ransom demand prompted police intervention. His family and friends had been pleading for his safe return since the abduction.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is transferring control of a federal zone along the U.S.-Mexico border to the Department of Defense, effectively turning it into a military base, which could allow troops to detain migrants. This move aims to circumvent federal law prohibiting the use of military personnel for law enforcement on U.S. soil. While officials claim the military will only provide security for the area, legal experts suggest the action is likely to face legal challenges, particularly concerning the Posse Comitatus Act and the military purpose doctrine.</p>

            <p>Harvard University has refused to comply with President Trump's demands, which included directives on governance, hiring, and teaching, leading to the freezing of $2.2 billion in federal funds. Despite facing financial repercussions, Harvard's president, Alan Garber, asserted that no government should dictate the curriculum of private universities. Trump's actions are part of a broader effort targeting universities over antisemitism, particularly concerning pro-Palestinian campus protests. While Harvard has made some concessions, it drew a line at the White House's list of demands, sparking a potential war of attrition between the federal government and higher education.</p>

The ban aims to address littering and rising youth vaping rates. While vaping is considered a means to quit smoking, health professionals express concerns about its detrimental effects on young people who have never smoked.</p>

For Women Scotland argues that the redefinition of "woman" exceeds parliament's powers and could impact sex-based rights and single-sex services.

            <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Colorado Rockies 6-2 on Jackie Robinson Day, demonstrating improved patience at the plate and solid defense. The Dodgers' ability to lay off pitches out of the strike zone led to an early exit for the Rockies' starter, while outstanding defensive plays helped strand runners. Will Smith's three-run homer and Tommy Edman's four hits contributed to the victory. Manager Dave Roberts emphasized the emotional significance of Jackie Robinson Day, highlighting the importance of living in a way that honors Robinson's legacy.</p>

            <p>Faced with perceived hostility from US President Donald Trump, the European Union is reportedly considering strengthening ties with China. The EU is planning a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing and restarting negotiations over tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has adopted a softer tone in speeches and communications with Chinese leaders. Some officials suggest the EU is open to new opportunities with China, while others emphasize the importance of strengthening Europe's own capabilities.</p>

            <p>President Trump's defiance of a court order to facilitate the return of a wrongly deported Maryland resident has sparked concerns about a potential constitutional crisis. Experts are divided on whether the U.S. is already in a crisis, citing Trump's disregard for court rulings and the separation of powers. The case involves a Salvadoran citizen, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported despite a court order protecting him from deportation. Trump's administration has taken a narrow view of its obligations, leading to accusations of authoritarian behavior and a threat to the U.S. system of governance.</p>

            <p>The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has issued a cease and desist order against Google for violating anti-monopoly laws through unfair trade practices related to search services on Android devices. Google was found to have required Android device manufacturers to prioritize its own search apps and services through licensing agreements. The JFTC stated that Google required manufacturers to preinstall and prominently feature Google Search and Chrome on devices and to exclude rival search services as a condition of its advertising revenue-sharing model. This action aligns with similar crackdowns on firms in the UK and the U.S.</p>

            <p>The White House has introduced a new media policy that significantly limits access to President Trump by news agencies, including wire services, following a court ruling that the administration improperly punished The Associated Press. The new policy reduces the number of slots available to wire services in pool coverage and gives the press secretary discretion over who can question the president. Media organizations have expressed disappointment and concern over the restrictions, arguing that they undermine the freedom of the press and government transparency. The White House has argued that press access is a privilege, not a right.</p>
