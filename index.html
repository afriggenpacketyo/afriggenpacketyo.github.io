          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a conservative backed by Donald Trump, narrowly won Poland's presidential election against liberal Warsaw Mayor RafaÅ‚ Trzaskowski, reflecting deep divisions within the country. The outcome suggests Poland will likely pursue a more populist and nationalist direction under Nawrocki's leadership. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed confidence in continued EU-Poland cooperation following the election. While most day-to-day power resides with the prime minister, the president influences foreign policy and can veto legislation, potentially hindering Prime Minister Donald Tusk's ability to fulfill electoral promises, made to both voters and the EU, such as loosening abortion laws and reforming the court system.</p>

          <p>Eight individuals were hospitalized after an attack in Boulder, Colorado, where a suspect used a "makeshift flamethrower" and other incendiary devices against a group honoring Israeli hostages in Gaza. The suspect, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, reportedly shouted "free Palestine" during the incident, which authorities are investigating as a potential act of terrorism. The victims, ranging in age from 52 to 88, sustained burns and other injuries, with one in critical condition. The FBI is conducting further investigations, and the incident has drawn condemnation from officials, including Colorado Governor Jared Polis, who called it a "heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community."</p>

          <p>Former yokozuna Hakuho is expected to announce his retirement from the Japan Sumo Association at a press conference on June 9. The Mongolian-born 40-year-old, now known as elder Miyagino, will leave the governing body amid uncertainty surrounding his scandal-hit Miyagino stable. The stable has been closed since April 2024 after Miyagino's protege Hokuseiho was found to have physically abused two junior wrestlers. Hakuho, who retired from competition in September 2021, was held responsible for the violent acts committed by Hokuseiho.</p>
