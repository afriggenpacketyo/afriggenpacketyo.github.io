          <p>Two Japanese boxers, Shigetoshi Kotari and Hiromasa Urakawa, both 28, have tragically died from brain injuries sustained in separate fights during the same boxing event in Tokyo. Both men suffered subdural hematomas and underwent emergency brain surgery but ultimately succumbed to their injuries a few days later. In response to the deaths, the Japanese Boxing Commission announced that Oriental and Pacific Boxing Federation title bouts will be reduced from 12 rounds to 10. The commission has also launched an investigation into the incidents to discuss the safety protocols within the sport.</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, some top Wall Street analysts are recommending specific dividend-paying stocks as a source of stable income for investors. Companies such as Chevron (CVX), Rithm Capital (RITM), and AT&T (T) are highlighted for their consistent dividend yields and recent market performance. Analysts point to factors like Chevron's Hess acquisition, Rithm Capital's pivot to an alternative investment model, and AT&T's strong wireless subscriber growth as reasons for their positive outlook. The article presents these recommendations as potential options for investors seeking to bolster their portfolios against market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tech, surveillance, and private prison companies such as Palantir, Geo Group, and CoreCivic are reporting substantial financial gains attributed to the Trump administration's expanded immigration enforcement policies. Palantir's revenue from U.S. government contracts grew 53% in the second quarter, while private prison firms noted their detention facilities are fuller than ever. This financial success comes as a result of a massive increase in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which has allowed for the expansion of detention capacity. Critics argue these profits are derived from policies that harm immigrant communities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nineteen U.S. states are holding sales tax holidays in 2025, providing temporary relief for shoppers on specific items like back-to-school supplies and disaster preparedness goods. These events are politically popular, though some tax experts argue they primarily benefit wealthier consumers who can time their purchases, rather than stimulating broad economic growth. For many middle and lower-income families, however, these holidays offer a crucial opportunity to save on essential, big-ticket items as they face rising costs and potential price hikes from tariffs. Financial advisors suggest combining these tax breaks with other store promotions and rewards programs to maximize savings.</p>

According to CB Insights, there are now nearly 500 AI "unicorns" valued at over $1 billion each, with a significant concentration of this new wealth in the San Francisco Bay Area. This boom is fueling a resurgence in the local economy, though most of the wealth remains in private companies, presenting unique challenges and opportunities for the wealth management industry.

          <p>Despite a constant stream of negative news, there are many underreported stories of global progress that often go unnoticed due to a psychological phenomenon known as negativity bias. This evolutionary trait hardwires humans to focus more on threats and bad news, which can lead to a skewed, pessimistic worldview. The article argues that highlighting positive developments, such as a falling U.S. murder rate and fewer global deaths from extreme weather, is crucial. Embracing a mindset of realistic optimism is not about ignoring problems, but about fostering the resilience and motivation needed to believe that complex issues are solvable.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 474 people at a demonstration in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a group recently banned under UK terrorism laws. The protest was a deliberate act of civil disobedience to challenge the ban, with hundreds displaying signs supporting the group. The arrests mark one of the largest single-day arrest totals for the police force in a decade. While the Home Secretary defended the ban based on security advice, human rights groups like Amnesty International criticized the mass arrests as disproportionate and a threat to freedom of expression.</p>

Researchers at the University of Georgia analyzed fragments from the home and determined their ancient origins. The incident marks the 27th meteorite recovery in Georgia, and scientists believe modern technology and public awareness will lead to more such discoveries, aiding in the study of asteroids.</p>

One resident from Novoaidar described a significant decline in her quality of life, noting that she now barters for food and that local jobs pay poorly. The population has dwindled, essential services like power and internet are unreliable, and access to medical care is severely limited, often requiring a Russian passport.

However, investigators discovered a small metal piece from the door's lock underneath Pennig's body, suggesting the door was forced open before she was shot and fell.

          <p>As Congress begins its August recess, President Trump's recently signed tax and spending bill has become a major point of contention for both Republicans and Democrats. The legislation extends tax cuts, funds mass deportations, and imposes work requirements for Medicaid, which Republicans champion as fulfilling campaign promises. Democrats, however, are highlighting the bill's cuts to social safety nets, its benefits for the wealthy, and its failure to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies, which they believe makes their opponents vulnerable. Both parties are using the recess to frame the bill's impact for voters ahead of the critical 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's new bill to create a tax deduction for tip income has left many service industry workers with questions and a sense of skepticism. The measure provides a temporary deduction of up to $25,000 on federal income tax for qualified tips, but it does not affect state or payroll taxes for Medicare and Social Security. Workers and tax experts point to a lack of clarity on which occupations qualify and how different types of gratuities, like automatic service charges, will be handled.

          <p>NASA's interim head, Sean Duffy, has directed the agency to develop a 100-kilowatt nuclear reactor to be placed on the moon by the end of the decade. This initiative is seen as essential for establishing a permanent, long-term human settlement on the lunar surface, as solar power is insufficient during the 14-day lunar nights. The move is also framed as a matter of national security, aiming to counter a joint Chinese-Russian plan for a more powerful lunar reactor. A nuclear-powered moon base would support regular astronaut missions, scientific research, and potentially serve as a stepping stone for grander space exploration ambitions.</p>

Key recommendations include choosing pasture-raised meat over products from factory farms, where animals endure extreme confinement and harsh conditions. Additionally, opting for meat from larger animals like cows over chickens can reduce the total number of lives affected, and selecting wild-caught fish is preferable to those from crowded fish farms, offering a pragmatic path to reducing harm.</p>

          <p>More than 200 days into his second term, President Donald Trump's actions have intensified concerns among critics about a shift toward authoritarianism in the United States. Recent moves include demanding the prosecution of his predecessor, firing a top labor statistician after a weak jobs report, and funding a massive expansion of ICE, creating the nation's largest domestic police force. While once dismissed as hyperbole, terms like "dictatorship" are now being used by mainstream commentators who argue that the foundational pillars of U.S. democracy are being systematically dismantled.

          <p>San Francisco is experiencing a new "gold rush" driven by the artificial intelligence boom, which has infused the city with economic optimism but also anxiety about its future. The city has become a hub for major AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, leading to a surge in venture capital funding and leasing of office space, helping it recover from the post-pandemic downturn. However, this frenzy coexists with concerns about the high cost of living, potential job displacement due to automation, and ongoing tech layoffs. The rapid changes are transforming the city's social and economic landscape, creating both opportunities and significant challenges for its residents. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 1988 film "Miracle Mile," which depicts Los Angeles in chaos as residents flee an impending nuclear attack, has found a renewed audience and cult status in recent years. Written and directed by Steve De Jarnatt, the movie's appeal is largely attributed to its affectionate portrayal of iconic locations along Wilshire Boulevard's Miracle Mile. The story begins as a romance between a musician and a waitress before a misdirected phone call plunges the city into panic. Despite its grim premise, the film ends on a bittersweet note, suggesting that finding love, even at the world's end, offers a meaningful conclusion.</p>

          <p>A collection of short fiction by authors Steph Cha, Ivy Pochoda, and Jonathan Lethem offers speculative glimpses into the future of Los Angeles. Steph Cha's "Ham and Cheese" portrays a near-future deli worker navigating a world of wealth disparity and lost luxuries like real tuna. Ivy Pochoda's "Allnight Supermarket" imagines a post-exodus L.A. where the remaining Skid Row community finally establishes its own neighborhood council and builds a market. In Jonathan Lethem's "2047: Meet David Allen, the Minister of Commemoration," characters travel through a flooded landscape to hear memories of a forgotten, drier world from a revered elder.</p>

          <p>Amid the confusion and limitations of recycling, the concept of reusable food and beverage containers is gaining traction as a solution to the waste crisis. An estimated 50 billion single-use coffee cups are discarded annually in the U.S. alone. A recent pilot program in Petaluma, California, tested a city-wide system where customers could use and return reusable cups from various stores at no extra charge. The program, sponsored by major corporations, reported a successful return rate, suggesting that community-wide, incentive-free reuse systems can be more effective for the environment than single-use alternatives, even accounting for washing and transport.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As cities worldwide face increased flooding due to climate change, some are adopting the "sponge city" model, which uses nature-based solutions to absorb and manage stormwater. This approach, exemplified by a new park in Bangkok, contrasts with traditional "gray" infrastructure that quickly funnels water away. By creating more permeable surfaces, wetlands, and green spaces, cities can capture rainwater, reduce runoff, replenish groundwater, and create recreational areas. Los Angeles is also exploring this model through its Safe Clean Water Program, which funds projects to make the urban landscape more absorbent, though progress faces bureaucratic and financial hurdles.</p>

          <p>Facing threats to its traditional water sources from climate change, Southern California is planning a range of projects to ensure future water reliability and avoid a "Day Zero" crisis. With supplies from the Colorado River and Northern California projected to shrink, water agencies are focusing on diversifying their portfolios. Key strategies include building a massive wastewater recycling facility, capturing more stormwater, and restoring natural watersheds. These initiatives aim to create a more sustainable and resilient local water supply, though they come with significant costs and ongoing debates over investments in new transport infrastructure versus local, nature-based solutions.</p>

          <p>Despite California being a focal point of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement, federal data reveals that Texas and Florida had higher numbers of ICE arrests in the first five months of his second term. Texas led with over 26,000 arrests, followed by Florida, with California third. When adjusted for population, California ranked even lower, at 27th. Experts attribute this to greater cooperation between local law enforcement and ICE in Republican-led states, which cast a wider enforcement net. However, California did experience one of the most dramatic percentage increases in arrests, highlighting the intense, targeted nature of federal operations in the state.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is dismissing dozens of asylum applications, some filed years ago, forcing immigrants to restart the complex process from the beginning. According to letters sent by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the cases are being dismissed because the applicants did not receive a mandatory "credible fear" interview at the border, often due to a shortage of asylum officers. Immigration attorneys fear this move will strip protections from people who have been living and working legally in the U.S. for years. They worry their clients could be detained under new policies if they report to ICE to schedule the now-required interview.</p>
