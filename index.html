          <p>A CNBC investigation highlights the alarming rise of "nudify" apps and websites that use artificial intelligence to create nonconsensual, explicit deepfakes of real people from their social media photos. The article focuses on a group of women in Minnesota who discovered a friend had used such a service, revealing a significant legal loophole as no laws were broken since the images weren't distributed. The report underscores the real emotional trauma experienced by victims and the ease with which these deepfakes can be created, prompting calls for new legislation to address this form of AI-driven abuse.</p>

          <p>Climate activist Greta Thunberg has rejected claims that her participation in a Gaza-bound humanitarian aid flotilla is a mere publicity stunt, stating that no one would risk their life for attention. Speaking from a vessel off the Greek coast, she emphasized the mission's goal is to break what she calls Israel's "illegal and inhumane siege" and deliver essential supplies to a starving population. The flotilla has reportedly faced drone attacks, which Thunberg attributes to Israeli attempts to intimidate the peaceful mission, though Israel has not commented on the specific incidents.</p>

          <p>Self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi outlines three limiting beliefs that often prevent people from increasing their income. The first is the false notion that one should already know how to manage money and earn more, which creates shame and prevents seeking help. The second is the belief that success should come easily if one is talented, ignoring the necessity of patience and systematic effort. Finally, the habit of procrastination, or telling oneself they will start "later," is a major obstacle to taking the necessary first steps toward financial growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has committed to starting the construction of three new towns in England before the next general election, as part of its plan to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029.

The policy is central to Labour's economic growth strategy and emulates the post-war government's new town developments. However, the plan faces challenges, including industry pressures and concerns from local residents who feel uninformed about the scale of the projects.</p>

The hip-hop mogul faces a potential maximum of 20 years in prison, though prosecutors have recommended a sentence of at least four to five years, while his defense is arguing for 14 months. During his trial, the court heard details of encounters Combs orchestrated between his girlfriends and male sex workers. While convicted on these charges, he was acquitted of more serious allegations, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has urged his Labour Party to unite and focus on defeating the right-wing Reform UK party, as he faces historically low approval ratings. Speaking ahead of Labour's annual conference, Starmer acknowledged the steep political challenge, with polls showing only 13% of voters are satisfied with his leadership. His government has been recently rocked by high-profile resignations and controversy over unpopular policies, leading to internal criticism and sinking support. Starmer defended his record and attacked Reform's policies as "racist," framing the conference as a critical moment to reset his premiership.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a massive 12-hour aerial bombardment across Ukraine, utilizing nearly 600 drones and dozens of missiles, killing at least four people and wounding more than 70. The capital, Kyiv, bore the brunt of the attack, where all four fatalities occurred, including a 12-year-old girl. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the "vile" attack, which targeted seven regions and damaged over 100 civilian sites, including a cardiology institute and a large bakery. He vowed that Ukraine would retaliate, stating the assault demonstrates Moscow's desire to continue the conflict.</p>

          <p>Following the Pentagon's decision to take an equity stake in rare earth miner MP Materials, industry leaders are calling for more U.S. government deals to secure the nation's supply chain for critical minerals. The move is seen as a necessary step to counter China's market dominance in materials like rare earths and lithium, which are vital for defense and technology sectors. The Trump administration is reportedly considering a similar equity stake in Lithium Americas for its Nevada mine. This strategic shift towards government price floors and direct investment signals a willingness to adopt China's model of industrial policy to protect national security interests.

Officials predict that travel by car will be the dominant mode of transport, accounting for nearly 80% of all trips.

          <p>The UK government has guaranteed a £1.5 billion loan for Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to help the carmaker and its supply chain recover from a debilitating cyber-attack that has halted production for nearly a month.

          <p>This article argues that jury nullification—the power of a jury to acquit a defendant despite evidence of guilt if they believe the law is unjust—may become a vital tool for ordinary Americans to resist tyranny. The author suggests that as the Trump administration increasingly uses the Justice Department for political persecution, such as the indictment of former FBI director James Comey, jurors have the right to refuse to convict. Citing historical precedents where nullification was used against tyrannical laws, the essay posits that this mechanism can protect the rule of law from being corrupted for political revenge, empowering citizens to reject unjust prosecutions.</p>

This article analyzes the motivations behind this support, linking it to Trump's strategy of using economic tools to prop up ideological allies. Milei's "shock therapy" approach, which includes deep public spending cuts and an assault on union rights to combat hyperinflation, has won praise from the IMF but has had a severe human impact, increasing unemployment and poverty. The U.S. intervention is seen as a move to stabilize a political ally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece contends that the Trump administration has triggered a "legitimacy crisis" by shredding the constitutional order and the social contract that underpins U.S. government. The author argues that by defying court orders, attacking judges, and revoking legal statuses, the administration has abandoned the principle that the government must also follow the rules. The article highlights the Supreme Court's role in enabling this crisis by gutting judicial checks on executive power. It concludes that this erosion of the rule of law requires a response from citizens to reassert that the government requires the consent of the governed to be legitimate.</p>

This claim suggests the J-35 may be stealthier than its American counterpart, the F-35, which is often described as having an RCS comparable to the size of a golf ball.
