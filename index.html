          <p>Ukraine's recent "Operation Spider Web" drone strike on Russian airbases has demonstrated a new paradigm in modern warfare, challenging the notion that bases deep behind front lines are safe. The operation, which reportedly used smuggled drones to destroy or damage dozens of strategic bombers, provides a blueprint for smaller militaries to counter larger air forces. By targeting aircraft on the ground, Ukraine imposed significant financial and strategic costs on Russia far more cheaply than intercepting missiles. This tactic forces a costly rethinking of airbase defense and resource allocation.</p>

          <p>One year after a widely criticized debate performance by Joe Biden, this article argues that the Democratic Party remains in a state of disarray, struggling to find a clear path forward. The piece reflects on the party's subsequent challenges, including the 2024 election loss and internal divisions, exemplified by the recent New York mayoral primary. The author suggests that while grassroots energy exists, the party leadership appears rudderless. The commentary concludes that Democrats must look toward the future and the 2028 election to escape the cycle of relitigating past failures.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government is set to halt the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) by June 30, a move that scientists warn could severely cripple hurricane forecasting capabilities. The DMSP satellites provide unique and critical data for monitoring storm development and Arctic sea ice, which researchers say cannot be adequately replaced by other systems. The sudden announcement has left forecasters and scientists scrambling, with some calling the decision "reckless" and a "systematic destruction of science," especially as an active hurricane season begins.</p>

          <p>The victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York's Democratic mayoral primary has elicited strong reactions from conservatives. While some expressed admiration for his effective grassroots campaign against an establishment figure, many view his rise as a concerning sign of the Democratic party's leftward shift. At a conservative conference, attendees described his agenda as an affront to free markets and expressed skepticism that his brand of politics could succeed outside of liberal urban centers. The result is seen as providing fresh material for Republican messaging against their opponents.</p>

          <p>According to a Chinese Middle East expert, Beijing will likely remain cautious and avoid providing direct military support to Iran despite escalating tensions with the U.S. and Israel. While Iran may seek Chinese weapons, China is focused on balancing its relationships with all regional powers, including Israel and other Western-aligned states. The analysis suggests that while the direct conflict may not broaden, tit-for-tat attacks could continue as Iran advances its nuclear program.

The rule serves as a practical framework to manage expectations, as no house is perfect.

          <p>Petroleum analysts are forecasting a significant drop in U.S. gas prices, suggesting this summer could be the cheapest for fuel since 2021. Experts predict the national average could fall below $3 per gallon by September, following a brief spike due to the recent Israel-Iran conflict. The expected decline is attributed to the de-escalation in the Middle East, increased refinery production, and a typical softening of consumer demand after early summer travel peaks. Adjusted for inflation, current gas prices are already near a 20-year low. (not investment advice)</p>
