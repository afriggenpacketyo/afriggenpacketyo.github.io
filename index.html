          <p>House Democrats released a controversial 2003 birthday note allegedly from Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein, which was part of documents subpoenaed from Epstein's estate. The note, which Trump has denied writing and sued The Wall Street Journal for reporting on, contains a hand-drawn image and a message. Trump's legal team and White House staff contest the signature's authenticity, comparing it to more recent examples, though his signature has evolved over time. The release is part of a bipartisan House Oversight Committee investigation into Epstein's records.</p>

          <p>A new mural by the anonymous artist Banksy appeared on the Royal Courts of Justice in London, depicting a judge striking a protester with a gavel. Banksy authenticated the work on Instagram, which activists interpret as a commentary on the UK government's ban of the group Palestine Action. However, authorities quickly covered the artwork and announced its removal, citing the building's protected historical status. The mural will be carefully removed to preserve the 143-year-old structure's original character.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether seniors can avoid paying for Medicare Part B, which has a standard monthly premium of $185 in 2025. While complete avoidance is rare, options for delaying enrollment without penalty exist for those still working with creditable employer health insurance. For low-income individuals, state-run Medicare Savings Programs or Medicaid can help cover or eliminate the premium costs. However, forgoing Part B can restrict access to crucial supplemental coverage like Medigap and Medicare Advantage plans, potentially leading to higher out-of-pocket expenses.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced a new, intensified immigration enforcement initiative in Chicago named "Operation Midway Blitz." The operation specifically targets individuals described by the department as "criminal illegal aliens," with officials stating it was prompted by Illinois' sanctuary city policies. Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson criticized the move, accusing the Trump administration of using fear tactics and failing to coordinate with local authorities. The announcement follows a social media post from President Trump alluding to increased deportations in the city.</p>

          <p>With interest rates in flux, savers with a significant sum like $40,000 must carefully choose between a high-yield savings account and a certificate of deposit (CD). While current rates are comparable, a CD offers a fixed rate for its term, protecting against future declines, whereas high-yield savings rates are variable. The decision hinges on the saver's ability to keep the funds untouched, as CDs penalize early withdrawals, while high-yield accounts offer liquidity. Both options remain significantly more profitable than traditional savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coalition of nearly 100 pro-life organizations, led by Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, is urging Congress to include Hyde Amendment-style protections in any extension of Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies.

They contend that the ACA's original structure allows for the commingling of federal funds with private payments for abortion coverage.

The government has insisted it is "absolutely backing" the bill, describing it as the biggest upgrade to workers' rights in a generation.

          <p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans has increased its settlement offer to over 600 survivors of clergy sexual assault to a minimum of $230 million. This new offer, up from a previous $180 million, is an attempt to secure the necessary two-thirds approval from claimants in its ongoing bankruptcy case. The settlement funds will come from the archdiocese and its smaller insurers, while survivors can still pursue additional claims against the primary insurer. The case has been highly contentious, with the archdiocese filing for bankruptcy in 2020 to manage hundreds of abuse claims.</p>

          <p>A survey from the New York Federal Reserve reveals that American workers' confidence in their ability to find a new job has fallen to an all-time low. The August Survey of Consumer Expectations showed that the perceived probability of finding new employment after a job loss dropped to 44.9%, the lowest since the survey began in 2013. This data signals a reversal of the "Great Resignation" trend, as a slowing labor market and cautious hiring by employers are causing workers to stay in their current positions.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily allowed the Trump administration to resume widespread immigration enforcement stops in the Los Angeles area by freezing a lower court's injunction. The district court's order had barred federal agents from detaining individuals based solely on factors like race, language, or occupation without additional reasonable suspicion. In a 6-3 decision, the majority cleared the way for the enforcement activities to continue while the legal challenge proceeds. The dissenting justices argued the ruling was a "grave misuse" of the court's emergency power.</p>

The trend was more pronounced among lower-income and less-educated groups. The findings raise public health concerns, as excessive sugar consumption is linked to obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and other health issues.</p>

One option is credit counseling, where professionals create a debt management plan, often negotiating lower interest rates. Another approach is working with a debt relief company, which can negotiate directly with creditors to settle debts for less than the full amount owed. A third strategy involves proactively contacting credit card issuers to inquire about hardship programs or payment plans, which can provide temporary relief from financial burdens.</p>

The panel ruled that Trump's defamatory statements about Carroll's sexual assault allegation were not official acts and therefore not covered by immunity, affirming the jury's decision.</p>
