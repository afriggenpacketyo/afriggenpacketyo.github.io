          <p>The popular passive investment strategy of buying S&P 500 index-tracking ETFs is facing scrutiny from some financial experts. They argue that the index has become imbalanced, with technology stocks accounting for a record high of over 35%, reducing diversification for investors. As a result, traders are reportedly showing renewed interest in small-cap stocks, such as those in the Russell 2000 index, which recently hit an all-time high. This shift comes as major tech companies are set to report their latest earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

Member nations are feeling pressured to align with one of the superpowers on matters of security, trade, and technology, a dynamic described as a "zero-sum game." While some economically weaker states align with China, larger countries like the Philippines and Indonesia are attempting a difficult balancing act, maintaining security ties with the U.S. while fostering crucial economic relationships with China. The summit highlights the region's struggle to maintain neutrality.</p>

          <p>Timothy Mellon, an heir to the Mellon banking family, has been identified as the anonymous donor who gave $130 million to help pay U.S. military salaries during the ongoing government shutdown. President Trump had previously announced the donation from a "patriot" without naming the individual. While the contribution is substantial, it only amounts to approximately $100 per service member and may potentially violate the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from spending funds not appropriated by Congress. Mellon is a known major donor to a pro-Trump super PAC.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the EU is actively working to end its reliance on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for manufacturing smartphones, electric vehicles, and military technology. The move is a response to recent export curbs and license requirements imposed by Beijing, which have caused significant economic damage to some European industries. The EU's strategy includes increasing recycling efforts, developing domestic production and processing, and forming partnerships with other resource-rich countries like Australia, Canada, and Ukraine to secure alternative supply chains.</p>

          <p>A man previously pardoned by former President Trump for his involvement in the January 6th Capitol riot has been arrested and charged with making a terroristic threat. The individual, Christopher Moynihan, allegedly sent text messages stating his intent to kill House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries during a speech in New York City. This arrest highlights growing concerns about recidivism among pardoned rioters and contributes to the rising number of threats against members of Congress.

          <p>One year after the largest dam removal project in U.S. history, the Klamath River is showing remarkable signs of ecological recovery. Salmon have been observed in headwaters for the first time in over a century, native plants are blooming, and wildlife is returning to the revitalized waterway. The restoration inspired an Indigenous youth program, "Paddle Tribal Waters," where teenagers completed the first full kayak descent of the river in more than 100 years. This successful project is now serving as a model for river restoration movements worldwide.</p>

          <p>California's Proposition 50, which would allow Democrats to redraw congressional districts to create five additional safe seats, is being marketed to voters as a direct countermeasure to Donald Trump and Republican gerrymandering efforts in states like Texas.

          <p>According to Chinese state media, President Xi Jinping took a direct and personal role in drafting the country's upcoming 15th five-year plan. He reportedly headed the drafting team, conducted extensive investigations during tours across the country, and played a "decisive role" in shaping the economic and social blueprint. This hands-on approach underscores Xi's centralized authority and personal investment in the nation's long-term strategic direction. The framework underwent multiple revisions by the Politburo Standing Committee before being presented to the Central Committee for deliberation.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos has sold his mansion in Hunts Point, Seattle, for $63 million, two years after relocating to Miami with his wife, Lauren Sánchez. The Amazon founder had originally purchased the property overlooking Lake Washington in 2019 for $37.5 million, realizing a significant profit from the sale. This move coincides with Bezos reducing his ownership stake in Amazon to below 10%, having sold over 100 million shares in the past year. The sale also comes amid an ongoing legal dispute with his wife's brother over the publication of private texts.</p>

By reducing its holdings, Berkshire has potentially left an estimated $50 billion in unrealized profits on the table.
