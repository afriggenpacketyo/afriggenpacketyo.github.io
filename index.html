          <p>Hall of Fame pitcher Mariano Rivera and his wife, Clara Rivera, have been added as defendants in an amended sexual abuse lawsuit filed by an unnamed girl and her mother in Westchester County Court. The original lawsuit, filed in January, alleged the girl was victimized at events linked to the church the Riveras co-founded, with Clara Rivera listed as a senior pastor. The amended suit alleges the Riveras disregarded the girl's claims and intimidated her to remain silent to avoid trouble for the church. Rivera's attorney states the allegations are completely false, and the plaintiff is seeking a jury trial and damages.</p>

          <p>The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) is launching legal action against Ofsted, the education watchdog in England, over proposed changes to school inspections. The union seeks a judicial review of plans for new school report cards, arguing they represent another crude grading system that will negatively impact school leaders' mental health. This action follows criticism from Ruth Perry's sister and other teaching unions, who warn the changes will detrimentally affect staff wellbeing and students' experience. Ofsted maintains that supporting mental health is a key part of the proposals and deems the union's claims untenable.</p>

          <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian human rights advocate and Columbia University student, recounts his detention by the Department of Homeland Security after a citizenship naturalization interview in an essay published in the New York Times. Mahdawi describes the event as a trap orchestrated due to his opposition to Israel's actions in Gaza, and notes that his detention followed other arrests of student activists. Despite spending 16 nights in jail, a federal judge ruled in his favor, leading to his release. Mahdawi argues that the American government is attempting to deport him for political speech, undermining U.S. foreign policy, and that this repression of dissent threatens democracy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional and permanently blocked the administration from enforcing it. Judge Beryl Howell found the order violated the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, stating it sent a message that lawyers must adhere to the party line. Perkins Coie represented Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and hired a research firm that retained Christopher Steele. The ruling is a victory for Perkins Coie and a rebuke of the president's actions against firms associated with disfavored causes.</p>

          <p>United Airlines will reduce its schedule at Newark Liberty International Airport by 35 roundtrip flights daily, approximately 10% of its Newark hub schedule, due to air traffic controller staffing shortages and FAA technology problems. CEO Scott Kirby attributed the disruptions to a significant number of air traffic controllers walking off the job after recent technology failures. Kirby is urging the FAA to implement flight restrictions similar to those at other congested airports. The FAA acknowledged staffing issues were causing delays at Newark, and Kirby praised the Trump administration's commitment to infrastructure investment.</p>

          <p>Chinese e-commerce platform Temu has stopped shipping products directly from China to U.S. customers, now fulfilling all U.S. orders from local warehouses. This change follows the Trump administration's closure of a loophole that allowed Chinese-made goods worth under $800 to enter the U.S. without import fees. Temu had previously announced it would adjust prices and started adding import charges for U.S. customers. The company states pricing remains unchanged as it transitions to a local fulfillment model and actively recruits U.S. sellers to join the platform.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts suggest that establishing clear communication channels with agreed-upon negotiators is crucial for easing US-China trade tensions. While Chinese officials propose special envoys appointed by Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, the U.S. prefers direct negotiations between Trump and Xi, an approach China rejects as too risky. A key point of contention is China's role in producing fentanyl ingredients, which led to Trump imposing tariffs on Chinese goods. China may use fentanyl cooperation as leverage in future trade talks, rather than a gesture of goodwill.</p>

Haley alleges that Weinstein sexually assaulted her in 2006, after inviting her to his apartment. Weinstein's lawyer questioned Haley on the details of the alleged sexual assault, attempting to cast doubt on her recollection. The judge called a break as the exchange escalated, with Haley cursing at Weinstein before covering her mouth. Weinstein's previous conviction was overturned, leading to the retrial where he faces charges of sexual assault and rape.</p>

The rebound was fueled by a better-than-expected jobs report and rising hopes for US-China trade talks.

          <p>Miriam Haley, one of Harvey Weinstein's accusers, broke down in tears during cross-examination in his retrial. Haley, a former television production assistant, alleges that Weinstein sexually assaulted her in 2006. During questioning, Weinstein's lawyer pressed Haley on the details of the incident, leading to an emotional outburst and a temporary pause in the proceedings. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and his lawyers argue that the encounters were consensual.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is planning a large-scale parade through Washington, D.C., on June 14, coinciding with the Army's 250th anniversary and President Trump's 79th birthday. The parade will involve approximately 6,600 soldiers, tanks, infantry vehicles, helicopter flyovers, and parachute jumps. The timing and White House involvement have fueled speculation that Trump is using the Army's birthday to stage a grand military parade. The cost of the event is unclear, but it will require involvement from multiple federal agencies and may cause infrastructure damage.</p>
