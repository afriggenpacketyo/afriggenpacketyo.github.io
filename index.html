          <p>A train traveling from Manchester to Cardiff collided with a tractor and trailer at a level crossing in Leominster, Herefordshire, resulting in two people being hospitalized. The incident occurred on Thursday morning, affecting 56 passengers. A male passenger was airlifted to Hereford County Hospital with injuries not considered life-threatening, while a woman was also transported to the hospital by ambulance. Fifteen others were evaluated and discharged at the scene, and the tractor driver was uninjured. The crash led to the blockage of all lines between Hereford and Craven Arms, causing significant service disruptions. An investigation is underway to determine the circumstances leading up to the collision.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate over 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees who were previously subject to a reduction in force. The judge's preliminary injunction emphasized the importance of the Department's ability to fulfill its functions and obligations, as mandated by Congress. The staff cuts, announced on March 11, would have significantly reduced the agency's staff and led to the closure of seven out of twelve offices responsible for enforcing civil rights protections for students, safeguarding them from discrimination based on race, sex, and disability. This order marks a setback for the administration's efforts to restructure the Education Department.</p>

          <p>A Cessna 550 crashed into a residential neighborhood in San Diego early Thursday morning, resulting in multiple fatalities among those on board and destroying several homes. The crash occurred in Murphy Canyon near the Tierrasanta neighborhood, and multiple homes caught fire. There were no reports of serious injuries among residents on the ground, who evacuated quickly. The plane had been attempting to land at the Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport. The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the cause of the crash, and the neighborhood is described as a debris field with jet fuel present.</p>

          <p>The House has passed a bill that includes a provision requiring Medicaid recipients to prove they are working, volunteering, or attending school for 80 hours per month to maintain coverage. This stricter version of work requirements, supported by President Trump, has faced opposition due to concerns it could cause millions to lose insurance. The Congressional Budget Office estimates 7.6 million people could become uninsured due to these Medicaid changes, with savings coming from fewer people having Medicaid. While popular among Republicans, critics argue it is a budget-saving measure that will disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, and it is unclear how states will manage the complex eligibility documentation process.</p>

          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in April fell 0.5% from March, reaching an annualized rate of 4 million units, the slowest April pace since 2009, according to the National Association of Realtors. Sales were down 2% from April of the previous year, falling short of economists' expectations. The decline is attributed to high interest rates and low consumer confidence, impacting the spring housing market. Inventory increased by 9% month-to-month, reaching 1.45 million homes for sale, representing a 4.4-month supply, the highest level in five years. The median price of an existing home sold in April was $414,000, a modest 1.8% year-over-year increase, indicating a cooling market.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department plans to discontinue manufacturing the penny due to its rising production costs, marking the end of one of the first coins minted by the U.S. government. The federal agency has placed its final order for penny blanks, with the United States Mint expected to cease production in early 2026. In 2024, it cost about 3.7 cents to manufacture and distribute each 1-cent coin, resulting in an annual savings of approximately $56 million for the Mint. This decision follows scrutiny from previous administrations and directives from President Trump, who cited the wasteful expense of minting pennies that cost more than their face value.</p>

          <p>Elias Rodriguez, a 30-year-old from Chicago, has been identified as the suspect in the fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy employees outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. The victims, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, were allegedly shot by Rodriguez, who authorities believe acted alone. Following the shooting, Rodriguez entered the museum and was apprehended by security. The suspect, who chanted "free, free Palestine" during his arrest, is being investigated for a potential hate crime. Rodriguez is an employee at the American Osteopathic Information Association, and his social media history reveals pro-Palestine activism and frustration with media coverage of the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

          <p>OpenAI announced plans to build a large computing complex in the United Arab Emirates as part of a joint venture with Oracle, Nvidia, SoftBank, and G42, an Emirati AI firm. This initiative follows a deal between the Trump administration and the UAE. The first data center is expected to be operational next year. G42 will also invest in OpenAI data centers in the United States, matching every dollar invested in the Emirates. This expansion is part of Sam Altman's ambitious plan, called Stargate, to construct massive data centers globally to support powerful AI systems. This plan has been met with both support and security concerns from Washington officials.</p>

          <p>Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives passed President Donald Trump's tax bill, but investors on Wall Street expressed concerns about the bill's potential impact on federal deficits and long-term fiscal health. Democrats vehemently opposed the bill's cuts to the social safety net. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would decrease resources for households in the lowest income decile and increase resources for the highest decile. The bill faces a complex path through the Senate, where several Republican senators have already indicated they will require significant changes before voting for it.</p>

          <p>Despite Shohei Ohtani's progress in bullpen sessions, the Dodgers are proceeding cautiously with his return to pitching, prioritizing his offensive contributions. The team is facing a challenging stretch of games against winning teams, and while Ohtani's arm would be valuable, his bat is deemed essential. The Dodgers' pitching staff is depleted due to injuries, making Ohtani's offensive presence even more crucial. Dave Roberts will have to manage a depleted rotation and bullpen, potentially making strategic decisions to save key relievers for games where they have a lead. The team's success hinges on protecting Ohtani the hitter while navigating pitching challenges.</p>
