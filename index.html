          <p>The family of a victim from the January 29th collision between an American Airlines flight and an Army helicopter over Washington, D.C., has filed the first of many expected lawsuits. The suit names the FAA, the Army, and the airlines, alleging they ignored warning signs from over 30 prior near-misses in the area. The NTSB's preliminary findings suggest multiple contributing factors, including the helicopter flying above its altitude limit and overworked air traffic controllers. The lawsuit seeks accountability to prevent future tragedies, with dozens of other victims' families expected to join the legal action.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning of a significant surge in infections from a drug-resistant bacteria known as NDM-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (NDM-CRE). These infections, which can cause pneumonia and bloodstream infections, have increased by over 460% between 2019 and 2023. Because NDM-CRE is resistant to most powerful antibiotics, it is extremely difficult to treat and can be fatal, posing a growing public health threat. Experts urge healthcare providers to be vigilant and for patients to be persistent in seeking treatment for any persistent infections.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from VantageScore, the average American's credit card balance has climbed to $6,500, with credit utilization rates reaching a concerning level of over 30%. This trend suggests that many are relying on credit to cover basic living expenses amid ongoing economic pressures and high interest rates. The article outlines several strategies for managing this debt, including consolidation loans, balance transfer cards, and credit counseling, emphasizing the need for a structured approach. Taking immediate action is crucial to avoid debt cycles as interest continues to compound. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's suggestion that pregnant women should "tough it out" instead of taking acetaminophen, numerous doctors and public health officials are voicing concerns. They emphasize that untreated high fevers during pregnancy can pose serious risks to fetal development, including potential cardiac and central nervous system abnormalities. Medical professionals reiterate that acetaminophen (Tylenol) remains the safest over-the-counter option for pain and fever during pregnancy compared to alternatives like ibuprofen or aspirin. They advise pregnant individuals to follow medical guidance rather than political commentary to avoid harmful outcomes for both mother and baby.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's new defender, 18-year-old Giovanni Leoni, is expected to be sidelined for several months after sustaining a suspected anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. The injury occurred during his debut match in a Carabao Cup game against Southampton, forcing him off the pitch after 81 minutes. This significant setback leaves Liverpool with only three recognized senior centre-backs for the foreseeable future. Leoni, who recently joined from Parma, expressed his disappointment but vowed to return to playing as soon as possible.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, borrowing costs for home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) have decreased. A comparison shows that a $100,000 HELOC is currently slightly cheaper on a monthly basis than a fixed-rate home equity loan of the same amount. However, the article notes that HELOCs have variable rates, meaning payments could rise if market conditions change, whereas home equity loans offer the stability of a fixed payment. Homeowners are advised to weigh the reliability of a fixed-rate loan against the potential for further savings with a variable-rate HELOC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>YouTube has announced it will allow creators who were previously banned for violating its COVID-19 and election misinformation policies to rejoin the platform. In a letter to the House Judiciary Committee, parent company Alphabet stated the move reflects a commitment to free expression, as the policies under which the creators were banned are no longer in effect. This decision follows pressure from conservatives who argued that tech companies unfairly censored right-wing voices. The move is part of a broader trend of tech companies rolling back content moderation rules established during the pandemic and the 2020 election cycle.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has rapidly built a domestic weapons industry, now producing millions of drones annually to counter the Russian invasion and reduce reliance on foreign aid. A key part of its strategy involves long-range drone and missile strikes deep inside Russia, specifically targeting the oil and gas industry, which is a primary source of the Kremlin's revenue. This campaign has successfully hit numerous refineries and pipelines, causing fuel shortages within Russia and reducing its export capacity. This economic warfare, supported by European allies, represents Ukraine's effort to apply its own form of sanctions to cripple Russia's ability to fund the war.</p>

Economists offer mixed predictions on its effects, suggesting it could boost domestic hiring in some sectors like technology in the short term. However, other research indicates that restricting access to skilled foreign labor could harm companies' growth and ultimately limit overall job creation for Americans in the long run. The policy remains controversial, with proponents arguing it protects U.S. workers from being replaced by cheaper labor, while critics warn it could stifle innovation and economic expansion.

Sliwa vowed to remain in the campaign and threatened to name the people behind the offers if they persist. The mayoral race features a crowded field, and President Trump had previously suggested that Sliwa and current Mayor Eric Adams should withdraw to create a two-person contest between Zohran Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo.</p>

The agreement stipulates that for every migrant returned to France who crossed the Channel illegally, the UK will accept one refugee with a valid protection claim. The UK government hopes the policy will deter illegal crossings and disrupt human smuggling networks, though the plan has faced criticism from opposition parties and rights groups for its limited scope.</p>

This rule, established in 2001, required traders making four or more day trades in five days to maintain a $25,000 account balance. The change, which awaits SEC approval, will replace the fixed minimum with a more flexible intraday margin rule based on the positions taken.

The letter draws parallels to other companies like Apple and Nvidia, which have announced domestic investments following engagement with Trump.

His death is interpreted by his allies as proof that the left is intolerant of even democratic conservative participation in the public sphere. This perspective is fueling an emotional and vehement political response, with calls to seize cultural control and retaliate against perceived political enemies.</p>
