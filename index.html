          <p>Approximately 250 million honeybees escaped after a truck overturned in a sparsely populated area of Whatcom County, Washington State. Emergency responders were stung while dealing with the aftermath of the accident, which involved a truck carrying the bees. Efforts are underway to recapture the escaped bees, which presents a challenge due to their large numbers and the rural location of the incident.

          <p>Japan and the U.S. have reported progress in tariff negotiations, aiming for a potential deal as early as next month, according to Japan's chief tariff negotiator. President Trump announced an increase in tariffs on steel imports to 50% from the previous 25%, speaking at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, and praised Nippon Steel's planned $14 billion investment in the American producer. China has agreed to begin procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, lifting a ban imposed after the Fukushima wastewater release. Other news includes warnings about rice scam websites, strengthened Japan-Cambodia security cooperation, investigations into securities account hijackings, Dai-ichi Life's investment in British insurer M&G, and sumo grand champion Onosato's ring entry ceremony.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he would double tariffs on steel imports to 50% during a rally in Pennsylvania, aiming to further secure the steel industry in the United States. He also celebrated a "blockbuster" agreement for Japan-based Nippon Steel to invest in US Steel, stating that Nippon has committed to keeping U.S. Steel's blast furnaces operating at full capacity for a minimum of a decade. Trump emphasized there would be no layoffs or outsourcing due to the deal, and U.S. Steel workers would receive a $5,000 bonus, while the United Steelworkers union expressed caution regarding the merger's impact on national security and its members. The president framed the drive to boost domestic steel production as a matter of national security, blaming past administrations for the decline of the American steel industry.</p>

This has contributed to a fear of parenthood among millennials and Gen Z, who worry they cannot meet these standards. The essay posits that the cultural shift towards prioritizing individual mental health and holding parents accountable has created an almost impossible benchmark for prospective parents.</p>

          <p>President Trump praised Elon Musk for his work with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) as Musk's tenure as a "special government employee" concluded. Trump said Musk's efforts to cut government spending have been without comparison in modern history, although DOGE's savings fell short of initial promises. Despite his limited time as a special government employee, Trump indicated that Musk will remain involved as a friend and advisor. Musk defended DOGE's work and expressed confidence in achieving the $1 trillion savings goal over time.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's departure from the Trump administration was marked by a combination of praise from the president and lingering questions about his performance. Despite Trump's generous words, Musk's cost-cutting efforts fell short of initial targets, and he publicly criticized Trump's spending bill. A New York Times report detailed allegations of widespread drug use by Musk, including ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms, and ketamine, leading to further scrutiny. The event highlighted both Musk's close relationship with Trump and the challenges he faced during his time in Washington.</p>

          <p>A clinical trial suggests that the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab could significantly extend the lives of people with advanced head and neck cancer.

Patients receiving pembrolizumab had a 10% lower risk of their cancer returning elsewhere in the body after three years. The findings represent a significant advancement in treating this difficult-to-manage cancer, offering new hope for improved outcomes.</p>

          <p>The Army has issued guidelines for expelling transgender troops, requiring them to voluntarily leave active duty by June 6, after which involuntary separations will begin. Internal directives instruct personnel to address transgender troops by their medical assignment at birth rather than preferred pronouns. Soldiers will identify fellow service members suspected of gender dysphoria based on criteria including past requests for grooming standard exemptions or social media activity. The guidance has been criticized as worse than the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, leading to concerns about the treatment and future prospects of transgender veterans.</p>

These workers collected $17.1 million in pay, with Chapman assisting in job applications and forwarding pay after taking a cut. This tactic is used to manipulate the gig economy and draw salaries from unsuspecting businesses, as international sanctions affect North Korea's funding sources.</p>

          <p>After a federal court struck down President Trump's use of emergency powers to enact broad tariffs, his administration is exploring alternative pathways for imposing trade duties. The legal challenge puts much of Trump's trade agenda at risk, which relies on tariffs to secure better trade terms and boost U.S. manufacturing. Experts suggest Trump could turn to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, or Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, each with its own limitations and requirements.</p>

The lawsuit comes after National Public Radio (NPR) filed a similar suit against Trump and his administration.
