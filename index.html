          <p>Japan's cruise industry is experiencing a significant resurgence after the COVID-19 pandemic halted operations in 2020. Pent-up travel demand and new investments are fueling a surge in maritime journeys, with Japanese ports seeing record domestic passenger numbers. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism reported a 14.2 percent year-on-year increase in the Japanese cruise market in 2024, reaching 224,100 passengers. Major shipping companies like NYK Line and Mitsui O.S.K Lines Ltd. are expanding their cruise ship fleets to capitalize on this growing market, with new vessels offering luxurious amenities and entertainment options. The Asuka III, set to launch in July, will be the largest passenger ship in the Japanese fleet, featuring frescoes and private seaside balconies in all cabins, reflecting the growing interest in cruise travel.</p>

          <p>A suspect launched an attack on a pedestrian mall in Boulder, Colorado, injuring six people with what authorities are calling a "makeshift flamethrower."

The attack has led to the cancellation of upcoming Run for Their Lives events, which aim to raise awareness about hostages in Gaza.

          <p>Immigration attorneys are expressing concerns that the Trump administration's intensified deportation efforts are causing fear among both residents and citizens. There have been reports of individuals being arrested and placed into expedited deportation proceedings immediately after leaving immigration court. While U.S. citizens are generally not subject to questioning upon returning from international travel, permanent residents may face scrutiny from immigration officials. Attorneys advise residents planning to stay abroad for more than six months to apply for a re-entry permit to avoid being considered as having abandoned their residency, and those with criminal records should consult with an immigration lawyer to assess their deportation risk.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan opposition leader MarÃ­a Corina Machado fears that NicolÃ¡s Maduro's regime will respond to the U.S. decision to restrict Chevron's operations in Venezuela with increased internal repression. Machado, who is in hiding, highlighted the recent arrests of over 70 opposition activists and leaders prior to legislative elections. The partial revocation of Chevron's license to export oil from Venezuela poses a significant challenge to the country's economy, which heavily relies on oil exports. Machado views the U.S. decision as beneficial for Venezuela's future, as it prevents resources from going to the current regime and maintains a minimal operation for the eventual democratic transition.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler secured a four-shot victory at the Memorial Tournament, joining Tiger Woods as the only repeat winners of the event. Scheffler's consistent performance, marked by only one bogey in the final 40 holes, solidified his position as the world's top-ranked golfer. Ben Griffin's late surge was ultimately undone by a double bogey on the 17th hole, allowing Scheffler to cruise to victory. With this win, Scheffler has now won three of his last four starts, further cementing his dominance in the sport.</p>

          <p>Ernest Williams, a 90-year-old Royal Navy veteran, is still fighting to correct what he believes is an unjust military pension that has been denied to him since the 1980s. Williams says he was "robbed" of the pension he deserved because his discharge date was set two years earlier than others who applied for redundancy at the same time, missing out on significantly improved pension rules. Despite numerous appeals to official bodies and support from Members of Parliament, Williams has been told his pension reflects his "full and correct entitlement" based on the rules at the time. Williams hopes that by speaking out, he can bring attention to his case and encourage others affected by the same issue to come forward.</p>
