          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to impose a 25% blanket tariff on all goods imported from Japan and South Korea, effective August 1. President Trump revealed the decision through letters posted on social media, which were addressed to the leaders of both nations. The letters state the tariffs are necessary to address persistent trade deficits the U.S. holds with these countries and are separate from other sector-specific duties. This move has caused a downturn in U.S. financial markets, with major indices falling in response to the renewed trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 89 fatalities, with dozens of individuals, including children from a summer camp, still unaccounted for. The Guadalupe River rose with unprecedented speed, devastating communities and Camp Mystic, a children's summer camp in Kerr County, which suffered a significant number of deaths among its campers and staff. Search and rescue operations are ongoing, involving numerous state and federal agencies, as President Trump has declared a major disaster for the area. The tragedy has prompted a massive response, but the full extent of the loss of life is still being determined.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has publicly criticized Elon Musk following the tech billionaire's announcement of a new political party, the "American Party." In a social media post, Trump described Musk as having gone "off the rails" and called the formation of a third party a "ridiculous" move that only serves to create disruption and chaos. The conflict marks a significant falling out between the two, who had previously maintained a close alliance. Trump also targeted Musk's support for electric vehicle mandates, highlighting that his administration's new budget eliminates EV tax credits.</p>

          <p>Block CEO and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has launched a beta version of Bitchat, a new peer-to-peer messaging application that functions without an internet connection. The app uses a Bluetooth mesh network to create local communication clusters, allowing for encrypted, ephemeral messages to be passed between nearby devices. This design ensures functionality even during internet shutdowns or in areas without cell service, reflecting Dorsey's ongoing interest in censorship-resistant technology. Bitchat does not require personal information like phone numbers or emails, positioning it as a privacy-focused alternative to mainstream platforms like WhatsApp.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive analysis highlights growing concerns among economists and officials about the trajectory of the U.S. national deficit, which now exceeds 6% of GDP. Experts warn that persistent deficits, exacerbated by recent budget plans, could trigger significant fallout in markets, the economy, and international relations. Key risks include rising inflation, higher interest rates that "crowd out" private investment, and a diminished capacity for the government to respond to future emergencies. The report suggests the U.S. may have less than two decades to correct its fiscal path before facing severe consequences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Leaders of the BRICS nations concluded their summit in Rio de Janeiro without making any public statements in response to a new tariff threat from U.S. President Donald Trump. Trump had indicated he might impose tariffs on countries that align with what he termed "Anti-American BRICS policies." While Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva did not address the issue in his opening remarks, officials from Russia and China acknowledged the threat separately. A Russian spokesperson stated the comments were "noticed," while China's foreign ministry reiterated that BRICS is not a bloc aimed at confrontation.</p>

Officials also released security footage showing no one entered Epstein's cell area around the time of his death. The investigation did not uncover evidence to support charges against any uncharged third parties, and the DOJ stated its priority remains bringing justice to victims, not perpetuating unfounded theories.</p>

Robinhood's product, launched in the EU, allows users to invest in private company shares, like those of OpenAI and SpaceX, through blockchain-based tokens.

          <p>The practice of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents wearing masks and plain clothes during raids in Los Angeles is causing widespread fear and confusion. Critics, including former ICE officials, warn this tactic is dangerous, as it makes it difficult for the public to distinguish between legitimate law enforcement and criminals, potentially escalating encounters. While DHS officials state there is no new policy requiring masks, they and law enforcement unions defend the practice as necessary to protect agents from doxing and threats. The tactic has led to calls for legislation requiring clear identification for all officers operating in California.</p>

          <p>While Apple celebrates the major box office success of its movie "F1," an analysis suggests the company faces significant challenges in the field of artificial intelligence. The hit film demonstrates Apple's strength in long-term investment and marketing, but its recent AI announcements have underwhelmed Wall Street and consumers. The company's voice assistant, Siri, has seen little fundamental improvement in over a decade, lagging behind competitors like Google and OpenAI. This strategic gap has led to reports that Apple may consider licensing AI technology from rivals, a move that would contradict its core strategy of owning its key technologies.</p>

          <p>As search and rescue operations persist in central Texas, several key points define the catastrophic flooding event. The death toll has surpassed 85 and is expected to rise, with many victims from a washed-out summer camp. Ongoing search efforts are complicated by debris and continued rainfall. Meanwhile, questions are mounting over the adequacy of warnings, with Texas officials and federal forecasters appearing to deflect blame for the lack of preparation in a region known as "Flash Flood Alley." President Trump has declared a federal disaster and plans to visit the state later in the week.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the catastrophic Texas floods reveals that staggering amounts of rain, with some areas receiving upwards of 20 inches, fell over a short period. The deluge was caused by remnant moisture from a tropical storm that stalled over the Texas Hill Country, a region naturally prone to flash flooding. This intense rainfall caused the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes during the predawn hours, overwhelming two of its forks simultaneously. Forecasters warn that additional rainfall is possible, and flood watches remain in effect for the already devastated region.</p>

The Shah reportedly refused the offer, stating, "We are not in the business of killing clerics," a decision that proved fateful. Shortly after, Iraq expelled Khomeini, who then moved to France, gained unfettered media access, and orchestrated the Iranian Revolution within months.</p>
