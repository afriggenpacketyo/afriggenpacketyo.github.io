          <p>Israel's Security Cabinet has approved a controversial plan to expand its military operations by taking over Gaza City, a move Prime Minister Netanyahu supports despite opposition from top military officials. The decision comes amid dire warnings from the World Health Organization about record child malnutrition and a report from Doctors Without Borders condemning systemic violence at aid centers. Simultaneously, families of Israeli hostages are protesting the plan, fearing it will further endanger their loved ones, while Hamas has rejected it as detrimental to truce negotiations.</p>

The company posted a profit of 421.8 billion yen, a sharp reversal from the previous year's loss and well above the 127.6 billion yen consensus estimate. This strong performance was driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Funds, buoyed by investments in companies like Grab Holdings and Swiggy, with several more portfolio companies expected to go public soon.

          <p>Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated she is working at the national level to ensure access to gender-affirming medical care for transgender children. Her comments came in response to questions about pauses to such care in California and amid a broader political conflict on the issue. This support aligns with a lawsuit filed by over a dozen Democratic-led states challenging the Trump administration's efforts to block access to sex change procedures and treatments for individuals under the age of 19.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a 14-day temporary restraining order, halting further construction of the controversial 'Alligator Alcatraz' immigrant detention center in Florida. The ruling came after environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe argued that the facility was built in the environmentally sensitive Everglades without necessary impact studies. While the center can continue to house detainees, the order prevents any new work, including paving, that could cause irreparable harm to the ecosystem and lands considered sacred by the tribe.</p>

          <h2>Climate Change Has Advanced California's Wildfire Season by Over a Month, Study Finds</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research published in Science Advances quantifies how human-caused climate change has shifted California's fire season to begin significantly earlier than it did in the 1990s. In some northern regions like the Cascade Range, the season now starts 46 days sooner, driven by earlier snowmelt and increased drying of flammable vegetation. The study ruled out human-ignited fires as the cause for the shift, noting that 2025 is already on pace to exceed the five-year average for burned acreage in the state.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has increased the reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to $50 million, doubling the previous amount. Attorney General Pam Bondi accused Maduro of being a major narco-trafficker who works with cartels to flood the U.S. with drugs. This move escalates U.S. pressure on Maduro, who was indicted on narco-terrorism charges in 2020. In response, Venezuela's foreign minister dismissed the increased bounty as a "pathetic" and desperate act of political propaganda.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano and Disney have reached a settlement in her wrongful termination lawsuit, which she filed after being fired from the series "The Mandalorian" in 2021. Carano was dismissed over controversial social media posts, which she claimed was discriminatory and a violation of her right to express her opinions. While the settlement details remain confidential, a Lucasfilm spokesperson indicated a willingness to work with Carano in the future, suggesting an amicable resolution to the high-profile dispute.</p>

          <p>The UK government is developing legislation to impose stricter controls on serious violent and sexual offenders after their release from prison. The new plan would create tailored geographical zones where an offender is permitted to be, rather than simply creating exclusion zones where they cannot go. Monitored by enhanced electronic tagging, the system is designed to give victims greater peace of mind, though it has raised concerns about increasing the workload and pressure on the already strained probation service.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is demanding regulatory and legislative intervention after State Farm announced an average 27% increase in homeowners insurance rates for the state. The governor voiced deep concern that State Farm may be unfairly shifting out-of-state catastrophe costs onto Illinois residents, as the company's loss numbers appear inconsistent with the state's own analysis. State Farm defends the hike by citing a rise in severe weather events, particularly hail damage, which is becoming more frequent. (not investment advice)</p>
