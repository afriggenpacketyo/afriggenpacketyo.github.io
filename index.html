          <p>Columbia University requested the New York Police Department's assistance in clearing pro-Palestinian demonstrators from the campus library after they occupied the building and vandalized property. Acting University President Claire Shipman stated the decision was necessary due to safety concerns, including a large group attempting to force their way into the library and the presence of individuals not affiliated with the university. Two public safety officers were injured during a crowd surge. The NYPD entered the campus to remove the individuals who were trespassing, and Mayor Eric Adams emphasized the city's commitment to peaceful protest but intolerance for lawlessness. The Trump administration has been critical of Columbia's handling of pro-Palestinian protests, threatening to withhold federal funding.</p>

          <p>West Virginia coal miners are losing access to free black lung screenings after President Trump's administration slashed the budget of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The screenings, which have been offered for decades, are crucial for detecting the chronic disease caused by prolonged exposure to coal dust. Catherine Blackwood, a former NIOSH scientist, expressed concern over the elimination of jobs at the facility, which studied various workplace hazards. The cuts have raised fears about the health and safety of workers, especially in a state where Trump won a significant majority of the vote. The budget for NIOSH was about $363 million in 2023, the same year that job injuries and illnesses cost Americans around $176 billion, according to the National Safety Council.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering deporting migrants to Libya, a country plagued by armed conflict and political turmoil since 2011. Two U.S. officials revealed that the deportations, potentially operated by the U.S. military, could begin soon. Libya has a Level 4 travel advisory from the State Department due to crime, terrorism, and civil unrest, and has a troubling record regarding the treatment of migrants. The administration has been aggressively pursuing deportation agreements with various countries, including those in Latin America and Africa, to deter illegal immigration. The article notes that it is unclear exactly who would be deported to Libya and whether they would be detained upon arrival.</p>

          <p>A technical outage in Philadelphia caused chaos for air traffic controllers managing flights in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport, leading to significant delays and cancellations. The failure of radar and radio systems left controllers in a state of anxiety, prompting some to take mental health leave and exacerbating existing staffing shortages. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has called for a complete overhaul of the air traffic control system. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has acknowledged the issues and is taking steps to improve reliability, including installing new data connections and increasing staffing. The article highlights that the situation is a culmination of technical glitches and staffing issues that have plagued the Newark team for months.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining the federal funds rate at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. This decision comes amid pressure from President Trump to lower interest rates and concerns about the economic impact of his trade policies. Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the rising risks to higher inflation and unemployment due to the tariffs but noted that the impact hasn't yet materialized in economic data. The Fed is adopting a wait-and-see approach due to the uncertainty, retaining the flexibility to adjust rates as needed. The article notes that Wall Street interpreted Powell's comments as signaling an increased risk of stagflation.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom after Newsom requested collaboration on a federal film tax credit to "Make America Film Again." Newsom's proposal followed Trump's announcement of 100% tariffs on films produced outside the U.S., aimed at revitalizing the American film industry. Trump claimed the film industry has been "decimated" by other countries and Newsom's "gross incompetence." Despite the criticism, Trump expressed some positive sentiments towards Newsom and acknowledged providing water to California during the January wildfires.

          <p>The 2024-25 influenza season has been particularly severe, with 216 pediatric deaths nationwide and 25 in New York State alone. Health authorities attribute the high death toll to declining vaccination rates and the circulation of particularly virulent strains. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that over 47 million Americans contracted the flu, resulting in more than 600,000 hospitalizations. The article notes that only one of the 25 children who died in New York was vaccinated, and the decline in vaccinations reflects a rising distrust of the scientific establishment.</p>

          <p>The current charitable tax deduction system in the United States disproportionately benefits wealthy donors and the institutions they support, such as museums and universities.

The article proposes alternative solutions, such as a matching system where the government matches private donations or emulating Canada's tax credit system. The aim is to create a more equitable system where every donated dollar receives the same federal subsidy, regardless of the donor's income.</p>

          <p>The California State Bar is facing a deeper financial crisis after a botched exam rollout, which was intended to save money but could now cost an additional $5.6 million.
