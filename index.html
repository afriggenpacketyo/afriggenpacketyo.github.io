          <p>A large-scale manhunt is underway in Montana for Michael Paul Brown, a former U.S. soldier suspected of killing four people at a local bar. Governor Greg Gianforte has declared the search the state's highest priority, involving over three dozen law enforcement agencies in a mountainous area near Anaconda. Authorities believe the suspect, who has a history of mental health issues, is armed and extremely dangerous, keeping the small community on high alert. A reward of up to $10,000 is being offered for information leading to his capture.</p>

While revenue surpassed estimates, the company's AI chip sales to China were significantly impacted by U.S. export restrictions, resulting in a substantial revenue loss. Despite the setback, CEO Lisa Su expressed optimism about future AI revenue growth and the competitiveness of new chips against rivals like Nvidia, though the company's outlook does not currently include sales from its China-focused chip.

This discord threatens the future of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), a key Indo-Pacific alliance with Japan and Australia aimed at countering China's influence. The primary obstacle is the failure to finalize a comprehensive trade agreement, which was intended to be a central achievement of the visit.

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved higher renewal fees for legal marijuana businesses to offset declining tax revenue and fund the city's cannabis regulation department. Business owners argue the fee hikes could be detrimental, as they already face challenges from high taxes and intense competition with the illicit market. The city contends the increases are necessary for its budget and to ensure the department can operate effectively, though it has also reduced fines for certain operational violations as part of the new ordinance.</p>

          <p>Snap's shares fell sharply after the company reported second-quarter results where global average revenue per user (ARPU), a key metric, missed Wall Street expectations. CEO Evan Spiegel attributed the weaker performance to a flawed advertising platform update, the timing of Ramadan, and the effects of U.S. trade policies. Although the company saw growth in daily active users and its subscription service, the failure to effectively monetize its user base at the expected rate has raised significant concerns among investors.

          <p>This article explains the concept of gerrymandering, the practice of drawing electoral maps to favor one political party, in the context of a major political standoff in Texas. It details the techniques of "cracking" and "packing" voters and clarifies the legal landscape, noting that while the Supreme Court has allowed partisan gerrymandering, racial gerrymandering remains unconstitutional. The piece highlights how this centuries-old tactic has evolved into a central and intensely fought battle for political power in modern American politics.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Lucid Group has reduced its full-year production forecast after reporting second-quarter financial results that missed Wall Street estimates. The company now expects to produce between 18,000 and 20,000 vehicles, citing ongoing supply chain constraints and a slower-than-expected ramp-up for its new Gravity SUV. The announcement reflects broader challenges in the EV market, including slowing consumer demand and the anticipated end of federal tax credits, which has led the company to adopt a more cautious outlook.

          <p>The U.S. Attorney General has reportedly directed prosecutors to present evidence to a grand jury regarding the origins of the 2016 Trump-Russia investigation. This move could potentially lead to formal charges against individuals involved in the initial probe, which Donald Trump has long labeled a politically motivated "witch hunt." The action follows the declassification of documents from Special Counsel John Durham's inquiry, which Trump allies claim show a conspiracy by political opponents to smear his presidential campaign.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Coast Guard investigation into the fatal Titan submersible implosion concluded that the tragedy was preventable and that owner OceanGate used "intimidation tactics" to evade regulatory oversight. The report found the vessel's design was fundamentally flawed, its hull had been previously compromised, and the company fostered a "toxic" safety culture where concerns were dismissed. The investigation places significant blame on the late CEO Stockton Rush for his overconfidence and negligence, which directly contributed to the deaths of all five people aboard.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell are formally arguing against the Department of Justice's effort to unseal grand jury testimony from her case, citing her due process rights as she appeals her conviction.

The Justice Department has stated that much of the information was already made public during trial, though some victim and witness identities would remain confidential if the records were released.</p>

          <p>This article examines the legal and constitutional questions surrounding Texas Governor Greg Abbott's threats to remove Democratic lawmakers who left the state to block a Republican-led redistricting plan. While the governor and House Speaker have threatened arrest and removal from office, political science and legal experts suggest their authority is severely limited once lawmakers are out of state. The Texas Constitution allows for compelling attendance but does not provide a clear mechanism for removal under these circumstances, setting up a prolonged political and legal standoff.</p>

          <p>Recent comments by President Trump have significantly influenced prediction markets, which now show Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh as the leading front-runners to be the next Federal Reserve chair. In a CNBC interview, Trump praised both men, referring to them as "the Kevins," while noting that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is no longer in contention for the role. Both Hassett and Warsh are perceived as likely to favor lower interest rates, aligning with the president's frequent public criticism of current Chair Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>
