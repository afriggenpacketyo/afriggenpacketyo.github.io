          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has sharply criticized comments from EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen regarding potential multinational troop deployments to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees. Pistorius stated that publicly discussing such plans before negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow is "completely wrong," and noted the EU lacks jurisdiction for troop deployment. This diplomatic friction comes as Kyiv also condemned the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) for omitting any mention of the war in its closing statement, highlighting ongoing international complexities surrounding the conflict.</p>

          <p>Several Afghan families have successfully arrived in Germany from Pakistan after a prolonged wait for visas, despite a tougher immigration stance from the current German government. These arrivals include former employees of German institutions and others at risk of persecution by the Taliban. The Merz government had previously paused resettlement plans, but a court ruling affirmed its right to stop issuing visas, suggesting those who arrived may have succeeded through legal challenges. This development occurs as Chancellor Friedrich Merz campaigns in North Rhine-Westphalia ahead of local elections, downplaying their significance as a test for his federal coalition.</p>

          <p>A new study warns that the Trump administration's stringent immigration enforcement could severely impact California's $4 trillion economy, which relies heavily on immigrant labor in key sectors like agriculture, construction, and hospitality. Researchers from the Bay Area Economic Institute and UC Merced estimate that mass deportations and stricter policies could cost the state up to $278 billion in GDP. With one-fifth of California's 10.6 million immigrants being undocumented, business owners express concern over potential labor shortages and economic disruption, while the administration maintains its focus on creating jobs for U.S. citizens.</p>

          <p>Actor Dwayne Johnson has detailed his physically and emotionally demanding transformation to portray MMA fighter Mark Kerr in the new sports drama, "The Smashing Machine." Johnson admitted to feeling genuine fear about his ability to perform the role, a feeling he hadn't experienced in his career for a long time. He underwent hours of prosthetic application daily to embody Kerr, whose struggles with addiction resonated with Johnson's own experiences losing friends. The film, which also stars Emily Blunt, explores the volatile relationship between Kerr and his then-girlfriend, Dawn Staples.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has reached an agreement with Crystal Palace to sign 25-year-old England center-back Marc Guehi, who will finalize the move after a medical in London. The deal comes as part of a significant spending spree for the Premier League champions, pushing their summer transfer total to a record-breaking £451.2 million. Guehi's signing is intended to bolster Liverpool's defense, which has appeared vulnerable in early-season matches.

          <p>A powerful magnitude-six earthquake has struck a remote, mountainous region in eastern Afghanistan, resulting in over 800 deaths and nearly 3,000 injuries, according to the United Nations. The quake, which occurred late Sunday near the city of Jalalabad, has caused widespread devastation, with officials warning the death toll could rise significantly as entire villages have been destroyed. Rescue operations are severely hampered by the difficult terrain, landslides, and limited communication, compounding a pre-existing humanitarian crisis in the nation. The shallow depth of the earthquake contributed to its destructive impact.</p>

          <p>Doctors have discovered a bullet fragment lodged perilously close to the carotid artery in the neck of a 10-year-old boy who survived last week's mass shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic school.

His survival has been described as a "miracle," and he is scheduled for surgery to remove the fragment with an expected full recovery.

          <p>Germany, France, and the United Kingdom have activated the "snapback" mechanism to reinstate UN sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program, a feature of the 2015 JCPOA deal. This move could restore all previously lifted sanctions within 30 days if no new agreement is reached, placing Iran in a difficult diplomatic position. In response, some Iranian politicians have proposed withdrawing from the Non-Proliferation Treaty, though experts believe Tehran's leadership may prefer a diplomatic settlement to avoid further economic isolation and potential military risks. The action reflects escalating Western pressure on Iran to curb its nuclear activities and development of ballistic missiles.</p>

In a social media post, Trump referenced the ongoing debate over vaccine effectiveness, stating he wants an answer "NOW" to clear up what he termed a "MESS."

          <p>Self-made millionaire and financial coach Bernadette Joy advises that prospective homebuyers who cannot afford the payments on a 15-year mortgage are not truly ready for homeownership. She argues that with a traditional 30-year mortgage, homeowners build very little equity in the initial years as most of the payment goes toward interest. Joy also cautions against underestimating the hidden costs of owning a home, such as furnishing larger spaces, higher utility bills, and unexpected maintenance, which average over $8,800 annually. She recommends a budget where total living expenses, including a mortgage, do not exceed 50% of income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated on Monday that India has offered to reduce its tariffs on U.S. goods to zero, a claim made as Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met with Chinese and Russian leaders at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. In a social media post, Trump described the U.S.-India trade relationship as "one sided" and said the offer was "getting late." The comment follows Washington's imposition of duties up to 50% on some Indian goods after New Delhi continued purchasing Russian oil, a move that has strained bilateral relations despite shared strategic concerns about China.</p>

          <p>ScotRail, the government-owned operator in Scotland, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, meaning passengers will no longer pay higher prices for travel on busy weekday trains. The move aims to encourage more commuters to switch from cars to trains and is expected to reduce some fares, like Edinburgh to Glasgow, by nearly 50%. The policy follows a pilot scheme in 2023 that was initially deemed too costly to continue but was revived by First Minister John Swinney. The government anticipates the scheme will cost £40m to £45m annually, which will be covered by the ScotRail budget if not offset by increased passenger revenue.</p>

          <p>Amid concerns of a potential crisis in the UK government bond (gilts) market, an analyst outlines several bold measures the government and the Bank of England could take. The article notes that UK long-term bond yields have risen more than their US counterparts, creating a puzzle for investors. To restore confidence and avoid a "doom loop," the author suggests credible fiscal projections, significant tax reform such as a land tax, pro-growth policies like rejoining the EU customs union, and allowing the Bank of England to set its own inflation target.

          <p>The U.S. has intensified its tech rivalry with China by revoking waivers that allowed foreign-owned semiconductor factories, including those run by Samsung and SK Hynix, to use certain American technologies in their Chinese plants. Effective December 31, these companies will need licenses for equipment, with the U.S. indicating it will not approve requests for technology upgrades or capacity expansion. This move is expected to accelerate China's drive for technological self-reliance, with industry insiders anticipating a greater push for home-grown chipmaking capabilities to counteract mounting U.S. restrictions and create a more fragmented global supply chain.</p>

          <p>As interest rates show signs of potentially falling, financial experts suggest that short-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are currently offering the most attractive returns for savers. Six-month CDs are identified as a "sweet spot," often providing higher Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) than longer-term options, which is a reversal of historical trends. For those with a longer time horizon, experts recommend a CD laddering strategy, which involves spreading funds across multiple CDs with varying maturities to lock in current high rates while maintaining periodic access to cash.

This applies to both familiar cats and strangers, suggesting the gesture is a positive form of cat-human communication that signals friendliness. The technique offers a simple way for owners and others to enhance their bond with felines.</p>
