          <p>Blaine Milam, 35, was executed in Texas for the horrific December 2008 murder of his girlfriend's 13-month-old daughter, Amora Carson, in what the couple claimed was an "exorcism." Prosecutors detailed how Milam savagely beat, bit, strangled, and mutilated the child over a 30-hour period, inflicting multiple skull fractures, broken bones, and numerous bite marks. Milam's then-girlfriend, Jesseca Carson, received a life sentence for her role in the capital murder. The execution followed rejected appeals regarding bite mark evidence and intellectual disability claims, bringing a close to this deeply disturbing case.</p>

          <p>CBS News California Investigates interviewed 11 candidates for California governor in 2026, probing their views on Governor Gavin Newsom's and the Legislature's successes and areas for improvement. Democrats, including Toni Atkins and Xavier Becerra, largely commended Newsom's efforts on issues like redistricting and strengthening the economy. Conversely, Republican candidates like Chad Bianco offered sharp criticism, with Bianco suggesting Newsom's actions were politically motivated for a presidential bid. Key areas candidates vowed to address differently included the state's housing crisis, insurance challenges, and a call for state leaders to prioritize California-specific concerns over national politics. The article provides a comprehensive overview of the diverse political landscape.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was indicted on felony charges of obstruction and perjury, following his 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, sparking immediate and fierce political reactions nationwide. U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, newly appointed, framed the indictment as a crucial matter of accountability, asserting that "no one is above the law." President Donald Trump, a long-time critic of Comey, celebrated the news on Truth Social, labeling Comey "one of the worst human beings" and a "Corrupt Head of the FBI." In contrast, Democrats like Senator Tim Kaine and Senator Mark Warner denounced the charges as politically motivated, warning of a dangerous abuse of power and an erosion of the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto, the eighth named storm this hurricane season, is currently swirling north of the Caribbean, though it is not expected to make landfall. There is a rare possibility, however, that Humberto could interact with another developing storm in the western Atlantic, potentially triggering the Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon describes two tropical storms merging or rotating around a common center, with the stronger system often absorbing the weaker one. While an interaction is considered unlikely to significantly alter Humberto's projected path, forecasters anticipate Humberto will strengthen into a hurricane within the next day or so.</p>

          <p>Approximately 200 pieces of live coral, illegally harvested from Indonesian waters, were intercepted and seized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at John F. Kennedy Airport. These corals are protected under the Endangered Species Act and international conservation agreements, making their trade highly restricted. Arriving in poor health after five days in transit, the corals were transferred to the New York Aquarium, which operates as a "coral hospital" for confiscated marine life.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced he would not permit Israel to annex the West Bank, stating firmly, "It's not going to happen," ahead of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's UN General Assembly address. This declaration follows a wave of Western nations formally recognizing a Palestinian state, intensifying international pressure on Israel regarding the ongoing conflict. Trump also indicated progress towards a "deal on Gaza." The article provides crucial context, detailing the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where over 65,000 Palestinians have been killed, and a UN commission's finding of genocide, which Israel vehemently denies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a new round of tariffs effective October 1, targeting various imported goods including a 100% duty on branded pharmaceutical products, 30% on upholstered furniture, 50% on kitchen cabinets, and 30% on heavy trucks. The pharmaceutical tariff includes an exemption for companies establishing new manufacturing plants within the U.S. Trump justified these tariffs as necessary to protect domestic industries from "unfair outside competition" and for national security reasons. However, economic data suggests these duties are contributing to rising inflation and have not yet stimulated job growth in manufacturing, challenging the administration's claims of economic success.</p>

          <p>Democratic leaders in Congress strongly rejected a White House memo threatening mass federal worker layoffs ahead of a potential government shutdown, labeling it an "intimidation" tactic. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused the Trump administration of weaponizing the federal workforce to exert political pressure, asserting that President Trump has consistently targeted federal employees. Democrats are standing firm on their demands for key health care priorities as a condition for extending government funding, criticizing House Republicans for departing D.C. without engaging in bipartisan negotiations.

          <p>Residents of a San Rafael, California neighborhood are on edge due to an unusually aggressive squirrel that has attacked several people, leading to at least two emergency room visits for bites and scratches. One 80-year-old woman recounted being startled when the squirrel jumped onto her leg during a morning walk. A local flier warns residents of the "attack squirrel." While squirrels are not typically rabies carriers, they can transmit other diseases. Experts from the Marin Humane Society believe the aggression likely results from humans hand-feeding or raising the animals, causing them to lose their natural caution and become confrontational when food is not provided.</p>

          <p>Raynae Madison and her family, visiting Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas, made a remarkable discovery, unearthing a nearly 3-carat chocolate brown diamond. The 2.79-carat gem, named the William Diamond in honor of her nephew, marks the third-largest diamond registered at the park this year. Park interpreter Emma O'Neal explained that brown diamonds from the Crater result from plastic deformation, creating structural defects that reflect light to produce their distinct color. This 800-acre state park, renowned for its unique volcanic crater, has a rich history of public diamond finds, with over 75,000 unearthed since 1906, continuing to attract over 100,000 visitors annually.</p>

          <p>The Samaritans, a crucial suicide prevention charity, is confronting a significant internal crisis and a potential exodus of hundreds of volunteers over controversial proposals to close more than 100 branches across the UK and Ireland. Critics argue that the planned shift towards larger centralized offices and increased remote working will severely undermine local community engagement and potentially jeopardize the charity's capacity to answer its high volume of calls. Volunteers have voiced strong opposition, with some even calling for a vote of no confidence in the chairman, citing a perceived lack of consultation and profound concerns about the future efficacy of this life-saving organization.</p>

          <p>British energy major BP has largely moved out of the takeover spotlight, with its shares climbing over 32% since early April, outperforming rivals. This improved sentiment is attributed to a fundamental strategic reset, a leadership shake-up, progress on cost-cutting, and recent oil discoveries. Earlier in the year, BP was subject to intense speculation regarding potential acquisitions by Shell, ADNOC, Exxon Mobil, and Chevron. CEO Murray Auchincloss has emphasized the company's focus on growth, and strong second-quarter results, including a $2.35 billion profit, have further bolstered confidence in its independent trajectory.

          <p>Hollywood is experiencing a significant division over the Israel-Gaza conflict, articulated through two opposing open letters regarding a boycott of Israeli film groups. One letter, signed by over 5,000 actors and filmmakers like Pedro Pascal and Selena Gomez, commits to boycotting Israeli institutions deemed "implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people." In direct response, a counter-letter, endorsed by more than 1,200 industry figures including Liev Schreiber and Mayim Bialik, vehemently rejects the boycott. This second letter labels the initial pledge as "a document of misinformation" and "antisemitic propaganda," urging the entertainment community to oppose discriminatory calls and advocate for the release of hostages.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 238 into law as an urgency measure, immediately providing up to one year of mortgage relief for victims of the devastating January 7 firestorms.

The relief is extended in 90-day increments and explicitly prohibits mortgage servicers from initiating or executing foreclosures.

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order that effectively paves the way for a deal designed to keep TikTok operational in the U.S. under a new corporate structure, thereby avoiding a complete ban. This order designates the agreement as a "qualified divestiture," extending the enforcement pause of a bipartisan law that mandated TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, to divest. The proposed deal establishes a U.S.-based joint venture where ByteDance will retain less than 20% ownership, with Oracle providing comprehensive security by hosting U.S. user data and reviewing the app's code and algorithm. Despite these measures, some lawmakers express ongoing concerns regarding potential Chinese influence over the platform.</p>

Martin acknowledged the red card's impact but faced scrutiny over the team's overall pedestrian and unthreatening performance even prior to the incident.
