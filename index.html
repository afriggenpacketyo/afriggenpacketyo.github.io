          <p>A significant security operation is underway in Scotland for Donald Trump's private visit, where he played golf at his Turnberry resort. While the day passed without major incidents at the resort, hundreds of protesters gathered in Edinburgh and Aberdeen to demonstrate against his visit, citing his political stances and the high cost of security to taxpayers. The visit also includes planned meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney, amidst controversy over public funding for a tournament at another of Trump's Scottish courses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During his arrival in Scotland, President Donald Trump strongly criticized European immigration policies, labeling the situation a "horrible invasion" that is "killing Europe." He contrasted this with his administration's actions to secure the U.S. southern border, claiming to have effectively stopped illegal entry. Trump urged European leaders to take a harder stance, similar to countries like Hungary and Poland, to prevent what he sees as the continent's decline. The comments were made ahead of meetings with UK and EU leaders to discuss trade.</p>

          <p>Two Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee have formally requested that Jeffrey Epstein's estate provide a copy of a "birthday book" compiled for the disgraced financier in 2003. The book allegedly contains a "bawdy" letter signed by President Trump, a claim Trump has denied and for which he is suing the Wall Street Journal. The lawmakers argue the document is relevant to congressional oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation and the Trump administration's selective release of related files.</p>

          <p>Media executive Tom Rogers, once a self-described "raging bull" on Netflix, has tempered his optimism for the streaming giant.

Rogers suggests that AI could be a "double-edged sword," potentially helping Netflix with costs but also empowering amateur creators on YouTube to produce more professional-looking content, further challenging Netflix's engagement metrics.

          <p>For the first time in its 72-year history, the PLA Naval Submarine Academy in China has recruited female students. The 10 women were accepted into the prestigious military institution after achieving top scores on their university entrance exams. The academy, which was founded in 1953, is responsible for training the personnel who operate China's fleet of naval submarines. This historic move marks a significant step in the integration of women into different roles within the Chinese military.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues Epstein Coverage Obscures More Consequential Global Issues</h2>

          <p>A commentary piece argues that the media's intense focus on the Jeffrey Epstein case is overshadowing several stories of far greater long-term importance. The article suggests that while the Epstein saga is compelling, it consumes a finite amount of public attention that could be better spent on other critical issues. It identifies four such topics: America's escalating national debt, a resurgent global hunger crisis, the transformative challenge of declining global fertility rates, and the degradation of U.S. military readiness in the face of new geopolitical threats.</p>

          <p>Gaza hospital officials report that at least 25 Palestinians were killed overnight by Israeli airstrikes and gunfire, with the majority of victims shot while waiting for aid trucks near the Zikim crossing. This incident occurs as ceasefire negotiations have reportedly stalled and the United Nations warns of a growing risk of famine in the territory. The UN and aid groups state that deliveries are severely hampered by Israeli military restrictions and looting, exacerbating a catastrophic humanitarian crisis where people are reportedly dying from malnutrition-related causes.</p>

          <p>Tennis star Venus Williams joked that she returned to competition for the health insurance benefits, a comment that resonated widely and highlighted the precarious link between employment and healthcare in the U.S. The article uses her situation to explain challenges many Americans face, such as the high cost of COBRA after leaving a job and navigating coverage for pre-existing conditions. Williams's need for a "best-in-class" global plan for her autoimmune condition and athletic career underscores the difficulties people with specific health needs encounter within the employer-sponsored system.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has strongly condemned the latest move by Hong Kong authorities to offer cash rewards for information leading to the arrest of pro-democracy activists residing in Britain. In a joint statement, the Foreign and Home Secretaries labeled the bounties an act of "transnational repression" and reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the rights and safety of individuals in the UK. This is the fourth time Hong Kong has issued such rewards for activists abroad, accusing them of violating the national security law imposed by Beijing in 2020.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese voters have rejected a large-scale effort to recall 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT), a result that deals a blow to the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP). The recall was initiated by those angry that the KMT and its allies have blocked key legislation and passed controversial reforms seen as favoring Beijing. The failure of the recall means President Lai Ching-te's administration will likely continue to face a resistant legislature, signaling public fatigue with "anti-China" rhetoric and making it difficult for the DPP to advance its agenda.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's expansive use of tariffs is facing a critical legal test, with a federal appeals court scheduled to hear a case challenging the president's authority. The lawsuit argues that President Trump has exceeded the power granted by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to unilaterally impose duties on other countries. A lower court previously struck down the tariffs, and with multiple similar lawsuits pending, the outcome of this appeal could have major implications for nearly all of Trump's recent trade deals and tariff actions.

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, who died at 76, lived a life of multiple, unexpected acts that defied his "Prince of Darkness" persona. After being fired from Black Sabbath for substance abuse, he launched a massively successful solo career, though his personal struggles continued. He later found a new generation of fans through the MTV reality show "The Osbournes," which recast him as a bumbling but lovable suburban father. As musician Alice Cooper noted, Osbourne was a unique mix of dark performer and court jester, a man who ultimately did not die an ordinary man.</p>

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted Niger's democratically elected president, the country is grappling with worsening economic conditions, ongoing security issues, and a crackdown on civil liberties. The junta, which cited these problems as justification for its takeover, has forced many NGOs to cease operations, leading to job losses and reduced aid. Human rights groups report a significant deterioration in freedom of expression, with arbitrary detentions of opposition figures. With the coup leader now sworn in for a five-year term, prospects for a swift return to civilian rule appear increasingly unlikely.</p>

Studies show that one in five teenagers feels lonely, and sociologists warn this can make them more susceptible to authoritarian thinking and political extremism. The problem is not confined to youth, as other research indicates that middle-aged individuals, particularly those facing unemployment or poverty, also experience high levels of loneliness, highlighting a broader societal challenge.</p>

Several individuals told the BBC that delays to their procedures, including cancer and spinal surgeries, could worsen their conditions, with one patient calling the delay a "death sentence." While the British Medical Association states that striking is a last resort in their pay dispute with the government, affected patients and their families are left in limbo, facing an emotional and physical toll from the disruption to their critical care.</p>
