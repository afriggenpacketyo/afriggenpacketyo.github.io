          <p>Jasveen Sangha, dubbed the "Ketamine Queen," has agreed to plead guilty to five federal charges, including providing the dose of ketamine that led to the death of actor Matthew Perry. Perry, who had publicly struggled with addiction, died from an acute overdose in October 2023, prompting a federal investigation that charged five individuals. Sangha is the final defendant to accept a plea deal, which also covers her involvement in a separate 2019 overdose death and maintaining a drug-involved premises. She is expected to officially enter her plea in the coming weeks and faces a lengthy prison sentence for her role in the drug distribution network.</p>

The couple, first linked in 2023, have kept their relationship relatively private, though Ceretti discussed the challenges of dating a high-profile actor in a recent Vogue France interview. In a separate discussion about aging, DiCaprio remarked that while he is now 50, he feels emotionally like he is 32. He also shared that reaching this milestone has given him a desire to be more honest and upfront in his personal and professional relationships, emphasizing the importance of not wasting time.</p>

          <p>A coalition of twenty states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department over a new rule tying federal grants for crime victims to immigration enforcement cooperation. The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration's condition, which denies funds to programs that don't assist federal immigration agents, is an illegal overreach and part of a broader crackdown on "sanctuary" jurisdictions. These states, which receive over $500 million annually from the Office for Victims of Crime, claim the rule forces them to choose between critical funding for services like emergency shelters and domestic abuse hotlines, or compromising trust with immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added 6,212 new words and phrases, reflecting the growing influence of internet culture on the English language. Among the new entries are terms popularized on social media, such as 'skibidi,' 'delulu,' 'tradwife,' and 'lewk.' 'Skibidi' originated from a viral YouTube series, while 'delulu,' short for delusional, describes someone believing things that are not true. The inclusion of these words highlights how online trends, particularly those popular with Gen Alpha, are having a lasting impact on mainstream communication. A dictionary representative noted that words are only added if they demonstrate significant staying power.</p>

          <p>Labor Day, a federal holiday celebrating the achievements of American workers, will be observed on Monday, September 1, 2025. The holiday originated in the late 19th century from the labor movement's fight for better working conditions and was signed into law in 1894. While government offices, banks, and the USPS will be closed, most major retailers like Target and Walmart, along with grocery stores and fast-food chains, are expected to remain open, though some may have reduced hours. Costco is a notable exception, as it will be closed in observance of the holiday, following its traditional schedule.</p>

          <p>The union representing over 10,000 Air Canada flight attendants is continuing its strike despite a ruling from the Canada Industrial Relations Board (CIRB) declaring the job action unlawful. The strike, now in its third day, has caused the cancellation of hundreds of flights, affecting an estimated 500,000 passengers. The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) stated it will defy the federal back-to-work order, with its president expressing willingness to face penalties including fines or jail time. The dispute centers on demands for higher wages and compensation for unpaid work, such as time spent during boarding, which the union claims the airline's latest offer fails to adequately address.</p>

          <p>An opinion article explores the geopolitical significance of China's proposal to build a new, large-scale embassy at the former Royal Mint site in London. The author argues that such diplomatic buildings are powerful symbols of national prestige and ambition, and China's massive project signals its view of London as a critical global capital. The piece contrasts China's long-term diplomatic investment with the UK's recent trend of selling off prime diplomatic properties for short-term financial gain. While the proposal has faced some local and political opposition citing security concerns, the author suggests it represents a test of Britain's international standing and its complex relationship with a rising China.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of the 2025 season, is projected to bring life-threatening surf and rip currents to the U.S. East Coast this week. Although the storm is not expected to make landfall, its power as a Category 4 hurricane with 140 mph winds is generating dangerous coastal conditions. A storm surge watch has been issued for North Carolina's Outer Banks, where mandatory evacuations were ordered for Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands due to the risk of significant coastal flooding. The National Hurricane Center warns that the storm will remain a powerful major hurricane through mid-week as it moves north between Bermuda and the U.S. coast.</p>

          <p>A long-form essay in The Atlantic posits that the current era of generative AI feels like a collective delusion, characterized by a strange mix of shock, confusion, and ambivalence. The author critiques the breathless hype from Silicon Valley, which promises a world-changing revolution while delivering unsettling products like AI-reanimated murder victims and creating widespread anxiety about job loss. The article suggests that this technology is inducing a kind of societal psychosis, reorienting the global economy around promises that may never materialize.

          <p>A new study from Bankrate indicates that despite wage increases, the average American worker's pay has lagged behind inflation by 1.2 percentage points over the last four years. This gap in purchasing power helps explain persistent public dissatisfaction with the economy, as many households continue to feel financial strain from the rising cost of living. The report highlights that some professions have been hit harder than others, with educators experiencing the largest deficit between income growth and inflation. In contrast, workers in sectors like leisure, hospitality, and healthcare have seen wage gains that outpaced inflation, largely due to post-pandemic demand and labor market dynamics.

The warning follows several enforcement actions over the weekend, including one at a local car wash and another outside a Home Depot, where multiple individuals were detained. Local leaders condemned the raids, stating they destabilize families and the local economy while spreading fear, even among U.S. citizens. The city recently joined a lawsuit challenging federal enforcement tactics, citing concerns over racial profiling and the negative impact on the community, which has a large Latino and immigrant population.</p>

The proposal also includes provisions for negotiations toward a permanent ceasefire to end the 22-month war. It remains unclear how Israel will respond, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously stated he would only accept a deal that releases all hostages at once, while pressure from hostages' families to secure a deal continues to mount.</p>

While Trump committed the U.S. to helping provide security guarantees for Ukraine, he emphasized that European nations would need to bear most of the burden.

Trump's claims are based on persistent, disproven theories of widespread fraud.

This price drop triggered a wave of forced liquidations across the market, totaling over $500 million in the last 24 hours as traders were compelled to sell their long positions.

Diaz, a trailblazer for Latinos in New York media, was remembered as a "reporter's reporter" and a mentor to many during his long career at NBC and CBS News New York. Speakers recalled his professionalism, humanity, and his ability to connect with the city's residents, particularly during his coverage of major events like 9/11. After his career in local news, he dedicated himself to teaching the next generation of journalists, cementing his legacy in the field.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent meeting with President Donald Trump suggests a deliberate shift in diplomatic strategy compared to a contentious visit six months prior. This time, Zelenskyy appeared more collegial, wearing a suit and using humor, which contrasted with the previous encounter where he was criticized for his attire and perceived lack of gratitude. The presence of several European leaders also helped steer the conversation toward substantive issues like security guarantees. This more cautious and charming approach appears to be a lesson learned by Zelenskyy and his team on how to navigate the unpredictable nature of Oval Office meetings with the current administration.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service appeared to suffer its second network outage in two weeks, with thousands of users reporting service interruptions on the tracking site Downdetector. The previous outage on July 24 was attributed to an internal software failure. This recent disruption occurred as SpaceX successfully launched another batch of Starlink satellites from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. The company is currently seeking to double its launch frequency from the base, a plan that has faced opposition from the California Coastal Commission due to concerns about environmental and community impacts.</p>

          <p>Iran is on the brink of a severe water crisis, with officials warning that millions of residents could face water shortages within weeks. The critical situation is the result of a prolonged drought and extreme summer heat, which have been significantly worsened by governmental mismanagement of the country's dams. Water levels have dropped to dangerously low levels, threatening the water supply for a population of ten million people. This looming crisis highlights the combined impact of climate change and inadequate infrastructure planning, posing a serious threat to the well-being of Iranians and the nation's stability.</p>

          <p>Leaked audio recordings have revealed that Israel's former chief of military intelligence, Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, stated that 50,000 deaths in Gaza were a "necessary and required" price for Hamas's October 7th attack. In the remarks, broadcast by Israeli television, Haliva suggested that for every Israeli killed, 50 Palestinians should die, regardless of whether they are children, to send a message to future generations. Haliva, who resigned over intelligence failures leading to the attack, later confirmed the authenticity of the remarks from a private discussion but said they were taken out of context. Human rights groups have condemned the statements as evidence of a deliberate policy of collective punishment.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of Retail Accounting Methods Reveals Potential Distortion of Tariff Impacts</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. tariffs on imported goods take effect, a common accounting practice known as the retail inventory method (RIM) could temporarily distort the reported profitability of major retailers. Used by companies like Walmart and Target, RIM averages costs across broad categories rather than tracking individual item costs, which can initially overstate profitability when product costs rise suddenly. This accounting lag means the full financial impact of the tariffs may not be immediately visible in upcoming earnings reports. While the effect normalizes over time, it creates a misalignment between a company's operational efforts to mitigate costs and its reported financial results during periods of cost volatility.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked more than 6,000 visas for international students due to violations of U.S. law and overstays. According to the department, the majority of revocations were for criminal offenses such as assault, burglary, and driving under the influence, while 200-300 were for activities defined as "support for terrorism." This action is part of the Trump administration's broader crackdown on immigration and follows a policy of enhanced social media screening for visa applicants. Critics, including Democratic lawmakers, have raised concerns that these measures, particularly those targeting student protesters, represent an attack on due process and free speech.</p>

          <p>The new musical "& Juliet" offers a vibrant and empowering alternative to Shakespeare's classic tragedy, built around the hit songs of producer Max Martin. The show's premise has Shakespeare's wife, Anne, intervening to rewrite the ending, allowing Juliet to live and embark on a new life in Paris. The review praises the production for its witty book by David West Read and its energetic direction, which transforms the story into a euphoric dance party. Featuring anthems by artists like Britney Spears and Katy Perry, the musical successfully recontextualizes pop hits to celebrate themes of second chances and self-discovery, led by a powerful performance from Rachel Webb as Juliet.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While there are no strict federal age limits for purchasing annuities, individual insurance companies often set their own caps, typically between 80 and 85 years old for immediate annuities. The timing of an annuity purchase is a critical factor, as it affects both the cost and the potential payout. Financial advisors often suggest considering annuities in one's late 50s or 60s to balance growth potential with favorable rates. Purchasing later in life, such as in one's 70s, can result in higher monthly payments due to shorter life expectancy, but may also limit product availability and increase the risk of being disqualified for health reasons.

          <p>Astronomers are studying 3I/ATLAS, the third-ever observed interstellar object, which is currently hurtling toward the center of our solar system. Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has pointed to Hubble Space Telescope observations showing a glow of light ahead of the object, but no corresponding cometary tail behind it. This has led to the intriguing possibility that the object is generating its own light, rather than just reflecting sunlight. Loeb suggests two potential explanations: it could be a rare radioactive fragment from a supernova, or it could be an artificially powered spacecraft. NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter team has reportedly agreed to attempt to observe the object when it makes a close flyby of Mars this fall.</p>

Authorities accuse him of using his newspaper to advocate for international sanctions against Hong Kong and China. The trial, which has drawn international condemnation and is being heard by three hand-picked national security judges, is seen by critics as a key indicator of the erosion of press freedom and judicial independence in the city.</p>
