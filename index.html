          <p>Senator Jack Reed criticized President Trump's rejection of his own intelligence chief's assessment that Iran isn't currently building nuclear weapons. Reed suggested Trump's stance is politically motivated, possibly to justify a potential attack on Iran. He argued that Trump needs to establish that Iran has the capacity and intent to develop nuclear weapons quickly to support such an action. Reed also noted that if the intelligence chief made a false statement, it should be corrected immediately, regardless of Israeli activity. The senator's remarks highlight growing tensions between the Trump administration and the intelligence community regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance visited Los Angeles as protests continue against the Trump administration's immigration policies. Vance toured a multi-agency Federal Joint Operations Center and a Federal Mobile Command Center, receiving briefings from agencies including the DEA, DHS, and ICE. His visit coincided with clashes between protesters and law enforcement over ICE raids and deportations, a central part of President Trump's agenda. A federal appeals court ruled that Trump can keep the National Guard in Los Angeles to quell the protests, despite Governor Newsom's objections. Vance has previously attacked the protests and called for the passage of a megabill to further secure the border.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced on social media that the United States has launched an attack on three nuclear sites in Iran. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) also reported completing strikes in southwestern Iran, targeting a military site containing missile launchers. These actions come amid escalating tensions between the two nations. The United States appeared to maneuver B-2 stealth bombers and refueling tankers in the Pacific ahead of President Donald Trump's decision on taking action in the conflict with Iran, signaling a potential escalation in the region.</p>

          <p>A yacht carrying approximately 400 people struck a dock on the Hudson River near the Henry Hudson Parkway and West 125th Street in New York City, injuring dozens.

Thirty-five people sustained non-life-threatening injuries, and twenty-two were transported to local hospitals for treatment.

          <p>Texas has enacted a law requiring all public school classrooms to display the Ten Commandments, making it the largest state to impose such a mandate. The law is expected to face legal challenges, with critics arguing it violates the separation of church and state, referencing a similar law in Louisiana that was blocked by a federal appeals court. Supporters of the law claim the Ten Commandments are fundamental to the U.S. judicial and educational systems. Opponents, including faith leaders, argue it infringes on religious freedom, noting the diverse religious backgrounds of Texas students, with the state's nearly 6 million students attending approximately 9,100 public schools.</p>

The government has pledged additional funding to improve access, including online booking and expanded healthcare teams to alleviate pressure on GPs. While this model aims to provide doctors more time for complex cases, the overall situation remains challenging, with record numbers of appointments offered but demand still outpacing capacity.</p>

One statue stood for decades at a McDonald's in the Netherlands before being removed due to controversy, while another resides in a defunct nightclub in Austria.

          <p>Social media is filled with advice on how to lower cortisol levels, a stress hormone, but experts warn against relying on quick fixes. While cortisol is essential for bodily functions, too much can lead to health problems. Many social media hacks, such as cortisol cocktails and supplements, lack scientific evidence and may not address the underlying causes of stress. Therapists and experts recommend addressing the root causes of stress through therapy, mindfulness, and lifestyle changes, cautioning that simplistic solutions can prevent individuals from seeking necessary medical treatment.</p>

          <p>Senator Alex Padilla criticized the Trump administration as "petty and unserious" after Vice President JD Vance referred to him as “Jose” during a press conference. Padilla stated that Vance knows his name, suggesting the misnaming was intentional. Vance's office claimed it was a mistake, attributing it to mixing up individuals who have broken the law. Other California Democrats rallied behind Padilla, with Governor Newsom calling the misidentification intentional. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass highlighted racial undertones in Vance's comments, emphasizing Padilla's significance to the community.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey of the Liberal Democrats has proposed offering new army recruits a £10,000 bonus to address troop shortages, citing concerns over Russian aggression and an unpredictable U.S. president. The plan also includes a £20,000 payment for former armed services personnel who rejoin for two additional years. The proposal aims to increase the number of trained soldiers to over 73,000. Additionally, the Lib Dems suggest distributing pamphlets to British homes to prepare citizens for potential conflicts or cyber-attacks. The scheme's cost would be funded through an increase in the Digital Services Tax.</p>

Kneecap responded by accusing the prime minister of arming a genocide, referencing the ongoing war in Gaza.
