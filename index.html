          <p>The United States and China have announced a 90-day agreement to reduce reciprocal tariffs, marking a significant de-escalation in their trade war. Both countries will lower their tariffs to 10%, with the U.S. also maintaining a 20% duty on Chinese imports related to fentanyl. The agreement follows successful talks in Geneva, where both sides expressed a desire to avoid economic decoupling. The pause is set to begin on Wednesday, with continued discussions planned to address broader economic and trade policies.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is experiencing significant budget and staff cuts, potentially worsening the accuracy of weather forecasts. These forecasts are critical for various sectors, including air travel, farming, and emergency management. Understaffing at the National Weather Service (NWS) has already led to reduced weather balloon launches and less equipment maintenance. With extreme weather events becoming more frequent due to climate change, the cuts threaten the country's ability to prepare for and respond to disasters effectively.</p>

          <p>A recent regulatory change is making it easier for temporary workers in the U.S. to apply for permanent residency. The rule clarifies that workers on temporary visas, such as the H-2B visa, can apply for a green card without jeopardizing their visa status. This change is particularly beneficial in industries like horse racing, where employers are willing to invest in securing reliable, skilled labor. While employers still face costs and a lengthy application process, this pathway offers more stability amid uncertainty about future work visa availability.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party has announced its plans to cut immigration levels into the UK, focusing on a system that is "controlled, selective, and fair." Key measures include tightening visa requirements for some skilled workers while expanding eligibility for others with high potential. Immigrants will generally need to live in the UK for 10 years before applying for permanent residency, with a faster route for high-skilled contributors. The plans also address social care, students, refugee working rights, and English language tests, but do not include an overall cap on net migration.</p>
