          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold over $36 million in company stock as part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March. This sale is one of several, with a larger plan to sell up to six million shares by the end of the year. Huang's personal net worth has surged, placing him in close competition with Warren Buffett, fueled by Nvidia's dominance in the artificial intelligence chip market. The company recently surpassed a $4 trillion market capitalization, highlighting immense investor confidence in its AI-driven growth and technological leadership.</p>

          <p>Comedian Patton Oswalt is releasing an audio-only special titled "Black Coffee and Ice Water," a format he chose out of nostalgia for comedy albums. In a recent interview, he discussed how the material reflects the current "rapidly insane" times and his personal experiences parenting a teenager. Oswalt shared anecdotes about his daughter's reactions to his work and the humorous, relatable dynamic of their family life. The special, which explores his personal confusion and sadness, is set for a November release on Audible.</p>

          <p>The Unite union has voted to suspend the membership of UK Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner amid a protracted dispute over bin strikes in Birmingham. Rayner had encouraged the striking workers, who are Unite members, to accept a deal from the Labour-run city council. The union's move signals a significant public rift with the Labour government, threatening both political and financial ties, as Unite is a major party funder. This conflict is symptomatic of broader union discontent with the government over issues like welfare cuts and workers' rights.</p>

          <p>World Boxing Association lightweight champion Gervonta "Tank" Davis has been arrested in Florida on a domestic violence charge. The arrest stems from an alleged assault on his ex-girlfriend in mid-June during a dispute concerning their two children. According to the police report, Davis is accused of hitting the woman in the back of the head and slapping her in the face, causing a minor injury. This incident adds to Davis's existing legal issues, including a previous domestic battery charge and jail time for a hit-and-run.</p>

A key advantage for these individuals is that Social Security benefits are legally protected from garnishment by most creditors, which can provide significant leverage during negotiations.

          <p>A new analysis ranks the most affordable states in the U.S. for 2025, highlighting places where the cost of living remains lowest.

          <p>A 2025 analysis identifies the most expensive states to live in the U.S., where high costs and inflation continue to heavily impact residents. California is ranked as the most expensive state, followed by Hawaii, Florida, and Colorado. The primary drivers of high costs in these states are housing, with a large percentage of residents spending over a third of their income on it, and soaring homeowners insurance premiums due to climate-related risks. These factors create significant financial burdens for households and challenges for companies trying to attract workers.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's recent flurry of tariff threats against various countries, including a 35% rate for Canada, enduring confusion and uncertainty remain the primary outcomes. While stock markets have largely remained optimistic, some analysts believe the full economic impact has been delayed by front-loading of orders and has yet to be felt. The administration's actions mark a historic shift in U.S. trade policy, potentially raising the effective tariff rate to levels not seen since the 1940s. This unpredictability hinders business investment and complicates global economic forecasts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Virginia has slipped from its number one spot to fourth place in CNBC's annual "Top States for Business" rankings, largely due to the Trump administration's efforts to cut the federal workforce. As a state with a significant number of federal employees and contractors, Virginia's economy is particularly vulnerable to these job cuts. Economists forecast that the state could lose tens of thousands of jobs, with a ripple effect impacting other sectors. Governor Glenn Youngkin insists the state can absorb the losses, pointing to numerous open private-sector jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that the U.S. will impose a 35% tariff on all Canadian imports starting August 1, escalating the ongoing trade dispute. In a letter to Canada's prime minister, Trump cited Canada's retaliatory tariffs and the flow of fentanyl as justifications, warning that the rate could increase if Canada retaliates further. This new general tariff is separate from existing sectoral levies on items like steel, aluminum, and autos. The move creates significant uncertainty for the U.S.-Canada trade relationship and the future of the USMCA trade agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Emergency room visits for tick bites in the U.S. have reached their highest level since 2019, with a notable spike in the Northeast.

Health officials are urging people to take preventative measures, such as using insect repellent and performing thorough tick checks after being outdoors.</p>

          <p>Despite California's status as a sanctuary state for transgender healthcare, major clinics like Children's Hospital Los Angeles are shutting down or pausing services for trans youth.
