          <p>Following Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in Los Angeles, protests erupted, leading to clashes between demonstrators and authorities and the deployment of National Guard troops by President Trump. California Governor Gavin Newsom has called for the withdrawal of the National Guard, denouncing the deployment as inflammatory and a breach of state sovereignty. Demonstrators took to the streets, including blocking the 101 Highway, in response to the ICE operations, which resulted in numerous arrests. Local officials have accused the White House of politicizing the situation, while immigration rights advocates have condemned the actions as fear-mongering. The situation remains tense as both sides dig in on their positions.</p>

          <p>Protests against federal immigration sweeps in Los Angeles escalated, with demonstrators blocking traffic on the 101 freeway, leading to the deployment of the California National Guard. President Trump signed a memorandum to deploy 2,000 National Guardsmen to address the "lawlessness" in California, according to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Governor Gavin Newsom has requested the Trump administration to rescind the deployment, calling it "purposefully inflammatory" and likely to escalate tensions. The protests, which began Friday evening, continued through the weekend, reflecting growing tensions over immigration enforcement operations in the state.</p>

          <p>An aid ship attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip was reportedly boarded by Israeli troops, according to activists. The Freedom Flotilla Coalition stated that communication with the vessel, the Madleen, has been lost, posting a photo purportedly showing activists with their hands up. Climate activist Greta Thunberg is reportedly among those aboard the vessel, which is believed to be off the Egyptian coast. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz had previously ordered the military to prevent the ship from breaking the blockade of Gaza, citing security concerns related to preventing weapons from reaching Hamas.</p>

          <p>Nearly 350,000 nursing staff in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are set to vote on a 3.6% pay increase, with the Royal College of Nursing already dismissing the award as "grotesque." The vote is considered crucial in determining the next steps, which could include a ballot for strike action, following a bitter pay dispute that led to strikes in late 2022 and throughout the winter. The RCN argues that nursing has been placed at the back of the queue regarding pay, leading to pay erosion and increasing numbers of nurses quitting. Resident doctors in England are also being balloted on strike action over pay, casting a shadow over the government's 10-year plan for the NHS in England.</p>

Unlike previous discoveries, the bodies were jumbled, with torsos and heads separated, suggesting hasty burials.

          <p>Former agents from Israel's Mossad shared details of a daring operation in which they built and sold explosive pagers to Hezbollah terrorists. The plot, known as the pager plot, involved Mossad creating booby-trapped pagers and walkie-talkies, which were then sold to Hezbollah through shell companies. The devices were later activated, causing mayhem and casualties among Hezbollah members, weakening the organization. The operation had far-reaching consequences, including aiding in the fall of the Assad regime in Syria and severely impacting Iran's influence in the region.</p>

The government is considering a radical solution: smaller regional markets, with the hope that this could make the system more efficient and deliver cheaper bills.

          <p>During the Emergency in the mid-1970s, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's government quietly explored reimagining India as a centralized state with a presidential system. Historian Srinath Raghavan's new book reveals that Gandhi's aides pushed for a stronger presidency, inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France, to centralize executive power and sideline the judiciary. While the idea never fully materialized, it influenced the Forty-second Amendment Act, which expanded Parliament's powers and limited judicial review. The exploration of a presidential system reflects a desire to move beyond the constraints of parliamentary democracy, though it ultimately did not come to fruition.</p>
