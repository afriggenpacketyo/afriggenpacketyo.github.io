          <p>California Democrats have placed a measure on the ballot that would temporarily bypass the state's independent redistricting commission to create more favorable congressional districts for their party. The ballot's title explicitly names Texas, framing the move as a direct response to Republican gerrymandering efforts in that state, which were initiated at the request of former President Trump. This unusual and overtly partisan approach highlights the escalating national battle over redistricting, with legal experts noting the rarity of a state's ballot measure referencing another state's political actions to justify its own.</p>

          <p>With teenagers increasingly using generative AI tools like ChatGPT for everything from homework to mental health support, experts are urging parents to initiate conversations about the technology's ethical use and potential risks. The article suggests that parents should learn about AI alongside their children, use the tools together to evaluate responses, and teach critical thinking skills like fact-checking. While acknowledging AI's potential as a learning aid, it also highlights dangers, such as chatbots providing unsafe advice on serious mental health issues, underscoring the need for clear household rules and boundaries.</p>

          <p>Small colleges like Roanoke College are reviving their football programs after decades of absence in an effort to increase overall enrollment, particularly among men, whose college attendance rates have been declining. While administrators see an immediate influx of student-athletes and a boost in campus spirit, research indicates these enrollment spikes are often temporary. The trend highlights a broader strategy among educational institutions to attract male students and enhance campus life, even as the long-term effectiveness of using athletics for recruitment remains debated.</p>

The article details a coordinated effort by right-wing activists and some Republican officials to identify and report those expressing criticism or schadenfreude over Kirk's death. This campaign has raised significant free speech concerns, with experts warning against a clampdown on debate over the legacy of a controversial public figure, even as political violence is condemned.</p>

          <p>A powerful earthquake with a magnitude of 7.4 struck off the east coast of Russia’s Kamchatka region early Saturday, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The epicenter was located approximately 112 kilometers east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky at a relatively shallow depth. While the Pacific Tsunami Warning System initially issued a threat, it was later rescinded. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries from the seismic event in the sparsely populated region.</p>

          <p>Voters in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, are participating in local elections that are being viewed as the first major political test for Chancellor Friedrich Merz's coalition government. The results will also gauge the performance of the state's premier, Hendrik Wüst, who is seen as a potential successor to Merz. Opinion polls suggest that the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is poised to make significant gains in some areas, highlighting the ongoing political shifts and challenges within the German electorate.</p>

          <p>It is understood that officials in Downing Street and the Foreign Office were aware of supportive emails between Lord Mandelson and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before Prime Minister Keir Starmer publicly defended the ambassador. Sources indicate the Prime Minister himself was not personally briefed on the emails' contents when he spoke at Prime Minister's Questions. The revelation has led to Lord Mandelson's dismissal and intensified pressure on Starmer over his handling of the appointment and the apparent communication failures within his government.</p>

          <p>The highly anticipated boxing match between Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence "Bud" Crawford has experts offering conflicting predictions for the outcome. One perspective favors Crawford, citing his superior technical skill, adaptability, and a potential decline in Canelo's performance, suggesting he could win on points despite moving up two weight classes. Conversely, the other argument supports Canelo, emphasizing his significant size and power advantage at the 168lb limit and questioning if Crawford can withstand the punishment from a naturally larger, stronger fighter.

The Chinese firms are positioning themselves as tech-focused and affordable alternatives, leveraging an edge in battery technology and production scale to challenge established automakers who are perceived as slower to adapt to the EV transition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US health authorities are growing concerned as Chagas disease, a parasitic illness traditionally found in South America, is spreading within the United States, with cases now reported in at least eight states. Transmitted by the feces of the "kissing bug," the disease can lead to serious, life-threatening heart and digestive problems years after the initial infection. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is considering reclassifying the disease as endemic, which would shift its status from an imported tropical illness to a permanent domestic health risk requiring enhanced monitoring and public awareness.</p>

          <p>The UCLA Bruins' football season has reached a new low following a decisive 35-10 home loss to New Mexico, a team from the Mountain West Conference. Now 0-3 for the first time since 2019, the Bruins have yet to hold a lead in any game this season and were thoroughly outplayed on both offense and defense. The disappointing performance raises serious questions for second-year coach DeShaun Foster, as the team has been outscored 108-43 and continues to be plagued by penalties and a lack of execution heading into its Big Ten conference schedule.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to order an airstrike targeting senior Hamas leaders in Qatar appears to have been a significant miscalculation. While intended to pressure the group and project an image of "total victory," the mission reportedly failed to kill its main targets while enraging the key mediator, Qatar. The strike has drawn widespread international criticism, strained relations with the United States, and thrown fragile ceasefire and hostage negotiations into disarray, undermining Israel's diplomatic standing without achieving its primary military objective.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' recent momentum was halted in a frustrating 5-1 extra-innings loss to the San Francisco Giants.

The game ended in the 10th inning when embattled closer Tanner Scott gave up a walk-off grand slam, highlighting the team's ongoing struggles with inconsistent hitting and late-game collapses.</p>

Bane reported her missing hours later, suggesting she fell overboard, but his timeline contains inconsistencies and his refusal to allow a full search of his yacht has fueled suspicion, leaving her family without answers.</p>

          <p>This article provides a detailed timeline of the Karen Read murder case, from the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, in January 2022, through two lengthy trials. Read was accused of hitting O'Keefe with her SUV, but her defense argued she was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving other individuals at a house party. After her first trial ended in a hung jury, a second trial concluded in June 2025 with an acquittal on the most serious charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter, though she was convicted of DUI.</p>
