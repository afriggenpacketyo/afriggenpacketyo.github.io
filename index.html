          <p>The U.S. government has entered its second day of a shutdown, with live updates detailing the ongoing funding impasse. The deadlock stems from partisan disputes over federal spending and Democratic demands for healthcare tax credit extensions. This situation affects numerous federal agencies and employees, creating uncertainty and potential disruptions to public services. The lack of a budget agreement highlights deep divisions within Congress.</p>

          <p>Eight men, including Raja Zulqurnean, have been found guilty of sexual offences against a girl who was groomed from age 13, including an Islamic wedding ceremony when she was 15. The victim experienced sexual assault and abuse while in a Bradford children's home, with social workers reportedly present at the "wedding" despite exploitation concerns. Zulqurnean was jailed for 23 years for multiple sexual assaults. This case highlights an "institutional scandal" where systems meant to protect the victim enabled her abuse.</p>

          <p>Hungary's ruling Fidesz party, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has historically outspent all opposition parties combined on social media political advertising. With platforms introducing ad bans, Fidesz is shifting strategy towards online activism, recruiting "digital freedom fighters" to spread its message. This comes as challenger Peter Magyar gains significant organic reach and popularity, topping polls and integrating opposition groups. The article suggests Orban's virtual strategy faces challenges from Magyar's strong physical presence and grassroots mobilization.</p>

          <p>U.S. hiring rates have fallen to their lowest level since 2009, with September data showing a significant slowdown. This economic downturn coincides with the government shutdown, which has halted the release of official labor market statistics. Economists are now relying on alternative data sources, such as the Chicago Federal Reserve's indicators and reports from outplacement firms, to gauge the health of the job market. Announced layoffs for 2025 are already 24% higher than all of 2024, signaling a challenging period for employment. (not investment advice)</p>

The incident occurred at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue, an area with a large Jewish community. Police responded swiftly, shooting and killing the suspect who was attempting to enter the building with a knife. Three other individuals remain in serious condition, and authorities have declared a major incident, deploying additional police assets to synagogues nationwide.</p>

          <p>Current average mortgage and refinance interest rates are higher than in previous years, with 30-year mortgages at 6.27% and 30-year refinances at 6.61% as of October 1, 2025. Despite these elevated rates, borrowers with strong credit profiles can still secure favorable terms. Experts suggest that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could stabilize mortgage rates. The article advises comparing lenders, strengthening credit scores, and considering loan terms and fees to find the best options. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Denmark's tax authority, Skat, lost a significant £1.4 billion tax fraud case in the UK High Court, related to "cum-ex schemes." The court ruled that Skat was not misled into making the false tax rebates, citing "flimsy" and "almost non-existent" controls for assessing claims. While the main defendant, Sanjay Shah, was previously jailed in Denmark for fraud, the UK judge found insufficient evidence to prove Skat's case.

Once an adoption is finalized, adoptive parents hold legal control, and post-placement contact agreements are not court-enforceable in about half of U.S. states. The narrative emphasizes the need for stronger legal protections and better support for birth parents.</p>

Douglas compares Comey's situation to Hans Litten, a German attorney persecuted by Hitler for upholding the law. The article highlights the flimsy nature of the case, the resignation of a prosecutor who balked at charges, and the appointment of a Trump loyalist. It suggests the indictment is a "score-settling" attempt to punish Comey for prioritizing the law over loyalty to the president.</p>

However, the piece critiques the tendency within this culture to overgeneralize the wisdom gained from fighting to all aspects of life, dismissing compromise and self-doubt. It suggests that while fighting offers valuable lessons about self-awareness, its ethos can be counterproductive outside the gym or battlefield, particularly in a healthy republic.</p>
