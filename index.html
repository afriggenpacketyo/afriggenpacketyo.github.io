          <p>Mexico has initiated a lawsuit against Google following the tech giant's decision to label the Gulf of Mexico as the 'Gulf of America' on its maps platform after an executive order from the Trump administration. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced the lawsuit, highlighting Mexico's Foreign Relations Ministry's prior attempts to persuade Google against the name change. The dispute centers on the application of the 'Gulf of America' label, which Mexico argues should only apply to the portion over the U.S. continental shelf, while Google defends its policy of aligning with official local names, as the legislation now heads to the Senate. This article describes the events which led to the filing of the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani's three-run homer in the ninth inning secured a dramatic 14-11 victory for the Dodgers over the Arizona Diamondbacks, highlighting a game filled with lead changes and offensive firepower.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labour Party, led by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, is expected to introduce new immigration policies aimed at reducing the UK's net migration, which stood at 728,000 last year. The anticipated changes include requiring employers to invest in UK skills before hiring overseas workers, potentially targeting the IT and telecommunications sectors. Visa restrictions may be imposed on nationalities with higher rates of overstaying and asylum claims, while migrants may need to wait longer for permanent residency. Additionally, the white paper is expected to include tougher English language requirements for immigrants, and will highlight rules on the recruitment of international care workers.</p>

          <p>Newly released records detail the corruption case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, which was ultimately dismissed after intervention from the Trump administration. Federal prosecutors secured an indictment against Adams on five counts, including bribery and fraud, but the Trump administration ordered the case to be dropped. The documents reveal investigators considered seizing Adams' electronic devices and that he was investigated for witness tampering. The dismissal occurred after Adams allegedly agreed to cooperate with President Trump's deportation agenda, prompting criticism of a potential quid pro quo, though Adams maintains his innocence.</p>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the US, has described the recent UK-US trade deal as a 'platform for going further' in opening up trade opportunities between the two nations.

While discussions on the UK's Digital Services Tax (DST) are ongoing, Mandelson clarified that abolishing the DST was not part of the current deal. He also noted the positive reception from other ambassadors in Washington and highlighted the strong working relationship between Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are meeting with Chinese officials in Geneva to address escalating trade tensions.

While expectations for a major breakthrough are low, there is hope for a reduction in tariffs, potentially easing the burden on financial markets and companies dependent on U.S.-China trade.

          <p>Pakistan has accused India of launching missile strikes on three of its air bases, claiming most were intercepted, and has initiated retaliatory strikes targeting Indian missile storage and air bases. The escalation follows a recent attack in India-controlled Kashmir, for which India blames Pakistan, a charge Islamabad denies. Amidst rising tensions, the U.S. Secretary of State urged both nations to de-escalate and offered assistance for constructive talks. The military actions have led to airport closures in Pakistan and reports of explosions in Indian-controlled Kashmir, raising concerns about a potential war between the nuclear-armed rivals.</p>

The order calls for deputizing state and local law enforcement, former federal officers, and other individuals, though funding for this effort remains unclear. The Trump administration has also been promoting 'self-deportation,' offering migrants financial assistance to leave the country voluntarily under 'Project Homecoming'.

          <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te marked the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe, a move seen as a symbolic stance against Beijing's growing military pressure. However, Lai's speech has drawn criticism for allegedly ignoring Japanâ€™s wartime atrocities and minimizing the role of the Republic of China in the Allied victory. Lai warned of a 'new authoritarian bloc' threatening global stability, urging democratic nations to unite against modern threats.</p>

          <p>The UK steel industry has welcomed the lifting of 25 percent tariffs on steel exports to the United States, a move that provides some relief for struggling businesses. However, uncertainties remain regarding the implications for products processed in the European Union and the overall stability of trade relations. While the agreement is seen as positive, company officials express concerns about the Trump administration's unpredictable trade policies and the need for long-term stability. The UK steel industry has been grappling with weak demand, competition, and high costs, making tariff relief a crucial development.</p>

          <p>Amidst escalating trade tensions and high tariffs imposed by President Trump, Chinese companies are increasingly shifting manufacturing operations to Vietnam. The move aims to circumvent tariffs and maintain access to the U.S. market, with e-commerce platforms like Alibaba and Shein facilitating the transition. While Vietnam offers advantages such as a shared border and a young workforce, challenges remain, including potential scrutiny from U.S. officials concerned about tariff evasion. Some Chinese companies are also exploring strategies to conceal the origin of their products by rerouting them through other countries.</p>

          <p>A judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from implementing sweeping cuts and layoffs at over a dozen government agencies, as part of a federal cost-cutting initiative led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled that the plaintiffs, a group of federal employee unions, are likely to prove that the Trump administration's attempts to reorganize and downsize the federal government exceed its legal authority. The restraining order will remain in effect for at least 14 days, while the judge considers the case.</p>

          <p>China reported a drop in consumer prices in April, adding to concerns about deflation amidst the ongoing trade war with the United States. The national consumer price index (CPI) edged down by 0.1 per cent year on year, reflecting the impact of high tariffs on bilateral trade. While negotiations with the United States may ease tensions, the tariffs remain a significant barrier, leaving Chinese manufacturers with unsold goods and contributing to deflationary pressures. The price of food declined, while prices for other goods and services increased slightly.</p>
