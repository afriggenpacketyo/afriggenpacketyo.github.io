          <p>China has accused the United States of undermining preliminary trade agreements by issuing an industry warning against using Chinese chips, particularly those from Huawei. A spokesperson for China's Commerce ministry called the U.S. Commerce Department's guidance "discriminatory" and "market distorting," demanding that the U.S. correct its mistakes. China warned that it would take resolute measures to protect its interests if the U.S. continues to damage them. This dispute follows high-level talks in Geneva where both countries agreed to a 90-day pause on tariffs, which could be reinstated if a broader deal is not reached.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been actively working to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine, engaging in phone calls with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and other European leaders.

Trump has expressed frustration with both sides of the conflict. European leaders have urged Trump to join them in imposing further sanctions on Russia if he cannot broker a ceasefire, though analysts suggest Russia believes time is on its side.</p>

          <p>Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, has issued a warning that Moody's downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating understates the actual threat to U.S. Treasuries. Dalio argues that Moody's doesn't account for the risk of the government printing money to cover its debts, which would devalue bondholder returns. Moody's recently cut the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing growing budget deficits and increasing interest payments. U.S. stocks declined as Treasury yields rose in response to the downgrade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel is navigating a complex strategy in Gaza, balancing pressure on Hamas with the need to address humanitarian concerns and maintain international support. The government reversed its two-month blockade by allowing limited aid into Gaza, while also escalating military actions. This reflects internal disagreements over national priorities, with Prime Minister Netanyahu balancing right-wing allies who oppose aid with foreign allies concerned about famine. The equivocation over a ground invasion also highlights the tension between far-right ministers pushing for re-occupation and military leaders wary of its sustainability and dangers to hostages.</p>

          <p>Lenders tend to offer differing rates for home equity loans and HELOCs, with home equity loans typically featuring higher, fixed rates, while HELOCs offer lower variable rates. The difference is due to the flexible draw periods enable lower initial HELOC rates, and the ongoing borrowing risk into variable rate structures. Flexible access: A HELOC lets you borrow as needed â€” much like a credit card â€” and offers flexibility for ongoing expenses. Potential tax benefits: According to Glick, those who finance home improvements with equity products may qualify for tax deductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has called for Israel's exclusion from international cultural events, such as the Eurovision song contest, due to its military campaign in Gaza, drawing a parallel to Russia's exclusion after its invasion of Ukraine. Sanchez criticized what he sees as double standards and urged artists to stand up for values like democracy and peace. This comes amid ongoing controversy surrounding Israel's participation in Eurovision and calls from pro-Palestinian groups for its exclusion. More than 53,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to local health officials, in Israel's offensive since a cross-border Hamas militant attack in October 2023 that killed around 1,200 people.</p>
