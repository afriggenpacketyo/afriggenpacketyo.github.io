          <p>During a match against Dundee Utd, Aberdeen player Jack MacKenzie was injured by an object thrown by his own fans, leading to a police investigation. MacKenzie required medical treatment and stitches, prompting strong condemnation from his manager, who described the incident as a disgrace. Police Scotland is appealing for information to identify the individual responsible for the act. The SPFL criticized the "moronic behaviour" that marred what should have been an exciting game, emphasizing that such actions will not be tolerated and severe sanctions are expected.</p>

          <p>The New York Times article reports that the Democratic Party in Arizona is facing significant challenges as it prepares for the 2026 elections, particularly concerning the re-election prospects of Governor Katie Hobbs. Hobbs, considered one of the most vulnerable Democratic governors, faces a tough race in a state with a Republican advantage and the potential for a strong GOP opponent like Andy Biggs or Karrin Taylor Robson. The state party is also dealing with internal strife, including a feud between the state Democratic chairman and Arizona's Democratic senators, creating further obstacles for Hobbs as she seeks to consolidate support and appeal to moderate voters.</p>

          <p>A new round of ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas has begun in Doha, mediated by Qatari and US officials, following a major Israeli offensive in Gaza. The offensive, named "Operation Gideon's Chariots," has resulted in hundreds of Palestinian deaths, prompting international condemnation and warnings of a worsening humanitarian crisis. The talks aim to secure the release of remaining hostages in exchange for a period of calm, but significant obstacles remain, including Israel's insistence on dismantling Hamas and maintaining its blockade of Gaza, while Hamas seeks an end to the war.

          <p>The United Arab Emirates is significantly increasing its investment and influence in Africa as the United States and China reduce their presence on the continent, according to this New York Times article. Emirati firms are investing heavily in key sectors such as ports, mines, and renewable energy projects, with announced deals totaling $110 billion since 2019. This strategic move is part of the UAE's broader plan to diversify its economy away from fossil fuels and enhance its control over global supply chains, particularly in light of reduced investment from China and a shift away from development aid by the U.S. and Britain.</p>

          <p>A Russian drone attack killed at least nine civilians in the Sumy region of Ukraine, hours after the first face-to-face talks between Ukrainian and Russian delegations in over three years. The strike, which hit a shuttle bus, was condemned by President Zelensky as a deliberate attack on civilians, who believes that peace will only come when Putin is forced to negotiate. Despite the recent diplomatic activity, the conflict continues with daily casualties, and international pressure is mounting for stronger sanctions against Russia.

          <h2>FA Cup Final Incident Sparks Debate Over Red Card Decision</h2>

          <p>Crystal Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson was central to a debate during the FA Cup final against Manchester City, after he handled the ball outside of the box. While Henderson made crucial saves to help Palace win, his handball raised questions about whether he should have been sent off, potentially altering the game's outcome. The VAR reviewed the incident but decided not to issue a red card, explaining that Haaland's direction did not constitute a clear goal-scoring opportunity. Former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney strongly disagreed, calling it "100% a red card."</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart for warning that prices on various goods would increase due to tariffs imposed by his administration. Trump insisted that Walmart, which made billions in profits, should "eat the tariffs" instead of passing the costs on to consumers. A Walmart spokesperson responded that the company is committed to keeping prices as low as possible, but there are limits to what they can absorb given retail margins. This exchange highlights the growing tension between the administration's trade policies and the impact on American businesses and consumers.</p>
