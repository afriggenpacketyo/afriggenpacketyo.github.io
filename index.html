          <p>Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York mayoral primary has exposed a deep rift within the Democratic party. Moderate Democrats and business leaders are now scrambling to find a viable challenger for the November general election, with some considering backing independent candidates to oppose him. In contrast, progressive figures like former Mayor Bill de Blasio argue the win legitimizes Mamdani's platform, reflecting the majority's will. Mamdani himself is engaging with all factions, including concerned business executives, aiming to unite the city under his vision for affordability and safety.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has declared that reforming the country's "broken" benefits system is a moral necessity, following a rebellion from his own party that forced a U-turn on planned welfare cuts. Speaking at a Labour conference, he asserted the need to fix a system that is "failing people" without removing the essential safety net for the vulnerable. The government has already conceded on some reforms to disability payments, but internal dissent remains, with some MPs and unions demanding the entire proposal be scrapped.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that military conflicts, like the recent fictional U.S. strikes on Iran, inevitably dominate the media landscape, often to the political benefit of the sitting president. The author, Margaret Sullivan, notes that this intense focus pushes other vital domestic issues, such as gun violence or threats to democracy, out of the news cycle. While acknowledging the importance of covering foreign policy, the piece suggests that the media's tendency to be captivated by war can distort public priorities. It draws a parallel to the "yellow journalism" era, where conflict was used to capture public attention.</p>

          <p>In a historic reversal of its post-World War II pacifist stance, Germany is planning a massive military expansion, aiming to create the strongest armed forces in Europe. Spurred by a new Trump presidency and security concerns in Europe, the German government will increase defense spending to 3.5% of its GDP, funded by a special constitutional change. This major policy shift reflects a new sense of urgency and is intended to meet the demands of its NATO partners. The move signals a profound change in Germany's national identity and its role in global security.</p>

          <p>Despite being a deep-red state that overwhelmingly supports Donald Trump, Kentucky has become a hub of GOP opposition to the president's agenda. Senators Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, along with Representative Thomas Massie, frequently challenge Trump on issues ranging from war powers and tariffs to deficit spending. This has created a rift with Trump's loyal base in the state, who feel their influential lawmakers are out of step. The article explores the unique, independent streak in Kentucky's politics that allows these figures to maintain their positions while openly defying the party's leader.</p>

The law generally forbids the use of the military for civilian law enforcement, a principle rooted in colonial-era fears of standing armies.

The author criticizes the "respectability politics" that seeks mainstream acceptance by policing the community's own members. The article asserts that progress has always been driven by the most marginalized, from the drag queens at the Stonewall Riots to other gender-nonconforming pioneers.
