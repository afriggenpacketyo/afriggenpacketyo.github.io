            <p>Universal is planning a new theme park near Bedford, UK, slated to open in 2031, with construction beginning soon on the 476-acre site. The park is expected to feature immersive rides and attractions based on popular franchises like James Bond, Paddington, and The Lord of the Rings. Experts emphasize the importance of storytelling in ride design, citing the Harry Potter-themed rollercoaster at Universal Orlando as an example of immersive experience. Theme park designers consider guest flow and layout, often incorporating a central lake or a 'hub and spoke' design to manage crowds effectively and enhance the overall visitor experience.</p>

            <p>Weezer's Coachella performance drew extra attention following an incident involving bassist Scott Shriner's wife, Jillian, who was shot by police after a manhunt. Shriner was found with a handgun and allegedly fired at police, leading to her arrest for attempted murder, but she has since been released on bond. Despite the personal turmoil, Weezer took the stage and delivered a set filled with classic hits like 'Hash Pipe,' 'The Sweater Song,' and 'Buddy Holly,' with frontman Rivers Cuomo showing support for Shriner during the performance. The band made no direct reference to the incident, focusing instead on providing a high-energy show for the Coachella crowd.</p>

            <p>The UK government swiftly passed emergency legislation to take control of British Steel's Scunthorpe plant to prevent its closure after the Chinese-owned company, Jingye, sought to sell off raw materials. Government officials waited in a nearby hotel for Royal Assent to finalize the law and allow them to enter the plant, amid concerns about potential unrest among the workforce, which is composed of both Chinese and British employees. The government has hired EY to assist with a new management structure and hopes to secure necessary raw materials to keep the blast furnaces operational, but nationalization remains a likely outcome. Securing these materials involves complex international supply chains and trade challenges, making this intervention a temporary measure.</p>

            <p>The State Department confirmed that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man wrongly deported to El Salvador, is alive and secure but detained in the Terrorism Confinement Center.

President Trump stated that El Salvador's President Bukele accepted custody of violent alien enemies of the U.S., though he did not specifically mention Abrego Garcia. Abrego Garcia's attorneys are seeking additional relief, including air transportation back to Maryland and parole, citing Trump's acknowledgement of the U.S.'s power to bring him back.</p>

            <p>President Trump is advocating for Congress to pass legislation that would make daylight saving time permanent, ending the biannual clock changes in the United States. This follows ongoing efforts in Congress, including the Sunshine Protection Act, to adopt daylight saving time. While Trump previously expressed mixed feelings, he now calls for more daylight at the end of the day, citing the inconvenience and cost of changing clocks. The issue was debated in a Senate hearing, with some senators arguing against the practice due to its negative impact on health and productivity, while medical experts debate the benefits of permanent standard time versus daylight saving time.</p>

            <p>Bangladesh's interim leader Muhammad Yunus concluded a visit to China, marking his first state visit since assuming office. Beijing committed to US$2.1 billion in investments, loans and grants, including US$400 million to modernize Mongla Port and US$350 million to develop an industrial zone. Yunus also sought Chinese support to advance Bangladeshâ€™s textile, pharmaceutical and renewable energy sectors. Yunusâ€™ visit may be seen as a pivot towards Beijing in a bid to escape Indiaâ€™s foreign policy grip and draw closer to Southeast Asia and the rest of the Indo-Pacific.</p>

Norris admitted he felt "clueless" and struggled to find his rhythm throughout the weekend, unable to capitalize on the car's strong performance. McLaren team principal Andrea Stella attributed Norris's struggles to a recurring issue in qualifying, where he has difficulty extracting the maximum performance from the car due to certain handling characteristics.
