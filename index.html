          <p>Iowa state Representative J.D. Scholten has announced his candidacy to challenge Republican Senator Joni Ernst in 2026, spurred by Ernst's controversial remarks regarding potential Medicaid cuts. Ernst had responded to concerns about Republican Medicaid cuts by stating, "Well, we're all going to die," which Scholten cited as a key motivator for his run. Scholten, a former congressional candidate and professional baseball player, aims to make the race a referendum on President Trump's trade policies, particularly their impact on Iowa soybean farmers. While some of Iowa's House seats are considered competitive, Democrats have not won a Senate race in the state since 2008.</p>

          <p>A private survey revealed that China's manufacturing activity unexpectedly contracted in May, marking the fastest decline since September 2022. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell below 50, indicating a contraction for the first time in eight months, driven by a sharp decrease in new export orders. This contraction highlights the impact of prohibitive US tariffs on Chinese manufacturing, leading to a decline in foreign demand and overall new orders. The job market also experienced a contraction, with employment shrinking at the fastest rate since January, exacerbating concerns about economic headwinds facing China's manufacturing sector.

          <p>A former Taiwanese defense official, Andrew Yang Nien-dzu, has warned of the increasing risk of a military accident in the Taiwan Strait due to Beijing's escalating pressure on Taiwan. Yang cited the lack of direct communication channels between the two sides and the increasing "grey zone operations" by Beijing, such as frequent coastguard activities near Taiwan. These activities, while not military operations, carry a military message and place immense pressure on Taiwan. Exchanges between Beijing and Taipei have been suspended since 2016, further complicating communication efforts.</p>
