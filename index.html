          <p>Axios released audio excerpts from Joe Biden's 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur, which led to a report describing Biden as an elderly man with a poor memory. The audio reveals Biden struggling to recall dates, including the year of his son Beau's death and Trump's first election. While a transcript was previously released, the audio provides additional context regarding Biden's demeanor and memory issues during the session. The release of the audio has renewed concerns about Biden's cognitive abilities, particularly after his withdrawal from the presidential race following a rocky debate performance, with some books describing his aides' efforts to manage perceptions of his age.</p>

          <p>A proposed bill to fund President Trump's agenda includes significant Medicaid cuts, raising concerns among disabled and low-income Americans who rely on the program for healthcare. An analysis estimates that these cuts could leave millions without health insurance by 2034. While some Republicans argue the cuts aim to eliminate fraud without affecting necessary coverage, many Medicaid recipients worry about reduced access to care or having to choose between healthcare and basic needs. The bill also proposes work requirements for able-bodied recipients, which could jeopardize care for those with substance use disorders or other challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area as high winds swept across dry farmlands, creating a wall of dust that significantly reduced visibility. The National Weather Service reported near-zero visibility on major interstates, causing travel disruptions and airport ground stops. Showers mixed with the dust, leading to reports of "mud rain" in some areas. Cooler, drier weather is expected over the weekend, followed by a return to a rainy pattern next week, but the most significant storm threat remains east of I-55.</p>

The defense attempted to portray Ventura as a willing participant, presenting texts and emails showing her agreement to sexual encounters. Ventura maintained she was coerced and would trade the money for a life free of the "freak offs," which she said caused physical injuries and stifled her career.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is considering closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture as part of its restructuring plans, following a significant net loss for fiscal year 2024. The potential closures include the Oppama plant, which pioneered electric vehicle production, and the Shonan plant of Nissan Shatai Co. These plants represent a substantial portion of Nissan's domestic production capacity. The decision remains uncertain as the company has yet to consult with labor unions, parts makers, and local municipalities. This move is part of a broader strategy to reduce global production capacity and workforce to return to profitability by fiscal year 2026.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is preparing for a potential influx of mainland Chinese companies seeking to list on its stock exchange, prompted by the threat of delisting from US exchanges. The US government has not ruled out delisting Chinese stocks, leading to concerns about decoupling amid a US-China tariff war. Deloitte China has submitted proposals to Hong Kong's Chief Executive's Policy Unit, outlining strategies to simplify listing procedures and secure funding for these companies. This move aims to bolster Hong Kong's financial preparedness and attract companies seeking alternative listing venues.</p>

          <p>Chinese defense scientists are developing a guided munition called Tianxing-1, or "Sky Star-1," to transform traditional rocket artillery into a system capable of striking aerial targets. The rocket features lift-enhancing wings and adjustable tail fins for extended range and powerless-flight maneuverability. Launched from ground-based platforms, the rocket transitions into a glide phase, autonomously adjusting its trajectory to engage targets. While operating on principles similar to hypersonic glide missiles, the Tianxing-1 travels at a slower pace, potentially struggling to chase high-speed aircraft or drones.</p>

          <p>Audio recordings from Joe Biden's 2023 interview with a Justice Department investigator reveal memory lapses, supporting claims made in a special counsel report describing him as an elderly man with a poor memory. In the audio, Biden struggles to recall key milestones, such as the year he left office and the date of his son Beau's death. The Biden administration had previously resisted releasing the audio, but the Trump administration has been planning to release the full interview. This comes as a new book alleges the White House covered up Biden's condition, claiming it was so poor that aides discussed putting him in a wheelchair.</p>
