          <p>Wegovy manufacturer Novo Nordisk is intensifying its direct-to-consumer sales strategy to counter competition from copycat drugs and address U.S. demands for lower prices. The company's cash channel allows patients to buy weight-loss treatments at a significantly reduced cost, a move seen as a response to President Trump's ultimatum for lower drug prices. While facing a profit warning due to "unsafe and unlawful" compounding, the company sees the cash channel as key to regaining market share and meeting patient needs. The CFO noted ongoing discussions with the administration about broader drug pricing policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iran is facing an extreme water crisis, with a severe heatwave and the lowest rainfall in 60 years depleting reservoirs, particularly around the capital, Tehran. Authorities have closed public offices to conserve power, as temperatures are forecast to reach 50°C (122°F). Experts warn that decades of resource mismanagement and over-consumption have led to this point, with 80% of the country's reservoirs nearly empty. President Masoud Pezeshkian has cautioned that Tehran could face severe water shortages by September if consumption is not controlled, highlighting a long-predicted environmental emergency.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin held a three-hour meeting with Steve Witkoff, President Trump's special envoy, in Moscow. The talks occurred just days before a White House deadline for Russia to agree to a peace deal to end the war in Ukraine or face severe economic penalties. The U.S. has threatened "severe tariffs" on nations buying Russian oil if progress is not made, a response to Russia's escalating strikes on civilian areas. Despite the diplomatic pressure, analysts believe Putin is stalling for time and has shown no indication of making concessions.</p>

          <p>A massive wildfire in the Aude region of southern France has resulted in the death of an elderly woman, with another person reported missing. The blaze, the largest in France this year, has burned over 13,000 hectares, destroyed at least 25 homes, and forced thousands to evacuate. Over 1,800 firefighters are battling the rapidly advancing fire, which is fueled by strong winds and dry conditions exacerbated by climate change. Officials have warned that the fire will likely take several days to control, calling it a "disaster of unprecedented scale."</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, although revenue was slightly below projections. Growth was primarily driven by the company's streaming services and its experiences segment, which includes theme parks and resorts. The streaming business, anchored by Disney+, showed continued subscriber growth, helping to offset the ongoing decline in traditional television revenue. The company also raised its full-year earnings guidance, signaling confidence despite headwinds in its linear TV and film divisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Representative Kevin Kiley (R-Calif.) has introduced a bill aimed at preventing states from redrawing their congressional district maps before the 2030 census. The move is a response to a burgeoning nationwide "redistricting war," sparked by a Republican push in Texas and a retaliatory effort by Democrats in California. Kiley argues that constant mid-decade redistricting creates "total chaos" and instability for both voters and representatives, regardless of party. He is urging House Speaker Mike Johnson to support the legislation to end the partisan battle over congressional maps.</p>

With most spending fixed, the main lever left for the government appears to be tax increases, despite promises not to change main rates.

The club has also freed up significant funds by offloading Marcus Rashford's large salary in a loan deal and receiving payments from sell-on clauses for former players. While co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe warned of financial troubles, the club's powerful commercial brand and projected profits provide the necessary flexibility for major signings.</p>

          <p>ESPN has signed a five-year deal, reportedly worth an average of $325 million annually, to become the exclusive U.S. home for WWE's premium live events starting in 2026. This includes flagship events like WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, which will stream on ESPN's new direct-to-consumer platform. The deal marks a significant increase from the previous rights holder and represents a strategic move for both companies. ESPN aims to expand its audience to a younger, more diverse demographic, while WWE gains a powerful partner to grow its national scale.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., announced the termination of 22 federal contracts for mRNA-based vaccine research, totaling nearly $500 million. Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic, stated that HHS determined the technology "poses more risk than benefits" for respiratory viruses, a claim disputed by many infectious disease experts. The move, which affects projects from companies like Pfizer and Moderna, was criticized by scientists who credit mRNA technology with saving millions of lives and view it as crucial for future pandemic preparedness.</p>

          <p>South Korea is introducing a temporary visa-waiver program for Chinese tour groups in an effort to boost tourism and improve bilateral relations. The program will run from September 29 of this year until June 30 of the next, allowing members of organized tours to enter the country without a visa. This move follows a similar unilateral visa-free policy from Beijing for South Korean visitors. Officials hope the initiative will revitalize regional economies and increase domestic consumption, building on the trend of Chinese nationals being the largest group of overseas tourists.</p>

Aid advocates argue that cash transfers are an efficient and empowering way to fight poverty, with hundreds of studies showing positive outcomes. They are now making their case to lawmakers.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. marks the 60th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act (VRA), the landmark civil rights law faces significant challenges that threaten its core protections. The article details how court decisions, such as the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder case that weakened federal oversight of election changes, have eroded the law's power. Current legal battles, including a case from Louisiana before the Supreme Court and partisan redistricting fights in states like Texas, continue to test the VRA's remaining provisions.

          <p>A new FBI report shows that crime rates in the United States decreased in 2024, challenging the narrative of an out-of-control crime wave used during the presidential election campaign. The data reveals a 4.5% drop in overall violent crime, with murders falling by 14.5% to levels not seen since before the pandemic. The report, based on data from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, indicates that both violent and property crime rates were at their lowest levels since the 1960s.

The watchdog ruled that the ad, which featured the headline "Always Got Your Back," implied that alcohol could be a solution for overcoming boredom, frustration, and loneliness. The ad compared life's frustrations, like Wi-Fi failing or a friend being late, to the reliability of its beer. Despite BrewDog's argument that the ad was about reliable quality, the ASA concluded it breached the advertising code and ordered that it must not appear again.</p>
