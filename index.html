The company's net income saw a significant boost from the sale of its Hulu stake to Disney, though it also experienced a loss of 226,000 broadband customers. This decline in broadband is an ongoing industry challenge, which Comcast is attempting to counter by pivoting its market strategy and focusing on growth in its mobile division, which added a record 378,000 new lines.

          <p>A petition filed in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court alleges that Washington County District Attorney Jason Walsh pressured his county's coroner to rule an infant's 2022 death a homicide to bolster his tough-on-crime image for an election. The coroner claims Walsh stated, "I need this to be a homicide. I need it to win an election." This case raises serious questions about prosecutorial misconduct and the political exploitation of the death penalty, particularly as it involves the scientifically debated diagnosis of shaken-baby syndrome.

          <p>A fact-check by DW highlights a stark contradiction between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's assertion that "there is no starvation in Gaza" and reports from humanitarian organizations. Global hunger monitors like the IPC have warned that famine thresholds have already been surpassed in parts of the enclave, with the World Health Organization reporting dozens of malnutrition-related deaths in July alone. The article examines the information war surrounding the crisis, including Israeli officials' counterclaims and attempts to discredit photographic evidence of emaciated children. </p>

          <p>While health experts agree with the central claim by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that American children are experiencing rising rates of chronic conditions, they strongly criticize his MAHA report for promoting misinformation. The report is faulted for conflating autism, a neurodevelopmental condition, with diseases and for baselessly linking health issues to the childhood vaccine schedule. Scientists point to actual concerns like pollution and poverty as drivers of pediatric illness, arguing the administration's policies are often at odds with improving children's health. </p>

The report found that a reliance on clinical metrics over caregiver insight led to a lack of shared decision-making and missed opportunities to escalate his care.

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly confirmed Emil Bove for a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on a 50-49 vote. The confirmation proceeded despite serious objections from over 80 retired judges and multiple whistleblowers who raised concerns about Bove's past conduct at the Department of Justice and his personal loyalty to President Trump. Critics argue the appointment undermines judicial independence and sets a dangerous precedent where fealty to a political figure is prioritized over constitutional duty.</p>

          <p>This essay posits that the United States risks squandering its position as a global scientific superpower, drawing parallels to the decline of past scientific empires like the Soviet Union. The author argues that the Trump administration's policies—including proposed budget cuts to research agencies, hostility toward foreign scientists, and the politicization of research—are unprecedented in modern American history. These actions are reportedly causing a brain drain as top scientists consider leaving the country, potentially leading to a long-term decline in U.S. innovation and influence.</p>

          <p>This article covers two major U.S. news developments. First, the Federal Reserve voted to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, citing the need to assess the economic impact of the president's tariffs, though the decision was not unanimous. Second, Texas lawmakers have released a proposed new congressional redistricting map aimed at adding up to five Republican seats, a move that is expected to face significant legal challenges from Democrats. Both events represent key moments in current U.S. economic and political landscapes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In Ukraine, lawmakers have reversed a controversial bill that would have undermined the independence of anti-corruption agencies, following significant domestic protests and pressure from Western allies. This political development comes as fierce fighting continues on the front line, with Russia claiming to have captured the key town of Chasiv Yar, an assertion that Ukrainian officials have denied. Meanwhile, President Zelenskyy has called for stronger international action against Russia after another deadly wave of overnight airstrikes across the country.</p>

          <p>Canada has announced its intention to formally recognize a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly in September, becoming the third G7 nation to do so in recent days. Prime Minister Mark Carney said the move is contingent on the Palestinian Authority implementing democratic reforms and holding elections. The decision marks a significant shift in Canadian foreign policy and drew a swift rebuke from Israel and a warning from U.S. President Trump regarding a potential trade deal, reflecting a growing diplomatic split among Western allies.</p>

          <p>A "radar-related" issue with the UK's national air traffic control system (NATS) caused major disruptions across all UK airports on Wednesday. The failure led to the cancellation of more than 150 flights and grounded thousands more, with passengers urged to check with their airlines before traveling. This is the second significant NATS outage in less than a year, prompting airlines to demand answers and leading experts to warn that the knock-on effects on the busy summer travel schedule could persist for several days.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis explores the significant and growing divide between Democratic voters, who increasingly sympathize with Palestinians, and the party's establishment leaders, who have largely maintained pro-Israel policies. The article attributes this disconnect to several factors, including the powerful influence and financial contributions of lobbying groups like AIPAC, a tendency to conflate criticism of Israel with antisemitism, and the political inertia of older politicians accustomed to a different era of bipartisan support for Israel. This internal fracture is becoming a major point of tension within the party.</p>
