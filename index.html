          <p>Hurricane Erick was upgraded to a Category 2 storm as it approached Mexico's Pacific coast, packing winds of 155 kilometers per hour. The US National Hurricane Center warned of damaging winds and life-threatening flash floods for southern Mexico. President Claudia Sheinbaum urged residents in low-lying areas to move to shelters, with around 2,000 temporary shelters set up in Guerrero and Oaxaca. Mexico experiences severe storms every year between May and November on both its Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and this storm is no exception. The mountainous region along the coast is particularly prone to mudslides and there are numerous rivers that could burst their banks.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he has not yet decided whether the U.S. military will join Israel's ongoing attacks on Iran, but he also warned that Iran cannot be allowed to obtain nuclear weapons. Iran has reportedly readied missiles and equipment for strikes on U.S. bases if the U.S. intervenes. An Iranian official warned that any U.S. intervention would risk "all-out war," as the conflict between Israel and Iran escalates, and Israel has advised its citizens to remain close to bomb shelters. The situation has led to a mass exodus from Tehran and the U.S. embassy in Israel will be closed until at least Saturday, with uncertainty remaining over the future of the conflict.</p>

According to royal sources, Catherine is trying to find the right balance as she fully returns to public engagements, and she was said to be disappointed to miss the sporting occasion in Berkshire, where she would have appeared in the carriage procession. She was due to attend on Wednesday with her husband the Prince of Wales, King Charles and Queen Camilla.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has endorsed David Ellison's Skydance takeover of Paramount Global, despite his $20 billion lawsuit against CBS, a Paramount subsidiary, over a "60 Minutes" interview. Trump expressed hope the deal goes through, linking the merger-review delay to his lawsuit. Paramount seeks a settlement to clear the path for the Skydance acquisition, which needs FCC approval. The deal faces a regulatory hurdle: FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's consent to transfer CBS television station licenses to the Ellisons from the Redstones, and the Senate approved Trump's second Republican appointment to the panel, Olivia Trusty.</p>

          <p>A new report from Zillow indicates that a home's interior paint colors can boost its sale price by almost $2,600, with olive green being the hottest kitchen color. Buyers are willing to pay up to $1,600 more for a kitchen with olive green cabinets, while classic navy walls in the bedroom can increase the sale price by an estimated $1,815. Dark gray living rooms are also preferred, potentially boosting an offer by about $2,600, while bright, playful colors like lemon yellow or scarlet red can negatively impact the sale price. These findings highlight the importance of aesthetic considerations when selling a home.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration will delay the ban on TikTok for the third time, extending the deadline by 90 days, according to the White House. President Trump met with advisers in the Situation Room on Tuesday after leaving a summit with Group of Seven leaders early, citing tensions in the Middle East. Trump has been presented with a range of options by his national security team related to Iran, including the potential use of American military assets to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, Senate Republicans are making changes to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" narrowly passed by the House last month to fund much of President Trump's domestic agenda.</p>

Warning signs include making only minimum payments, borrowing from one card to pay another, calls from debt collectors, and an impact on housing or utilities. Alternatives to bankruptcy include debt settlement, debt management plans, debt consolidation loans, budgeting and side income, and hardship programs.

Kelly's legal team claims the Federal Bureau of Prisons is taking active steps to kill him and had overdosed him on medications, then took him out of a hospital at gunpoint and denied him surgery on blood clots in his lungs. Kelly is serving 30-year and 20-year federal sentences for child sexual assault crimes and racketeering.</p>

          <p>Crude oil futures were little changed on Wednesday after President Trump said Iran wants to negotiate over its nuclear program following six days of Israeli airstrikes. Trump stated that the Iranians had reached out to him and suggested sending a delegation to the White House to negotiate. He also confirmed he was considering a military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, though no final decision had been made. Trump's comments seemed like a shift in tone from his threats against Iran a day ago, with oil prices gaining about 10% since Israel launched its campaign against Iran (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Trump has expressed strong disapproval of protesters wearing face masks, posting about it frequently on Truth Social.

Some suggest that if protesters can't wear masks, ICE agents shouldn't either, raising questions about accountability and safety.</p>

The largest drops are expected in major food-producing regions like the US Midwest, impacting global food prices. For every degree Celsius of warming, global food production is likely to decline by 120 calories per person per day. While some cooler countries may see larger harvests, the overall decrease in food production could lead to more food insecurity for a rising global population.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court's decision upholding a Tennessee ban on gender affirming care for transgender youth is facing criticism as an abdication of the judiciary's responsibility to protect minorities. The court deferred to the judgment of the Tennessee Legislature, arguing the law doesn't discriminate on the basis of sex or transgender status. Dissenting justices argued the law does discriminate by allowing certain hormones to be given to boys but not girls, and vice versa, and by singling out transgender youth. Critics say the decision ignores the discrimination inherent in the law and avoids applying heightened scrutiny, potentially leading to enormous human costs.</p>
