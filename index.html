          <h2>China's Support for Iran Tempered Amid U.S. Military Action and Strategic Interests</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.S. has initiated military action against Iran's nuclear sites, China's support for Iran appears to be cautiously restrained, balancing its alliance with Tehran against its own economic and strategic interests. China has pledged support for Iran's sovereignty but has shifted its rhetoric towards brokering dialogue and a ceasefire, avoiding direct condemnation of Israel. China's economic interests, particularly its access to Iranian oil and the Strait of Hormuz, play a significant role in its strategic calculus. Some analysts suggest China may benefit from the chaos in the Middle East, potentially weakening the U.S., while others anticipate China will seek to maintain stability to protect its economic interests. Optimism surrounding the situation is tempered by the potential for further escalation and broader regional instability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Rafael Grossi has called for a diplomatic solution and de-escalation of the conflict in Iran. Grossi emphasized the need for IAEA inspectors to access Iran's nuclear sites to assess the damage resulting from recent Israeli and U.S. attacks. He noted that a full assessment of the underground damage at Fordo, a site built under a mountain, is not yet possible. Given the nature of the explosive payload used, Grossi anticipates significant damage to centrifuges at the site, underscoring the urgency of verifying the extent of the destruction.</p>

          <p>The U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear targets have drawn criticism from Democrats, who question the constitutionality of the action, while Republicans largely support the president's decision. Israel maintains its aim to degrade Iran's missiles and nuclear program, while Iran considers its response to the U.S. attack. Iran's Revolutionary Guards have released a video vowing consequences for the U.S., raising concerns about potential retaliation. Iran's options for retaliation include cyber attacks and disruption of oil shipping in the Gulf, creating a difficult decision for Iran as any response could lead to further conflict.</p>

          <p>Senate Majority Leader Thune outlines the Republican agenda focused on American strength, security, and prosperity through a reconciliation bill. The bill aims to fully fund border security measures and President Trump's policies, preventing Democrats from leveraging resources for other government spending. It also prioritizes defense funding, including investments in missile defense systems and new ships, and extends the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) permanently. The bill includes reforms to Medicaid, such as removing illegal immigrants from health programs and introducing work requirements, in order to return to a fiscally sustainable path.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Critics argue that President Trump's use of emergency declarations to justify policies on immigration, tariffs, and energy represents an abuse of power and a threat to democratic norms. Legal scholars and watchdog groups contend that Trump's claims of national emergencies are often spurious or thinly documented, leading to legal challenges and judicial rebukes. The use of emergency powers allows Trump to bypass Congress and implement his agenda in an authoritarian style, with courts serving as a primary check on his actions. Experts warn that this trend normalizes governing in a perpetual crisis mode, undermining the constitutional system.</p>

          <p>Increased immigration arrests are impacting the economy and well-being of immigrant families and communities across the U.S., with some immigrants and even citizens being caught in the enforcement efforts. Businesses in heavily immigrant areas are experiencing declines in sales as people are afraid to leave their homes, and some workers are avoiding job sites due to fear of deportation. While there was an initial indication of easing enforcement in agriculture and hospitality, this guidance was later reversed, leaving business leaders and immigrants scared and confused. The situation is taking an emotional toll on families, leading to protests and a sense of being unsafe in their communities.</p>

The conflict could also increase Washington's urgency to secure rare earth minerals, giving Beijing more leverage in trade negotiations.

          <p>Recent incidents of political violence targeting members of both major parties have raised concerns about a potential surge in such acts. While some data suggests an increase in threats and concerning statements directed at members of Congress and local officials, challenges remain in accurately measuring the overall scale of political violence. Factors such as a volatile political environment and the spread of misinformation on social media may contribute to the increase. Researchers emphasize the need to address the root causes of political violence, including rhetoric and the proliferation of conspiracy theories, to effectively combat the issue.</p>

This shift reflects a familiar pattern of partisan division in response to foreign policy events. The memory of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars continues to influence public sentiment, with few Americans believing those conflicts were worth their cost.</p>

Reform UK estimates the policy would generate between Â£1.5bn to Â£2.5bn annually, which would be distributed to the lowest-paid 10% of full-time workers.

          <p>President Donald Trump has raised the possibility of regime change in Iran after the U.S. joined Israel in striking Iranian nuclear facilities. Trump questioned why there wouldn't be a regime change if the current Iranian regime is unable to "MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN." The remarks came after top U.S. officials stressed that toppling Iran's leaders was not the aim of the military action. A former Trump official suggested that Trump might just be "kidding around," and that there had been a lot of "misdirection" following the comments.</p>

          <p>Iran's parliament has backed blocking the Strait of Hormuz following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, a move that experts say risks alienating its neighbors and trade partners. The decision to close the waterway, which is the only sea route from the Persian Gulf to the open ocean, rests with the country's national security council. Experts suggest that Iran would have more to lose than gain from such a move, potentially turning its neighbors into enemies and provoking its key market in Asia, particularly China. Disrupting supplies would also "put a target" on the country's own oil production, export infrastructure, and regime.</p>

Blocking the strait would have profound consequences for the global economy, disrupting international trade and driving up oil prices.

          <h2>Altadena Fire Survivor Decides to Rebuild After Devastating Loss</h2>

          <p>Jennie Marie Mahalick Petrini, whose house burned down in the Eaton fire in Altadena, has decided to rebuild despite the challenges and costs involved. Petrini's decision is driven by a combination of emotional attachment to the property, financial considerations, and community ties. While many fire survivors are choosing to sell their burned lots, Petrini's low mortgage rate and insurance payouts make rebuilding a more viable option. She plans to use various strategies, including a Small Business Administration loan and a "like-for-like" rebuild, to expedite the process and keep costs down.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Board of Education is slated to vote on an $18.8-billion budget for the next school year, which officials say will stave off cuts and layoffs for one more year. Revenue next year is currently calculated at $15.9 billion, nearly $3 billion less than what the district plans to spend. Union leaders and activists are pushing for higher wages and increased spending on programs for Black students and immigrants. Absent cuts, by the end of 2027-28, the district will be financially underwater, officials say.</p>
