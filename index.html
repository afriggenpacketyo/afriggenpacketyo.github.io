          <p>Following the death of Betsy Arakawa, Gene Hackman's wife, due to hantavirus, three additional fatal cases have been confirmed in Mono County, California, prompting health officials to issue warnings. Hantavirus, carried by rodents, can cause severe respiratory or renal diseases with a high fatality rate. Health officials emphasize that the increase in indoor mice elevates the risk of exposure, urging residents to take precautions such as sealing gaps in homes and disinfecting contaminated areas. Early symptoms include fever and muscle aches, progressing to respiratory distress; early intensive care is critical for survival. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is escalating trade tensions by threatening to impose additional tariffs on China in response to retaliatory measures. This move follows Trump's announcement of significant tariffs against numerous U.S. trading partners, which has already caused considerable disruption in global markets. A White House official indicated that the new tariffs could potentially reach a total of 104%, further intensifying the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. The President believes this is a necessary measure to protect American interests and level the playing field in international trade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer advises against buying Apple stock despite its 30% decline from its record high, citing concerns over President Trump's trade advisor Peter Navarro's stance on Apple's manufacturing practices. Cramer believes that Navarro's unfavorable view of Apple's operations in Vietnam could lead to further challenges for the company. He also notes the uncertainty surrounding potential retaliatory measures from Europe in response to Trump's tariffs. While Apple's valuation appears reasonable, the potential impact of tariffs makes the stock risky. (not investment advice)</p>
