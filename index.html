          <p>A 76-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of administering poison after eight children and one adult became ill at a summer camp in Stathern Lodge, Leicestershire. All nine individuals were hospitalized but have since been discharged. Residents described chaotic and stressful scenes as emergency services established a triage center at a local village hall, with parents initially being denied access to their children. Leicestershire Police, which is now being investigated for its initial handling of the report, has been granted more time to question the suspect.</p>

          <p>The UK Met Office has named Storm Floris, which is expected to bring unseasonably strong weather to the country on Monday. Forecasters predict wind gusts of 60-70 mph, particularly in northern coastal areas, with some parts of Scotland potentially seeing gusts up to 85 mph. Because trees are in full leaf, there is an increased risk of them being toppled, leading to potential travel disruptions and power outages. While named storms in August are not unprecedented, they tend to have a greater impact during the summer months due to temporary structures and increased outdoor activities.</p>

          <p>A year after mass protests led to the resignation and exile of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh remains deeply polarized under an interim government. While political freedoms have increased for opposition parties, human rights groups report that the new administration is falling short on its promises, utilizing arbitrary detentions against political opponents. The country has also seen a rise in the visibility of Islamist parties, which are pushing back against progressive reforms. Despite some economic progress, including a favorable tariff deal with the U.S., the nation struggles with political instability and unfulfilled hopes for systemic change.</p>

Despite the revised outlook and a more than 9% drop in its stock price, the company's second-quarter results surpassed Wall Street expectations. The biotech firm reported a smaller-than-anticipated loss and higher-than-expected revenue, attributing the positive performance to significant cost-cutting measures, including a recent 10% reduction in its workforce.

          <p>Leonardo "Flaco" Jimenez, the renowned master of the Tex-Mex accordion, has passed away at the age of 86. Over a career spanning more than seven decades, Jimenez became a global ambassador for conjunto music, a sound rooted in the German polka influences of South Texas. He learned the instrument from his father, a pioneer of the genre, and went on to collaborate with a diverse range of international stars, including Ry Cooder, Bob Dylan, and the Rolling Stones. Despite his global fame and multiple Grammy awards, he remained a beloved figure in his hometown of San Antonio, celebrated for his ecstatic, roots-driven musical style.</p>

          <p>Democratic-led states and abortion providers are suing the Trump administration over a legislative provision that blocks Medicaid funding for certain abortion providers, including Planned Parenthood, for one year. A federal judge has temporarily halted the measure, which was part of a bill passed by Congress and signed by the president. Legal experts note the case is significant as it challenges the authority of both the executive and legislative branches. Proponents of the law argue Congress has the power to control federal spending, while opponents claim the funding cut is unconstitutional and will have severe public health consequences.</p>

          <p>The competition for executive talent among family offices is intensifying, leading to more structured and generous compensation packages. A new report from Morgan Stanley reveals that a majority of these private wealth management firms now use long-term incentive plans, such as co-investment opportunities and carried interest, to attract and retain top professionals. This trend has significantly boosted pay, with CEOs at larger investment-focused family offices now earning a median of over $1.2 million annually. The shift reflects a move away from informal agreements towards more formalized, performance-based compensation structures. (not investment advice)</p>

Chevron recently completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation after a favorable arbitration ruling, and it expects the deal to start contributing to earnings by the fourth quarter.

The technique, originally observed on well-preserved bronze swords from the Terracotta Army, involves applying a thin layer of chromium salts. By adapting this ancient method, scientists have created a modern chromium plating process that combats the extreme heat and pressure inside cannon barrels. According to a defense journal, this innovation has successfully doubled the service life of high-pressure artillery, addressing a persistent challenge of barrel erosion and microcracking in advanced weaponry.</p>

The move, which cost around $20,000, was driven by a desire for a "different pace of life" and an opportunity to slow down and build a strong family foundation. Nellis continues to work remotely for his U.S.-based company by adjusting his schedule to overlap with American time zones. He and his wife hope that raising their two young sons in Europe will provide them with a broader cultural perspective and less pressure to pursue traditional corporate careers.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Considers Medicare and Medicaid Coverage for Weight Loss Drugs</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning a pilot program to cover popular weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy under Medicare and Medicaid. This five-year experimental plan would allow government health insurance programs for low-income and elderly Americans to cover the cost of these GLP-1 medications for weight management. The move aims to address the nation's high obesity rates but faces challenges due to the drugs' high costs, which can exceed $5,000 per year. The initiative, slated to begin in 2026, marks a potential shift in federal policy, as coverage for these drugs for weight loss alone is currently restricted.</p>

The tariffs on Canadian goods will increase from 25% to 35%, while Mexico has received a 90-day extension for negotiations.

In a series of social media posts, Trump called Powell a "stubborn MORON" and demanded an immediate and substantial rate cut. He further suggested that if Powell refuses, the Federal Reserve Board should "assume control" and implement the cuts. This direct pressure on the central bank's independence comes as the administration faces a slowing labor market and the economic effects of its own tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas Republicans have proposed a new congressional map designed to secure five additional seats for their party in the upcoming midterm elections. The redrawn districts, created at the urging of Donald Trump, would achieve this by strategically reconfiguring boundaries in South Texas and the Dallas and Houston metro areas. The plan involves packing Democratic voters into fewer districts and creating new, heavily Republican ones, which could dilute the voting power of Hispanic communities. While the map is considered an aggressive gerrymander, analysts note that established Democratic incumbents might still have a chance to win in their newly drawn, more competitive districts.</p>

This development follows Russia's first use of the experimental weapon against Ukraine in November. The deployment of these intermediate-range missiles, which can carry nuclear or conventional warheads, further escalates tensions with NATO and the West.</p>

They believe the inflationary impact of tariffs will be temporary and that a delay in easing policy does not properly balance the risks to economic growth.

The move shocked the Swiss business community, which had anticipated a deal with a much lower rate, similar to that of the EU. The U.S. is a critical market, accounting for about a sixth of Switzerland's total exports, and manufacturing groups have warned the high tariff could put tens of thousands of jobs at risk.
