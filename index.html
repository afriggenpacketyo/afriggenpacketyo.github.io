        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A proposed plan to impose a $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications is causing significant concern among U.S. startup founders and venture capitalists. They argue that the high cost will disproportionately harm early-stage companies, making it prohibitively expensive to hire essential foreign talent in skilled fields like engineering. This policy could complicate recruitment, stifle innovation, and potentially drive investment and skilled workers toward more welcoming markets in Europe and Canada. The move has created widespread uncertainty, with many small businesses fearing they cannot compete with larger corporations that can more easily absorb such costs.</p>

          <p>Yoweri Museveni, who has led Uganda since 1986, is preparing for another presidential campaign, continuing his tenure as one of the world's longest-serving leaders. Supporters credit him with bringing significant peace, stability, and economic development to the nation, particularly in the agricultural and tourism sectors. However, critics point to a pattern of increasing democratic backsliding, human rights violations, and rampant corruption that undermines progress. The upcoming election will test whether Ugandans prefer the continuity and stability he represents or desire a change from a government accused of suppressing opposition.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A novel and environmentally friendly technique known as phytomining is being developed to harvest valuable metals from the ground using plants. Certain 'hyperaccumulating' species can absorb high concentrations of metals like nickel, zinc, and even gold from the soil, storing them in their leaves and stems. After harvesting and incinerating the plants, a metal-rich 'bio-ore' is left behind, which can be processed into valuable resources like nickel sulfate for batteries. This method offers a climate-friendly alternative to conventional mining by cleaning contaminated land and operating with near-zero carbon emissions.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's announcement of a planned $100 billion investment in OpenAI has sparked a significant rally in semiconductor stocks worldwide. The deal, which involves deploying systems requiring millions of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), boosted investor confidence across the AI supply chain. Key Asian companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and SK Hynix saw their shares rise, and the positive sentiment extended to European equipment manufacturers as well. The massive investment is seen as a strong signal that the demand for AI infrastructure remains robust and will benefit a wide range of suppliers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover has confirmed that its factory production will remain suspended until at least October 1 following a debilitating cyber attack at the end of August. The prolonged shutdown is reportedly costing the company at least £50 million per week and is raising serious concerns about the financial stability of smaller firms within its supply chain. UK government ministers are meeting with the company and its suppliers to discuss support measures as fears grow that some businesses could face collapse. The incident highlights the cascading economic impact that cyber attacks on major industrial players can have on an entire ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle has intensified into a major Category 4 storm in the Atlantic Ocean, with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph. According to the National Hurricane Center, the storm is forecast to track further out to sea and poses no direct threat to land, with no watches or warnings currently in effect. However, the powerful system is expected to generate significant swells that will affect the coasts of Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and dangerous rip current conditions for the next several days.</p>

The move, sponsored by Saudi Arabia, is intended to keep the two-state solution viable amid the ongoing catastrophic war in Gaza. French President Emmanuel Macron stated that "right must prevail over might," framing the decision as a necessary step toward peace.

          <h2>Scientific Community Refutes Causal Link Between Tylenol and Autism Amid Political Claims</h2>

          <p>Following President Trump's assertion of a link between Tylenol and autism, scientific experts are reiterating that there is no established causal relationship. Extensive research has shown that while some studies suggest a minimal increase in risk, the development of autism is linked to complex polygenetic factors and environmental influences, not a single medication. Experts argue that the rising number of autism diagnoses is primarily due to increased awareness, broader diagnostic criteria, and better screening methods, particularly for girls. The scientific consensus remains that vaccines do not cause autism, a claim that has been thoroughly and repeatedly debunked.</p>

          <p>After more than nine years of negotiations, the European Union and Indonesia have successfully reached an agreement on a free trade pact. The Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) will eliminate most tariffs on EU exports, including agricultural products and car parts, while opening up investment opportunities in Indonesia's growing economy, particularly in the electric vehicle sector. The process was reportedly expedited by global trade tensions, including the sweeping tariff policies of the U.S. This deal marks the EU's third such agreement with a Southeast Asian nation and is expected to boost jobs and growth on both sides.</p>

          <p>England's National Health Service has launched a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a diagnosis when a patient presents with the same symptoms three times or their condition worsens. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid over five months and more than 20 contacts with her GP. This guidance aims to improve patient safety by encouraging doctors to order further tests, seek a second opinion, or refer to a specialist, thereby helping to catch serious illnesses earlier.</p>

          <p>Voters in the West African nation of Guinea have overwhelmingly approved a new constitution in a recent referendum, with provisional results showing over 90% in favor. The new charter was put forward by the military junta that seized power in 2021. The referendum is controversial because, while it paves the way for future elections, it also allows military members to run for office, extends presidential terms from five to seven years, and makes it harder for political parties to compete. The vote was boycotted by major opposition leaders, who have been suppressed by the ruling junta.</p>

          <p>Kamel Daoud, an acclaimed Algerian author, is now living under police protection in France due to the grave danger he faces for his latest novel, "Houris." The book, which won France's prestigious Prix Goncourt, breaks a national taboo by recounting the massacres and torture of the Algerian civil war of the 1990s. As a result, all of Daoud's books have been banned in Algeria, and the government has issued international arrest warrants against him. He faces enmity from the regime, Islamists, and some intellectuals for forcing a confrontation with a painful and officially silenced part of the nation's history.</p>

The potential arrival of the storm follows an already soggy September in the UK, which has seen above-average rainfall. However, there remains considerable uncertainty in the forecast, with different global weather models showing conflicting paths for the storm system as it approaches Europe.</p>

          <p>Global investment in renewable energy technologies reached a record $386 billion in the first half of 2025, marking a 10% increase compared to the same period last year. This continued growth demonstrates strong momentum in the clean energy sector, despite the Trump administration's efforts to roll back low-carbon policies and projects. The report highlights that finance for onshore and offshore wind saw a significant increase, and a large portion of newly announced funding is designated for upgrading energy grids. This resilience suggests that the transition to clean energy is being driven by powerful market and policy forces beyond a single administration. (not investment advice)</p>

The company will delay the launch of new EVs and extend the production of its popular combustion engine models like the Panamera and Cayenne well into the 2030s.

He successfully brought star player Seve Ballesteros back into the fold and cultivated a new generation of talent that included Nick Faldo and Bernhard Langer.
