        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Organizers of the 'No Kings' movement are preparing for nationwide protests against the Trump administration, with millions of participants expected. The demonstrations are a response to what organizers describe as authoritarian behavior, citing issues like immigration detentions and cuts to federal programs. While some Republican governors have activated their National Guards in anticipation, protest leaders are emphasizing their commitment to peaceful assembly and community solidarity. The White House has dismissed the significance of the planned events, which follow a similar large-scale mobilization in June.</p>

          <h2>Republicans Criticize Anti-Trump Protests and Link Democratic Stance to Shutdown Negotiations</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republican lawmakers are strongly criticizing the upcoming nationwide 'No Kings' protests, with some leaders labeling them as 'Hate America' rallies. House Speaker Mike Johnson and other GOP members have suggested that Democrats are refusing to negotiate an end to the government shutdown to avoid angering their far-left base, which they see as the driving force behind the demonstrations. This criticism connects the political impasse over government funding directly to the planned protests, framing the events as a product of radical activism. Several prominent Democrats have confirmed they will attend the rallies, reinforcing their support for the protesters' right to dissent.</p>

          <p>Top diplomats from China and Canada have met in Beijing, signaling a potential mending of the two countries' strained relationship. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Canadian counterpart, Anita Anand, that China is prepared to restart dialogue and exchanges at all levels to rebuild mutual trust. The meeting, described by Wang as a 'fresh start,' aims to move past recent diplomatic tensions and find common ground for cooperation. This diplomatic effort follows Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's recent visit to Washington, as Ottawa navigates its relationships with both global powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The first T20 match of England's winter tour against New Zealand in Christchurch was abandoned due to rain after the first innings. England, batting first, managed to score 153-6 on a challenging pitch, largely thanks to an unbeaten 49 from all-rounder Sam Curran, who rescued the team from a difficult position at 81-5. Despite a promising recovery that set up a potentially competitive second half, the weather intervened before New Zealand could begin their chase. The washout marks a frustrating start to the series, which serves as preparation for the upcoming T20 World Cup.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces have confirmed that remains recently returned from Gaza are those of Eliyahu Margalit, a 75-year-old hostage who was killed during the October 7th attack. His body had been taken from the Nir Oz kibbutz, and his death was previously announced in December 2023. This marks the 10th deceased hostage to be repatriated, though many others remain, causing significant anger in Israel. The return is part of a ceasefire agreement, which Hamas claims to be committed to despite challenges in locating bodies amidst the destruction in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew has announced he will give up his title as the Duke of York and other honors following sustained pressure over his connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. In a personal statement, he maintained his denial of accusations against him but stated the ongoing controversy was a distraction to the Royal Family's work. The decision was made in consultation with King Charles and Prince William, further diminishing his public role after previously stepping back from royal duties. This development comes as a posthumous memoir from accuser Virginia Giuffre is set to be published.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has commuted the seven-year federal prison sentence of former congressman George Santos, who was released immediately after serving less than three months. Santos had been convicted of wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. In his announcement, Trump cited what he called horrible mistreatment of Santos in prison and praised the ex-lawmaker's courage for always voting with the Republican party. The commutation, which removes all further fines and supervised release, drew sharp criticism from several New York House Republicans and Democrats, who argued that the short time served was not justice for his crimes.</p>

The call for a ceasefire came after Trump also signaled hesitation in providing Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, citing the need to maintain U.S. stockpiles.

Companies like Singapore's Carousell and South Korea's Bunjang are using a mix of expert appraisers, AI, and scientific equipment to ensure authenticity, offering money-back guarantees to boost buyer confidence. This focus on trust is helping to fuel growth, attracting shoppers with both affordability and access to rare, discontinued items.</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old woman from Newport, Wales, discovered she had a large, cancerous tumor on her kidney after a seemingly minor accident during a holiday weekend. Charlotte Morjaria sought medical attention for what she believed was a broken rib after being playfully picked up during a game, but a CT scan revealed the hidden tumor. Doctors diagnosed her with a rare form of kidney cancer that had produced only subtle symptoms, which she had attributed to other causes. Following surgery to remove her kidney, she is now cancer-free but requires lifelong monitoring, crediting the holiday mishap with saving her life.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing significant criticism after linking the need for 'large-scale deportations' to a 'problem in the cityscape.' Opposition politicians have condemned the remarks as racist and discriminatory, arguing that the vague wording targets immigrant communities and denies their belonging in Germany. Dozens of Green party members have demanded a public apology for the comments. While some conservative allies have defended Merz, the controversy has highlighted deep divisions over immigration policy and the rhetoric used by political leaders in the country.</p>

In an interview, Stubb stated that forcing Russia to the negotiating table requires 'the stick' rather than 'the carrot,' a role he believes Trump is uniquely positioned to play. He expressed optimism that more progress toward peace has been made during Trump's second term than in the previous three years. Stubb also affirmed that Finland would never recognize Russia's annexation of Ukrainian territories, including Crimea.</p>

          <p>A man in England discovered his family's hidden history after finding a suitcase belonging to his late father, who he had known as an Anglican Englishman. The case revealed his father was born Peter Eisner, a member of a wealthy Jewish family in pre-war Germany whose vast industrial fortune, worth billions today, was stolen under Nazi rule. The documents led to a decade-long investigation, uncovering a story of dispossession, flight, and the murder of relatives in the Holocaust. The journey has resulted in the successful restitution of some stolen artwork, reconnecting the family with its lost heritage.</p>

          <p>Former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has strongly criticized Proposition 50, a measure championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, calling it a 'big scam.' The proposition would authorize temporary changes to the state's congressional district maps, a move Newsom argues is necessary to counter Republican redistricting efforts in other states. Schwarzenegger, however, condemned the measure as unethical gerrymandering that takes power away from the people and gives it back to politicians. He argued that Democrats should win elections based on performance rather than by altering district maps to their advantage.</p>

          <p>Chen-ning Yang, a Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist widely regarded as one of the most important scientists of the 20th century, has died in Beijing at the age of 103. In 1954, he and Robert Mills co-authored what became known as the Yang–Mills theory, a set of equations that provided the mathematical foundation for the Standard Model of particle physics. This theory was fundamental to understanding the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces that govern the subatomic world. His work remains a cornerstone of modern physics, placing him in the same echelon as figures like Albert Einstein.</p>
