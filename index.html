          <p>Following recent US and Israeli strikes, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi has called for a new international agreement to address Iran's nuclear activities. Speaking in Paris, Wang expressed deep concern over escalating regional tensions and the risk of a nuclear disaster, positioning China as a key mediator. He urged relevant parties to accelerate negotiations for a deal that would place Iran's nuclear program under strict IAEA supervision, emphasizing that peace is achievable and history will judge each nation's sincerity.</p>

          <p>England and Wales face a significant challenge at the Women's Euro 2025, having been drawn into the tournament's most difficult group alongside France and the Netherlands. According to statistical analysis, this "Group of Death" features three of the world's top 11 teams, giving it a 37% chance of producing the eventual tournament winner. While England are defending champions and the Netherlands won in 2017, France is on an impressive eight-game winning streak, setting the stage for highly competitive opening matches.</p>

          <p>Turkish authorities have arrested the mayors of three major southern cities—Adiyaman, Adana, and Antalya—all from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP). The arrests are part of a broader investigation into allegations of organized crime, bribery, and bid-rigging. This action follows the recent imprisonment of Istanbul's popular mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, and is seen by critics as a politically motivated effort to weaken the opposition after its significant gains in recent local elections.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Compares Trump's Governance to Cold War-Era African Dictatorships</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analytical article argues that Donald Trump's style of governance shares striking parallels with the autocratic regimes of cold war-era African dictators, many of whom were supported by the U.S. The author draws comparisons between Trump's actions—such as deploying troops against domestic protesters and his theatrical economic policies—and the methods of leaders like Mobutu Sese Seko and Idi Amin. The piece suggests that these authoritarian tactics, once fostered abroad by the U.S. as a bulwark against communism, are now manifesting within American politics itself.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Officials have detailed the mechanics behind the deadly Texas flash floods, explaining that intense, un-forecasted rain fell directly over the headwaters of the Guadalupe River's two forks. This caused an extremely rapid surge, with one fork rising from 7 to 29 feet in minutes before the waters converged, creating a devastating wave that overwhelmed the region. In response to the disaster, which has claimed at least 24 lives, Texas has declared a state of emergency, mobilizing extensive state resources for the ongoing search and rescue efforts.</p>

          <p>Britpop legends Oasis played their first concert together in 16 years, launching a highly anticipated reunion tour in Cardiff, Wales, to a rapturous crowd of over 60,000. Brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher, whose acrimonious split ended the band in 2009, performed a two-hour set filled with their iconic 1990s hits like "Wonderwall" and "Champagne Supernova." The powerful performance, which focused squarely on the band's beloved songbook, marked the beginning of a 19-date tour across the U.K. and Ireland, with further international dates planned.</p>

          <p>During a diplomatic tour aimed at strengthening ties with the Caribbean and Latin America, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was awarded the Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, the nation's highest civilian honor. The visit focused on boosting investment in sectors like energy and health, building on the deep historical connections between the two countries, which date back to the arrival of indentured Indian laborers in 1845. Modi also announced that more citizens of Indian origin in the dual-island nation would be eligible for Overseas Citizen of India cards.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' trade deadline strategy is expected to remain unchanged despite a knee injury to third baseman Max Muncy, who is projected to miss about six weeks. Initial fears of a season-ending injury were allayed when tests revealed only a bone bruise with no ligament damage. With Muncy expected to return well before the playoffs, the team's front office feels confident relying on internal options like Tommy Edman and Kiké Hernández to fill the position, rather than pursuing a high-cost replacement on the trade market.</p>

          <p>Several beaches in the Rockaways, Queens, were temporarily closed to swimmers on the Fourth of July after multiple sharks were spotted swimming dangerously close to the shore. The city's emergency management agency used drones to monitor the sharks' activity and ensure public safety, allowing the beaches to reopen after about an hour. The sightings came just days after New York state officials announced enhanced shark surveillance measures for Long Island beaches ahead of the busy holiday weekend to help protect beachgoers.</p>

The strategy focuses on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through digitalization and automation, aiming to transform the nation from a shipbuilding powerhouse into a global maritime leader.

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has denied a last-ditch effort to stop the deportation of eight immigrants, clearing the way for their removal to countries including war-torn South Sudan. The case is part of a contentious legal battle over the Trump administration's policy of deporting individuals, many with serious criminal convictions, to nations where they may face perilous conditions. Lawyers for the men expressed disappointment, stating the ruling denied their clients the opportunity to have their claims heard and to protect their lives from potential danger.</p>
