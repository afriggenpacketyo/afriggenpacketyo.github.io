          <p>Ireland's Katie Taylor secured a third victory over Amanda Serrano, retaining her undisputed light-welterweight championship in a historic all-female event at Madison Square Garden. The bout, described as a tactical "chess match," ended in a majority decision with scores of 97-93, 97-93, and 95-95. Unlike their previous encounters, this fight saw a more strategic approach from both boxers, with Taylor's economical and precise counters ultimately proving decisive. Following the win, the 39-year-old champion acknowledged the historic nature of the rivalry but remained noncommittal about her future in the sport.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures expected to peak above 30°C (86°F) across large parts of the country. The Midlands and south Wales are forecast to be the hottest areas, while amber heat health alerts remain active for southern England, the Midlands, and East Anglia. The intense heat has affected events like Wimbledon, where play was paused due to spectators needing medical attention. Authorities have issued warnings about wildfire risks and potential travel disruptions, urging the public to take precautions and supervise children near water to prevent drowning.</p>

          <p>The owner of a luxury penthouse on Park Lane has been in an eight-year legal battle with companies linked to the late Mohamed Al Fayed's family over property issues. The dispute, which began over a lift installation agreement, has escalated to include allegations of leaky roofs, botched refurbishments, and the malicious use of a noisy lift to disturb the owner. This legal row reflects Al Fayed's famously combative business approach, which appears to persist after his death. The article also notes the building's connection to previous allegations where multiple women stated Fayed sexually assaulted them at a neighboring property he also owned.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their seventh consecutive loss, falling 8-7 to the San Francisco Giants despite a late-game offensive surge. Starting pitcher Dustin May struggled, giving up seven runs and allowing the Giants to build a significant lead. Although the Dodgers' bats came alive to score seven runs against Giants' ace Logan Webb, they were unable to complete the comeback. Shohei Ohtani hit his 32nd home run into McCovey's Cove, a rare feat for a Dodger player, but it wasn't enough to halt the team's longest losing streak since 2017, further shrinking their division lead.</p>

The Warren County Sheriff's Office shared photos of a smiling Stevenson on the return flight, where he was under heavy guard by U.S. Marshals and other law enforcement to prevent another escape. Stevenson, who was wanted on multiple charges including firearm possession and assault, had initially evaded a contracted agent by boarding a light rail train. His recapture followed a month-long manhunt, with officials emphasizing that justice will eventually catch up with fugitives.</p>

          <p>In an opinion piece, writer and lawyer Raja Shehadeh argues that Israel's plan to move Palestinians into a secured camp in Rafah constitutes a crime against humanity, highlighting a long history of international law failing to protect Palestinians. The author contends that despite numerous UN resolutions and legal challenges, the lack of enforcement mechanisms and the interests of powerful nations have rendered international law ineffective for Palestine. He suggests that accountability will ultimately come not from legal institutions but from global recognition of Palestinian humanity and resilience, known as 'sumoud,' in the face of dispossession and suffering.</p>

          <p>Indirect negotiations in Qatar between Israel and Hamas for a new ceasefire and hostage release are reportedly close to collapsing, according to Palestinian officials. The officials claim Israel's delegation lacked the authority to decide on key issues, such as the extent of military withdrawal and the mechanism for aid distribution, effectively stalling the talks. A major point of contention is a map provided by Israel showing its intent to maintain a buffer zone much deeper than previously discussed. This has eroded trust, with Palestinian negotiators accusing Israel of using the talks to buy time during diplomatic visits to Washington.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty in a U.S. federal court to multiple charges, including drug conspiracy and leading a continuing criminal enterprise. Prosecutors stated that Guzman Lopez, known as "El Raton," admitted to taking over his father's leadership role in the Sinaloa Cartel alongside his brothers. As part of his plea deal, he confessed to coordinating the trafficking of vast quantities of narcotics into the U.S. and agreed to cooperate with authorities, which will likely result in a reduced sentence from a potential life term.</p>

          <p>British soft toy company Jellycat has abruptly stopped supplying its products to approximately 100 independent shops in the UK, leaving many small business owners feeling confused and hurt. Retailers, some of whom have stocked the popular plush toys for over two decades, received a form email stating the decision was final and related to the company's "brand elevation strategy." The move comes after a surge in Jellycat's popularity, driven by social media, which had already made it difficult for small stores to secure stock.

          <p>A proposal by the Czech Railway Authority to dismantle the historic 123-year-old Vysehrad railway bridge in Prague has drawn significant criticism from architects, heritage experts, and the public. The authority argues that a new, three-track bridge is necessary to handle projected growth in rail traffic, as the current structure is corroded and operating at reduced capacity. However, a coalition of experts, endorsed by Unesco, contends that the iconic bridge can be repaired in place for less money and disruption. The debate highlights the classic conflict between preserving a city's architectural heritage and meeting the demands of modern infrastructure.</p>

Experts warn that such extreme heat can cause mass mortality events for species like seaweeds and seagrasses, which are vital to the ecosystem.
