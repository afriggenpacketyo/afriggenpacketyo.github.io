          <p>House Republicans are moving to block a Democratic effort to investigate Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's use of Signal, a secure messaging app. GOP leaders have included language in a rule with unrelated measures to prevent Democrats from calling up resolutions of inquiry, which are often used by the minority party to request information from the president. Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, plans to force a vote on a resolution of inquiry calling on Trump to turn over all of Hegseth’s communications shared on Signal. Johnson defended the move, stating that they were preventing political stunts and wasting time.</p>

Bourla also mentioned the potential for a reduction in the current tax regime for locally produced goods as a strong incentive for U.S. manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Experts describe President Donald Trump's approach to policy implementation as a "flood the zone" strategy, characterized by a rapid and unprecedented pace of executive orders. This approach, influenced by Project 2025, aims to quickly enact conservative and controversial policies. Critics argue that these actions challenge the power of Congress and test the limits of immigration enforcement. While some moves have been blocked by the courts, experts warn that even reversed policies can have lasting damage by shifting the narrative and pushing the political spectrum further to the right.</p>

          <p>This article argues that President Trump's economic policies, particularly his approach to tariffs, are fundamentally aligned with left-wing economic thought. The author contends that Trump's belief in his ability to set prices and direct the economy from above contradicts traditional conservative principles of free markets and limited government. The piece suggests that Trump's economic views echo the ideas of economic planners and politicians who believe they can better manage the economy than a laissez-faire approach. </p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's call to "drill, baby, drill," the oil and gas industry has faced challenges during his second term. U.S. crude oil prices have declined, making it unprofitable for many companies to increase production. Oilfield service firms are warning of slowed investment due to falling prices and economic uncertainty caused by Trump's policies. The S&P 500 energy sector has underperformed the broader market, reflecting the industry's struggles.</p>

          <p>House Education and Workforce Committee Republicans have unveiled a plan to overhaul the student loan and financial aid system, seeking to limit student borrowing and reduce repayment options.

The plan includes measures that would severely restrict college access by slashing financial aid programs and eliminating basic consumer protections.</p>

          <p>Pfizer is expanding its cost-cutting efforts and reported first-quarter profit that topped estimates, even as the company's sales fell due to declining revenue for its Covid pill, Paxlovid. The company now expects additional savings of roughly $1.2 billion by the end of 2027, driven by enhanced digital enablement and streamlining business processes. Pfizer also anticipates research and development reorganization cost savings of around $500 million by the end of 2026, which will be reinvested into its product pipeline. The results come as drugmakers brace for President Donald Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported into the U.S.</p>
