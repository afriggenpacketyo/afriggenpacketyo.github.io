          <h2>Trump Blames Biden for Economic Struggles While Taking Credit for Successes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview, President Trump attributed the positive aspects of the economy to his policies while blaming former President Biden for any downturns. He defended his tariffs, asserting they would enrich the country and acknowledged ultimate responsibility but emphasized his short tenure. Trump has previously attempted to shift blame to Biden for economic contractions, particularly the recent contraction in the first quarter. This strategy reflects an ongoing effort to distance himself from negative economic indicators while capitalizing on positive ones, creating a narrative of immediate impact despite the complexities of economic policy. Optimism score must be between 0 and 100.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports have dampened the mood at the Spring Canton Fair, with toy exporters fearing stagnation in research and development due to potential order suspensions from the United States.

          <p>President Trump, in an interview, declined to affirm his support for due process rights for both citizens and noncitizens, stating he is not a lawyer and does not know. While repeatedly threatening to make Canada the "51st state," he deemed military action against Canada as "highly unlikely". Trump defended his economic policies, despite recession forecasts, and downplayed suggestions of a third term in office. These comments reflect Trump's often unconventional and provocative approach to governance.</p>

          <h2>Biden Aides Considered Cognitive Test Before 2024 Election, Book Reveals</h2>

          <p>A new book reveals that Joe Biden's top staff debated having him take a cognitive test in February 2024 as he prepared for his re-election campaign, but ultimately decided against it. The aides worried that taking the test would raise further questions about his mental acuity, despite confidence he would pass. Biden eventually stepped down from the campaign after a poor debate performance and was replaced by Kamala Harris, who lost the election to Donald Trump. The book sheds light on the internal discussions surrounding Biden's fitness for office.</p>

          <p>Doctors in Gaza report a catastrophic situation due to Israel's total siege, which has halted humanitarian aid for over 60 days, leading to shortages of food, water, and medicine. Preventable diseases and illnesses are surging, and the likelihood of dying from them is increasing. Humanitarian groups accuse Israel of using aid as a political tool, violating international law. The situation is compounded by the existing partial blockade imposed since 2007, exacerbating the struggles of the population.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs have significantly impacted the Port of Los Angeles, with roughly a third of traffic grinding to a halt, according to the port's CEO. The tariffs are expected to negatively affect waterfront communities and warehousing centers, leading to job losses and economic disruption. Experts warn that the port slowdown will be felt across the US, highlighting the far-reaching consequences of trade policies on local economies. The situation is further complicated by new rules imposing port fees on ships built in China, leading to projected blank sailings.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Innocence Project has announced new evidence in the Scott Peterson murder case, claiming it "eviscerates" the prosecution's theory and proves Peterson's innocence. The LAIP presents evidence of a burglary near the Peterson's home, witness statements placing Laci Peterson in the neighborhood after the alleged murder, and questions about the timing of Laci's death based on fetal growth. The evidence includes suppressed and destroyed exculpatory evidence, leading to claims of a disorganized investigation. The re-examination of the case has been met with skepticism, but it has also raised questions about the fairness of the original trial.</p>
