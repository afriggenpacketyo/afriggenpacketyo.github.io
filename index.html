          <p>Oklahoma's state superintendent, Ryan Walters, has announced his resignation to become the CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance, a new organization aimed at combating teachers' unions. Walters stated his goal is to "destroy the teachers unions and take back our schools," framing the move as a battle against what he calls the "liberal, woke agenda" in public education. The announcement drew praise from conservative circles but was met with criticism from union leaders, such as American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten, who called it a "good day for Oklahoma’s kids" and accused Walters of exporting divisive rhetoric nationally.</p>

          <p>The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation metric for the Federal Reserve, remained at 2.9% annually in August, aligning with economists' expectations. This figure, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, suggests the central bank may proceed with its anticipated interest rate reductions. The Commerce Department report also indicated that consumer spending and income grew slightly more than forecasted, showing economic resilience. These stable inflation readings are unlikely to alter the Fed's current policy trajectory toward further monetary easing this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nathan Gill, the former leader of Reform UK in Wales, has pleaded guilty to multiple bribery charges for accepting money to make pro-Russian statements while he was a member of the European Parliament. Between 2018 and 2019, Gill admitted to receiving payments from a Ukrainian politician to promote a narrative beneficial to Russia concerning events in Ukraine. The prosecution stated that Gill was tasked on at least eight occasions to make specific statements in parliament and news outlets in exchange for cash. Gill, who faces a potential jail sentence, denied a related conspiracy charge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the ROAD to Housing Act, aims to address the U.S. housing crisis by using federal incentives to encourage local governments to ease zoning restrictions. Spearheaded by Senators Tim Scott and Elizabeth Warren, the legislation would create model zoning codes and offer grants to municipalities that successfully increase their housing supply. This approach seeks to overcome local opposition to new construction, which often stifles development despite regional benefits. The proposal is modeled on the concept of "Right-to-Build Zones," which would allow developers to operate under simpler, less restrictive rules in designated areas.</p>

          <p>Billy Vigar, a 21-year-old former Arsenal youth striker, has died after sustaining a significant brain injury during a match for Chichester City. It is believed his injury was caused by a collision with a concrete wall surrounding the pitch, prompting calls for improved player safety measures at football grounds. The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) has demanded a full investigation, stating players should not be exposed to "unnecessary and avoidable risk." The incident has renewed concerns previously raised after a similar collision in 2022, leading to a petition to ban brick walls around pitches.</p>

          <p>A UK court has dismissed the terrorism case against Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, known as Mo Chara from the Irish rap group Kneecap, due to a procedural error. He was charged after allegedly displaying a flag supporting Hezbollah at a London concert, a charge he denied and described as politically motivated. The chief magistrate ruled the charge was "unlawful" because prosecutors failed to obtain the necessary consent from the Director of Public Prosecutions within the six-month statutory time limit. Outside the court, Ó hAnnaidh stated the case was an attempt to silence advocacy for Gaza.</p>

The visit, marked by state-media displays of locals celebrating in traditional dress, stands in stark contrast to reports of ongoing mass detention, forced labor, and pervasive surveillance targeting the Uyghur population. Human rights groups and a 2022 UN report have accused China of serious human rights violations in the region that may amount to crimes against humanity, a reality masked by the government's carefully managed narrative.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that fewer than one in three U.S. teenagers with opioid use disorder receive necessary treatment, a critical gap as overdose deaths among this demographic have nearly tripled since 2018. Researchers point to the increased availability of counterfeit pills containing fentanyl, often sold via social media, as a key factor in the rising death toll. Experts highlight a severe lack of accessible treatment options for adolescents, particularly medication-assisted treatments like buprenorphine, which are considered the most effective. This treatment gap is compounded by prejudice and systemic hurdles that prevent young people from receiving evidence-based care.</p>

          <p>Sir Menzies "Ming" Campbell, a distinguished figure in British politics and sports, has passed away at the age of 84. He led the Liberal Democrats from 2006 to 2007 and served as the Member of Parliament for North East Fife for 28 years, where he was a renowned foreign affairs spokesman and a prominent critic of the Iraq War. Before his political career, Campbell was an accomplished sprinter who held the UK 100m record and competed in the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Current Lib Dem leader Ed Davey paid tribute to him as a "dedicated public servant and a true Liberal giant."</p>

          <p>The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organizes the Eurovision Song Contest, will hold a vote among its 68 member countries to decide if Israel should be allowed to participate in 2026. The decision comes after Israel's continued involvement became controversial due to the ongoing war in Gaza, with several nations threatening to boycott the event. A simple majority vote at a general assembly in November will determine the outcome. Israel's public broadcaster has argued for its inclusion, citing its long and successful history in the contest, which was founded as a symbol of unity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite high-profile venture capital deals, the investment firms of the ultra-wealthy are primarily gaining exposure to the artificial intelligence boom through public equities rather than direct startup investments. A Goldman Sachs survey of 245 family offices found that 52% invest in AI via stocks or ETFs, compared to just 25% investing directly in private AI companies. This preference is partly attributed to more reasonable valuations in public markets and the significant presence of AI-driven companies within major stock indices like the S&P 500. Energy and materials firms benefiting from AI's growth are also popular secondary investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Judy Blume's groundbreaking 1975 novel "Forever..." is celebrating its 50th anniversary, prompting reflection on its lasting cultural impact. The book, which candidly depicted teenage sexuality, love, and contraception from a young woman's perspective, became a rite of passage for generations of adolescents. It was radical for its time, validating female desire and agency, and consequently faced decades of controversy and book-banning attempts. While today's teens have different avenues for information, the article considers the novel's role in encouraging an intentional and intimate understanding of sexuality that may still hold relevance.</p>

          <p>A Texas teenager, Benjamin Elliott, is on trial for the murder of his twin sister, Meghan, whom he fatally stabbed in the neck while she slept in 2021. Elliott, then 17, immediately called 911, claiming he believed he was in a dream and had been sleepwalking. The defense is built on this claim, supported by a family history of sleepwalking and the findings of a sleep disorder expert who studied him. Prosecutors remain skeptical, questioning his account of the night and pointing to the severity of the wounds as evidence of intentional action in a case with no apparent motive.</p>
