            <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers rediscovered their offensive power in a 5-3 victory over the Colorado Rockies, largely due to the combined performance of Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts, and Freddie Freeman. Betts and Ohtani both hit home runs, while Freeman contributed two hits, marking a return to form for the team's key players. Manager Dave Roberts emphasized the need for more selective hitting, and adjustments were made during batting practice to improve performance against fastballs. The win was also supported by a strong pitching performance from Dustin May, who pitched six innings and allowed only one run.</p>

            <p>Patients in the South West of England with inflammatory skin diseases such as eczema, psoriasis, and acne are experiencing significant delays in accessing NHS dermatology services, leading to physical and emotional distress. Long waiting times, exacerbated by increased skin cancer referrals and a shortage of dermatologists, leave patients in a 'living hell,' with some waiting over a year for treatment. The situation is driving some individuals to seek private healthcare, though newer, more effective medicines are often only available through the NHS. This has led to calls for greater recognition and resources for treating inflammatory skin conditions.</p>

            <p>Veterinarians working for large corporate groups in the UK are reporting increasing pressure to generate income, potentially compromising animal welfare. Some vets feel compelled to upsell procedures and are monitored based on the revenue they bring in, leading to ethical concerns. Out-of-hours services are also allegedly booking non-urgent appointments as emergencies, increasing costs for pet owners. While companies claim clinical autonomy and prioritize animal health, the emphasis on financial targets raises questions about the balance between profit and patient care.</p>

            <p>Since the Taliban's rise to power in Afghanistan, girls and women have faced severe restrictions on education and employment, leading many to turn to carpet weaving as one of the few available options. Despite a booming carpet export business, weavers earn meager wages, often working long hours for less than a dollar a day. The lack of opportunities and dire economic situation have trapped many women in low-paid labor, highlighting the challenges faced by Afghan women under Taliban rule. Some organizations have established workshops to support those left behind by the closures, but the situation remains precarious.</p>

            <p>In the case against the driver charged with killing NHL player Johnny Gaudreau and his brother Matthew, the defense is expected to argue that the brothers' intoxication contributed to the fatal crash. However, prosecutors argue that there is no law against cycling while intoxicated in New Jersey and that witnesses saw the brothers riding responsibly. The prosecution contends that the driver, Sean Higgins, was impaired and fueled by road rage when he struck the brothers. The hearing will determine if the cyclists' intoxication levels are relevant to the trial.</p>

He acknowledged that the new tariff system has caused market jitters but affirmed Trump's commitment to the strategy for lowering trade deficits.

The demands were aimed at combating antisemitism on campus and included changes to governance, hiring practices, and admissions procedures. Harvard President Alan Garber stated that the university would not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.

            <p>A freeze on federal funding by the Trump administration has halted key infrastructure projects in tribal communities across the US, impacting initiatives ranging from home renovations to riverbank stabilization. More than 22 tribes and nonprofits have had around $350 million in funding frozen, often without notice. These projects, funded through the EPA's Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights, are crucial for addressing climate change threats and improving living conditions in remote communities.

The administration maintains that while it can remove domestic obstacles to lawful entry, it cannot forcibly extract an individual from a foreign nation's custody. The situation highlights the limitations of US authority in dealing with foreign governments and the challenges of rectifying administrative errors in immigration cases.</p>
