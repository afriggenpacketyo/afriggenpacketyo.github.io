        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China experienced a sharper-than-expected 0.3% drop in consumer prices in September year-on-year, maintaining deflationary pressure. This decline, coupled with persistent producer price deflation, highlights the impact of sluggish domestic demand and trade uncertainties on both consumer and business confidence. While core CPI showed some improvement, economists warn it is premature to declare an end to deflationary trends, citing ongoing structural challenges like softening demand and overcapacity. The article emphasizes that despite policy efforts yielding some positive results in industrial profits, the overall economic stabilization remains fragile, especially given the unrecovered housing market and weak labor conditions.</p>

          <p>Numerous U.S. and international news organizations, including The New York Times and Associated Press, have refused to sign the Pentagon's new media access rules, leading to the revocation of their press credentials. These outlets deem the policy overly restrictive, particularly a clause requiring journalists to acknowledge they could lose badges for seeking classified or certain unclassified information. The Pentagon defends the rules as essential for national security, while media associations argue they gag employees and threaten a free press. This article highlights a significant clash between government transparency and journalistic freedom.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, president of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), faces a tougher route to becoming prime minister after coalition partner Komeito abruptly withdrew. Komeito's exit left the LDP with a smaller minority in the Diet, opening the door for a potential opposition upset and forcing a postponement of the prime ministerial vote. The article notes that opposition parties are now exploring a unity candidate, potentially Yuichiro Tamaki, to challenge the LDP. This political shift could, paradoxically, allow the LDP to pursue long-delayed policy goals without Komeito's concessions, though Takaichi's leadership is now under increased scrutiny.</p>
