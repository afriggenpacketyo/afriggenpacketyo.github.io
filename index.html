          <p>A new law signed by President Trump significantly alters the federal student loan system for millions of Americans. It streamlines repayment options into two main choices: a standard 10-to-25-year plan and a new income-driven plan with a repayment term of up to 30 years. The legislation also tightens eligibility for Pell Grants for low-income students and introduces new borrowing caps for Parent PLUS and graduate school loans, sparking debate over the future of higher education affordability.

          <p>Timothy Leiweke, a high-profile sports executive and CEO of Oak View Group, has been criminally charged for allegedly conspiring to rig the bidding process for a $388 million sports arena at the University of Texas. The federal indictment claims he colluded with a competitor to ensure his company would be the sole bidder for the Moody Center project. Leiweke, who has since resigned from his CEO role, faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted, with prosecutors stating he deprived a public university of the benefits of fair competition.</p>

The book focuses on the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, who have worked tirelessly to find the stolen children of the "desaparecidos," or disappeared ones. It uses the story of one family, reunited through genetic science, to explore broader questions of justice, memory, and national healing.

          <p>Comedian Eric Idle, an icon of the Monty Python troupe, has sharply criticized U.S. President Donald Trump, calling him a "treasonous monster." In an interview, the 83-year-old actor, who resides in Los Angeles, stated that he finds nothing funny about the president and that he would be proud to be thrown out of the country for political reasons. Idle drew a parallel to Charlie Chaplin, who was exiled from the U.S. in 1952 over political concerns, saying he would be in "very select company."</p>

Debuted in Xinjiang, the robot uses advanced lidar and machine vision to identify the top bud of a cotton plant and then vaporizes it with a high-powered blue laser without physical contact. This technique redirects the plant's nutrients to boost boll formation and yield. The development team from Xinjiang University reports a high success rate and minimal plant damage, promising to improve efficiency.</p>

The proposal, which would see Palestinians security-screened and confined to the area, has reportedly faced opposition from within the Israeli military.
