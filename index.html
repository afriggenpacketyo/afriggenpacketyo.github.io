          <p>A Kyodo News podcast episode delves into Japan's debate over separate surnames for married couples, spurred by a survey revealing that nearly 30% of common-law relationships exist because couples wish to avoid changing their last names, a legal requirement unique to Japan. Three Kyodo News reporters discuss the intricacies of this issue, exploring its cultural and legal dimensions. The podcast also touches on how this debate reflects broader discussions about gender equality and individual rights within Japanese society, offering a bilingual resource for English learners interested in news writing and translation. The article analyzes how the unique surname law impacts personal choices and relationships in Japan, prompting consideration of potential legal reforms. </p>

The Times highlights research showing weight-loss drugs halved deaths from strokes and heart attacks, suggesting widespread benefits for the UK population and reduced pressure on the NHS. The Daily Express also focuses on the 'golden age' of obesity-fighting drugs, citing potential risk reduction for heart, liver, and kidney diseases. Additionally, the Daily Telegraph reports on counter-terrorism police investigating a fire at the prime minister's London home, considering possible involvement from a hostile state.</p>

          <p>The NHL has suspended Doug Cifu, a minority owner of the Florida Panthers, following a heated exchange on X with a Toronto Maple Leafs fan that escalated into a discussion about the Israel-Palestine conflict and Cifu's remark about Canada being the "51st state." Cifu responded to a fan's post about starvation as a weapon with inflammatory comments, including anti-Semitic remarks, before deactivating his account. The Panthers executive apologized for his behavior, stating it does not reflect the standards of the organization. The incident occurred during the second round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs between Florida and Toronto, adding to the series' already chippy atmosphere.</p>

          <p>eToro, an Israel-based stock brokerage platform with a growing crypto presence, has priced its IPO at $52 per share, raising nearly $310 million and valuing the company at approximately $4.2 billion. The company's Nasdaq debut, under the ticker symbol ETOR, will test the market's appetite for new offerings after previous plans were shelved due to tariff uncertainty. Founded in 2007, eToro competes with Robinhood and generates revenue through trading fees and non-trading activities. The company's net income significantly increased last year, driven by its expanding crypto business, and BlackRock has expressed interest in purchasing $100 million in shares at the IPO price.

          <p>A forthcoming book, "Original Sin," by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, reveals how former President Biden's aides reportedly quashed concerns about his age and cognitive abilities during his time in the White House. The book relies heavily on anonymous sources, describing instances where Biden forgot names of longtime aides and confused government officials. The authors suggest a 'cover-up' of Biden's diminishing abilities, with aides spending more time avoiding the issue than addressing it. Despite these claims, the book lacks any single explosive revelation that fundamentally changes the perception of Biden's fitness to serve. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, a program that provided deportation protections and work permits to over 8,000 Afghans. This decision reverses the Biden administration's extension of TPS, which cited the humanitarian crisis following the Taliban takeover in 2021. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem stated that the improved security situation and stabilizing economy in Afghanistan no longer prevent Afghans from returning. Advocates have criticized the move, while the Trump administration is also seeking to roll back TPS for Venezuela, a decision currently halted by a judge.</p>

          <p>Documents released in Mayor Eric Adams's federal corruption case reveal he used at least seven different cellphone numbers during the investigation, which he explained was necessary to separate personal, office, and campaign communications. The FBI tracked Adams's location using cellphone data, uncovering his use of multiple devices since August 2021. The charges against Adams, including bribery and wire fraud, were eventually dismissed, but the investigation involved seizing multiple electronic devices from Adams, including iPhones, an iPad, and a satellite phone found in Gracie Mansion. Adams has criticized the tactics used by federal authorities, attributing his inability to remember his phone password to dyslexia.</p>

Reinstated staff include those in NIOSH's respiratory health division, division of safety research, division of compensation and analysis support, and National Personal Protective Technology Laboratory.

Suzette Quintanilla expressed enthusiasm about sharing Selena's story with a global audience through Netflix, marking another collaboration between the family and the streaming platform.

California has filed a lawsuit arguing that Trump lacks the authority to impose tariffs on his own and will seek a preliminary injunction to freeze the tariffs in federal court.

The administration's focus on white Afrikaners has raised questions about its criteria for acceptable immigrants, particularly as it restricts other refugees and targets immigrants for deportation. While officials claim the Afrikaner refugees were carefully vetted, critics argue that the decision advances a narrative of global persecution of whites. The administration's rationale for denying Afghans temporary protected status is disputed by experts, who note ongoing security threats and the high risk faced by those who cooperated with U.S. forces.</p>

          <p>A team of researchers in China has cautioned against the rapid adoption of DeepSeek's AI in hospitals, citing potential clinical safety and privacy risks. As of early March, at least 300 hospitals in China have begun using DeepSeek's large language models (LLMs) for clinical diagnostics and medical decision support. The researchers warned that DeepSeek's tendency to generate factually incorrect outputs could lead to substantial clinical risk, despite its strong reasoning capabilities. They also noted that healthcare professionals could become overreliant on AI output, leading to diagnostic errors or treatment biases.</p>

Economists are closely watching for signs that President Trump's tariffs are impacting American households, though the effects may not be evident in the data for several months due to exemptions and front-loading of purchases.
