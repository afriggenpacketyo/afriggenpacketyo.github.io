          <p>Emil Bove III, a top Justice Department official responsible for enacting President Trump's immigration agenda and ordering the purge of career prosecutors, is being considered for a federal appeals judge position. Democrats are expected to scrutinize his role in contentious Justice Department actions during his Senate confirmation process. One of the more defining episodes of his tenure so far was the battle he waged against his former colleagues in the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York over the administration’s request to drop bribery charges against the New York mayor, Mr. Adams.</p>

          <p>President Trump held a two-hour phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss the war in Ukraine, stating that both Russia and Ukraine will begin ceasefire negotiations immediately. Trump also mentioned speaking with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO leaders after the call, and indicated that Pope Leo XIV expressed interest in hosting the negotiations. The article notes Putin has given little public indication that he's eager for a ceasefire or an end to the war he began. Vice President JD Vance said Trump is likely to argue to Putin that there are economic benefits to thawing relations between Russia and the rest of the world, but you're not going to get those benefits if you keep on killing a lot of innocent people.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates experienced a sharp increase following Moody's decision to downgrade the U.S. credit rating. The average rate on a 30-year fixed loan reached 7.04%, the highest since April 11. This increase in mortgage rates has already impacted the housing market, causing a pullback during the typically busy spring season. The article mentions that pending sales of existing homes in April dropped 3.2% compared to the previous year and homebuilder sentiment is at its lowest level since the end of 2023. Any rate increase will knock some people out of even qualifying for a mortgage.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 350,000 Venezuelans, who were previously protected from deportation and permitted to work in the United States. This decision lifts a lower court's order that had prevented the administration from ending the protections while legal proceedings continued. The ruling potentially allows the administration to move ahead with deportations. One lawyer representing TPS holders believes this to be “the largest single action stripping any group of non-citizens of immigration status in modern U.S. history.</p>

Tensions arose over increased scrutiny of "60 Minutes" programming, with concerns about journalistic independence. Redstone has also reportedly criticized McMahon for fairness and balance issues in CBS's coverage, particularly regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The article mentions that McMahon felt she had to fight to even get "60 Minutes" to air at all in recent weeks, given the board's preference that certain stories not run. The board has also been unhappy with McMahon's leadership and the performance of CBS News from a business perspective.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased after Moody's downgraded the U.S.'s credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns about the increasing burden of financing the government's budget deficit and the high cost of rolling over existing debt. The 30-year Treasury yield briefly topped 5%, reaching levels not seen since November 2023. The article mentions that the 10-year yield climbed to 4.479%. This action by Moody's aligns them with other major credit rating agencies that had already given the U.S. their second-highest rating. The Moody's downgrade is viewed as a major symbolic move, as they were the last of the major rating agencies to have the U.S. at the top rating.</p>

          <p>A new report suggests climate change is becoming an increasingly important consideration in assessing credit score risk for home mortgages, alongside debt, income, and collateral. Risks include flood, wildfire, and wind. The article states that in a severe-weather year, projected annualized climate-driven foreclosures could result in $1.21 billion in bank losses this year, or 6.7% of all foreclosure credit losses, according to the report. Just 10 years from now, as weather events grow more frequent and more destructive, those credit losses could increase to $5.36 billion, representing nearly 30% of foreclosure losses.</p>

          <p>Israel declared this week that it was expanding its ground offensive in the Gaza Strip, vowing to seize swaths of the enclave in an effort to force the surrender of Hamas after more than 19 months of war. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli troops could effectively take control of all of Gaza as part of the offensive. The past few days have been particularly deadly for Palestinians in Gaza, which has been devastated by the war and a recent blockade on aid that has left many facing hunger. The Israeli military said on Sunday that it had struck more than 670 targets across the enclave over the past week.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that the islands of Mbanie, Conga and Cocoteros off the coast of Gabon legally belong to Equatorial Guinea, settling a decades-long dispute. The three tiny islands, which are effectively uninhabited but are located in potentially oil and gas-rich waters, have been controlled by Gabon since its troops forcibly evicted Equatorial Guinean soldiers from Mbanie in 1972. The court ordered Gabon to acknowledge a treaty signed in Paris in 1900 dividing up French and Spanish colonial assets in the region which handed the islands to Spain, with sovereignty passing to Equatorial Guinea upon its independence from Madrid in 1968.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk is seeking a new CEO to help it regain its competitive edge in the weight loss drug market, as its obesity injection Wegovy loses ground to Eli Lilly's Zepbound. Shares of Novo Nordisk have plunged more than 50% over the past year, wiping out over $300 billion in market value. The new CEO will need to spearhead the company's plans to launch a new slate of weight loss drugs before key patents for Wegovy expire, and manage the impact of Medicare drug price negotiations and President Donald Trump's planned tariffs on pharmaceuticals. Investor enthusiasm has faded after Eli Lilly gained a bigger share of the market and clinical trial data on Novo Nordisk's next wave of obesity drugs underwhelmed investors.</p>

          <p>A "significant amount" of private data, including details of domestic sexual assault victims, has been stolen in a cyber-attack on Legal Aid's online system. The breach, which occurred in April, involves data dating back to 2010, including addresses, dates of birth, national ID numbers, and financial information. The Ministry of Justice has urged the public to be alert for suspicious activity and update potentially exposed passwords. The agency is the latest victim in a series of recent cyber-attacks that have caused mass disruption.</p>
