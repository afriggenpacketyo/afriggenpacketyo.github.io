            <p>Analysts are debating the feasibility and cost of manufacturing iPhones in the United States, a concept that has resurfaced amid trade tensions. While Apple designs its products in California, the bulk of production occurs in China due to lower labor costs and specialized skills. Bringing iPhone production to the U.S. would require significant investment in infrastructure, workforce training, and potentially higher component costs due to tariffs on imported parts. Estimates for a U.S.-made iPhone range from $1,500 to $3,500, reflecting the challenges of shifting a complex global supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

However, some entrepreneurs, like Gu Chujun, who was wrongly convicted of embezzlement and fraud, are still seeking the return of their assets, highlighting the ongoing challenges faced by the private sector in China.</p>

            <p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has expressed concerns that the U.S. economy is nearing or already in a recession, citing weakening economic indicators and the uncertainty created by the Trump administration's trade policies. Fink highlighted that consumer and business sentiment has deteriorated in recent months, despite some positive economic data like job growth and retail sales. He believes the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs offers little reassurance, leading to prolonged uncertainty that could further dampen economic activity. Despite his concerns, Fink does not foresee a financial crisis and expects artificial intelligence to remain a significant economic driver. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A leading U.S. economist has drawn parallels between President Trump's trade battle with China and the Vietnam War, suggesting that both sides will become entangled in a prolonged and damaging conflict. Adam Posen argues that the administration's belief in 'escalation dominance' is misguided, as China holds significant leverage in the trade war due to U.S. reliance on Chinese imports. Posen criticizes the administration's understanding of international trade and warns that the trade war will harm the U.S. economy more than China's.</p>

            <p>US gunmakers are facing uncertainty due to Donald Trump's tariff policies, which could increase costs on imported raw materials and safety products. While most guns sold in the US are manufactured domestically, they rely on components sourced globally. The Firearm Industry Trade Association is concerned that tariffs will push manufacturing costs upward, stunt economic growth, and reduce consumer demand. Some companies are moving manufacturing to other countries to mitigate the impact of tariffs.</p>

            <p>Recent layoffs at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could impact the agency's ability to process tax returns, conduct audits, and enforce collections during the peak of tax season. The layoffs are part of a broader effort to reduce the federal workforce, but they come at a time when the IRS is already struggling to address the tax gap and maintain its essential functions. Experts warn that these staff reductions could have financial consequences for the IRS and taxpayers alike.</p>

The Trump administration had conceded that Garcia's deportation was due to an administrative error, but had appealed the lower court's order.</p>

            <p>Consumer sentiment has fallen sharply in April, driven by rising inflation expectations, according to a University of Michigan survey. The survey's reading on consumer sentiment fell to its lowest level since June 2022, with inflation expectations reaching their highest point since 1981. Concerns about business conditions, personal finances, incomes, and the labor market have all contributed to the decline in sentiment, raising the risk of a recession. (not investment advice)</p>
