          <p>An aid agency is reporting dire conditions in Sudan, with people resorting to eating charcoal and leaves to survive after fleeing attacks on displacement camps near El-Fasher. The Norwegian Refugee Council highlights horrific stories of people dying of thirst and others dying from wounds after being repeatedly subjected to sexual assault during their journeys to safety. The conflict between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has created a humanitarian crisis, with the RSF accused of targeting non-Arabic residents of Darfur. The UN warns that assistance systems are collapsing, and medical workers and water sources are under threat.</p>

          <p>Consumers are exhibiting cautious spending habits in response to tariffs, with some accelerating purchases of big-ticket items like cars to avoid price hikes, while others delay major purchases due to uncertainty. The auto sector has seen increased sales, but overall consumer spending is slowing down, and retailers are observing unpredictable sales patterns. Surveys indicate that many consumers plan to postpone major purchases rather than buy early, reflecting a conservation mentality amid fluctuating markets and trade policy uncertainty. Companies are closely monitoring consumer behavior to predict demand and manage inventory in the face of the tariffs.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis suggests that tariffs implemented by President Trump will disproportionately impact lower-income households, increasing their tax burden significantly more than that of wealthier households. The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) found that the poorest 20% of households would experience a tax increase equal to 6.2% of their income due to tariffs, while the wealthiest 1% would see a 1.7% increase. Economists and analysts argue that tariffs act as taxes on consumers, raising prices for essential goods and disproportionately affecting those with lower incomes.</p>

          <p>A hairdresser in East London fears losing her business and home due to tax rises implemented in October's Budget, which add £23,000 annually to her salon's costs. She is reducing apprentice hours and employee numbers to survive, citing the impact of Value Added Tax (VAT) rules and increases in employer National Insurance contributions (Nics) and business rates. The British Hair Consortium is urging the government to halve VAT for salons to prevent industry collapse, arguing that it could increase overall tax revenue by preventing workers from going self-employed.</p>
