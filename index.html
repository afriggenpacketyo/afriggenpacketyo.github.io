          <p>In an inflationary economy, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace inflation, with the added benefit of FDIC or NCUA insurance. While national average yields for one- to five-year CDs are below 2%, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, some exceeding 4.4% for shorter terms. The article explains that due to an inverted yield curve, short-term CDs currently provide better returns than long-term ones, suggesting strategies like laddering to maximize earnings.

          <p>For homeowners, leveraging home equity through a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC) presents an affordable borrowing option compared to high-rate personal loans or credit cards. Current average rates for 10-year home equity loans are around 8.28%, while HELOCs average 7.84%, with potential for these rates to decrease if the Federal Reserve implements cuts. The article outlines the differences between the two products, noting that home equity loans offer a fixed-rate lump sum, whereas HELOCs provide a variable-rate revolving line of credit.

          <p>Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups has been arrested and charged in Oregon for his alleged involvement in an illegal poker operation with ties to the Mafia. This development is part of a broader investigation that has also implicated Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former player Damon Jones in a related illegal gambling case. Law enforcement officials, including the FBI Director, are expected to provide more details about the charges, which involve allegations of using inside information for unlawful wagering. Billups, a former NBA Finals MVP, coached his team's season opener just the night before his arrest.</p>

To secure the best possible rates, consumers are advised to strengthen their credit profiles, aiming for scores in the mid-to-high 700s, and to compare offers from multiple lenders.

          <p>Aerospace and defense firms Airbus, Leonardo, and Thales are combining their satellite and space operations to create a major European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink. The new joint venture aims to build a comprehensive portfolio of space technologies, strengthening Europe's technological sovereignty and competitiveness in the global space market. This strategic consolidation, which will employ 25,000 people, is seen as a pivotal step for the region's space industry as governments seek to retain control over domestic space programs and develop homegrown alternatives for satellite broadband services.</p>

          <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be between 2.7% and 2.8%, a modest increase that reflects the recent cooling of inflation. While the annual adjustment provides crucial inflation protection, many beneficiaries feel the anticipated increase, averaging about $54 per month, will be insufficient to cover the rising costs of essentials like healthcare and housing. The debate continues over whether the current formula, based on the CPI-W, accurately reflects the expenses faced by retirees, with some advocates pushing for alternative measures like the CPI-E.

          <p>During a visit to Israel, U.S. Vice President JD Vance strongly criticized a preliminary vote by the Israeli parliament on a bill that would authorize the annexation of the occupied West Bank, calling the move an "insult."

The diplomatic push underscores the U.S. administration's efforts to maintain momentum on a brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and prevent actions that could threaten the peace process.</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) has issued an apology and a detailed explanation for a massive outage that took numerous major platforms, including Snapchat and Reddit, offline. The company stated the disruption was caused by a dormant bug and faulty automation within its largest data center region, which prevented its internal systems from correctly resolving domain names. The incident has highlighted the internet's heavy reliance on a few dominant cloud providers, prompting calls for companies to build more resilient systems that can fail over to alternative providers during such events.</p>

          <p>According to multiple sources, France is retreating from a recent pledge to take more forceful action at sea to stop small boats carrying migrants across the English Channel. A promised new "maritime doctrine" to intercept and turn back boats is now being described as a "political stunt," with French political turmoil cited as a key factor in the delay. This development is a setback for the UK government's strategy to curb the crossings, as dangerously overcrowded inflatable boats continue to depart from the French coast on a near-daily basis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the contemporary debate over free speech often misses a crucial point articulated by philosopher John Stuart Mill: truly free speech originates from free thought. Speech is not free if it is constrained by prejudice, hatred, or a desire to manipulate; rather, it is the result of a conscientious process of learning, discussion, and openness to criticism. The author contends that the greatest threats to this ideal today are not censorship, but rather the systemic attacks on educational and scientific institutions and the consolidation of media ownership by billionaires, which undermine the public's ability to think freely.</p>

Despite rates hovering near a one-year low, affordability remains the top concern, with many buyers waiting on the sidelines in a standoff with sellers who are still pricing for a more competitive market. To cope with current conditions, buyers are utilizing strategies like interest rate buydowns, adjustable-rate mortgages, and borrowing from family. Meanwhile, a significant number of sellers are reducing their asking prices to attract buyers. (not investment advice)</p>

The author suggests that while reading habits have changed, the proliferation of podcasts and newsletters indicates a continued demand for thoughtful content, and AI tools simply represent a technological evolution, similar to the calculator. Instead of assigning traditional essays that AI can easily write, educators should adapt by creating assignments that require personal insight and focusing on in-class discussions to foster critical thinking, freeing students from the busywork of mastering arbitrary grammar rules.</p>

The trial concluded with no conviction after a lengthy and complex legal battle, which included a successful challenge by bereaved families to have the prosecution proceed.

To maximize deductions, experts suggest "bunching" donations now, potentially through a donor-advised fund, rather than spreading them out over future years under the less favorable tax regime.
