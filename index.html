          <p>Sam Altman's Worldcoin, a global identity verification system using iris scans and blockchain, has launched six U.S. retail locations in Austin, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nashville, Miami, and San Francisco. The system involves scanning a person's face and iris with a spherical device called an Orb, creating a unique "IrisCode" to verify humanity and prevent fraud. Users receive Worldcoin's cryptocurrency, WLD, and can use their World ID for sign-in with integrated platforms like Minecraft and Reddit. Visa will introduce the "World Visa card" for those scanned by World, and Match Group will pilot World ID with Tinder in Japan, with data being split among multiple parties using cryptography to prevent compromise.</p>

          <p>China has lifted sanctions on Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) that were initially imposed in 2021, a move seen as a charm offensive to improve relations with the EU amid global uncertainty caused by U.S. tariffs. The sanctions, which targeted MEPs accused of spreading disinformation about Xinjiang, had halted a trade and investment deal between the EU and China. While the European Parliament welcomes the move, they maintain that they will continue to address human rights issues within China. Experts suggest that this action is aimed at facilitating trade discussions, but significant obstacles remain due to China's ties with Moscow and the EU's continued sanctions regarding human rights abuses in Xinjiang.</p>

          <p>The United States military is equipped for short, high-intensity conflicts but lacks the necessary personnel and materiel for a prolonged major war, according to this New York Times article. The military has traded a larger, more durable force for a high-tech but brittle one, prioritizing expensive, cutting-edge weapons over sufficient firepower. The article highlights shortages in artillery shells, precision-guided missiles, and trained personnel, while also noting maintenance deferrals and shipbuilding capacity deficits compared to China. The authors argue that increased efficiency and scope in ammunition purchases, multiyear purchasing contracts, and improved recruiting efforts are needed to address these shortcomings and ensure the U.S. can retain its position as a global power.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have finalized a minerals deal that grants the U.S. preferential access to Ukraine's natural resources in exchange for the establishment of a reconstruction investment fund. This agreement, pursued by U.S. President Donald Trump, is intended to facilitate Ukraine's economic recovery and support a peaceful resolution to the conflict with Russia. The partnership aims to jointly develop and monetize Kyiv's deposits of rare earths, critical minerals, oil, gas, and other natural resources. U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent emphasized that this deal sends a clear message to Russia about the Trump Administration's commitment to a sovereign and prosperous Ukraine.</p>

          <p>In her first major address since leaving Washington, Kamala Harris criticized President Trump's first 100 days, expressing concerns about a potential constitutional crisis if the courts and Congress fail to check the President's power. Speaking in San Francisco, Harris argued that the Trump administration is deliberately implementing a decades-long agenda to undermine American democracy, citing reckless tariffs and attacks on truth tellers. She saluted Democratic leaders speaking out against Trump and urged Americans to organize and stand up for fundamental rights, while also acknowledging that things may worsen before improving. Harris's remarks come as she considers a potential run for California governor in 2026.</p>

While American ideals and images still resonate overseas, there is a sense that the U.S. is withdrawing from its traditional role as a champion of democracy.

          <p>During a NewsNation town hall event, President Donald Trump claimed he hadn't made any mistakes in his first 100 days in office, prompting laughter from the audience. When asked about his biggest mistake, Trump insisted he didn't believe he had made any. He acknowledged a "transition period" but promised "tremendous economic victories" in the coming year. Trump's claim comes amid reports of a historically unpopular first 100 days, with policies causing economic contraction and strained relations with allies.</p>

Luka Dončić had 28 points for the Lakers, but the team struggled to find consistency and ultimately lost in the first round for the second consecutive postseason.

          <p>European auto giants, including Stellantis and Mercedes, have reported a sharp drop in first-quarter profit and suspended or cut full-year financial guidance, citing uncertainty related to U.S. President Donald Trump's trade tariffs. Trump imposed a 25% tariff on automotive imports into the U.S. in early April. While Trump sought to ease these levies on Tuesday, analysts warn the fast-changing nature of his trade policies will likely keep long-term corporate investment decisions at bay. Volvo Cars and Porsche also adjusted their financial outlooks, highlighting the significant impact of tariffs on the automotive sector.</p>

Despite internal doubts about his potential to stand out among £1bn worth of talent, Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca gave George a chance in pre-season. FootballTransfers.com estimates George's transfer value has increased from £2m to over £10m due to his rapid progress. George's father hired a goalkeeper and personal coach, David 'Guru' Sobers, to raise his game alongside his work at Chelsea.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Israeli reservists, including former Mossad head Danny Yatom, have signed letters demanding an end to the Gaza war and a focus on securing the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas. The reservists argue that continuing the war does not contribute to its declared goals and endangers the hostages' lives. Reports suggest that reserve attendance has dropped significantly, creating a looming crisis for the military. Critics are increasingly questioning the morality of the war, and polls indicate growing public support for a ceasefire and hostage release deal.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Glasgow University have confirmed the increasing presence of mosquitoes in Scotland, with over 20 different species now identified, including some in Shetland, the most northern location to date. This discovery is attributed to a successful citizen science project where the public submitted over 700 potential sightings and photos. The insects are commonly found in woodland areas and cities, with larvae discovered in stagnant water. Researchers believe that public reporting has guided them to key mosquito habitats, leading to a better understanding of the mosquito population in Scotland.</p>

The attorney representing the students said they deeply regret their involvement in what began as a misguided attempt at a prank. Authorities are working together to prosecute the case, and those who turned themselves in will likely avoid criminal records and face prosecution in family court.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has held its policy rate at 0.5% for the second consecutive meeting, citing concerns about the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on the country's economy. While Japan has seen headline inflation above the BOJ's 2% target, allowing room to raise rates, Trump's tariffs have complicated plans to normalize monetary policy. The central bank highlighted that it will continue to raise its policy rate "if our economic and price forecasts are realised." The BOJ expects inflation to range between 2-2.5% in fiscal year 2025 and 1.5 to 2% in fiscal year 2026.</p>
