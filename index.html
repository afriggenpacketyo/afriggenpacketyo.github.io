          <p>Virginia Giuffre, who accused Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein of sexual abuse and sex trafficking, has died by suicide at the age of 41. Her family confirmed her death, stating that she had been a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and that the toll had become unbearable. Giuffre was a prominent campaigner against sexual abuse and was closely associated with the Me Too movement. She had reached an out-of-court settlement with Prince Andrew in 2022, who denied all claims against him.</p>

          <p>Canadians are heading to the polls on April 28th in what is expected to be a close race between the ruling Liberals, led by newly appointed Prime Minister Mark Carney, and the opposition Conservatives, led by Pierre Poilievre. Carney, a former head of the Banks of Canada and England, is politically untested but hailed for his financial expertise. Poilievre, a long-time MP, advocates for a low-tax, small government approach and has been critical of Liberal policies.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the United States and Japan are nearing a tariff agreement, as Ryosei Akazawa prepares for a second round of talks in Washington. Japan is seeking reconsideration of duties impacting its exports, particularly from the automobile industry. Trump views these talks as a high priority and a test case for other countries seeking tariff relief. The U.S. Trade Representative's office stated they are constantly engaged with Japan on alternative trade arrangements to potentially eliminate or reduce the current tariffs.</p>

          <p>Shedeur Sanders, the Colorado quarterback, experienced a disappointing slide in the NFL Draft, compounded by a prank call during a live stream. An imposter, pretending to be a general manager, told Sanders he would "have to wait a little longer" after Sanders answered the phone expecting to be drafted. This incident occurred after Sanders was passed over in favor of other quarterbacks projected to be drafted later, leading to speculation about the reasons for his slide. President Trump weighed in, criticizing NFL owners for not drafting Sanders.</p>

While it avoids explicitly demanding the return of all Russian-seized territory or NATO membership, the plan suggests a search for common ground, and Zelensky's attendance at Pope Francis' funeral depends on the security situation in Ukraine.</p>

The 100 hertz sound stimulates the inner ear, improving balance and reducing symptoms like lightheadedness and nausea. This finding is particularly relevant with the rise of self-driving vehicles, where passengers are more prone to motion sickness. The study, involving around 80 volunteers, showed a 70-80% alleviation of symptoms after exposure to the sound.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's Pentagon office reportedly set up a system allowing him to access Signal messages, bypassing standard Defense Department security protocols. A monitor in his office provided remote access to his personal cellphone, enabling him to check messages in a secure facility where cellphones are prohibited. This arrangement has raised security concerns. Hegseth has faced criticism for sharing details about U.S. airstrikes in Yemen in a private Signal group.</p>

The new sequence will consist of three numerals followed by three letters and one numeral (e.g., “000AAA0”). The change is occurring sooner than expected due to an increased rate of new plate issuances, possibly driven by fears of rising car prices due to potential trade wars.

China has become more vocal in its criticism of American “bullying” and is seeking international support for its position, reaching out to neighbors and long-term US allies.

          <p>The Trump administration has accused UC Berkeley of failing to disclose millions of dollars in foreign funding, marking the second top school to come under investigation this month. The Department of Education will examine UC Berkeley's alleged failure to fully and accurately disclose significant funding received from foreign sources. This inquiry revives a 2023 House subcommittee investigation into the Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute, a partnership between UC Berkeley and China’s Tsinghua University. The audit is part of a broader campaign against elite universities.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly attack in Kashmir, this article examines the major militant groups operating in the region, exploring their local impact and global connections. The Resistance Front (TRF), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) are among the key players in the insurgency. These groups aim to challenge control over Indian-administered Kashmir, and some have ties to transnational jihadi networks. The fluid militant landscape makes it difficult to track, contain, or eliminate these groups.</p>
