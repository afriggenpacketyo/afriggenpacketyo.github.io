          <p>England's dramatic run to the Euro 2025 final is being credited to the impactful substitute duo of Chloe Kelly and Michelle Agyemang. Their late-game heroics draw parallels to the 2022 tournament's 'super subs,' Alessia Russo and Ella Toone. Both Kelly and Agyemang were instrumental in turning deficits into victories in the quarter-final against Sweden and the semi-final against Italy. Their ability to change the game from the bench has been a decisive factor in propelling the Lionesses to another major final.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has reached a new trade agreement with Japan that will impose a 15% tariff on Japanese imports, a reduction from a previously threatened 25% rate. President Trump announced the deal, claiming it would generate a significant number of American jobs. Following the announcement, Japanese Prime Minister Sherigu Ishiba stated he was prepared to discuss the details after being briefed by his negotiator. This agreement marks a notable development in U.S.-Japan trade relations under the current administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused former President Barack Obama of "treason," alleging he plotted to sabotage his first term by linking him to Russian election interference. The claim stems from a recently declassified report that Trump asserts shows evidence of a "coup." A spokesperson for Obama's office sharply rebuked the accusation, calling it a "ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction." The article provides context on the origins of the Russia investigation and subsequent findings by the intelligence community.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced new trade agreements with both the Philippines and Indonesia, setting a 19% tariff rate on goods imported into the U.S. from both nations. In return, the deals reportedly involve the Philippines and Indonesia lifting nearly all tariffs on imported American goods, creating more open markets for U.S. products. These agreements are part of a broader administration push to finalize trade pacts ahead of an August 1 deadline for countries to avoid facing higher tariff rates.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has disciplined dozens of students who participated in a pro-Palestinian protest that involved seizing part of a campus library in May. The sanctions range from probation and multi-year suspensions to degree revocations and expulsions. This action follows a period of intense scrutiny and financial penalties from the Trump administration, which criticized the university's handling of campus protests and alleged antisemitism. Pro-Palestinian groups have condemned the disciplinary measures as excessively harsh and politically motivated.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has recessed early for its August break, a move reportedly made to avoid a vote on releasing more files related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. A bipartisan bill to disclose the information had been gaining momentum, putting House Speaker Mike Johnson in a difficult position between his conference and President Trump, who has resisted such calls. The episode highlights how the ongoing scandal has become a politically potent and disruptive issue within Congress.</p>

The decline was attributed to the company's forecast for the third quarter, which came in below market consensus. While the company's largest division, analog chips, showed strong growth of 18%, the weaker outlook for the coming months concerned investors, signaling potential headwinds for the key semiconductor supplier.

          <p>China's ambitious Qianfan satellite network, intended to be a global competitor to SpaceX's Starlink, is reportedly experiencing significant delays. The primary obstacle is a severe shortage of available rockets, as the country's launch manufacturing and capacity have not kept pace with the explosive demand for satellite deployment. This bottleneck is hindering the project's aggressive timeline, which aims to place over 15,000 satellites into orbit to provide worldwide direct-to-phone internet services.</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board's final report on the 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene Peltola Jr. identifies several contributing factors. Investigators concluded the small plane was overweight for takeoff, loaded with moose meat, and experienced significant aerodynamic drag from a set of moose antlers affixed to the right wing strut. The NTSB determined that these factors, combined with downdrafts in the area, likely resulted in the pilot being unable to control the aircraft over the remote Alaskan terrain.</p>
