          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty to charges of making false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding during his 2020 Senate testimony. The charges stem from allegations that Comey lied about authorizing an FBI staffer to be an anonymous source and made misleading statements. His defense team plans to file motions to dismiss the case, alleging vindictive prosecution and unlawful appointment of the prosecutor. The trial is scheduled to begin in early January, and Comey maintains his innocence. </p>

          <p>Recent social media claims suggest that Generation Z is leading a religious revival in the United States, with young people attending church more frequently. However, this article examines the data and finds that these claims misrepresent the findings of a Barna Group study. While the study notes a slight increase in church attendance among Gen Z churchgoers, it does not suggest an overall increase in religious affiliation. Pew Research Center data indicates that older Americans are still more likely to participate in religious services, and there is no sign of a religious revival among Gen Z. </p>

          <p>Jihad Al-Shamie, the perpetrator of the Manchester synagogue attack, made a 999 call pledging allegiance to ISIS before being shot dead by police. Al-Shamie drove his car into worshippers, killing two Jewish men, Melvin Cravitz and Adrian Daulby. One of the victims, Daulby, was killed by a police bullet, and several others were injured in the attack. The incident occurred after Al-Shamie was asked to leave the synagogue due to suspicious behavior. </p>

The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) identified the projectiles as consistent with pre-1925 French and German manufactured chemical weapons. The type of chemical fill could not be determined. The grenades will be destroyed at a specialized facility in Belgium, as the Netherlands lacks the capability to handle such objects. </p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed surprise at AMD's deal with OpenAI, where AMD offered 10% of the company in exchange for a commitment to purchase 6 gigawatts of AMD chips. Huang acknowledged the deal as clever but questioned the decision to give away equity before building the product. He emphasized that Nvidia's investment in OpenAI is different, allowing Nvidia to sell directly to the ChatGPT creator. Huang also confirmed Nvidia's involvement in xAI's latest funding round and expressed enthusiasm for Elon Musk's ventures. </p>

          <p>Gisele Pelicot, a survivor of sexual assault, appeared in court to confront one of the men appealing his conviction in the Mazan case. Pelicot's former husband drugged her and invited dozens of men to sexually assault her over nearly a decade. While Dominique Pelicot and 49 other men did not appeal their convictions, one man maintained his innocence, blaming Pelicot's husband for "luring" him to the home. Pelicot directly challenged the appellant, asking when she ever gave consent and urging him to take responsibility for his actions. </p>

          <p>Research suggests a new side effect associated with popular weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy is becoming more common. Researchers have found abnormal patterns of FDG uptake in patients taking GLP-1 drugs during oncologic FDG PET-CT scans. These patterns could be misinterpreted by doctors, leading to unnecessary tests, incorrect cancer staging, and treatment delays. Researchers advise imaging professionals to carefully document patients' medication history to avoid misinterpretations and ensure accurate diagnoses. </p>

          <p>This article critiques Attorney General Pam Bondi's performance during a congressional oversight hearing, arguing that she prioritized loyalty to President Trump over her responsibilities as a constitutional officer. Bondi repeatedly attacked Democratic senators, refused to provide factual information, and praised Trump excessively. Her behavior demonstrated a disdain for the legislative branch and its role in holding the executive accountable. The author contends that Bondi's actions reflect Trump's view of Congress as subordinate to the presidency. </p>
