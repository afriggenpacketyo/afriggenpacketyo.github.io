          <p>Australian stocks experienced a downturn after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a second consecutive term, signaling a desire for policy stability amid global economic uncertainties. The S&P/ASX 200 index reversed earlier gains, while the Australian dollar strengthened slightly against the US dollar. Across Asia, the offshore Chinese yuan and the New Taiwanese dollar also saw gains against the greenback. Meanwhile, discussions between representatives of Gautam Adani and the Trump administration regarding bribery charges have accelerated, potentially leading to a resolution soon.

          <p>President Trump has directed the Bureau of Prisons to reopen and significantly enlarge Alcatraz, the infamous former prison, as a "symbol of law, order, and justice." The move aims to house America's most violent offenders, despite the federal prison system already having considerable vacancy. Experts question the necessity and cost-effectiveness of the project, while critics like Nancy Pelosi denounce the proposal as unserious. Alcatraz, closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, would require substantial investment to become a functioning prison again, according to legal experts.</p>

          <p>President Trump has declared foreign film production a national security threat and proposed a 100 percent tariff on movies produced outside the United States. This declaration has sparked uncertainty regarding its application to independent foreign films, movies receiving foreign tax incentives, and films with overseas scenes or postproduction work. The move aims to incentivize Hollywood to bring production back to the United States, where thousands of film workers have lost jobs due to cheaper foreign locales and tax incentives offered by countries like Britain, Hungary, and Canada, according to this article.</p>

They highlight the rise of Chinese AI models like DeepSeek, which are nearing or surpassing U.S. capabilities, and the widespread adoption of Chinese tech platforms globally. The authors suggest that the U.S. needs to learn from China's approach by openly sharing AI technologies, innovating faster, and promoting the diffusion of AI throughout the economy to maintain its competitive edge.</p>

General Munir's comments, including describing Kashmir as Pakistan's "jugular vein," reflect a hard-line stance shaped by his intelligence background and a belief in the religious dimension of the conflict with India. While international actors urge de-escalation, General Munir's rhetoric and actions suggest a shift toward a more Islamist and militarized approach to Pakistani politics and foreign policy, according to this New York Times article.</p>

          <p>Will Hutchins, best known for his role as the comically genteel sheriff Tom Brewster in the 1950s television western "Sugarfoot," has died at the age of 94. Hutchins' character, a law student who preferred cherry soda to whiskey, brought a wholesome and comedic presence to the popular western genre. After his success on "Sugarfoot," Hutchins continued to work in television and film, later finding a unique career as a traveling clown, according to this New York Times article.</p>

          <p>As a U.S. tax loophole ends, apparel makers that sell to America are forced to consider alternative markets or cheaper locations in and outside China. Tariffs and rising costs are forcing garment factories in Guangzhou, China, to consider relocating or suspending production. The end of the de minimis exception, which allowed packages worth less than $800 to enter the United States tax-free, has made it impossible for some to continue selling on platforms like Amazon. Many factory owners are considering moving to provinces with lower wages or to countries like Vietnam, though tariffs on Vietnam are also increasing, according to this New York Times article.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz is set to become Germany's new chancellor at a time of significant challenges for the country, including economic struggles and rising inequality. Merz's attempts to address migration have been controversial, and his leadership style has been described as divisive. The anti-Europe, pro-Russia Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party has gained ground, reflecting a broader trend of nationalist populism. The author argues that Germany needs a unifier, but Merz's track record offers little reason for optimism.</p>

          <p>Patsy Widakuswara, the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against the Trump administration's attempt to dismantle Voice of America (VOA), calls for the media to resist attacks on press freedom.

Widakuswara emphasizes the importance of VOA in providing information to audiences worldwide, particularly in countries with limited press freedom, and urges others to fight against authoritarian tendencies.</p>

          <p>A recent government survey revealed that the lack of trash bins in public areas is the biggest inconvenience for visitors to Japan. While the issue has improved slightly, many tourists still struggle to dispose of trash and must carry it back to their accommodations. The removal of public trash bins is attributed to safety concerns following terror attacks, but the lack of bins has led to increased littering in tourist spots, according to this Kyodo News article.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. tariffs reduce orders for Chinese goods, China is encouraging exporters to sell domestically, potentially worsening deflation. Local governments and e-commerce giants like JD.com are supporting this shift, but it could lead to price wars and reduced profitability for Chinese firms. After hovering just above zero in 2023 and 2024, the consumer price index slipped into negative territory, declining for two straight months in February and March, according to this CNBC article. Uncertain job prospects and weak consumer demand are also contributing to the deflationary pressure.</p>
