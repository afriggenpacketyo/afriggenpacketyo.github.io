          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated his country's readiness for a U.S.-brokered ceasefire, accusing Putin of seeking Ukraine's "total defeat" in an exclusive interview with ABC News. Zelenskyy emphasized the necessity of strong U.S.-led pressure to make Putin more pragmatic and halt the ongoing war. He addressed past tensions with Trump, particularly Trump's characterization of the conflict as a playground squabble, which Zelenskyy firmly rejected, describing Putin as a murderer endangering children. Zelenskyy also highlighted the importance of establishing a normal, equal professional relationship with Trump to advance peace negotiations, noting that the majority of wars ended even when both sides did not trust each other.</p>

          <p>Pomona College is experiencing a growing movement among students and faculty to reduce the pervasiveness of technology in campus life. Students are advocating for more tech-free classes and creating spaces for unplugged socializing, while professors are experimenting with limiting or banning electronic devices in their classrooms. The college is uniquely positioned to implement such changes due to its small size, ample resources, and focus on fostering a close-knit community. The hope is that by creating tech refuges, Pomona can differentiate itself and better prepare students to think critically and engage meaningfully in the real world.</p>

          <p>The US National Guard, a component of the US Armed Forces Reserve, is typically deployed for disaster relief but can also be used for internal security and military operations abroad. The command structure varies depending on the deployment location; governors typically command reservists within their states, while the US president assumes command during nationwide deployments. Recently, President Trump controversially deployed the National Guard in Los Angeles to address immigration protests, overriding the authority of California Governor Gavin Newsom, who criticized the move as deliberately inflammatory. The National Guard offers opportunities for both part-time and full-time service, with various benefits and allowances available to its members.</p>

          <h2>Poll Reveals Mixed Views on Trump's Deportation Program</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News poll indicates that the Trump administration's deportation program has positive net approval, particularly among Republicans, but is heavily influenced by perceptions of who is being targeted. Support for the program decreases significantly if people believe it is not primarily focused on dangerous criminals or if they feel the administration is deporting more people than expected. The poll also reveals concerns about the potential economic impact of the program, with more Americans believing it will weaken rather than strengthen the economy. Furthermore, large percentages of Americans believe it is unacceptable for legal residents to be mistakenly deported.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article critiques America's infatuation with narratives of powerful men, particularly in the tech industry, arguing that this obsession perpetuates harmful myths and hinders societal progress. The author examines examples like Adam Neumann of WeWork and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, highlighting how their stories are often romanticized and used to justify questionable behavior. The piece contends that this focus on individual genius distracts from systemic issues and reinforces an unequal distribution of wealth and power, ultimately undermining democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>A state-backed think tank in China has presented the country's "four core principles" as a framework for resolving disputes in the South China Sea. These principles include resolving disputes through consultation, managing differences through co-management, achieving mutually beneficial cooperation, and opposing external interference. The report blames regional tensions on external actors who fuel rival claimants' actions and weaken the willingness for maritime cooperation. China's expansive claims over the South China Sea are contested by several ASEAN member states.</p>

          <p>Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has accused First Minister John Swinney of running a "dishonest and disgraceful" campaign in the lead-up to a recent Holyrood by-election.

Swinney defended his "two-horse race" remark by asserting Labour's vote share had "collapsed" and Reform's support was surging.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's policies have diminished China's long-held fear of "peaceful evolution," a strategy the U.S. allegedly used to undermine communist regimes. The author, born in China in the 1960s, recalls being taught to be vigilant against American conspiracies aimed at overthrowing the Communist Party. However, the author contends that the U.S. has shifted away from nation-building efforts and lecturing other countries on governance, reducing the perceived threat of American subversion.</p>
