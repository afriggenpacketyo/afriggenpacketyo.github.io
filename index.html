          <p>The Sports Bra, a sports bar in Portland, Oregon, is dedicated to showing women's sports and has gained a loyal following since opening in 2022. Founder Jenny Nguyen aimed to create a space where women's sports are prominently displayed and celebrated, fostering a sense of belonging for young girls interested in sports. The bar has become a popular spot for fans and athletes alike, promoting gender equality in sports viewership and investment. Despite progress, inequalities persist, with female athletes facing online abuse and lacking representation in top-paid athlete lists, highlighting the ongoing need for equity efforts.</p>

          <p>Conservationists in Wales are using edible glitter to track endangered water voles, whose population has declined by 90% in the last 30 years. The glitter is mixed with apple chunks and fed to the voles, allowing researchers to track their movements via their droppings. Different glitter colors help distinguish between vole families and their territories, providing crucial data for habitat management and protection. The team is testing this method on captive-bred water voles before applying it in the wild, hoping to improve conservation efforts and aid the species' dispersal and survival.</p>

          <p>Palaeontologists in Alberta, Canada, are excavating a mass grave containing thousands of Pachyrhinosaurus bones to understand how these dinosaurs died 72 million years ago. The site, nicknamed the "River of Death," holds one of the largest bone beds in North America, offering a unique snapshot of a single community of animals. Researchers believe the dinosaurs were part of a migrating herd that was wiped out by a catastrophic flash flood. The team's findings are featured in the BBC series 'Walking With Dinosaurs,' which uses visual effects and science to bring this prehistoric world to life.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed in April, signaling continued concerns about consumption in the country's economy. Despite this, industrial output grew more than expected, indicating resilience against U.S. tariffs. The Chinese government acknowledges external uncertainties and the need for further economic recovery consolidation. Fixed-asset investment rose slightly below expectations, while the urban unemployment rate eased. China's exports surged, particularly to Southeast Asian countries, offsetting a drop in shipments to the U.S., though domestic demand remains a concern. Automobile sales grew only slightly, and the real estate sector continues to face challenges.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the New York Times argues that China is outpacing the United States in technological and economic dominance, particularly due to President Trump's policies. The article asserts that while Trump focuses on trade tariffs, China is making significant investments in industries like AI, electric vehicles, and renewable energy. China's state-driven economic policies and substantial investments in research and development are creating a 'Chinese century,' while the U.S. risks falling behind due to short-sighted policies and undermining its own strengths. The author advocates for increased investment in R&D and fostering international collaboration to avoid a diminished American future.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article reports that a credit rating downgrade by Moody's, coupled with concerns about rising government debt, are unsettling financial markets. The downgrade, triggered by a bill in Congress that would make Trump's tax cuts permanent, raises fears about the U.S.'s fiscal deficit. This development could potentially threaten the safe-haven status of Treasury bonds, leading to higher premiums for U.S. debt and causing ripple effects across global markets. Analysts suggest the downgrade exacerbates existing worries about Trump's tariff policies and their impact on the American economy. </p>

Treatment options for Biden, whose cancer is hormone-sensitive, are limited but include hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and steroids to stabilize the patient and control the cancer.

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill cleared a hurdle in the House after conservatives initially rebelled over concerns about insufficient spending cuts. Four conservative holdouts voted present, allowing the bill to advance with promises of minor modifications. The legislation, which extends tax cuts and increases spending on the military and border security, faces further challenges in the Rules Committee and potential opposition in the Senate. Conservatives seek stricter Medicaid work requirements and an end to clean energy subsidies, while moderates push for larger state and local tax (SALT) deduction caps.</p>

The buildup includes new tents, warehouses, and renovations to military infrastructure.

The system, modeled after the U.S.'s ESTA, will require travelers from visa-exempt countries to provide travel and personal information before arrival. This will allow the Immigration Services Agency to examine data in advance and deny boarding to individuals with criminal histories or records of illegal stays in Japan. The goal is to facilitate the government's target of attracting 60 million foreign tourists by 2030.</p>
