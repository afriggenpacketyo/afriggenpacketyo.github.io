          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has suspended his campaign for re-election, citing financial difficulties and media speculation as key factors. His decision comes after a judge's ruling made it unlikely his campaign would receive public matching funds, a consequence of a now-dismissed federal corruption case against him. The move alters the dynamics of the mayoral race, where Adams had been polling behind Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Adams will serve out the remainder of his term but has not endorsed another candidate.</p>

          <p>New York Giants wide receiver Malik Nabers suffered a devastating knee injury during a game against the Los Angeles Chargers, requiring him to be carted off the field. The injury occurred while he was attempting to make a catch, and initial reports suggest a potential torn ACL, which would end his season. Nabers has been a crucial offensive player for the Giants since his standout rookie year, and his absence represents a significant blow to the team's prospects. The injury happened during the first start for rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to send troops to Portland, Oregon, to counter what he described as "domestic terrorists" and protect federal facilities. The move has been met with strong opposition from Oregon's governor and Portland's mayor, who argue there is no need for military intervention and accuse the president of stoking conflict. This action is part of a broader strategy by the Trump administration to use federal forces to address unrest in various U.S. cities. The announcement has intensified the national debate over federal authority and local governance.</p>

          <p>Ty Cobb, who served as a White House special counsel during Donald Trump's first term, strongly criticized the president's current approach to the Justice Department. In an interview, Cobb described recent actions, including the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, as "wholly unconstitutional" and "authoritarian." He argued that the Justice Department is now merely doing the president's bidding by targeting political enemies, abandoning the principle of even-handed justice. Cobb stated that Trump's primary goal is to rewrite history regarding his past actions and legal troubles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Humberto, a major storm in the Atlantic, may interact with a nearby developing system, Tropical Storm Imelda, potentially creating a rare meteorological event known as the Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon occurs when two tropical cyclones get close enough to orbit a common center, sometimes merging into a single, larger storm. While forecasters consider this outcome unlikely in the current scenario due to the difference in storm strength, the possibility remains under observation. Humberto is currently a Category 5 hurricane, while Imelda is expected to bring heavy rain to the Bahamas and the southeastern U.S. coast.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto has rapidly strengthened into a powerful Category 5 storm, with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph, as it moves through the Atlantic Ocean. While no immediate watches or warnings are in effect for land, Bermuda is being urged to monitor the hurricane's progress closely. The storm is expected to remain a major hurricane for several days, generating large swells that will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast. It is the eighth named storm of the season, followed closely by Tropical Storm Imelda.</p>

          <p>Moldovans have voted in a crucial parliamentary election that is seen as a referendum on the nation's alignment with either the European Union or Russia. Pro-EU President Maia Sandu has accused Russia of "massive Russian interference," including disinformation campaigns and vote-buying, to sway the outcome in favor of pro-Moscow parties. The election pits Sandu's Party of Action and Solidarity against the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc in a tight race. The result will significantly influence the future direction of the country, which is strategically located between Ukraine and Romania.</p>

However, Democrats are insisting that extending the subsidies, which prevent premium hikes for millions, must be part of any spending bill.

While President Trump has previously denied requests for such long-range weapons, his administration is reportedly reconsidering due to frustration with Russia's refusal to engage in peace negotiations.

          <p>"One Battle After Another," the new film from director Paul Thomas Anderson starring Leonardo DiCaprio, opened at the top of the domestic box office with $22.4 million. The adult drama, which also stars Sean Penn and Regina Hall, performed solidly, meeting industry expectations and continuing a successful streak for Warner Bros. The film's success was seen as a positive sign for adult-oriented dramas, a genre that has struggled to attract audiences back to theaters since the pandemic. Strong critical reviews and awards buzz likely contributed to its successful opening weekend.</p>

          <p>European golfer Viktor Hovland was forced to withdraw from his Sunday singles match at the Ryder Cup because of a persistent neck injury. As a result, his match against American Harris English was declared a half, with each team receiving half a point. The unexpected withdrawal slightly alters the final day's calculations but leaves Team Europe in a commanding position to win the tournament. Hovland, a key player for the European side, had been dealing with the injury for two months and was unable to play after attempting his warm-up.</p>

          <p>The Danish government has ordered a temporary nationwide ban on all civilian drone flights after multiple unmanned aerial vehicles were spotted near airports and military facilities. The sightings, which caused significant disruptions including the temporary closure of Copenhagen's main airport, are being treated as a potential "hybrid attack." While no one has been officially blamed, Danish officials have noted that Russia poses the primary security threat to Europe. The ban coincides with Denmark hosting an EU summit, with a German air defense frigate arriving to assist with airspace surveillance.</p>

          <p>In a close referendum, Swiss voters have narrowly approved a government-backed proposal to introduce a voluntary electronic identity system, with 50.4% in favor. The plan, which keeps all user data stored on individual smartphones under government control, was revised after a previous version was rejected in 2021 over privacy concerns related to private sector involvement. Supporters argue the digital ID will streamline online transactions and bureaucratic processes. Opponents, however, remain concerned about the potential for data misuse and the erosion of privacy, despite the new safeguards.</p>

          <p>Turkey is facing a significant public health crisis, with diabetes prevalence nearly doubling over the past 20 years to affect over 16% of its adult population, the highest rate in Europe. Experts attribute the dramatic rise to national food policies, lack of exercise, and high consumption of carbohydrates and starch-based sugars. Compounding the issue is a high rate of undiagnosed cases and inadequate post-diagnosis care, leading to frequent hospitalizations for uncontrolled diabetes. Critics argue that the government's health policies have been insufficient to combat the growing obesity and diabetes epidemics.</p>

The protests turned violent, leading to dozens of deaths, though student leaders claim the violence was instigated by outside infiltrators.
