        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chery Automobile, China's largest vehicle exporter, saw its shares jump 11% in its Hong Kong debut, raising US$1.2 billion through an initial public offering. This successful market entry, despite the cancellation of its listing ceremony due to Super Typhoon Ragasa, underscores the company's aggressive global expansion strategy. Chery is rapidly growing in Vietnam, the Middle East, and Europe, with sub-brands like Jetour and Omoda establishing a presence in new markets. Although facing substantial tariffs in the US, Canada, and the EU, the automaker is mitigating these challenges by investing in local manufacturing in key regions, positioning it uniquely among Chinese EV manufacturers.</p>

          <p>The White House announced it might pursue permanent layoffs for federal workers, rather than temporary furloughs, if the government shuts down on October 1, a notable shift from past practices. A memo from the Office of Management and Budget instructed agencies to prepare "reduction in force" notices for programs deemed inconsistent with presidential priorities. This aggressive stance, aimed at cutting government programs like foreign aid and EV charging stations, has been criticized by Democrats as an intimidation attempt. The administration suggests these layoffs could be avoided if Congress passes a specific funding bill, highlighting intense political deadlock over the budget.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto has officially formed in the central tropical Atlantic and is projected to steadily strengthen over the next several days as it tracks northwestward. Currently, there are no immediate coastal watches or warnings, but this storm, alongside another brewing system in the Caribbean, could potentially affect the Southeast U.S. coast from Florida to North Carolina. Humberto, the eighth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is in a favorable environment for intensification due to warm ocean temperatures. Authorities continue to monitor its path and development closely.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated national security investigations into imports of robotics, industrial machinery, and medical devices, potentially paving the way for new tariffs. These "Section 232" probes will assess if such imports threaten U.S. national security, covering a wide range of products from PPE like surgical masks and N95 respirators to complex medical equipment. The aim is to bolster domestic production and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains, especially from countries like Mexico and China. Any new duties would compound existing tariffs, signaling a continued aggressive trade policy that could significantly impact various U.S. industries, including automotive.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors are reportedly close to deciding whether to indict former FBI Director James Comey, a long-standing target of President Trump. The potential charges may relate to Comey allegedly lying to Congress in 2020 about the FBI's Russia investigation, with the five-year statute of limitations expiring soon. Concerns have been raised by legal experts regarding significant presidential pressure on this probe, especially after the recent resignation of an interim U.S. Attorney who reportedly opposed charging Comey.

          <h2>Federal Judge Rules Against Trump Administration on FEMA Grant Immigration Conditions</h2>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled it unconstitutional for the Trump administration to tie Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants to states' cooperation with immigration enforcement. This decision is a legal setback for the administration's efforts to penalize "sanctuary" jurisdictions by withholding critical emergency preparedness funding. Twenty mostly Democratic states had sued, arguing the policy violated federal law and the Constitution, and could jeopardize billions in disaster aid. The court sided with the states, deeming the policy "arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional," though the administration vows to appeal and continue its push against sanctuary policies.</p>

          <p>Canada's Supreme Court has temporarily stayed the planned execution of nearly 400 ostriches at a British Columbia farm, following protests from the owners over an avian flu outbreak. This decision halts the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's cull order while the farm owners appeal, a case that has garnered international attention, including from U.S. officials. Police had previously arrested the owners for obstructing agents. The CFIA argues the cull is necessary to prevent the virus's spread and mutation, but the court's intervention mandates the agency to maintain custody and care for the birds.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's massive $100 billion investment in OpenAI, announced recently, will largely be used by the AI startup to lease Nvidia's advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) rather than for upfront purchases. This arrangement allows OpenAI to spread its significant compute costs over several years, with Nvidia bearing more of the financial risk. The investment is crucial for funding OpenAI's ambitious AI supercomputing facilities, including the first gigawatt-capacity data center expected in late 2026. While concerns exist about the "circular nature" of such deals, OpenAI emphasizes driving real demand for its services to cover these substantial infrastructure investments.

In the first seven months of this year, the continent imported 9,516 megawatts worth of panels, a significant increase from the previous year. South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria are leading this surge, largely due to massive energy plants developed by Chinese firms, such as PowerChina's 342MW De Aar Central Solar Power Plant in South Africa. China's dominance in global solar technology production makes these imports a key indicator of Africa's accelerating shift towards renewable energy.</p>

Over 500 acres have been restored in the past 15 years, with another 500 planned.

          <p>Joshua Jahn, 29, has been identified as the suspect in the deadly Dallas ICE facility shooting, where he opened fire "indiscriminately" from a rooftop, killing one detainee and wounding two others before taking his own life. Law enforcement sources confirm the "anti-ICE" messages found on shell casings near Jahn, suggesting a potential motive. Childhood friends described Jahn as primarily interested in video games and internet culture, with no prior political leanings, making the incident a shock. University records show he briefly attended UT-Dallas over a decade ago.</p>

          <p>The U.S. tech sector and smaller firms are scrambling after President Trump signed an executive order imposing a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications for skilled foreign workers. While initially applying to future applicants, this significant cost could be crippling for startups and non-profits, potentially forcing some to relocate or halt hiring. Critics argue the policy, part of a wider program overhaul, is "anti-growth" and could lead to a "brain drain," prompting companies to offshore operations. Supporters believe major tech companies can absorb the cost, but the broader impact on innovation and the labor market remains a concern. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers at a U.K. government lab have made a significant breakthrough in nuclear fusion, designing an exhaust system that dramatically reduces the extreme heat inside fusion reactors. Working on the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak-Upgrade, the team developed a "Super-X divertor" with extended plasma "legs" to create a neutral gas buffer, cooling the plasma before it damages reactor walls. This innovation is crucial for making nuclear fusion a cheaper and more practical clean energy source, as it addresses a major challenge in safely handling intense plasma heat. The results open new pathways for designing future fusion machines.</p>

          <p>A former Riverside County sheriff’s deputy, Oscar Rodriguez, has been sentenced to one year in prison and 10 years probation for voluntary manslaughter, after killing his girlfriend's ex-partner while on duty. Initially deemed justified, a civil lawsuit revealed Rodriguez's romantic involvement with the victim's ex. Prosecutors, who sought a 10-year sentence, argued Rodriguez ambushed the victim without identifying himself and delayed medical care. The family's attorney criticized the lenient sentence, highlighting the "malicious conduct" and calling for greater accountability within the Sheriff's Department. Rodriguez resigned in 2016, and Riverside County settled the civil suit for $6.95 million.</p>
