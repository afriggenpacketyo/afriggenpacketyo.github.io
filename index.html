          <p>This article provides a historical overview of modern partisan gerrymandering, tracing its roots to the Republican "Redmap" project after the 2008 election. The strategy involved targeting key state legislative races in 2010 to gain control of the redistricting process, using advanced data and mapping software to create durable GOP majorities in Congress and statehouses. The piece explains how this effort reshaped American politics for over a decade, entrenching conservative power even in states with more Democratic voters.</p>

          <p>William H. Webster, the only person to have led both the FBI and the CIA, has passed away at the age of 101. Appointed to the FBI by Jimmy Carter in 1978 and the CIA by Ronald Reagan in 1987, Webster was known as a principled troubleshooter who restored public trust in both agencies following periods of scandal. His reputation for integrity and non-partisanship was central to his career, helping to navigate the institutions through turbulent times like the aftermath of Iran-Contra.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has briefed Chinese leader Xi Jinping on his upcoming summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, according to Chinese state media. While Xi reportedly endorsed the dialogue, Chinese foreign policy analysts express skepticism that the meeting will produce a lasting peace agreement for Ukraine or significantly alter strategic alignments. The call underscores the close ties between Moscow and Beijing, with Putin keeping his key ally informed as he prepares for high-stakes negotiations with the U.S. administration.</p>

          <p>An Australian scientist, Karl Kruszelnicki, reiterates the long-held scientific view that there is no mystery behind the Bermuda Triangle. He argues that the high volume of air and sea traffic in the notoriously tricky-to-navigate area means that, on a percentage basis, the number of disappearances is not unusual. This explanation, supported by institutions like NOAA and Lloyd's of London, points to a combination of violent weather, navigational challenges, and human fallibility, rather than any supernatural phenomena.</p>
