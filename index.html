          <p>An Israeli airstrike in central Gaza killed ten people, including six children, who were queuing for water, according to Gazan emergency officials. The Israeli military stated that a "technical error" caused a munition, aimed at an Islamic Jihad militant, to miss its target by several dozen meters. The Israel Defense Forces expressed regret for any harm to uninvolved civilians and confirmed the incident is under review. This event occurs amidst escalating Israeli attacks and reports of numerous other casualties in the region.</p>

          <p>A life-threatening flash flood emergency is ongoing in parts of Central Texas, with Kerr and Gillespie Counties under severe threat. The National Weather Service warns of rainfall rates up to four inches per hour, causing rapid river rises, such as the Lampasas River which rose over 22 feet in two hours. Authorities have suspended search operations in the Kerrville area and closed highways to protect lives amidst the dangerous conditions. The moderate risk of flash flooding persists for areas recently devastated by severe weather.</p>

          <p>Liverpool's first pre-season match was marked by emotional tributes to forward Diogo Jota and his brother, who died in a recent car crash. Before the game against Preston North End, fans and players participated in renditions of club anthems, and a wreath was laid in front of the traveling supporters. Players paid tribute after scoring in the 3-1 win, and the crowd sang Jota's song in the 20th minute, corresponding to his jersey number, which the club has retired. The event highlighted the deep connection between the player, the club, and its global fanbase.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's threat to impose 30% tariffs on EU imports, French President Emmanuel Macron has called for the European Union to "defend European interests resolutely." Macron urged the European Commission to accelerate preparations for "credible countermeasures" if a trade agreement is not reached by the August 1st deadline. While some European leaders called for calm and a pragmatic approach, Macron's firm stance reflects the shock and anger within the bloc over the escalating trade tensions with the United States, a key ally.</p>

          <p>French prison authorities have launched an investigation after an inmate successfully escaped from the Lyon-Corbas prison by hiding inside his cellmate's luggage. The 20-year-old prisoner, who was serving multiple sentences and was also under investigation for organized crime, took advantage of his cellmate's scheduled release on Friday. A prison administration director described the escape as an "extremely rare event" resulting from an "accumulation of errors" and "serious malfunctions." The prison has recently faced scrutiny for significant overcrowding.</p>

          <p>Experts are refuting baseless claims, amplified by some politicians, that the recent deadly floods in Texas were caused by cloud seeding, a weather modification technique. Scientists and meteorologists assert that this conspiracy theory is untrue and that current cloud seeding technology cannot generate the massive, sustained rainfall seen during the disaster. They warn that spreading such misinformation is actively harmful, as it erodes public trust in science and distracts from the real causes of extreme weather events, such as climate change and natural atmospheric patterns.</p>

          <p>The UK government will soon announce measures to make electric vehicles (EVs) cheaper to purchase, according to Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander. While she did not confirm if this would involve direct subsidies, Alexander guaranteed that the government will make the switch more affordable, with details to be revealed later in the week. The plan also includes a £25 million fund for councils to install "cross-pavement gullies" to facilitate charging for homes without driveways. The move aims to boost EV sales, which are currently lagging behind government-mandated targets.</p>

His departure is framed as part of a trend of traditional conservatives leaving Congress due to the current political climate.

According to Zheng, this approach is necessary to analyze Chinese public policy accurately and project the country's soft power.
