          <p>Navy veteran Jack McCain, son of the late Senator John McCain, discussed the plight of Afghan pilots and crew members who aided the U.S. military during the Afghanistan War. McCain emphasized the danger these individuals face under Taliban rule, highlighting reports of reprisal attacks despite promises to the contrary. He criticized the U.S. government's withdrawal planning and urged lawmakers to increase the number of Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs) to ensure the safety and evacuation of those who fought alongside the United States. McCain also dismissed the notion that Afghanistan is safe for anyone who has worked with the U.S., citing instances of imprisonment, torture, sexual assault, and killings by the Taliban.</p>

This glorification of violence by Iranian media is drawing condemnation, especially given the regime's history as a state sponsor of terrorism.

          <p>President Trump's warming relationship with the new Syrian leader, Ahmed al-Shara, has complicated Israel's military strategy in the region. After numerous Israeli airstrikes targeting weapons and preventing hostile groups from entrenching near Israel, Trump's meeting with al-Shara and plans to lift sanctions have led to a near cessation of these strikes. This shift in American foreign policy has undercut Israeli efforts to prevent the rise of another anti-Israel neighbor. While Israeli officials express skepticism about al-Shara's intentions, they appear to be de-escalating and opening a dialogue with the Syrian regime.</p>

          <p>A drone brigade in occupied Ukraine, known as Kaskad, is offering short-term, relatively safe deployments to politically connected Russians, providing a career boost upon their return. This "V.I.P. unit" allows officials to sidestep standard military service requirements and curry favor with the Kremlin. After stints in Kaskad, veterans often receive promotions and access to exclusive programs for war-tested officials. While ordinary Russian soldiers face indefinite deployments and high casualty rates, Kaskad members enjoy safer conditions and enhanced career prospects.</p>

          <p>During a Southern Conference tournament game, the Mercer baseball team walked off the field in protest after a Samford player, Michael Gupton, engaged in an elaborate home run celebration. Gupton's actions, which included leaping, skipping, and yelling towards the Mercer dugout, were deemed disrespectful, leading to the ejection of Gupton, a Mercer player, and two coaches. The game was paused for nearly 30 minutes as officials attempted to restore order, and the Mercer player's mother was ejected for jumping on the dugout roof. Samford ultimately won the game and advanced to the championship.</p>

          <p>Sen. Ron Johnson, a Republican from Wisconsin, has criticized President Trump's sweeping tax bill, warning that it could add trillions to the national debt. Johnson indicated that he believes there are enough GOP senators willing to block the bill unless there are serious spending reductions. The bill, which narrowly passed in the House, includes a tax break on tips and a $4 trillion increase in the debt ceiling. Other Republican senators, like Rand Paul, have also expressed concerns about the bill's impact on the national debt.</p>

          <p>Critics are alleging that Scottish councils are disproportionately targeting drivers with parking fines while neglecting environmental offences like dog fouling and littering. Figures show that councils issued over £25 million in parking fines in 2023-24, compared to just £9,700 in fines for dog fouling and £78,580 for littering. One MSP accused councils of effectively legalizing these environmental offenses while aggressively pursuing motorists.

This follows a federal judge's decision to block the administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll international students. The Trump administration had previously frozen over $2.2 billion in grants and contracts to Harvard, citing concerns about antisemitism and ties to the Chinese Communist Party.

          <p>An anti-corruption investigation in Guizhou province, China, has led to the downfall of officials linked to the region's big data sector. This investigation highlights the tension between state-led innovation and accountability, as the government intensifies its focus on strategically important industries such as big data and semiconductors. China aims to achieve self-reliance amid its competition with the United States, and anti-corruption efforts are increasingly targeting these key sectors.

While Americans carry an average of $67 in their wallets, the amount of cash one should keep depends on their routine. Experts recommend having enough to cover typical expenses like gas, food, or transportation, generally suggesting $50 to $100. Some emphasize the importance of cash during tech failures, with one planner recommending at least $50 for outages and emergencies. (not investment advice)</p>
