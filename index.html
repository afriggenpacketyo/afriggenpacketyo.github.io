          <p>A London-based entrepreneur, frustrated with the negative mental health impacts and "dating burnout" from apps like Tinder and Hinge, launched a new business focused on in-real-life (IRL) events. Her company, Haystack Dating, uses an algorithm to match attendees into small groups based on interests for activities like sports, fostering more authentic connections. This move taps into a growing trend of people, particularly millennials and Gen Z, abandoning dating apps in search of more meaningful and safer social interactions. The founder's personal experiences and social media presence helped drive the initial success of the venture.</p>

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is seeing a boom, where people spend on small, mood-boosting luxuries and significant experiences like concerts, even while cutting back on daily expenses. This phenomenon, an evolution of the "lipstick effect," reflects ongoing economic anxiety, with high inflation and interest rates making major life milestones like homeownership feel unattainable for many. Instead, consumers are finding joy in more immediate, accessible purchases, from makeup and homewares to collectible toys and event tickets. Analysts predict this trend will persist for several more years due to sustained global economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are employing aggressive, COVID-19-style public health measures to control an outbreak of the mosquito-borne illness chikungunya, raising public concern. In one instance, a village's Communist Party secretary led a task force to forcibly enter a residence to eliminate stagnant water where mosquitoes were breeding. These intrusive actions, which have also included attempts to take blood samples from feverish children without parental consent, are sparking complaints and fears of a return to the highly restrictive pandemic-era playbook. The measures highlight the government's heavy-handed approach to disease prevention.</p>

          <p>A Texas judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing former congressman Beto O'Rourke and his nonprofit, Powered by People, from financing the expenses of Democratic lawmakers who fled the state. The ruling stems from a lawsuit by Attorney General Ken Paxton, who accused the group of unlawfully using political funds for personal expenses like travel to help Democrats break quorum and block a GOP redistricting vote. O'Rourke condemned the move as a political attack on his organization's voting rights advocacy and vowed to continue fighting. The legal battle escalates the high-stakes political conflict over Texas's congressional maps.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), after suspending $584 million in federal research grants. The Department of Justice concluded that UCLA's response to pro-Palestinian encampments in spring 2024 was "deliberately indifferent to a hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli students," violating anti-discrimination law. University officials and California Governor Gavin Newsom have condemned the demand as "extortion" that would devastate the public university system. This marks a significant escalation in the administration's targeting of universities over alleged civil rights violations.</p>

          <p>Federal immigration agents conducted two raids at a Home Depot in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, detaining several day laborers and sparking criticism from advocates. The actions have raised questions about whether agents are violating a recent court order that prohibits them from targeting people based on race, location, or vocation without reasonable suspicion. This follows a similar raid dubbed "Operation Trojan Horse" at another L.A. Home Depot, prompting the city's mayor and attorney to investigate potential contempt of court. Federal officials maintain their operations are targeted and lawful, while critics argue they constitute racial profiling.</p>

          <p>Several protesters were arrested for disorderly conduct during a demonstration outside a federal immigration courthouse in Manhattan. Activists allege that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is operating an unconstitutional and covert detention facility on the 10th floor of the 26 Federal Plaza building, holding people in overcrowded and inhumane conditions. The protest, one of several this week, demanded access to the site for officials and journalists, which has been denied. The incident highlights ongoing tensions between immigration advocates and federal authorities over the treatment of detainees.</p>

          <p>A wave of protests is occurring across the U.K. against the government's use of hotels to house asylum seekers, fueled by local safety concerns and online organizing. The article explores a demonstration in Epping, Essex, which began after a hotel resident was charged with sexual assault, sparking fears among locals, particularly about the presence of all-male groups. While some far-right activists are involved, many protesters are local residents with no history of activism, reflecting a shift in public mood. The situation is complicated by a lack of official information about the hotel occupants, which breeds mistrust and anger.</p>

          <h2>New Biography Reportedly Details Prince Andrew's Scandals and Flawed Character</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new, deeply unflattering biography of Prince Andrew, titled "Entitled: The Rise and Fall of the House of York," chronicles his life through scandals involving sex, money, and arrogance. The book details his extensive connections to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, his abrasive personality, and his poor judgment in business and personal affairs. While containing some anecdotes of his courage during the Falklands War, the biography largely portrays him as an entitled and isolated figure. Royal commentators suggest the book effectively seals his fate, making any return to public life for the disgraced prince seem impossible.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim, allegedly from a retired pilot, stating that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times has been found to be without evidence. The fact-check points out that Epstein's island, Little St. James, does not have an airstrip, making it impossible for a plane of that size to land there; visitors arrived by boat or helicopter. Furthermore, the user who made the claim appeared to be wearing a costume pilot pin from an online retailer. The article highlights the spread of misinformation and the importance of verifying sources and basic facts.</p>

The ex-assistant, Dashiel Gables, accuses the rapper of wage violations, alleging he was paid a flat daily rate for shifts often exceeding 15 hours without overtime. The lawsuit also claims Rhymes used homophobic slurs and physically assaulted Gables by repeatedly punching him in the face, leading to his "constructive termination." Rhymes, whose real name is Trevor Smith Jr., has stated he is preparing a countersuit against the "disgruntled former assistant."</p>

          <p>Newcastle United manager Eddie Howe has stated that he "can't involve" striker Alexander Isak with the first team at present. The decision comes after the club rejected a £110m bid from Liverpool and the player reportedly wanted to explore his options, subsequently training alone. Howe emphasized that while there is no disciplinary issue, the current situation prevents Isak's participation with the group, casting doubt on his availability for the season opener. The situation adds to a frustrating transfer window for Newcastle, which is struggling to secure new signings while dealing with uncertainty.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to explore rule changes that would allow 401(k) retirement plans to include alternative investments such as private equity and cryptocurrencies. The move aims to "democratize" retirement savings by giving workers access to asset classes that have the potential for high returns but also carry higher risks, higher fees, and less transparency than traditional stocks and bonds. While proponents say it could boost long-term growth, experts caution that adoption by employers may be slow due to the complexity and volatility of these new investment options.

He suggests that improving the situation requires easing visa restrictions for foreign students and scholars to foster better understanding of China. His comments highlight the growing pressure on academic institutions to navigate an increasingly polarized and uncertain world order.</p>
