          <p>Despite objections from U.S. conservatives and Israel, President Trump is seeking a deal with Iran to limit its nuclear program and avoid war, with Gulf Arab states urging a negotiated settlement. Negotiations, led by Steve Witkoff, aim for creative solutions regarding uranium enrichment, such as a long-term freeze under enhanced inspections or a phased program. Iran insists on its right to civilian enrichment but may halt higher-level enrichment, while the U.S. seeks complete denuclearization. The article suggests sanctions could be phased out with American investment enhancing trust, though Iran wants guarantees the U.S. will adhere to any new agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Severe storms and tornadoes have swept across the Midwest, resulting in at least 26 deaths and widespread damage. Kentucky has been particularly hard hit, with a mass casualty event declared after a tornado tore through Laurel County, killing 17 and causing severe injuries. St. Louis, Missouri, also experienced significant damage, with five deaths reported and over 5,000 homes affected. The storms, part of a larger weather system, have left hundreds of thousands without power and prompted emergency declarations and curfews in affected areas.

          <p>New Jersey Transit executives and union representatives from the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen resumed negotiations on Saturday after the state's first transit strike in 40 years entered its second day, stranding thousands of commuters.

The union is seeking pay parity with other commuter railroads in the area, but the agency claims it cannot afford the increases.

          <p>Ukraine has criticized Russia's delegation to Istanbul, calling it a "sham" because they are not empowered to make decisions. Despite this, both sides agreed to exchange 1,000 prisoners of war, with Ukraine participating out of respect for the US President and Erdogan. Ukraine alleges that Russia demanded troop withdrawal as a gesture of goodwill, which they see as an ultimatum. Experts believe that the US wanted to see these negotiations, while Russia aims to spread its narrative. Further talks are expected, but a breakthrough is unlikely until there is a stalemate on the front lines.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria surprised senior officials at the Treasury Department. The announcement lacked specifics, causing officials to scramble for understanding, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was aware. The decision followed lobbying from Syria's transitional government for sanctions relief, which they blamed for economic struggles. The move aligns with support from Turkey and Saudi Arabia for normalizing relations with Syria, despite potential conflicts with existing sanctions.</p>
