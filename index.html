          <p>Protests in Los Angeles intensified following federal immigration sweeps, leading to clashes between demonstrators and authorities. President Trump deployed the National Guard to the city, a move criticized by California Governor Gavin Newsom as inflammatory. Demonstrations began after ICE officers executed search warrants, with protesters attempting to block agents. The unrest has spread, resulting in arrests and accusations of impeding immigration agents. The Department of Homeland Security reported numerous arrests, and the situation remains tense with ongoing debates between local and federal officials regarding the appropriate response. The protests highlight deep divisions over immigration enforcement policies. Optimism remains low given the tensions and political divisions.</p>

          <p>George Clooney has made his Broadway debut, starring in an adaptation of "Good Night, and Good Luck," a story about journalist Edward R. Murrow's confrontation with Senator Joseph McCarthy. Clooney, who co-wrote both the screenplay and the play, portrays Murrow as he challenges McCarthy's anti-communist crusade while facing pressure from his own network. The play highlights themes of truth, intimidation, and courage in the face of corporate media, echoing contemporary issues facing journalism. Clooney sees parallels between the play's historical context and today's media landscape, where governments may attempt to undermine the freedom of the press.</p>

          <p>The 60 Minutes article discusses how Israel's operation involving explosive pagers, which targeted Hezbollah militants, has significantly weakened Iran's regional influence. The Mossad's actions, coupled with subsequent Israeli airstrikes, led to the assassination of Hezbollah's leader and other key figures, causing the organization to implode. This disruption has reportedly undermined Iran's proxy war strategy, with Hezbollah losing its military strength and access to critical corridors in Syria. The article also notes the impact of these events on the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, and the broader implications for the region's political landscape.</p>

          <p>The UK faces an energy bill crisis due to grid limitations, where renewable energy firms are paid significant sums to curtail output because the system cannot handle the generated power. This inefficiency costs the country hundreds of millions annually, potentially reaching billions by 2030, and undermines promises of cheaper electricity through net-zero policies. The government is considering a radical solution: regional electricity markets to improve efficiency and lower bills. However, this proposal sparks intense debate, with concerns about potential cost increases for some consumers and undermining renewable energy investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has reacted to the deployment of federalized National Guard troops in her city, ordered by President Trump without the agreement of California's governor. Citing a rarely used law, Trump bypassed Governor Gavin Newsom and ordered two thousand national guard troops to Los Angeles for sixty days. This marks the first time in 60 years a president has used federal power to deploy national guard troops without state approval. Bass's response and the reactions of people in the city are being closely watched.</p>

          <p>During the Emergency in the mid-1970s, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's government quietly explored transitioning India to a presidential system, centralizing executive power and sidelining the judiciary. Inspired by Charles de Gaulle's France, the proposal aimed to bypass parliamentary constraints. However, the idea never fully materialized, although the Forty-second Amendment Act of 1976 expanded Parliament's powers and limited judicial review. The Janata Party later reversed many of these changes, and while Gandhi considered becoming president in 1982, she ultimately elevated Zail Singh instead.</p>
