        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A former Coast Guard lieutenant, Peter Stinson, has been charged with threatening to kill President Trump through numerous social media posts between 2020 and 2025. The posts allegedly included suggestions of using a gun, knife, or poison against the president, with Stinson offering support for a "contract hit." Federal investigators also cited a post made shortly after the 2024 attempted assassination of Mr. Trump where Stinson criticized the shooter's skills. Stinson, who investigators say identifies as a member of ANTIFA, has been ordered to be detained pending further hearings, and his attorney declined to comment. The optimism score is based on the seriousness of the threats and the potential for political violence. </p>

          <p>China is using its dominance in rare earth elements, essential for modern technologies, as leverage in trade talks with the United States. These elements are vital for consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical equipment, and military applications.

          <p>The Supreme Court will hear an appeal from Chevron, Exxon, and other oil and gas companies seeking to move lawsuits regarding coastal land loss and environmental degradation in Louisiana to federal court. These companies are contesting a 2024 federal appeals court decision that kept the lawsuits in state courts, where a jury previously ordered Chevron to pay $740 million for environmental damage. Chevron argues that because they operated as federal contractors during World War II, the cases should be heard in a more business-friendly federal court. Plaintiffs argue this is a delay tactic to avoid accountability for decades of environmental law violations. </p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have unveiled their version of President Trump's tax bill, proposing steeper cuts to Medicaid funding and a permanent extension of the $10,000 state and local tax deduction (SALT). This differs from the House bill, which raises the SALT deduction to $40,000 for incomes up to $500,000. The Senate version also includes a $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling and provisions to end taxes on tips, overtime, and auto loan interest, while making Trump's first-term tax cuts permanent. Republican leaders aim to pass the legislation by early July, but key sticking points remain unresolved. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's approach to the Israel-Iran conflict has been ambiguous, ranging from strong support for Israel to distancing himself from their actions. Three potential paths for Trump include escalating involvement by bowing to Netanyahu's pressure, maintaining the current course of limited involvement, or pulling back due to domestic concerns from the "Maga" movement. Escalation carries significant risks, while pulling back could alienate traditional Republican support. His unpredictability could be a strategic tactic or simply reflect conflicting pressures. </p>

          <p>President Trump and Prime Minister Starmer finalized a UK-US trade deal at the G7 summit, with Trump stating that Britain would be protected from future tariffs because he likes them. The deal covers aerospace and the auto sector, with the UK aerospace sector facing no tariffs and the auto industry having 10% tariffs, down from 25%. The steel industry still faces 25% tariffs, though the leaders pledged to work towards 0% tariffs on core steel products. Trump also expressed concerns about the Chinese owners of British Steel.

The judge deemed the cuts, which targeted research with perceived connections to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), as representing unlawful “racial discrimination and discrimination against America’s LGBTQ community.” Grants previously awarded to organizations and states that filed the lawsuit against the Trump administration were ordered to be reinstated. This ruling follows efforts by the Trump administration to shrink the federal government and national debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Flash floods caused by torrential rains in northern West Virginia resulted in at least six deaths, including a child, with rescue crews searching for missing people. The unexpected deluge caused infrastructure damage to roads, bridges, and highways, and submerged vehicles. Authorities said 2.5 to 4 inches of rain fell in about half an hour. The governor has declared a state of emergency in Ohio and Marion County. </p>

          <h2>Senate Republicans Seek to End $7,500 EV Tax Credit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 17:11:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senate Republicans proposed a tax and budget bill that would end the $7,500 tax credit on new electric vehicle (EV) sales 180 days after enactment. The bill would also immediately end the credit for leased EVs made outside North America and the $4,000 used-vehicle EV tax credit after 90 days. The proposal would exempt interest paid on auto loans for new cars made in the U.S. through 2028. President Trump recently signed a resolution to bar California's plan to end the sale of gasoline-only vehicles by 2035. (not investment advice)</p>
