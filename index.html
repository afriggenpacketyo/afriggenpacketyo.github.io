          <p>An SUV crashed into a Domino's Pizza in Herriman, Utah, rupturing a gas line and causing a powerful explosion that destroyed the restaurant. The incident occurred following a three-vehicle accident, and two bystanders heroically rescued the SUV's occupants just minutes before the vehicle was engulfed in flames. While multiple people from the initial crash were hospitalized, no one was inside the building during the explosion, and no firefighters were injured. The blast also caused significant damage to adjacent businesses, including a Jimmy John's and a Supercuts.</p>

          <p>Crews are making significant progress fighting the Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County, California's largest wildfire this year, which has burned over 80,000 acres. Containment has increased to 30% thanks to improved weather conditions and an influx of nearly 1,400 firefighting personnel. The fire, which began on Wednesday, has threatened around 50 structures and prompted evacuation orders for over 200 people. A primary concern is the fire's threat to the Carrizo Plain National Monument, home to endangered species, as officials hope to make more headway before a predicted midweek heatwave.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-06 19:29:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Washington Nationals have fired both manager Dave Martinez and general manager Mike Rizzo in a major organizational overhaul. The decision followed a weekend sweep by the Boston Red Sox and a prolonged period of struggle for the team, which currently sits at the bottom of the NL East division with a 37-53 record. Ownership cited the team's poor on-field performance and the need for a "fresh approach and new energy" as reasons for the change, despite Martinez and Rizzo's roles in the team's 2019 World Series victory. An interim general manager has been named, with a new interim manager to be announced shortly.</p>

          <p>Indirect ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas are scheduled to resume in Doha, Qatar, even as Israeli military operations persist in Gaza. Recent Israeli airstrikes have resulted in at least 38 Palestinian fatalities, with strikes hitting residential areas in Gaza City and a coastal area sheltering displaced people. The talks will focus on a U.S.-backed proposal for an initial 60-day truce involving a partial hostage release for an increase in humanitarian aid. However, significant disagreements remain, as Hamas seeks a permanent end to the war while Israel insists on retaining the ability to eliminate Hamas's capabilities.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has launched airstrikes against Houthi targets in three Yemeni ports, including Hudaydah, Ras Isa, and Saif, after issuing evacuation warnings to civilians. Israel's defense minister stated the strikes, dubbed "Operation Black Flag," targeted sites used to transfer weapons from Iran, including a power station and a ship hijacked by the group in 2023. The action is a response to the Iran-backed Houthis' repeated missile attacks on Israel and commercial shipping in the Red Sea since the start of the Israel-Hamas war.

The team is also battling a growing injury list, with key players Teoscar Hernández and Tommy Edman undergoing evaluations.

          <p>Two decades after the 7/7 London bombings, the UK's counter-terrorism capabilities have become significantly more sophisticated, but the nature of the threat has grown more complex and diverse. The 2005 attacks exposed failures in intelligence sharing and prompted a major overhaul, leading to better-funded, more integrated operations between MI5 and the police. However, the rise of the Islamic State group introduced the challenge of self-radicalized, lone-actor attacks, a tactic now mirrored by far-right extremists. While new laws and systems like Prevent are in place, authorities now confront a wider spectrum of threats, including violence without a clear ideology.</p>

          <p>An elite unit of the U.S. Coast Guard, known as surfmen, undergoes intense training at the treacherous mouth of the Columbia River, a spot nicknamed the "Graveyard of the Pacific." This area is one of America's most dangerous inlets, where powerful river currents collide with ocean waves. To earn their certification, these highly skilled rescuers must prove they can operate a lifeboat in extreme conditions, including 20-foot breaking waves and 50-knot winds. The four-week course at the National Motor Lifeboat School pushes trainees to their limits, preparing them to conduct life-saving missions in the most challenging maritime environments.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has warned its trading partners that they must negotiate new trade agreements by August 1 or face the reinstatement of higher tariffs. In April, President Trump had implemented a 90-day pause on steeper duties, which is set to expire. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that countries without new deals by the deadline will see their tariff rates revert to the higher April levels. The European Union is among those at risk of facing tariffs up to 50% on goods, though negotiations are ongoing and officials state they are making good progress on several fronts.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the deadly Texas floods, a debate has emerged between state officials and the National Weather Service (NWS) over the adequacy of the weather forecasts. Some Texas officials claim the predictions did not convey the historic severity of the storm, which caused the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in 45 minutes. The NWS counters that it issued timely flood watches and flash flood warnings, including an emergency alert sent to mobile devices hours before the worst flooding was reported. Meteorologists note the inherent difficulty in precisely forecasting such extreme weather events, highlighting the challenge of communicating risk effectively.</p>

The very openness that once defined its success is now viewed by some as a strategic vulnerability.

          <p>In 2007, long before his presidency, Donald Trump launched Trump Steaks, a brand of premium beef products marketed as "The World's Greatest Steaks." The USDA Prime-certified steaks were sold exclusively through the Sharper Image catalog and the QVC shopping channel. Despite the high-end branding, the venture failed after just two months due to extremely poor sales. Consumers were reportedly unimpressed with the product, citing a bland taste and grainy texture that did not justify the high price point of over $100. The brand's reliance on niche retailers and its inability to deliver on quality led to its quick demise.</p>

The bowling attack is also showing signs of strain, with pacemen accumulating high workloads and spinner Shoaib Bashir proving expensive.
