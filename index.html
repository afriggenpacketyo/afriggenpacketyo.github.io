No ticket matched all winning numbers in the previous drawing, though several smaller prizes were won across various states. The next drawing offers a winner the choice between the full annuity or a lump sum cash value of approximately $338.6 million before taxes, as the jackpot has not been won since May.</p>

The analysis suggests focusing on sectors like housing, mergers and acquisitions, and specific industrial and tech stocks that are poised to benefit from the Fed's more accommodative stance. It cautions against certain areas like enterprise software and healthcare, which may face headwinds from economic shifts (not investment advice).</p>

The Israeli operation targeted a military complex, a fuel depot, and power stations, resulting in four deaths and dozens of injuries according to Houthi officials. Israel is investigating why its defense systems failed to intercept the initial missile, which carried bomblets banned by over 100 countries.</p>

          <h2>Survey Reveals Nearly One in Five Retirees Face Financial 'Nightmare'</h2>

          <p>A recent Schroders survey indicates that 19% of American retirees describe their financial situation as a "nightmare," while only 5% feel they are "living the dream." This disparity highlights a significant retirement savings gap, with many seniors struggling with the impacts of inflation and higher-than-expected healthcare costs. The data suggests a widespread lack of preparedness, as the average savings fall far short of the amount people believe is necessary for a comfortable retirement (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A former Palantir employee argues that the company's AI-powered surveillance and targeting systems, known as Istar, represent an invisible but significant threat to civil liberties. These "AI kill chains" combine vast amounts of public and private data to track individuals for law enforcement and military operations, from ICE raids in the U.S. to warfare in Gaza. The author contends that this technology enables mass surveillance and violates constitutional rights, pulling everyone into a web of tracking that is becoming increasingly pervasive.</p>

          <p>Research suggests that cloves, a common kitchen spice, offer numerous health benefits beyond their culinary use, including potentially lowering blood sugar and improving gum health. The active compound eugenol gives cloves natural antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, which can help control plaque and fight harmful bacteria in the mouth. Studies have shown that daily consumption of clove extract can significantly reduce post-meal blood sugar levels, while the spice is also a good source of essential minerals.</p>
