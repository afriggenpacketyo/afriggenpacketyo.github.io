        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cross-party committee of UK Members of Parliament has criticized the Home Office for its failure to track whether foreign workers leave the country after their skilled worker visas expire. The Public Accounts Committee report highlights that the department has not analyzed exit check data since the visa route was introduced in 2020, relying on outdated airline passenger records. The committee also pointed to evidence of worker exploitation and accused the Home Office of being slow to address it, while the government maintains it is fixing the system and curbing net migration.</p>

          <p>The recently passed U.S. tax and spending package is poised to deliver a substantial budget increase to the U.S. Space Force, potentially raising its funding by 30% to nearly $40 billion by 2026. A significant portion of these funds, around $25 billion, is allocated for the 'Golden Dome' missile defense system, a project aimed at achieving space superiority amid growing military capabilities from China. This investment provides a major boost for defense and space contractors, especially as it contrasts with recent budget cuts at NASA, signaling a strategic pivot from space exploration to defense.

This high-level appointment places a veteran of the party's personnel management system in a critical position for managing affairs in the two special administrative regions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent critique from Chinese state media calling for tighter regulations on "blind box" toys, analysts believe toy company Pop Mart will remain resilient. The concern, which briefly caused the company's stock to drop, is that the business model entices heavy spending, particularly among minors. However, experts argue that Pop Mart's primary demographic consists of young adults with purchasing power, not children, which should insulate it from the most severe regulatory impacts. The company's strong and growing overseas sales, particularly in Southeast Asia and North America, also provide a significant buffer against domestic policy shifts.</p>

          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network (UKMON) believe that pieces of a small meteor have landed in the west Highlands of Scotland after it was seen streaking across the sky. The event, which produced an orange glow and a loud bang reported by dozens of people, was captured on security cameras. UKMON calculated that the meteor, which originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, likely scattered fragments over a wide area near Ben Nevis. While finding the meteorite pieces will be challenging in the mountainous terrain, the network has urged hillwalkers to be on the lookout.</p>

The government's core promises to stimulate growth and improve finances have been hampered by high inflation and borrowing costs, leading to a series of policy U-turns, particularly on welfare. While Labour has achieved some success on the international stage with new trade deals, it is struggling domestically with muted business optimism and the rising popularity of the rival Reform UK party.

          <p>The Australian hearing-implant company Cochlear has introduced its new smart hearing implant system in China, making it one of the first markets globally to receive the technology. The launch is being facilitated through Hainan province and Hong Kong. This advanced cochlear implant system is designed for individuals with severe to profound hearing loss for whom traditional hearing aids are no longer effective. Unlike hearing aids, the device bypasses damaged inner ear cells and directly stimulates the auditory nerve, offering a more effective solution for significant hearing impairment.</p>

          <p>A jury in Clackamas County, Oregon, has found former NBA player Ben McLemore guilty of sexual assault, unlawful sexual penetration, and one count of sexual abuse. The charges stemmed from an incident at a 2021 party where he sexually assaulted a 21-year-old woman who was incapacitated from alcohol consumption and unable to consent. The prosecution argued it was a clear case of assault, while the defense claimed the encounter was consensual despite both parties drinking. The district attorney's office emphasized that celebrity status does not grant immunity from prosecution.</p>

          <p>A family vacation in the Bahamas turned into a nightmare for a North Texas family after the father, a 42-year-old former Army Ranger, was nearly cut in half by a boat propeller. The man was snorkeling just 20 feet from shore when a small boat sped past, its propeller causing multiple leg fractures and deep gashes that almost detached his lower body. The boat's occupants reportedly looked back but did not stop. The man was airlifted to a hospital in Miami for treatment of his life-threatening injuries, and his wife is determined to find the individuals responsible for the hit-and-run incident.</p>

Russia's foreign ministry stated the move will boost bilateral cooperation in areas like energy and security. This recognition comes despite widespread international condemnation of the Taliban's human rights violations, particularly the severe restrictions placed on women and girls.</p>

While Newsom's political advisors deny the trip is about a presidential campaign, stating the focus is on helping Democrats in the 2026 midterms, the visit is seen as a significant political overture.
