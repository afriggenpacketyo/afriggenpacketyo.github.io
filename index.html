          <p>President Donald Trump has officially confirmed that he authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations within Venezuela, citing concerns over drug trafficking and the release of prisoners. The admission follows recent U.S. military strikes on vessels in the Caribbean, which have reportedly killed 27 people. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro condemned the move as an attempt to orchestrate a coup, while members of the U.S. Congress from both parties have expressed alarm that the administration is escalating toward conflict without proper oversight or authorization. Lawmakers are also demanding more evidence to justify the lethal strikes.</p>

          <p>Lakers guard Gabe Vincent delivered an impressive offensive performance, scoring 22 points and hitting six three-pointers during a preseason game against the Dallas Mavericks in Las Vegas. Vincent started the game by making his first five three-point attempts, electrifying the crowd before the Lakers ultimately lost 121-94. The game saw a different starting lineup for the Lakers, with key players like Luka Doncic sitting out the back-to-back contest. Unfortunately, teammate Jarred Vanderbilt left the game in the second quarter with a left quad contusion and did not return.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is under pressure after a high-profile espionage case against two men accused of spying for China was unexpectedly dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The head of the CPS stated the case collapsed because the government failed to provide evidence officially designating China as a national security threat at the time of the alleged offenses. This has sparked a political dispute, with the Conservative opposition accusing the Labour government of a cover-up to protect diplomatic relations with Beijing. In response, the government has insisted the decision was solely made by the independent CPS.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union's push to become a global AI hub by tripling its data center capacity is facing criticism over the immense water consumption required for cooling these facilities. Environmental experts warn that building these mega-projects in southern European regions already experiencing permanent water stress, like Spain and Greece, is unsustainable and lacks integrated policy thinking. While the industry asserts it is innovating with water-efficient technologies and using non-potable water, critics argue that the full water footprint, including off-site energy generation, is often overlooked. This places the tech boom in direct conflict with the continent's deepening water crisis.</p>

          <p>The People's Bank of China set the yuan's daily reference rate to its strongest point against the U.S. dollar in a year, signaling a move to bolster its currency. This decision comes amid growing market expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will implement further interest rate cuts to address economic risks, including those from U.S.-China trade tensions. A weaker dollar generally makes other currencies, like the yuan, more attractive. The adjustment reflects China's ongoing efforts to manage its currency's value in a volatile global economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has permanently closed its emergency care center in the Turgeau neighborhood of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, due to relentless gang violence that has made operations too dangerous for staff and patients. The facility, a critical lifeline in a city where gangs control 90% of the territory, had already been hit by stray bullets multiple times and was temporarily closed in March after an armed attack on its vehicles. This closure exacerbates a dire humanitarian crisis, with over 60% of the capital's health facilities now non-functional and a record 1.4 million people displaced by the violence.</p>

Mayor Muriel Bowser has expressed skepticism about the legality of President Trump's deployment of the National Guard to police American cities, stating she believes it is not legal for them to enforce local laws on U.S. soil. Speaking at a conference, Bowser highlighted that the D.C. National Guard is uniquely under presidential authority, unlike in states where governors have control. She warned that using the military for domestic crowd control creates a "slippery slope" that could threaten American democracy.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) had dropped the charges, stating it couldn't obtain evidence from the government labeling China a national security threat.

Trump stated his next goal is to convince China to follow suit, as his administration continues its broad campaign to cut off Moscow's crucial energy revenue streams.

          <p>A CDC scientist who was laid off during the government shutdown has warned that the Trump administration's workforce reductions will lead to "more preventable deaths." The scientist, who remains anonymous for fear of retribution, described the situation as chaotic, comparing it to an episode of 'Squid Games.' Since the shutdown began, approximately 600 CDC employees have been terminated, impacting entire programs, though a recent court order has temporarily halted the firings. The cuts come as the CDC has already lost nearly a quarter of its staff this year to resignations and layoffs, hampering its ability to respond to public health threats.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has downplayed hundreds of leaked racist and sexist text messages from leaders of the Young Republican National Federation, suggesting they were just "what kids do." In the messages, participants made offensive jokes, with one calling sexual assault "epic" and another writing "I love Hitler." Despite the fact that many participants are in their 20s and 30s, Vance argued against ruining their lives over "stupid" jokes. His comments contrast sharply with bipartisan calls for the individuals involved to resign, including from senior Republicans and the national federation itself.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is championing a plan to construct a large triumphal arch in Washington D.C., across the Potomac River from the Lincoln Memorial. The monument, dubbed the "Arc de Trump" by some, is intended to commemorate the nation's 250th anniversary in 2026 and would be privately funded by his supporters. Trump has displayed models of the arch, which is inspired by Paris's Arc de Triomphe, during White House events. This project is the latest in a series of aesthetic changes the president has initiated in the capital, including a gilded Oval Office makeover and a new White House ballroom.</p>

          <p>Journalist Mario Guevara, who was deported from the U.S. to El Salvador two weeks ago, has spoken out about his experience, calling his 100-day detention "horrible." Guevara was arrested by ICE agents in June while covering a protest near Atlanta. He alleges he was targeted for his journalism and faced threats and extortion while held in a federal prison alongside convicted felons. Despite being separated from his family, who remain in the U.S., Guevara says he has been received as a hero in El Salvador and plans to continue his reporting work while hoping to one day be reunited with his loved ones.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation into California's jury duty system has found that consequences for failing to appear are inconsistent and often non-existent across the state. Data from last year shows that one in four summoned Californians, over 2.7 million people, did not show up, yet 21% of counties admit they do not sanction dodgers at all. While some courts threaten fines up to $2,000, few actually collect them. Instead, many courts are focusing on incentives, such as better pay and more comfortable facilities, to encourage participation and ensure a diverse jury pool that is representative of the community.</p>

          <p>California officials are contemplating a shutdown of a major section of Interstate 5 in San Diego County due to safety concerns over a planned military event. The event, commemorating the Marine Corps' 250th anniversary and featuring Vice President JD Vance, will reportedly include live ordnance fired from Navy ships over the freeway onto Camp Pendleton. Governor Gavin Newsom's office has criticized the White House for a lack of coordination and communication, calling the event a "pompous display of power." A closure of the critical freeway, which carries over 80,000 travelers daily, would cause significant traffic disruptions throughout Southern California.</p>

          <p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued an emergency directive ordering all federal agencies to immediately patch vulnerabilities in products made by technology vendor F5. The order follows F5's disclosure that a nation-state actor gained long-term, unauthorized access to its source code and internal systems, creating an "imminent risk" to federal networks. Officials warn that the breach could allow attackers to steal credentials and potentially take full control of targeted systems. The Justice Department had delayed F5's public disclosure of the breach, citing national security concerns, in a rare and notable intervention.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Americans are facing long-term unemployment, defined as being out of work for 27 weeks or more, with nearly 2 million people in this category as of August. This figure represents the highest level since the pandemic in 2022, reflecting a brutal job market for many. One labor economist attributes the trend to economic uncertainty stemming from the White House, exacerbated by the government shutdown and ongoing tariff disputes. For individuals like Emily Groveman, who has been searching for a job for almost two years, the struggle has forced her to dip into retirement savings to survive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new policy requiring a $100,000 fee for each new H-1B visa is already causing significant disruption for small businesses and tech startups. Recruiters and entrepreneurs report that the steep cost is slowing hiring and shrinking the talent pool for highly specialized roles, particularly in fields like artificial intelligence where domestic talent is scarce. While some venture capitalists are negotiating for lower fees for startups, the policy is pushing many skilled immigrants to seek jobs only at large corporations that can afford the expense. The change is also forcing companies to explore upskilling existing staff and building new talent pipelines. (not investment advice)</p>
