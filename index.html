          <p>A new clinical trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine reveals that semaglutide injections can reverse life-threatening cases of liver disease, specifically metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Participants receiving semaglutide, traditionally a treatment for type 2 diabetes, experienced a significant reduction in liver inflammation and fat accumulation compared to those receiving a placebo. Researchers also noted improvements in liver fibrosis and blood measures, along with an average weight loss of 10.5%. While some adverse effects like nausea and diarrhea were more common in the semaglutide group, the findings suggest it could be a valuable treatment option for fatty liver disease, pending regulatory approval.</p>

          <p>The U.S. administration under President Donald Trump has imposed a 25% tariff on key auto parts, including engines, impacting Japan's car industry. This action follows the imposition of the same tariff rate on automobiles. To mitigate the impact, the administration is helping manufacturers relocate supply chains for car parts used in the United States over the next two years. Automakers can offset the tariffs for a percentage of the retail price of U.S.-assembled cars, offering a temporary relief measure. This tariff could significantly affect Japan, a key U.S. ally, given the auto industry's major contribution to its economy.</p>

          <p>Ghana's ambitious national cathedral project, envisioned by former President Nana Akufo-Addo and designed by architect David Adjaye, has become a symbol of economic mismanagement and political controversy. Intended as a national monument and a unifier for Ghanaian Christians, the $400 million project has stalled at its foundations, with only a large hole to show for the $58 million of public money spent. The new government has halted funding and launched an anticorruption initiative targeting the project. Critics argue that the cathedral was an inappropriate use of funds during Ghana's economic crisis, while supporters defend it as a future profit-making visitor attraction.</p>

China controls a significant portion of the world's rare earth elements reserves and refining capabilities, making it difficult for Ukraine to compete in the near term.

However, the assessment also anticipates significant costs, including over Â£10m per year for staffing and over Â£11m for initial training.

          <p>Singapore is holding its general election as Prime Minister Lawrence Wong faces his first major test against a strengthened opposition. The election is a key indicator of the People's Action Party's (PAP) popularity and Wong's leadership amid concerns about potential tariffs imposed by the U.S. and rising living costs. The PAP, which has ruled since 1965, is being challenged by the Workers' Party (WP), which seeks to increase its presence in Parliament. Wong has emphasized the need for a strong mandate to navigate economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Europe is grappling with its reliance on US credit card firms like Visa and Mastercard, with the ECB raising concerns about potential vulnerabilities. While some countries have domestic systems, others are entirely dependent on US networks. The rise of app-based payments, dominated by American tech firms, further exacerbates the issue. Experts are exploring alternatives, including a digital euro and the Wero payment system, but challenges remain in achieving widespread adoption. Russia's model of domestic payment processing offers a potential temporary solution, but implementing such a system across the EU would take several years.</p>

          <p>President Trump's promise of a "golden age" for the U.S. economy is off to a chaotic start as GDP shrank in the first quarter, reversing a period of robust growth. Trump blamed the "Biden 'Overhang'" for the negative numbers, while touting strong jobs reports as evidence of his success. However, analysts point to the administration's erratic tariff policies as a major factor in the economic slowdown, creating uncertainty for businesses and consumers. The impact of these policies is expected to be more pronounced in the second quarter, raising concerns about a potential recession.</p>

          <p>Australian voters are participating in a general election, choosing between Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of the Labor Party and opposition leader Peter Dutton of the conservative coalition. The election takes place against a backdrop of economic challenges, including a cost-of-living crisis and housing affordability issues, as well as geopolitical tensions with China and a volatile relationship with the U.S. under the Trump administration. While economic issues dominate voter concerns, culture wars and the influence of Trump-style politics have also played a role in the campaign. Recent polls suggest Albanese's party is headed for a second term.</p>

The situation has calmed with the entry of Syrian government forces, but the incident highlights the fragile state of security in the region.

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from the blood of Tim Friede, a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. The antivenom has shown protection against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes in animal tests. Friede's 18-year mission could be a significant step in finding a universal antivenom against all snakebites. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that could target two classes of neurotoxins. This is likely to provide coverage for many elapids for which there is no current antivenom.</p>

The museum is attempting to attract visitors from other regions to compensate for the decline. These tensions are a result of the Democratic Progressive Party's rise to power in 2016.</p>
