          <p>China is facing public debate and skepticism over its practice of reinstating and promoting officials who were previously disciplined for misconduct. This initiative aims to motivate officials who are perceived as doing the bare minimum amid President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption efforts and an economic downturn. However, the public views these second chances as a reward for bad behavior, expressing frustration on social media. The government defends the practice as a way to incentivize and rehabilitate officials, but public opinion remains largely critical.</p>

          <p>Turkey is experiencing a significant rise in obesity rates, ranking first in Europe for overweight and obese individuals, with experts linking this trend to poverty, malnutrition, and unhealthy food supplies. High food price inflation reduces citizens' purchasing power, leading to increased consumption of cheap, processed foods. The use of toxic chemicals in food production, such as pesticides, also contributes to hormonal imbalances and weight gain. While the Health Ministry has launched a campaign to combat obesity, critics argue that it stigmatizes individuals and overlooks broader economic issues, such as the inaccessibility of healthy foods for low-income households.</p>

Japan will not set an age limit for domestic tournaments, aiming to support children of all ages in the sport.</p>

          <p>Japan has implemented an amendment to its Penal Code, prioritizing rehabilitation efforts in prisons for the first time in over a century. Imprisonment is no longer divided into categories with and without labor, and prison work is no longer mandatory. This change allows more time for rehabilitative guidance and education, aiming to reduce recidivism. The new system includes tailored programs based on an inmate's age, characteristics, and other factors, such as addiction recovery and daily care for elderly inmates.</p>

          <p>South Korean women, who played a significant role in protests leading to the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, express feeling invisible again as equality issues are largely ignored in the upcoming elections. The two main candidates are mostly silent on women's equality, and a third candidate with anti-feminist views is gaining popularity among young men. These women fear their voices are being erased and that progress made is being reversed. They say that they had marched to the same song nearly a decade ago in anti-corruption protests that ended another president's career.</p>
