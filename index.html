The prosecution argues that the defense failed to provide timely notice and that the expert's testimony relies on hearsay as the expert hasn't examined Diddy. Diddy's trial is set to begin on May 5 and he maintains his innocence against charges including racketeering conspiracy and sexual assault. Judge Arun Subramanian allowed Diddy's legal team to use a "swingers" defense during a hearing Friday.</p>

The request follows Trump's announcement of tariff rollbacks, which caused a significant surge in the stock market.

China's cancellation of pork orders and warnings from the Port of Oakland about potential job losses highlight the severity of the situation.

Two individuals, Luke Farritor and Adam Ramada, have accounts on systems used by the National Nuclear Security Administration and the Department of Defense. While the Department of Energy denies the access, sources confirm the presence of accounts. This raises concerns about data security and the handling of classified information.</p>

          <p>President Vladimir Putin declared a three-day ceasefire in Ukraine for May 8-10, coinciding with the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany. Ukraine responded by suggesting a month-long ceasefire instead of a brief truce. The Trump administration expressed frustration and called for a permanent ceasefire. This comes as negotiations to end the war are considered critical, with President Trump's patience reportedly waning.</p>
