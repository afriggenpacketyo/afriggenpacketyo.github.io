          <p>In one of the largest single-site enforcement operations in Homeland Security Investigations history, federal authorities detained 475 immigrant workers at a Hyundai facility in Georgia. The raid was part of an investigation into unlawful employment practices, with most detainees being Korean nationals accused of visa violations. The operation, involving multiple agencies like ICE and the FBI, underscores a significant government crackdown on illegal immigration. Hyundai stated that none of those detained were its direct employees and pledged to review its contractors' compliance.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has clarified his pledge to stop small migrant boats within two weeks of gaining power, stating the timeline would begin after new, stringent deportation laws are passed. This proposed legislation would involve barring asylum claims from anyone arriving illegally and disapplying international treaties like the Refugee Convention. The adjustment followed scrutiny over the feasibility of the original promise, with Farage citing Australia's controversial offshore detention policies as a model for his approach to immigration control.</p>

Venkatesham is known for his role in appointing manager Mikel Arteta and for his empathetic leadership style, particularly during the pandemic. His move across North London is expected to change the dynamics of Tottenham's boardroom, which was long defined by Levy's famously tough negotiation tactics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that the climate crisis will lead to more frequent lightning-sparked wildfires across the Western US for decades to come. These types of fires tend to occur in remote areas and grow larger than human-caused fires, potentially worsening air quality and public health crises. The study, which used machine learning, found that 98% of the Western US will face an increased risk due to more lightning, drier conditions, or both, stretching firefighting resources thin.</p>

It frames the action as a necessary move against a designated terrorist organization threatening the US. The author praises the administration for its direct military approach to cartels, which have been declared an invasion force, asserting that a law enforcement solution alone is insufficient to address the threat.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has ordered "all-out efforts" to assist over 300 of its citizens detained in a major US immigration raid at a Hyundai-LG battery factory construction site in Georgia. The country's foreign minister stated he felt a "heavy responsibility" and would travel to Washington if necessary. The arrests have alarmed South Korean corporations, with LG Energy Solution suspending employee business travel to the US after 47 of its staff were detained in the operation.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer initiated a major cabinet reshuffle after Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's departure over a tax issue. The changes are intended to mark a new phase for the premiership and address key challenges like immigration, with Shabana Mahmood appointed as the new Home Secretary. However, the turmoil is seen as a political gift for the rival Reform UK party, which argues it undermines Labour's claim to be a cleaner, more competent alternative.</p>

          <p>The Harlem Hellfighters, a famed all-Black infantry regiment from World War I, have been posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, the nation's highest civilian honor. The unit was renowned for its bravery fighting alongside the French army, as they were shunned by the segregated US forces. The long-overdue recognition comes amid a broader national debate about how American history, particularly its racial history, is remembered and taught, with the medal set to be housed at the Smithsonian.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the ongoing effort to conceal the full extent of Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring is a crime against democratic principles of equality and justice. The author contends that powerful figures, including the House Speaker and Attorney General, are protecting Donald Trump by suppressing documents related to the case. This systemic silencing of victims is framed as part of a broader right-wing agenda to diminish women's rights and operate above the law.</p>

          <p>A brief absence from the public eye over a weekend sparked widespread online speculation and conspiracy theories about President Trump's health, including rumors of his death. The phenomenon is analyzed as a reflection of an online culture filled with misinformation and intense political polarization, fueled by an expectation of constant presidential communication. The White House dismissed the speculation, which Trump later called "fake news" while stating he felt better than ever.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests the Trump administration is increasingly using military force for law enforcement, both domestically and abroad. The recent lethal strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean is presented as a key example, following deployments of troops to US cities. Experts express concern that this blurs the line between warfare and policing, a strategy previously attempted with limited success that could prompt cartels to further militarize their own operations.</p>
