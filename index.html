        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK transport secretary has announced a pledge to clear the backlog of learner drivers waiting over five months for practical driving tests in England. The government plans to provide at least 10,000 extra driving tests monthly to tackle the issue, aiming to eliminate the backlog by next summer. Current driving test wait times are considered "totally unacceptable," with some areas experiencing a minimum six-month wait to book a test, according to data from the AA. This initiative aims to alleviate the stress and inconvenience caused by the long delays.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk plans to significantly reduce his involvement in the US government as Tesla reports a substantial drop in profits and sales. Musk has been leading the Department for Government Efficiency (Doge) but will now allocate more time to Tesla amidst criticism and boycotts linked to his political activities. Tesla's sales dropped 20% and profits fell over 70% in the first quarter, with the company citing "changing political sentiment" and tariffs as contributing factors. Musk will remain in the Trump administration as long as the president wants him to.</p>

          <p>BP shares experienced a 5% increase after activist investor Elliott Management revealed a stake exceeding 5% in the British oil major. Elliott's involvement is anticipated to pressure BP to shift its strategy back towards oil and gas businesses, reversing its green energy initiatives. BP had previously announced plans to increase fossil fuel investments to $10 billion through 2027 after scaling back its emissions targets. This strategic shift and Elliott's investment have sparked debate among investors focused on both revenue and climate concerns.</p>

          <p>The UK government's borrowing exceeded expectations, increasing pressure on public finances as Chancellor Rachel Reeves aims to secure a trade deal with the US to avoid import tariffs. Borrowing reached £151.9bn in the year to March, up £20.7bn from the previous year, prompting concerns about potential tax hikes or spending cuts. The IMF has lowered its growth forecast for the UK, citing tariffs and rising inflation, while the ONS reported increased government spending on pay and benefits. Reeves maintains her borrowing rules are "non-negotiable," but economists warn of the challenges ahead.</p>

          <p>Amid a significant measles outbreak in the U.S., a new poll reveals the spread of misinformation about the disease and the vaccine. While most people still trust the safety of the measles vaccine, many are uncertain about how to evaluate false claims, such as the vaccine causing autism or vitamin A preventing infection. Republicans are more likely to believe misinformation, and parents who believe these falsehoods are more likely to delay or skip recommended vaccines for their children. This highlights the challenge of combating health misinformation in a media-saturated world.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has seen his influence diminish among right-wing populists abroad, as his aggressive trade policies and confrontational approach to allies create a "Trump slump."

The shift reflects a broader trend of voters seeking credible leaders who can confront, rather than accommodate, the US president's policies, straining ties among populist movements globally.</p>
