          <h2>New Report Links Democratic Gubernatorial Candidate's Husband to Naval Academy Cheating Scandal</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report claims that Jason Hedberg, husband of New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial candidate Rep. Mikie Sherrill, was involved in the 1994 U.S. Naval Academy cheating scandal. This allegation surfaces after the improper release of Sherrill's private military records, which showed her name was excluded from graduation ceremonies for failing to report classmates who cheated. While Sherrill denies direct cheating, her campaign accuses Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli and the Trump administration of illegally obtaining and weaponizing these records for political gain. Ciattarelli's campaign, however, demands Sherrill release her disciplinary records and threatens legal action for defamation, intensifying the already tight gubernatorial race in the blue-leaning state.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 ideological decision, has permitted the Trump administration to continue withholding over $4 billion in foreign aid previously approved by Congress. This ruling overturns a federal judge's order to release the funds, with the conservative majority emphasizing the President's foreign policy authority and questioning the standing of international aid groups that had sued. Justice Elena Kagan, in dissent, criticized the ruling's rapid progression through the emergency docket, highlighting the lack of thorough deliberation. The administration had utilized a rare "pocket rescission" authority, a mechanism to bypass the legislative branch on appropriated funds, which has not been employed since the 1970s, underscoring the contentious nature of this executive action.</p>

          <p>Robert Eugene Brashers, a deceased serial killer and perpetrator of multiple sexual assaults and murders, has been identified as a suspect in the infamous 1991 Austin, Texas, yogurt shop murders. Retired detective John Jones, an original investigator, revealed the connection was made through DNA evidence, specifically a bullet casing found in the shop's drain consistent with the gun Brashers used to die by suicide in 1999. This significant breakthrough offers a potential resolution to the brutal killings of four teenage girls, a cold case that has remained unsolved for over three decades despite previous arrests, overturned convictions, and extensive investigative efforts. The identification provides a crucial step towards long-awaited closure for the victims' families.</p>

Despite US captain Keegan Bradley's defiant stance, Europe's strong performance, highlighted by Jon Rahm and Tommy Fleetwood, positions them as strong favorites for the upcoming Saturday foursomes. The visitors are clearly delighted with their early momentum, while the US team faces considerable pressure and internal criticism regarding their captain's strategic decisions.</p>

Rubin was denied bail after prosecutors cited his discussion of hiring a "hit man to target women who had filed a civil suit against him" and his substantial overseas wealth, including over $74 million in a Cayman Islands account. The indictment details a trafficking network costing over $1 million, with victims reportedly universally fearing Rubin due to his brutal conduct.</p>

The district's board chair, Jackie Norris, confirmed his detention, noting he was granted a state license in 2023 and they are verifying ICE's claims, which include existing weapon possession charges.

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey's recent indictment for false statements to Congress and obstruction could be undermined by President Trump's years-long public attacks and his influence on the Justice Department. Legal experts suggest Trump's repeated expressions of animosity and his comments cheering the charges could provide strong evidence for Comey's defense to argue selective or vindictive prosecution. The abrupt departure of the top prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, replaced by a White House aide with no prosecutorial experience just before Comey's indictment, further fuels concerns about political motivation. This situation highlights the potential for the president's direct involvement to compromise the integrity of the judicial process.</p>

          <p>Legal experts view the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, orchestrated under President Trump's direction, as a critical test for the integrity of the American justice system. Trump's years-long public animosity towards Comey, culminating in direct calls for his prosecution and the appointment of a loyalist U.S. attorney, suggests a politicized use of federal power. Critics argue the case, alleging false testimony and obstruction, appears weak and is part of an escalating campaign of retribution against political foes.

Shakur, born Joanne Deborah Chesimard, was granted political asylum in Cuba after her 1979 escape from a U.S. prison, where she was serving a life sentence for the 1973 murder of a New Jersey State Trooper. Her case has long symbolized strained U.S.-Cuba relations, with American authorities repeatedly demanding her return, even placing her on the FBI's "most wanted terrorists" list. Despite this, Shakur maintained her innocence and became a significant rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement, inspiring activists and artists alike with her writings and defiance.</p>

While the medical examiner notes that CTE's physical and mental manifestations are still under study, experts like Chris Nowinski emphasize that even low-stage CTE involves significant brain cell death affecting judgment and behavior.

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, a Category 3 storm, is currently churning north of the Caribbean, with forecasters predicting it will not make landfall. However, there's a possibility it could interact with another developing system in the western Atlantic, a rare phenomenon known as the Fujiwhara effect. This effect involves two tropical storms merging or spinning around a common center, with the outcome depending on their relative strengths. While the developing system is weaker, such an interaction could slightly alter their expected paths. Officials are monitoring both systems, as the second storm, potentially named Imelda, is expected to strengthen and track towards the Bahamas, increasing risks for the southeastern U.S.</p>

          <p>The upcoming APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting in Gyeongju, South Korea, is poised to serve as a significant diplomatic stage, with both U.S. and Chinese presidents expected to attend amidst rising Korean peninsula tensions. Following North Korean leader Kim Jong-un’s recent visit to China, this opinion article suggests the summit could pave the way for a U.S.-North Korea summit or a trilateral meeting involving South Korea, potentially mediated by Beijing and Seoul. It emphasizes that China's mediating role is essential, with South Korea acting as a "pacemaker" for regional cooperation. The non-binding nature of APEC makes it an ideal venue for fostering dialogue and building consensus towards peace.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced that 20 U.S. soldiers involved in the 1890 Wounded Knee massacre will retain their Medals of Honor, reversing a review initiated by his predecessor. Hegseth, part of the Trump administration, called the men "brave soldiers" and asserted their place in history is "no longer up for debate," dismissing concerns as "politically correct." This decision halts efforts by Democratic lawmakers to revoke the medals, which for Native Americans symbolize a genocidal history of brutality. The move is the latest in a series of Trump administration actions reinterpreting U.S. history, including reverting Confederate base names and criticizing cultural institutions.</p>

          <p>A tropical system, currently designated Invest 94L and strengthening near Cuba, is increasingly likely to impact the Carolinas early next week, bringing significant weather concerns. While initial forecasts suggested it would remain at sea, recent model guidance now shows a potential landfall anywhere from Georgia to the Outer Banks, with some models even indicating it could pass over Charlotte. Expected to become Tropical Storm Imelda over the weekend, the system is predicted to bring heavy rain, gusty winds, and severe weather between Monday and Wednesday. This comes during an active hurricane season, with Hurricane Humberto also being monitored offshore, adding to regional weather anxieties.</p>

The article suggests that declining public trust in health institutions post-COVID has amplified his anti-vax message, which has permeated the political right.

Cook's attorneys contend that Trump's "manufactured charges," based on pre-appointment conduct, do not meet the "for cause" requirement for removal and that a stay allowing her removal would signal a loss of Fed independence, risking market chaos.
