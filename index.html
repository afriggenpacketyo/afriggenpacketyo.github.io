          <p>West Ham United has appointed Nuno Espirito Santo as their new head coach on a three-year contract, following the dismissal of Graham Potter. Potter was sacked after just eight months, with the club positioned 19th in the Premier League table. Nuno, who previously managed Nottingham Forest and led them to their highest league finish in decades, expressed his pride in joining the club. His immediate goal is to enhance the team's competitiveness, with his first match scheduled against Everton.</p>

The latest variants, such as the DF-5C, are reported to have an extended range capable of reaching the entire continental United States. This capability ensures the missile system continues to play a significant role in the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force's strategic planning.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 09:51:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the American dream of homeownership increasingly out of reach due to high prices and interest rates, modular home construction is emerging as a potential solution. Companies like Colorado-based Fading West utilize factory-based assembly lines to build homes, claiming to reduce costs by up to 20% and cut construction time in half compared to traditional methods. This approach not only addresses the national housing shortage but has also been deployed for disaster relief, such as providing temporary housing for victims of the 2023 Maui wildfires. The industry aims to disrupt traditional homebuilding by offering a faster, more sustainable, and affordable product.</p>

          <p>The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has voted to lift all sanctions against Russia and Belarus that were imposed following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. This decision reverses a partial suspension and restores full membership rights to both national Paralympic committees. The move could allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete under their own flags at the upcoming Milan-Cortina Winter Paralympics. Ukraine's sports minister strongly condemned the decision, calling it a betrayal of Olympic values, while the final participation of athletes still depends on individual sports federations.</p>

          <p>The FBI has fired approximately 20 agents who were photographed kneeling during a racial justice protest in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd. The agents had been reassigned last spring before their recent termination. The FBI Agents Association condemned the firings as unlawful, accusing FBI Director Kash Patel of disregarding the legal rights of employees and calling for a congressional investigation.

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's recent economic claims reveals a mixed record of accuracy regarding inflation, consumer prices, and growth. While the president correctly stated that mortgage rates and gasoline prices have decreased over the past year, his assertions that grocery prices are down and inflation has been defeated are incorrect, as both continue to rise. Similarly, while the stock market has reached record highs, claims of booming manufacturing are contradicted by a net loss of jobs in the sector since April. The article provides data from federal sources to evaluate each of the president's statements. (not investment advice)</p>

May, who is representing himself and resigned from his position earlier this year, faces five to twenty years in prison for each of the five counts.

          <p>Despite widespread negative sentiment and concerns over inflation, the U.S. economy is showing surprising resilience, potentially bolstered by a strong stock market. Recent data indicates robust consumer spending, income growth, and a rise in new home sales, which some economists attribute to the "wealth effect" from Wall Street's record highs. However, this strength could be fragile, as the top 10% of earners own 87% of the market, leaving the broader economy vulnerable if stocks decline. This situation creates a precarious balance where positive market performance is currently offsetting other recessionary pressures like stagnant job growth. (not investment advice)</p>

The article frames the Tylenol scare as another form of mom-shaming and an attempt to control women's bodies.

The new approach aims to move beyond superficial profiles by using AI to analyze user values, goals, and beliefs to suggest more compatible partners. While companies hope this will inject more humanity into the process, experts remain skeptical, noting that romantic chemistry is complex and unpredictable.

          <p>Broadcast media giants Nexstar and Sinclair have ended their boycott of "Jimmy Kimmel Live," restoring the show to their local ABC affiliate stations. The companies had pulled the show after host Jimmy Kimmel's controversial comments about the assassination of Charlie Kirk, a move that initially appeared to demonstrate their increased leverage over networks. However, the boycott proved more costly for the stations, which lost significant viewership and advertising revenue by replacing the popular late-night show with local programming. The quick reversal suggests that despite consolidation, the networks still hold ultimate power in these affiliate relationships.</p>

          <p>Nearly nine months after the Eaton fire destroyed thousands of structures in Altadena, California, many residents are struggling with the slow and arduous process of rebuilding. While some are committed to returning, a significant portion of property owners have not yet applied for building permits, citing frustration with insurance battles, financial shortfalls, and the prospect of living in a construction zone for years. This has led to a sense of exhaustion and uncertainty, with some who initially vowed to rebuild now reconsidering their future in the fire-scarred community, which they feel is now a ghost town.</p>

          <p>Reflecting on the 1977 legal battle over a neo-Nazi group's right to march in Skokie, Illinois, this opinion article argues for the vital importance of protecting even offensive speech under the First Amendment. The author recounts the pain this caused for Holocaust survivors in the community, but quotes the ACLU lawyer who defended the group's right to march. The lawyer, who is Jewish, argued that the real client was the First Amendment itself. The piece concludes that if speech is denied because it is offensive, officials gain the power to prevent any speech they dislike, undermining the core principle of free expression.</p>

          <p>The recent federal indictment of former FBI Director James Comey could be vulnerable to dismissal due to President Trump's long history of public attacks against him, according to legal experts. Defense lawyers are expected to argue for selective or vindictive prosecution, citing the president's repeated calls for Comey's imprisonment and his celebratory comments following the charges. The case is further complicated by reports that career prosecutors initially opposed bringing charges and the recent installation of a Trump ally with no prosecutorial experience to lead the office. These factors create unusual circumstances that could bolster a motion to have the case thrown out.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose a $100,000 fee on all new H-1B visa applications is being criticized by economists as a move that could damage the U.S. economy. Britta Glennon, an economist at the Wharton School, argues the policy is based on the false premise that there is a fixed number of jobs and will deter top global talent from coming to the U.S. Research shows that skilled immigrants are highly innovative and entrepreneurial, often creating more jobs and making American workers more productive. Instead of benefiting the economy, the steep fee could lead companies to offshore jobs and ultimately erode America's competitive edge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As major Hurricane Humberto moves through the Atlantic, meteorologists are monitoring its potential interaction with another developing storm system nearby. If the two storms get close enough, they could engage in the Fujiwhara effect, a rare phenomenon where two cyclones orbit each other or merge. The outcome depends on the storms' relative strengths; often, the stronger storm absorbs the weaker one. While an interaction between Humberto and the developing storm is considered unlikely, the possibility exists, which could slightly alter their forecasted tracks as they move toward the southeastern U.S. coast.</p>

          <p>A review of Kamala Harris's new book, "107 Days," characterizes it as a confirmation of her and Joe Biden's political weaknesses during the 2024 campaign. The reviewer argues that the memoir details the steep challenges Harris faced but fails to acknowledge her own campaign missteps, such as her choice of Tim Walz as a running mate, whom she now criticizes. The article contends that Harris does not grapple with key policy failures on immigration and inflation and overlooks the role of identity politics in her defeat. Ultimately, the book is portrayed as lacking self-awareness and failing to offer coherent solutions.</p>

          <p>The killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has been framed by Trump administration officials and allies as a key moment in a "spiritual war," drawing on the language of the New Apostolic Reformation (NAR). This charismatic Christian movement, which Kirk had embraced, believes a "Third Great Awakening" is underway to bring society under God's dominion. Leaders in the movement have described Kirk as the "first martyr" of this awakening and cast his assassination as a battle against demonic forces. This rhetoric is mobilizing followers who see politics as a cosmic struggle between good and evil.</p>

          <p>An estimated 800 million children worldwide suffer from lead poisoning, with a primary and often overlooked source being the informal recycling of lead-acid batteries. In many low- and middle-income countries, used car batteries are broken open and the lead is melted down in unsafe conditions, releasing toxic dust that contaminates communities. However, this is a solvable problem, as demonstrated by countries like Brazil, which successfully formalized its recycling industry through policy changes. By altering economic incentives, such as removing taxes on scrap and implementing manufacturer take-back programs, governments can steer batteries away from dangerous backyard smelters and into safer, regulated facilities.</p>

The policy would initially target convicted criminals and later expand to include individuals whose asylum applications have been rejected and who are receiving social benefits. Germany has not deported anyone to Syria since 2012, and the move is being criticized by human rights organizations.

The proposed scheme, which would allow young people aged 18-30 to live and work in the UK or EU for a few years, has been criticized by opponents as a partial return to freedom of movement.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tendency to openly admit to or boast about actions that past presidents would have concealed has fundamentally changed the nature of political scandals. By being brazen about his conduct, from pressuring the Justice Department to pursue his political foes to potential conflicts of interest, Trump has desensitized the public and media. This approach, observers note, perversely makes him appear authentic to his supporters and takes the sting out of revelations that would have been career-ending for his predecessors. The constant flood of controversies creates a background noise that diminishes the impact of any single event, neutralizing traditional accountability mechanisms.</p>
