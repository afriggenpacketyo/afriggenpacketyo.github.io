        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of Zach Cregger's horror film 'Weapons' examines its narrative choices and thematic depth. The article praises the movie for providing clear answers to its central mystery, where a class of third-graders vanishes one night. It highlights how the film explores the fallacy of catharsis, suggesting that defeating the villain doesn't erase the underlying trauma and grief. The review commends the performances, particularly Amy Madigan's, and the film's ability to be both a satisfying and emotionally resonant horror masterpiece.</p>

          <p>Senator Josh Hawley is launching an investigation into Meta following a report that the company's internal guidelines permitted AI chatbots to engage in "romantic" and "sensual" conversations with children. The probe aims to determine if Meta's AI products enable child exploitation and whether the company misled the public about its safety measures. Hawley has demanded that CEO Mark Zuckerberg preserve all relevant documents. Meta responded by stating the reported guidelines were erroneous, inconsistent with its policies, and have since been removed.</p>

          <p>Erin has strengthened into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, with forecasters predicting it could become a major hurricane. As of Friday, the Category 1 storm was located east of the Leeward Islands and is not expected to make a direct impact on the United States. Its forecast path shows a northward curve, keeping it away from the U.S. East Coast. Officials in the Caribbean have issued tropical storm watches, urging residents to monitor the storm's progress due to potential heavy rain and dangerous surf conditions.</p>

          <p>A Tax Foundation analysis details the potential state-by-state impact of President Trump's major tax legislation, showing significant variation in average savings. In 2026, the average individual taxpayer is projected to save $3,752, with residents in states like Wyoming and Washington seeing the largest benefits. The report also notes that high-income resort areas could see disproportionately large average tax cuts. Conversely, a separate Congressional Budget Office report suggests the legislation could benefit top earners while reducing resources for lower-income households through cuts to social programs (not investment advice).</p>

In partnership with an immunology company, she aims to raise awareness about the condition, which affects voluntary muscles and can cause symptoms ranging from double vision to difficulty breathing. A neurologist explains that while the disease can be serious, its symptoms often fluctuate and can be managed with modern treatments, allowing most patients to lead relatively normal lives.</p>

          <p>Shares of semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials fell sharply after the company issued weak financial guidance, citing demand pressures and uncertainty in China. The company's forecast for adjusted earnings per share and revenue both fell short of analyst expectations. CEO Gary Dickerson attributed the outlook to the current macroeconomic environment and trade issues, which have created lower visibility for its China business.

In response to these unpredictable trends and an initial oversupply of capacity, carriers have been cutting flights. This reduction in capacity is expected to help stabilize fares but reflects a more complex and less predictably profitable third quarter for the industry.</p>

The lawsuit argues the takeover is an illegal abuse of authority and seeks to void an order from Attorney General Pam Bondi that placed the DEA administrator in command of the MPD. D.C. officials, including Mayor Muriel Bowser, contend there is no emergency to justify the action, which they describe as an "authoritarian push." The takeover has already seen hundreds of National Guard troops and federal agents deployed throughout the city.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's federalization of the Washington D.C. police force, Democratic lawmakers have introduced a joint resolution to end the takeover. Citing the D.C. Home Rule Act, the resolution asserts that the president has not demonstrated the emergency conditions required for such an action. Sponsors argue that Trump's justification relies on misleading crime statistics, as D.C.'s crime rate has actually been declining. They contend the move is an egregious attack on the city's autonomy and has worsened public safety by creating confusion and blocking local funds.</p>

In Pakistan, at least 199 fatalities have been reported, with the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province being the hardest-hit area. Rescue efforts are underway, though a helicopter involved in the relief operation crashed, killing five crew members. In India-administered Kashmir, a remote Himalayan village was struck by flooding that killed at least 60 people, with many more still missing.

          <p>The Salford Red Devils rugby league club has canceled its upcoming Super League match against Wakefield, citing significant player welfare concerns. The financially troubled club has been forced to rely on inexperienced loanees after most of its senior players departed. The decision was made after a recent 80-6 defeat where five players made their debut, and the club stated only two players available for the next match had recent top-level experience. The Rugby Football League will now determine the outcome of the fixture, while discussions continue about the remainder of Salford's season.</p>

          <p>A seismic swarm of more than 130 small earthquakes, with the largest being a magnitude 4.0, has occurred in the Geysers geothermal steam field in Northern California. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such small quakes are common in this area, which is one of the world's most productive geothermal power facilities. The seismic activity is believed to be induced by the operations of the power plant, which involves withdrawing steam and injecting reclaimed water into the hot rock. The USGS notes this activity is distinct from the region's major seismic hazards on faults like the San Andreas.</p>

          <p>In the days leading up to the summit with President Trump, Russian forces have breached Ukrainian defensive lines in the Donetsk region, creating a potentially dangerous situation for Kyiv. While the advances are limited, analysts suggest Russia aims to use these battlefield gains to strengthen its negotiating position with the U.S. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes the offensive is intended to create an information backdrop suggesting Ukraine is losing ground. The development adds significant pressure to the high-stakes talks, where Ukraine's territorial integrity and a potential ceasefire are central issues.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to lift a lower court's injunction that places restrictions on immigration enforcement tactics in Los Angeles. The order from a federal judge prohibits agents from stopping or detaining individuals based solely on factors like their race, their use of Spanish, or their presence at day-laborer sites. The case raises questions about the extent to which courts can rein in law enforcement practices. While the injunction is narrow, the article suggests it is unlikely to survive review by the current Supreme Court, which has historically been reluctant to issue broad orders restricting law enforcement.</p>

The author criticizes past U.S. policy as naive, allowing these groups to operate under the guise of political or charitable work while promoting extremist ideologies.

          <p>A divided federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can move forward with its plan to lay off over 1,400 employees at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The 2-1 decision overturns a lower court's injunction that had blocked the mass firings, stating the claims must go through a different civil service review process. The administration aims to create a more "streamlined" bureau, but critics and the employees' union argue the cuts would cripple the agency's ability to perform its congressionally mandated duties. The dissenting judge warned that the agency's very existence was threatened.</p>

He stated that any decisions regarding territorial concessions must be made by Ukraine itself, a position that may reassure European allies. Trump also expressed support for U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, short of full NATO membership, as part of a potential peace deal.
