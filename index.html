          <p>This article reports on over 2,500 migrants crossing the English Channel since a new "one in, one out" agreement between the UK and France was implemented. The deal proposes returning one migrant to France for every asylum seeker the UK accepts, but removals have not yet begun. Amid these crossings, concerns are rising about smugglers using larger, more dangerous "mega dinghies" capable of carrying over 100 people, increasing risks for those making the journey. The UK government faces pressure to demonstrate the effectiveness of its new strategy to curb illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has mandated an end to the Air Canada flight attendants' strike, forcing both the airline and the union into binding arbitration less than 12 hours after the work stoppage began. The strike had grounded hundreds of flights, affecting over 100,000 travelers daily during the peak summer season. While the government cited economic risks for its intervention, the union accused officials of violating workers' constitutional right to strike and siding with the airline. The move has been praised by business groups but criticized by labor advocates.</p>

          <p>This article details the undercover operation that led to the capture of Bryan Patrick Miller, the "Phoenix canal killer" responsible for two murders in the early 1990s. Cold case detective Clark Schwartzkopf posed as a security consultant and met Miller at a Chili's restaurant to covertly obtain his DNA from a water glass. The DNA was a match to evidence found at the crime scenes, leading to the arrest of Miller, who was also a local personality known for dressing as a "Zombie Hunter." Miller was later convicted and sentenced to death.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Proposes Revenue-Sharing Deal for AI Chip Exports to China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 02:00:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has reversed a ban on exporting certain AI chips to China, now allowing companies like Nvidia and AMD to sell them under a novel revenue-sharing agreement. The deal requires the companies to give 15% of their revenue from these sales to the U.S. government, a move critics argue sets a dangerous precedent of making national security-based export controls appear "up for sale." This policy shift, negotiated directly by President Trump, raises legal questions about whether it constitutes an unconstitutional tax on exports and could destabilize international trade relations.

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has broken her social media silence weeks after her "Good Jeans" ad campaign for American Eagle sparked a divided public response. The campaign, which played on the words "genes" and "jeans," was criticized by some for having alleged racial undertones, while others praised it for challenging "woke" advertising. American Eagle released a statement clarifying the campaign was solely about the jeans. Despite the controversy, some public relations experts suggest the heightened attention could ultimately benefit both the brand and Sweeney's career financially and professionally.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a concept for a hypersonic drone carrier that utilizes an innovative "scissor wing" design, an idea once explored by NASA. The design features a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates as the aircraft's speed increases, optimizing performance across subsonic, transonic, and hypersonic flight regimes. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, but at Mach 5, it aligns parallel to the body, turning the entire aircraft into an efficient "waverider." This adaptable design aims to overcome aerodynamic compromises of high-speed flight.</p>

          <p>Colorado dentist James Craig has been found guilty of the first-degree murder of his wife, Angela, who died after a mysterious and rapid illness. An autopsy revealed she was poisoned with lethal concentrations of cyanide and other toxins, which prosecutors argued Craig administered in her daily protein shakes. Investigators uncovered evidence that Craig had researched and purchased poisons online, and was motivated by financial troubles and an affair with another woman. Craig, who pleaded not guilty, was sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>

          <p>This article, written by an executive counselor and couples' therapist, explores the psychological drivers behind infidelity among otherwise "good" people. The author identifies five common pitfalls: a lifetime of repressing one's own identity to be "good," perfectionism stemming from childhood trauma, poor personal boundaries, being in an abusive marriage, and reacting to a significant loss.

          <p>A small private plane made a successful emergency landing on Interstate 805 in San Diego on Saturday afternoon after experiencing apparent mechanical issues. The aircraft was traveling from Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport to Miramar Marine Corps Air Station when the incident occurred. The landing forced the closure of several highway lanes for hours while authorities investigated and removed the plane. Remarkably, no injuries were reported to the plane's occupants or to any drivers on the busy highway, averting a potential catastrophe.</p>
