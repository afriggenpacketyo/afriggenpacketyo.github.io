          <p>A report from the National Energy System Operator found that the power outage and fire that shut down Heathrow Airport originated from a problem detected seven years ago. An elevated moisture reading in an electrical substation, which should have prompted immediate replacement, was reportedly left unaddressed by National Grid. The failure affected nearly 67,000 customers and disrupted 270,000 journeys, prompting an investigation by the energy regulator Ofgem into potential license breaches and raising concerns about the resilience of the UK's critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Alexi Saenz, the leader of a Long Island-based MS-13 clique, is set to be sentenced for his role in a federal racketeering case involving eight murders and other violent crimes.

Prosecutors are seeking a 70-year prison sentence, citing his continued gang activity while incarcerated, while his defense argues for a 45-year term, pointing to remorse and a traumatic upbringing.</p>

          <p>An $88 million satellite named MethaneSAT, designed to monitor greenhouse gas emissions with high resolution, has been declared lost after it stopped communicating with ground control.

          <p>This opinion article argues that G7 nations have undermined global tax fairness by agreeing to exempt U.S. multinational corporations from a previously agreed-upon global minimum tax framework. The author contends that this move, made under pressure from the Trump administration, puts the interests of large corporations ahead of developing countries and their own citizens. The deal is criticized for creating an uneven playing field, incentivizing a "race to the bottom" on tax policy, and making a mockery of the inclusive process that was supposed to establish the rules. The article calls for a stronger, UN-led tax convention. (not investment advice)</p>
