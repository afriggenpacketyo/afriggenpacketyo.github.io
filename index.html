        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the H5N1 bird flu strain has spread among animals, human cases remain relatively low, possibly due to pre-existing immunity from past flu infections.  Studies using animal models and blood tests suggest that antibodies and T cells developed from previous flu exposures might offer some protection against severe bird flu illness.  However, scientists caution that this doesn't eliminate the risk of a pandemic, and younger individuals might be more vulnerable.</p>
