          <p>Over 85 international climate experts have published a detailed review condemning a Trump administration Energy Department report on greenhouse gases as scientifically unsound. The experts argue the DOE report, which downplayed the economic damage of CO2 emissions, cherry-picked data and misrepresented scientific literature to support fossil fuel industry interests. Critics, including the American Meteorological Society, view the report as part of a broader trend of politicizing science within the federal government, prompting many scientists to organize responses to counter what they perceive as misinformation.</p>

The vessels were observed passing between Okinawa's main island and Miyakojima, heading northwest. According to Tokyo, these same ships had previously sailed through the Korea Strait and the Sōya Strait, completing a month-long maneuver that effectively circled the entire Japanese archipelago, prompting surveillance and intelligence gathering by Japan's Maritime Self-Defence Force.</p>

          <p>In an inflationary economy, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to earn returns that can outpace inflation, with the added benefit of FDIC or NCUA insurance. While national average yields for one-to-five-year CDs are around 1.70% to 2.04%, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some reaching up to 4.45% APY for shorter terms. The current inverted yield curve means short-term CDs often have better rates than long-term ones, making strategies like CD laddering a practical approach for savers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts are pointing to a "golden opportunity" for investors to utilize the 0% long-term capital gains tax bracket, which could be accessible to more people in 2025 due to new deductions in President Trump's recent tax bill. For 2025, single filers with taxable income up to $48,350 and married couples up to $96,700 can qualify. This allows for strategies like "tax-gain harvesting," where profitable assets are sold tax-free to rebalance portfolios or reset the cost basis for future tax savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has called on Russia and Mongolia to deepen their economic ties and collectively resist "external interference," reinforcing Beijing's efforts to build a regional bloc against Western influence. The statement comes as Mongolia has been actively pursuing a "third neighbor" foreign policy to diversify its partnerships with countries like the U.S., Japan, and the E.U. Mongolia's strategic importance has grown due to its vast mineral wealth, including rare earths, which are critical in the escalating trade and technology rivalry between Beijing and Washington.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Landslides are a common and deadly geological event, caused when materials on a slope fail under pressure from factors like excessive rainfall, earthquakes, or human activity. They are classified into four main types—falls, topples, slides, and flows—with debris flows, often called mudslides, being among the most frequent. While climate change is expected to increase their occurrence, landslides can be prevented through engineering solutions like improving drainage and building retaining walls, as well as by avoiding construction in high-risk areas near steep slopes or drainage ways.</p>
