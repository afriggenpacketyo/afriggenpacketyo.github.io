          <p>A U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is currently holding, following an exchange of living hostages for Palestinian prisoners. However, significant challenges remain, including urgent calls from international organizations like the Red Cross to open all border crossings for vital humanitarian supplies to rebuild the devastated Gaza Strip. A major point of contention is Hamas's failure to return the remains of all 24 deceased Israeli hostages as stipulated in the agreement, a violation that threatens the fragile peace.</p>

          <p>Following the U.S.-brokered peace deal, European leaders are exploring ways to play a more significant role in the region's future beyond providing reconstruction funds for Gaza. The EU has expressed readiness to contribute to a proposed temporary transitional government and an International Stabilization Force, although commitments from individual nations like France and Germany are still under consideration. However, Europe's influence may be limited, as it was largely sidelined during negotiations and has yet to secure a seat on the U.S.-led "Board of Peace" that will oversee the plan's implementation.</p>

The update also includes a more restrictive "Limited Content" option for parents and applies similar age-appropriate standards to the platform's integrated AI features.</p>

          <p>Actress and producer Reese Witherspoon has co-written her debut novel, a thriller titled "Gone Before Goodbye," with bestselling author Harlan Coben. The book features an Army combat surgeon, Maggie McCabe, who becomes entangled in an international conspiracy, a character Witherspoon created to challenge the male dominance of the action genre. Witherspoon drew inspiration from her parents' military medical careers to develop the protagonist and hopes the novel will be the first in a series that could be adapted for film or television.</p>

          <p>The mother, boyfriend, and sister of a 12-year-old Connecticut girl have been charged in connection with her death after her remains were discovered in a storage bin outside an abandoned home. Authorities allege that Jacqueline "Mimi" Torres Garcia endured "prolonged physical abuse and malnourishment" before she was killed in the fall of 2024. Her mother, Karla Garcia, and boyfriend, Jonatan Nanita, face murder charges, while her aunt, Jackelyn Garcia, is charged with unlawful restraint and cruelty. The investigation is ongoing, and the state's Department of Children and Families is reviewing its history with the family.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. government shutdown underway, many military families are experiencing significant financial stress over the potential delay of their next paycheck. Despite assurances from the Trump administration that funds have been identified to pay service members, the uncertainty is causing hardship for those already living paycheck to paycheck. Advocacy groups note that a significant portion of military families have minimal savings, making them particularly vulnerable to income disruptions and forcing them to make difficult decisions about which bills to pay.</p>

Homeowners who take out a reverse mortgage retain the legal title and ownership of their house; the lender does not take possession but places a lien on the property to secure the loan. The loan balance, including interest and fees, becomes due when the borrower sells the home, moves out, or dies, at which point the heirs can choose to repay the loan to keep the house or sell it to settle the debt.

          <p>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure has announced a significant partnership with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), planning to deploy 50,000 of its AI graphics processors starting in the latter half of 2026. This move signals a growing trend among cloud providers to offer alternatives to Nvidia's dominant GPUs for artificial intelligence workloads, particularly for AI inference tasks. The deal involves AMD's new Instinct MI450 chips, which are designed for large-scale AI systems and have also been part of a major deal with OpenAI, a key Oracle cloud customer.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving in place a $1.4 billion judgment against him for defaming the families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims. A Connecticut jury had awarded the damages in 2022 after Jones repeatedly and falsely claimed the 2012 mass shooting was a hoax. Jones's attorneys had argued the sum amounted to a "financial death penalty," but the high court denied the appeal without comment, finalizing the massive award for the plaintiffs.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is not expected to significantly disrupt the mortgage market, as most loans are originated by private lenders. However, borrowers seeking government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, VA, and USDA could experience processing delays due to staff furloughs. A key concern is the potential impact on the National Flood Insurance Program, administered by FEMA, which could hamper the ability to secure required flood insurance for homes in high-risk areas, possibly delaying closings for some homebuyers.</p>

          <p>The current U.S. government shutdown is the latest in a series of funding lapses that have occurred since 1980, when a legal opinion established that agencies could not operate without congressionally approved funding. There have been 14 shutdowns over the past four decades, with eight occurring during the Reagan administration, though most were brief. The frequency and duration of shutdowns have increased in the last decade, with a 21-day shutdown under President Clinton in 1995 and a record 34-day shutdown under President Trump in 2018, often stemming from partisan disputes.</p>

This is because their compensation is mandated by the Constitution and funded through a permanent appropriation that does not require annual renewal, unlike the budgets for most federal agencies. While lawmakers' pay is secure, their staff members are treated like other federal employees and will not be paid until the shutdown ends, though each office determines which staffers are "essential" and must continue working.</p>

          <p>A U.S. government shutdown happens when Congress fails to pass appropriations bills to fund federal agencies before the fiscal year begins on October 1. Without authorized funding, agencies must cease all non-essential functions, furloughing many employees while "essential" staff, such as military personnel and air traffic controllers, must work without immediate pay. While entitlement programs like Social Security continue, other services can be disrupted, and the economic impact can be significant, as seen in the 2018-2019 shutdown which caused an estimated $3 billion in permanent economic losses.</p>
