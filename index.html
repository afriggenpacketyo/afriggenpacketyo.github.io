        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Huawei has unveiled new computing systems powered by its Ascend chips, designed to boost artificial intelligence capabilities and challenge Nvidia's market dominance in China. The company plans to launch the "Atlas 950 SuperCluster" next year, featuring over 500,000 Ascend chips, with a more advanced version slated for 2027. This move aligns with the Chinese government's emphasis on self-reliance in chip technologies, as US sanctions restrict access to advanced semiconductors. While Huawei's claims of superior computing power need verification, its ambition to lead in AI remains significant, potentially reshaping the competitive landscape in the AI chip market. Optimism around the company's future prospects is tempered by the challenges posed by ongoing US sanctions. </p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk announced positive late-stage trial results for its once-daily obesity pill, revealing "significant" weight reduction comparable to its injectable Wegovy. The Oasis 4 trial demonstrated an average weight reduction of 16.6% after 64 weeks in patients with obesity or overweight and at least one comorbidity. The oral semaglutide pill offers patients an alternative to injections, potentially increasing accessibility and adoption. The pill is currently under FDA review, with a decision expected in the fourth quarter of this year, and if approved, it will be manufactured in the U.S. The promising results have the potential to broaden treatment options for individuals struggling with weight management. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has pledged to fight "vexatious, last-minute claims" that obstruct migrant deportations, following a temporary block on the deportation of an Eritrean man to France. The man, who arrived in the UK by small boat, claimed to be a victim of modern slavery just hours before his scheduled deportation. Mahmood criticized such claims as a mockery of the laws and the country's generosity, emphasizing her commitment to securing the border. The Home Office is set to appeal the decision and review the Modern Slavery Act to prevent misuse, aiming to ensure the "one in, one out" deal with France functions effectively. The determination to streamline deportations signals a hardening stance on immigration enforcement. </p>

Palmer emphasized the team's desire to compete and perform at their best, rejecting the notion that they cannot quickly adapt to the competition's demands. Coach Enzo Maresca acknowledged the team's lack of focus throughout the entire match but expressed optimism about learning from the defeat. The game highlighted defensive lapses against a more experienced Bayern side, underscoring the challenges Chelsea faces in the Champions League.

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged to a new record high, driven by gains in real estate and technology sectors, following the Federal Reserve's expected interest rate cut. Other Asia-Pacific markets experienced mixed trading, with South Korea's Kospi rising while Australia's ASX/S&P 200 declined. The Bank of Japan is holding its policy meeting, with expectations of steady policy rates. The Fed's rate cut, framed as "risk management," led to market volatility and uncertainty among investors, although further cuts are anticipated in the coming years. The overall market sentiment remains cautious amid global economic uncertainties. </p>

The Blue Badge scheme, designed to provide parking access for disabled individuals, is being "thoroughly abused" by those seeking free parking. Enforcement is lacking, and the use of fake badges limits the availability of designated bays for those who genuinely need them. The government has strengthened powers to inspect and confiscate misused badges, but more resources are needed to combat the problem.

          <p>A federal immigration judge has ordered Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student linked to pro-Palestinian protests, to be deported to Algeria or Syria. The ruling stems from allegations that Khalil misrepresented his background on his green card paperwork. Khalil's lawyers plan to appeal, arguing that the decision is retaliation for his activism. The Trump administration has accused Khalil of "hateful behavior and rhetoric." The case underscores the ongoing legal battles faced by pro-Palestinian activists. </p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed in the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters expect the weather system to remain over open waters for the next several days but it may become a low-grade hurricane as it intensifies over the weekend. The storm's current forecast predicts that Gabrielle's track will carry it north of the Caribbean and away from land, but the system could reach Bermuda next week. Gabrielle developed about one week after what was historically considered the peak of the Atlantic hurricane season. </p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle formed in the central Atlantic Ocean, ending a nearly three-week stretch with no storms during the peak of hurricane season. The National Hurricane Center forecasts Gabrielle to become a hurricane by Sunday as it churns northwest. The United States is not expected to see direct impacts from this system, but it might churn up surf on the East Coast next week. Gabrielle is the first tropical storm in the Atlantic since Fernand fizzled on August 28. The Atlantic has struggled to produce storms this year because of dry air and stronger-than-usual wind shear. </p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines CEO Dave Davis announced plans to cut flights by 25% in November and brace employees for more job cuts, weeks after declaring its second bankruptcy in less than a year. The airline is planning its November schedule and Davis told employees they will see a 25% cut in capacity over 2024 "as we optimize our network to focus on our strongest markets." The struggling discount carrier is in negotiations with vendors and aircraft lessors, and is evaluating its fleet size, as it tries to shrink itself to find more stable footing. The company is also planning to meet with the airlines' union leaders in the coming weeks. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts anticipate that China's central bank will implement only moderate easing measures this year, even after the US Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. The Fed's move is expected to create more room for looser monetary policy in China. Following the Fed's announcement, the offshore yuan strengthened overnight. Economists predict a smaller rate cut pace from the PBOC compared to the Fed, which could narrow the interest rate gap and ease capital outflow pressures on the yuan. This approach aims to support the yuan's stability. (not investment advice)</p>
