          <p>Romania has become the second NATO country, after Poland, to report a Russian drone entering its airspace. The unmanned aircraft was detected by Romanian F-16s monitoring Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure near the Danube river before it disappeared from radar. The incursion, which did not fly over populated areas, has been condemned by the EU as an unacceptable breach of sovereignty. In response to recent airspace violations, Poland has increased its air defense readiness, and the Czech Republic has deployed a special operations helicopter unit to Poland to reinforce NATO's eastern flank.</p>

          <p>Laurence Tribe, a distinguished professor emeritus at Harvard Law, faced significant backlash on social media for sharing a debunked claim that the suspect in Charlie Kirk's assassination was an "ultra-MAGA" supporter. Tribe's post amplified a narrative attempting to blame the political right for the tragedy, a claim that contradicts FBI reports confirming the suspect, Tyler Robinson, was in a romantic relationship with a transgender partner. Critics, including Jeremy Carl of the Claremont Institute, accused Tribe of disseminating "absolute lies" and disinformation from a notoriously unreliable source. The incident highlights the rapid spread of misinformation following politically charged violent events.</p>

          <p>Following a large "Unite the Kingdom" march in London organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated that the British flag will not be surrendered to those who use it as a symbol of division and fear. The event, which drew over 150,000 participants and a smaller counter-protest, resulted in injuries to 26 police officers and 24 arrests. Starmer emphasized that while peaceful protest is a core value, assaults on police and intimidation will not be tolerated. The prime minister affirmed that the flag represents Britain's tolerance and diversity.</p>

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox has confirmed that Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect in the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, is not cooperating with authorities. While Robinson has not confessed, Cox noted that people around him, including his roommate who is a transitioning transgender person, are cooperating with the investigation. The governor also confirmed reports that Robinson had communicated on the platform Discord after the shooting, making jokes about being the gunman.

          <p>An explosion at an empty house in Bradford, UK, led to the arrest of two men on suspicion of metal theft. The blast, which occurred on Southfield Lane, completely destroyed one property and damaged two neighboring houses, resulting in minor injuries to a man, woman, and child. A 27-year-old man was found seriously injured near the scene and arrested, while a 28-year-old man who initially fled was apprehended later. Neighbors described a massive "boom" that shook their homes, with debris scattered across the street, prompting a large emergency services response.</p>

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham warns that the United States is in a "dangerous place" historically. He argues that political violence erupts when there are fundamental, existential disagreements about who qualifies as an American and who is included in "We the People." Meacham connects the recent string of violent acts to a period where the nation is debating not just political methods but the very purpose of its politics. He urges leaders to uphold the "American covenant" of peaceful debate and dissent, drawing on historical moments of perseverance to inspire a path away from violence.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian military drones have successfully struck the Kirishi oil refinery, one of Russia's largest, located in the northwestern Leningrad region. The attack caused a fire and explosions at the facility, which is operated by Surgutneftegas and is a top-three producer of crude oil in the country. This strike is part of a sustained Ukrainian campaign targeting Russian oil infrastructure, which Kyiv states is crucial to fueling Moscow's war effort. The attack comes as Russia faces domestic gasoline shortages, leading to a temporary ban on exports to stabilize its internal market and prices.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Constitution, one of the world's oldest, was intentionally designed by its framers to be a work in progress, adaptable through amendments. Historian Jill Lepore and National Constitution Center CEO Jeffrey Rosen explain that the document was a product of compromise, with many founders expecting it to be constantly revised to reflect an evolving nation. Key changes, like the Bill of Rights and post-Civil War amendments abolishing slavery, demonstrate this intended flexibility. However, with no meaningful amendments in over 50 years and increasing reliance on Supreme Court interpretation, some experts worry that the system of checks and balances is not functioning as the founders intended.</p>

The site, which hosts graphic images of real violence, has been linked to several other recent school shooters, suggesting a pattern of online radicalization. According to the ADL, these online spaces glorify violence and allow perpetrators to reference and pay tribute to one another.

          <p>This opinion article argues that while the assassination of Charlie Kirk is a tragedy to be condemned, the rush to eulogize him as a virtuous practitioner of political debate is a dishonest revision of his life. The author contends that Kirk's public appearances were not good-faith debates but rather trolling affairs designed to humiliate opponents and spread hateful rhetoric against minority groups. The piece criticizes commentators who have praised Kirk's "moxie," pointing to his opposition to the Civil Rights Act and his promotion of racist theories as evidence that he worked against civic equality.

The piece critiques the failed peace process, arguing it misunderstood the conflict by suppressing historical grievances and prioritizing security over justice.

          <p>Immigrant communities in Los Angeles are experiencing heightened fear following a Supreme Court ruling allowing federal agents to conduct warrantless raids, with the Department of Homeland Security vowing to "flood the zone." This has created a difficult choice for many undocumented workers, who must risk deportation by going to work or face eviction by staying home. A recent report found that earnings for immigrants in the city dropped significantly as they avoided raids, though many have since returned to work out of economic necessity. In response, volunteer groups are organizing to monitor raid activity, inform residents of their rights, and provide a protective presence in vulnerable areas.</p>

While it remains unclear if the suspect was legally carrying the weapon, the timing of the event has highlighted Utah's permissive gun laws, which include permitless carry and a lack of "red flag" laws.

          <p>University of Texas quarterback Arch Manning acknowledged he needs to improve his performance after being booed by his own fans during a lackluster 27-10 win against UTEP. The highly-touted grandson of Archie Manning, who began the season as a Heisman favorite, has struggled, completing only 55% of his passes through three games. Against UTEP, he went 11 for 25 with 114 yards, a touchdown, and an interception, including a stretch of 10 consecutive incompletions. Despite the mounting pressure and criticism, both Manning and his coach, Steve Sarkisian, expressed confidence that they can right the ship as they head into their SEC schedule.</p>

          <h2>Social Media Influencers Face Backlash for Harassing Australian Wildlife for Content</h2>

          <p>A growing backlash is targeting social media influencers who provoke and torment Australian wildlife for viral content. One recent video shows U.S. influencer Mike Holston, known as "The Real Tarzann," wrestling a crocodile in Queensland, an act the state government is investigating as illegal and dangerous. Animal rights groups like PETA and World Animal Protection are condemning this behavior, calling for stronger regulation by social media platforms to remove such exploitative content. Experts worry that these videos not only constitute animal cruelty but also encourage "copycat tourism," trivializing the stress caused to animals and putting both wildlife and people at risk.</p>

          <p>As the UK's Labour Party faces declining popularity, this analysis explores the success of Zohran Mamdani, a progressive Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City, as a potential model. Mamdani's campaign has gained significant traction through a sharp focus on economic issues like affordability, proposing clear, compelling policies such as free bus transport and a rent freeze. His success is also attributed to a strong, overarching narrative that picks a side against the status quo and a savvy use of social media to connect with voters. In contrast, critics suggest Labour has struggled with shifting priorities and a lack of a clear, compelling story.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable act of bravery, surgeons in Kyiv performed a life-saving heart transplant on a 12-year-old girl during one of the most intense Russian missile and drone attacks on the city. Dr. Borys Todurov and his team from the Kyiv Heart Institute drove through explosions to retrieve a donor heart from a 4-year-old who had died in an accident. They then successfully completed the transplant surgery for Kira Skliarova, whose own heart had been severely weakened by illness, even as their hospital building shook from the nearby blasts. Kira is now recovering, offering a story of hope and resilience amidst the war.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre has asserted that Lord Mandelson should never have been appointed as the UK's ambassador to the United States due to his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. In a BBC interview, Giuffre's brother called the appointment a sign of "deep corruption." Mandelson was recently dismissed from the post after emails revealed he sent supportive messages to Epstein in 2008 as the financier faced jail for sex offenses. A UK government minister acknowledged that had the full extent of the relationship been known, the appointment would have been "highly unlikely," as the new information was materially different from what was understood during the vetting process.</p>

          <p>A scrapbook gifted to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday, compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell and released by House Democrats, is renewing questions about what his powerful associates knew of his crimes. The book contains numerous entries with sexual innuendo, including a controversial message attributed to Donald Trump stating, "We have certain things in common, Jeffrey." The book also lists Trump, Bill Clinton, and Alan Dershowitz under the "friends" section. The release has intensified criticism of Trump for his past ties to Epstein and for his administration's failure to release all related documents as promised.</p>

          <p>In this article, the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders, Mary Lawlor, relays the harrowing experiences of Palestinian human rights workers in Gaza. These defenders continue to document atrocities and gather evidence for potential accountability despite living in catastrophic conditions, facing constant danger, and mourning the loss of their own families. They describe a daily struggle for food and water, the risk of being targeted while working, and a profound loss of faith in international law, which they feel has failed to protect them. They urge the world not to wait until they are killed to document their cases and to pressure governments to end the violence.</p>

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is seen as a potential turning point in a rising tide of political violence in the United States. Data shows a nearly 40% increase in terrorism and targeted violence plots in the first half of 2025 compared to the previous year, creating a climate some experts compare to the turbulent 1960s. However, the current era is considered more dangerous due to the influence of social media in accelerating radicalization and the widespread availability of lethal weapons. As prominent voices on the right call for retribution, experts on extremism worry that inflammatory responses could fuel further violence rather than de-escalate tensions.</p>

          <p>A plan by Florida's Surgeon General, Joseph Ladapo, to eliminate all vaccine mandates in the state has faltered following criticism from former President Donald Trump and public health experts. Ladapo had announced an effort to end all mandates, framing it as a fight for freedom, but Trump quickly voiced support for standard childhood vaccines, calling them uncontroversial and effective. In response to the backlash, the Florida Department of Health has clarified it will only propose removing requirements for vaccines not mandated by legislation for school entry, such as for chickenpox and hepatitis B. The future of the broader push now rests with a state legislature whose leaders are Trump loyalists.</p>

          <p>Gregory Bovino, a 29-year Customs and Border Protection veteran, has become the public face of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration raids in major Democratic-run cities like Los Angeles and Chicago. As the head of the El Centro sector, Bovino has spearheaded operations far from his usual rural border jurisdiction, using tactics that have drawn sharp criticism from local officials for being overly aggressive and racially motivated. His self-promotional, action-film-style social media videos and politically charged statements have led critics to suggest he is courting favor with President Trump. Experts warn that using border patrol agents for urban policing is risky.</p>

          <p>This advice column addresses a reader struggling with scrupulosity—an obsessive worry about one's own morality—especially in the context of the Jewish High Holidays. The author suggests moving away from a mindset of moral optimization, which can be paralyzing and unrealistic for humans, who are inherently flawed. Instead, the column advocates for self-compassion and reframing "sin" as "missing the mark," an understandable human error rather than a damning failure. Citing psychological research, the author argues that self-compassion leads to greater personal responsibility and a willingness to make amends, offering a healthier path to being a better person than constant, guilt-ridden self-analysis.</p>

          <p>This article provides advice on how to handle potentially fraudulent door-to-door salespeople, prompted by a reader's unsettling encounter with an aggressive lawn-mowing offer. While not all such offers are scams, high-pressure tactics, refusal to take no for an answer, and demands for upfront payment are major red flags. Common scams involve home repair, security system upgrades, or utility services, often targeting older adults. To protect oneself, consumers should never let strangers into their homes, should research any company making an offer, and always insist on a detailed written contract. If scammed, it's crucial to document everything and report the incident to law enforcement.</p>
