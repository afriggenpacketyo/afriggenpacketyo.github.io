          <p>China's official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) registered at 49.3 for July, indicating a contraction for the fourth straight month and falling short of analyst expectations. The decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including extreme weather events like heatwaves and heavy rains, alongside persistent trade tensions with the United States. Economists express concern as key sub-indexes for employment, new orders, and raw materials also pointed to a contraction, suggesting a worrying economic slowdown in the second half of the year.

          <p>A former Chinese ambassador to Germany, Shi Mingde, has suggested that the European Union's recent trade deal with the United States could deepen its economic and security dependence on Washington. Speaking at an event in Beijing, the diplomat argued this reliance might hinder the EU's pursuit of strategic autonomy. This perspective comes as the EU implements a "de-risking" policy to reduce its reliance on China, a move Beijing views as a veiled attempt to contain its growth.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Why India Resisted Rushing into a Trade Agreement with the US</h2>

          <p>Despite facing new 25% tariffs from the U.S., India has strategically avoided hurrying into a trade deal, primarily to protect its sensitive agricultural sector, which represents a large and influential voting bloc. Analysts suggest India is negotiating from a position of strength, aware of its growing importance to the U.S. as a strategic partner and a manufacturing alternative to China. New Delhi appears confident it can secure a favorable agreement on its own timeline without compromising key national interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The man responsible for a deadly 2024 Christmas market attack in Magdeburg, Germany, has caused further distress to his victims by sending them personal letters from his jail cell. The perpetrator, who killed six people, somehow obtained the names and home addresses of survivors and mailed them handwritten letters asking for forgiveness. Recipients have expressed shock and a sense of being re-traumatized by the unwanted contact, prompting calls for authorities to prevent similar correspondence in the future.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows How Recent US Tariffs Are Beginning to Affect the American Economy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC Verify analysis explores the initial economic impacts of the Trump administration's sweeping new tariffs. The policies have led to a tripling of the U.S. government's monthly tariff revenue and prompted many firms to stockpile imported goods, which temporarily widened the trade deficit. There are now early signs that these tariffs are starting to translate into higher consumer prices for specific categories of goods, such as appliances, computers, and toys.

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, maintaining the current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The decision comes despite public pressure from President Donald Trump for a rate cut to stimulate the economy. In an unusual move, two members of the board dissented, voting in favor of a cut, signaling a potential broadening of support for lower rates as policymakers grapple with the uncertain effects of tariffs and global economic conditions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a major earthquake in Russia that triggered tsunami alerts, this article explains the science behind these powerful ocean waves. Tsunamis are most often caused by large, shallow underwater earthquakes that create a vertical displacement of the seafloor, generating waves that travel at jet-plane speeds in deep water. As they approach the coast, they slow down and their height increases dramatically, creating a dangerous surge of water that can cause widespread devastation, making evacuation warnings critical.</p>

          <p>A research expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered and filmed what they describe as "thriving communities" of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. The team observed vast fields of tube worms, beds of clams, and mats of bacteria in the pitch-dark, high-pressure environment. These findings challenge long-held assumptions about the limits of life in extreme ocean depths and suggest that such chemosynthetic ecosystems, fueled by chemicals from the seafloor, may be widespread.</p>
