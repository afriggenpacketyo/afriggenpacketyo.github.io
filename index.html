          <p>Following recent military action by the U.S. and Israel, Iran has stated it will not return to nuclear negotiations, asserting that the attacks have made diplomacy more difficult. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared the operation a "great victory" and an opportunity to expand peace agreements, while a hostage families forum urged a comprehensive deal to end the Gaza war. Concurrently, Russian President Vladimir Putin commented that the situation is "calming down" and called for all parties to return to diplomacy, suggesting that the conflict appears to be in the past and economic relations can now be developed.</p>

          <p>The NFL has suspended former Baltimore Ravens kicker Justin Tucker for the first ten weeks of the 2026 season for violating the league's personal conduct policy. This decision follows accusations from sixteen massage therapists who alleged inappropriate behavior by Tucker between 2012 and 2016, claims which he has denied as "unequivocally false." In a statement, Tucker's representative expressed disappointment with the NFL's decision but indicated that Tucker would accept the resolution to move forward. The Ravens had previously released the five-time All-Pro kicker in May, citing it as a "football decision."</p>

          <p>The White House has clarified that no meeting is currently scheduled with Iran, contradicting President Trump's recent statement that talks would occur "next week." Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt affirmed that while the administration remains in close communication with Iranian officials and intermediaries, the immediate goal is to bring Iran to agree to a non-enrichment, civil nuclear program. To entice Iran back to negotiations, the administration is reportedly considering options such as facilitating access to billions in funds for a civilian nuclear program and offering sanctions relief, contingent on Iran committing to zero uranium enrichment.</p>

          <p>An Egyptian national has pleaded guilty to a federal charge after kicking a U.S. Customs and Border Protection K9 at Dulles International Airport. The incident occurred when the 5-year-old beagle, Freddy, alerted to the man's luggage, which was later found to contain over 100 pounds of prohibited agricultural items. According to the affidavit, the man kicked the dog so hard it was lifted off the ground, causing injuries that required veterinary care. The 70-year-old man was credited with time served, ordered to pay the $840 veterinarian fee, and has since returned to Egypt.</p>

          <p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has sharply criticized the European Union for its "double standards" in failing to suspend its association agreement with Israel despite what he termed a "catastrophic situation of genocide" in Gaza. This follows an EU report that found "indications" of Israel breaching its human rights obligations. While Spain and Ireland advocate for suspending the trade deal, they face opposition from other member states like Germany, making the required unanimity for such a move unlikely. Top EU diplomats have stated the goal is not to punish Israel but to trigger improvements, with the issue to be revisited next month.</p>

          <p>The UK government is reportedly set to announce a significant compromise on its proposed changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and Universal Credit benefits. According to sources, a deal has been reached with over 100 Labour backbenchers who had threatened to defeat the government's plans. The expected concessions include allowing existing claimants to continue receiving their current payment levels and fast-tracking support programs designed to help individuals find employment. This move represents a major climbdown by the government to avoid a potential legislative defeat on its key welfare reform policy.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially launched his re-election bid as an independent candidate, positioning himself against the Democratic party's presumptive nominee, Zohran Mamdani. Adams, who did not seek the Democratic nomination amid a corruption scandal, is framing the race as a choice between his "record on the streets" and Mamdani's "silver spoon" socialism. He is actively courting the city's business community and Wall Street leaders, who are reportedly concerned about Mamdani's progressive proposals like rent freezes and higher taxes. Adams promises to continue focusing on crime reduction, mental health, and affordable housing.</p>

          <p>The White House has indicated that President Trump's upcoming July deadlines for reimposing tariffs on imports from numerous countries are "not critical" and could be extended. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the decision rests with the president, who could also unilaterally offer a reciprocal tariff rate if deals are not reached. This signaling of flexibility, which follows similar comments from other administration officials, suggests that tariffs may not automatically increase for countries engaged in "good faith" negotiations. So far, the U.S. has only announced framework trade agreements with China and the United Kingdom. (not investment advice)</p>

This structural change aligns the U.S. publication with other international Vogue editions and allows the 75-year-old Wintour to focus more on her global and corporate responsibilities, while remaining at the top of the organization's masthead.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a period of decline earlier in the year, interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have risen slightly, but potential for a decrease remains this summer. This article identifies three key dates when rates could fall: the release of the June inflation report on July 15, and the conclusions of the Federal Reserve meetings on July 29 and September 17. A cooling inflation report or a decision by the Fed to cut its benchmark rate could lead lenders to lower variable HELOC rates. The September Fed meeting is considered the most likely catalyst for a rate reduction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CDC advisory committee, recently reconstituted by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has voted to recommend against the use of flu vaccines containing the preservative thimerosal. This decision came despite statements from the CDC and FDA that there is no evidence of harm from the low doses used in some vaccines. The vote sparked controversy during the meeting, with one committee member arguing against the recommendation, citing a lack of scientific evidence of risk and the potential for increased vaccine costs globally.

          <p>The victory of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani in New York's mayoral primary has reignited a national debate within the Democratic Party about its ideological direction. Mamdani's win over the more moderate former Governor Andrew Cuomo is seen by some as a sign of momentum for the party's progressive wing, which emphasizes issues like affordability with bold proposals. However, the victory has also drawn concern from moderate Democrats and criticism from Republicans, who are casting Mamdani as "radical." The outcome raises the question of whether his playbook represents a viable path forward for Democrats nationally or if it is an exception specific to New York City.</p>

The bear had a history of confrontations with humans, including breaking into homes and a car with a child inside. California wildlife officials stated that euthanasia was a last resort, taken because the bear posed a significant public safety risk after attempts to haze it away from populated areas had failed.

          <p>Republican Representative Kat Cammack of Florida announced that her offices were evacuated due to "imminent death threats" against her and her family. She stated the threats began after she shared her personal story of an ectopic pregnancy, where she said doctors were hesitant to provide treatment due to fears of violating the state's strict abortion ban. Cammack blamed "fearmongering" by opponents of the law for the incident. The U.S. Capitol Police confirmed they are investigating the threats, highlighting the intense and dangerous political climate surrounding abortion access and the safety of public officials.</p>

          <p>An Israeli drone strike targeting a Hamas police unit in a market in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, has killed at least 18 Palestinians, according to a local doctor and eyewitnesses. The police officers, who were in civilian clothes, were reportedly confronting vendors over alleged price gouging of aid supplies when the strike occurred. The incident highlights the chaotic and desperate humanitarian situation, with civilians struggling to access food amid violence and scarcity. It also comes as Israeli officials accuse Hamas of stealing aid, a claim that Hamas and local tribal committees deny, stating that aid security is a local effort.</p>

          <p>An article from The Atlantic suggests that Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is facing a conflict between her non-interventionist principles and President Trump's more aggressive stance, particularly regarding Iran. Despite her initial mission to prevent the politicization of intelligence, Gabbard has reportedly altered her public statements on Iran's nuclear program to align with the president's narrative after he publicly contradicted her initial assessment. This perceived shift has reportedly damaged her credibility within the intelligence community and diminished her influence in the White House, with some associates believing her peace-focused approach is a poor fit for the administration's current direction.</p>

          <p>This article compares the potential interest earnings of depositing $10,000 into a short-term certificate of deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account in the current financial climate. While short-term CD rates are currently competitive, the analysis shows that the earnings difference is minimal. For example, a 6-month CD at 4.51% would earn just over $5 more than a high-yield savings account at 4.30%. Conversely, a 9-month CD would earn about $10 less. The choice between the two depends on a saver's outlook on future interest rate movements and their need for liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

The court upheld a civil conviction against producer Luis de Llano for the abusive relationship he had with Sokol nearly four decades ago, when she was 14 and he was 39. This landmark decision establishes that the statute of limitations does not apply in civil cases involving the sexual abuse of minors, paving the way for other victims to seek justice.

The survey of nearly 9,000 validated voters found that non-voters in 2024 preferred Trump over Kamala Harris, 44% to 40%. This finding challenges the long-held political assumption that higher turnout typically benefits the Democratic party. The study also highlighted a shift in demographics, with Trump's 2024 coalition being younger and more ethnically diverse compared to his 2016 base, while Harris's coalition became whiter.</p>

In an interview with NPR, he explained how high temperatures can cause materials like asphalt and steel to expand and degrade, leading to problems such as buckling roads, warped railway tracks, and stressed bridges. As climate change leads to more frequent and intense heatwaves, these effects challenge the durability and safety of our transportation networks. This requires a re-evaluation of how infrastructure is designed, built, and maintained to withstand these new environmental stresses.</p>

A paper from Apple researchers, titled "The Illusion of Thinking," found that these models fail to solve problems beyond a certain level of complexity and may not be developing generalizable problem-solving skills. This suggests that instead of "thinking," the models might simply be memorizing patterns, a limitation that could challenge the industry's narrative of a swift path to superintelligence. These findings could have significant implications for the AI industry, which has been heavily investing in the computational power needed for these advanced models.</p>

          <p>Beamish, The Living Museum of the North, an open-air museum in County Durham, has won the prestigious Â£120,000 Art Fund award for UK's museum of the year. The museum brings the history of the North East region to life through immersive, faithful recreations of towns, farms, and a colliery from the 1820s to the 1950s. Judges praised the museum as a "joyous, immersive and unique place" and were impressed by the passion of its staff and the completion of its "Remaking Beamish" project. The project, which included a new 1950s town, was developed with input from thousands of local residents and schoolchildren.</p>
