          <p>Experts believe Israel's precision strikes on Iranian nuclear and military infrastructure could create a strategic opportunity for the US in nuclear talks.  The operation, while unilateral, involved real-time intelligence sharing with the US.  Some analysts suggest a "bad cop, good cop" strategy, with Israel applying military pressure and the US positioned to negotiate. This article highlights the potential for a revised nuclear deal under these new circumstances.</p>
