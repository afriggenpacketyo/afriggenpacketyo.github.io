            <h2>Zelenskyy Accuses Russia of Violating Easter Truce</h2>

            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported continued Russian attacks despite Vladimir Putin's announced Easter truce. Zelenskyy stated that there were numerous shellings and assaults by Russian forces within the first six hours of the declared ceasefire, although there were no reports of casualties. He accused Russia of creating a false impression of a ceasefire while still attempting to advance in some areas. Zelenskyy reiterated Ukraine's readiness to extend the truce for 30 days if Russia genuinely engages in a full and unconditional cessation of hostilities. This proposal comes after a previous attempt at a ceasefire during Orthodox Christmas in 2023 failed. </p>

            <p>The article discusses Donald Trump's attempts to impose political authority over academic life by demanding that universities lacking viewpoint diversity hire new faculty to transform their political complexion. It argues that this approach, which essentially calls for affirmative action for conservatives, is a form of social engineering that undermines the traditional vision of scholarly objectivity. The author suggests that while viewpoint diversity is a real issue, the proposed solutions often threaten to make the problem worse by institutionalizing political identities and making political beliefs legitimate criteria for admission and recruitment. Instead, the author advocates for encouraging the capacity of the human mind to stay on the move between different points of view. </p>

            <p>Train services on Tokyo's Yamanote and Keihin-Tohoku lines have resumed after a suspension of over 24 hours due to track-switching work. The work was necessary for the construction of a new route to improve access to Haneda airport. The suspension affected approximately 550,000 people. The new route is set to open in the fiscal year starting April 2031.</p>
