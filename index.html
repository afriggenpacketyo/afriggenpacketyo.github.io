          <p>Democratic lawmakers in Texas are strongly opposing a new congressional map proposed by Republicans, arguing it is a "grossly unfair" gerrymander designed to dilute minority voting power. The plan would shift several Democratic-held districts to favor the GOP, a move Democrats warn could violate the Voting Rights Act. Critics fear this action in Texas could trigger similar partisan redistricting efforts in other states, escalating political polarization across the country. The debate highlights the contentious nature of redrawing electoral boundaries for political advantage.</p>

          <p>India has shown reluctance to finalize a trade agreement with the United States despite President Trump's imposition of a 25% tariff and an additional penalty. New Delhi is prioritizing the protection of its agricultural sector, a crucial voting bloc, and is unwilling to grant U.S. companies broader market access in this area. Analysts suggest that India's strategy of "multi-alignment," which includes pursuing trade deals with other partners like the U.K. and the EU, gives it leverage to negotiate on its own terms. This stance reflects India's aim to balance its strategic partnership with the U.S. while protecting its national interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's national air traffic control provider, NATS, is facing criticism from major airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet after a radar-related system failure caused widespread flight disruptions. The outage on Wednesday led to over 150 cancellations and grounded thousands of flights, with some knock-on effects continuing into Thursday. This incident has drawn parallels to a similar major failure in August 2023, prompting demands for answers and accountability to ensure the resilience of critical aviation infrastructure. The government is now working with NATS to investigate the cause of the system failure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.3 in July, indicating a fourth straight month of contraction and falling short of analyst expectations. The decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including seasonal downturns, extreme weather events like heatwaves and floods, and persistent trade tensions with the United States. Sub-indexes for new orders and employment also remained in contraction territory, signaling continued weakness in the world's second-largest economy. Analysts express concern that the economic impact of tariffs will become more pronounced in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese military and government scientists are actively researching methods to disable or destroy Elon Musk's Starlink satellite constellation, which they perceive as a significant national security threat. An Associated Press review of public research papers reveals proposals ranging from sabotage and laser attacks to developing custom-built hunter-killer satellites. Beijing's concerns are fueled by Starlink's potential military applications, its close ties to the U.S. defense establishment, and its near-monopoly on low-orbit satellite communications. In response, China is also accelerating the development of its own satellite mega-constellations.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company has revised its forecast for the financial impact of U.S. tariffs, now expecting them to cost the company approximately $2 billion in the current year. The automaker, which manufactures most of its vehicles in the U.S., has already incurred $800 million in extra duties in the second quarter alone. The increased costs are attributed to sustained high tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, where Ford has operations, as well as levies on imported steel and aluminum.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A New Mexico judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by actor Alec Baldwin against prosecutors and investigators involved in the fatal "Rust" movie set shooting case. Baldwin had alleged malicious prosecution and civil rights violations after an involuntary manslaughter charge against him was dismissed at trial last year. The judge dismissed the suit without prejudice due to a lack of significant action, giving Baldwin's legal team 30 days to refile. An attorney for Baldwin stated they have been engaged in good-faith settlement discussions and will refile if those talks are not resolved favorably.</p>

          <p>The Arora Group, led by hotel tycoon Surinder Arora, has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport. The plan, named Heathrow West, features a shorter third runway that would avoid the costly and complex need to reroute the M25 motorway. The group claims its proposal would be cheaper and less risky than the one from Heathrow's own operators, with a new runway operational by 2035. This marks the first time the government is considering competing bids for the long-debated expansion project, introducing a new dynamic to the process.</p>

          <p>Robinhood reported strong second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, with revenue climbing 45% year-over-year to $989 million. The company's net income more than doubled, and it added 2.3 million funded customers, bringing its total to 26.5 million. The growth was driven by strong net deposits and higher valuations in equities and cryptocurrency, reflecting the company's successful push into broader wealth management services. Despite the strong performance, the stock slipped slightly on guidance for increased operating expenses related to its pending acquisition of Bitstamp. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis by BBC Verify illustrates the initial impacts of the Trump administration's aggressive tariff policies on the U.S. economy and global trade patterns. While government tariff revenue has surged, the U.S. trade deficit has widened, partly due to companies stockpiling imports to avoid taxes. The tariffs have significantly reduced Chinese exports to the U.S., but China has increased trade with other partners. Economists are now seeing early signs that the tariffs are feeding through to U.S. consumer prices for certain imported goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to hold its key interest rate steady, resisting pressure from President Donald Trump to implement a cut. The decision was not unanimous, with two board members dissenting in favor of a rate cut, signaling a potential shift in sentiment. The Fed's cautious approach comes amid debate over the economic impact of the administration's tariffs, with policymakers weighing stable employment against concerns of slowing growth and inflation that remains above their target.

          <p>Following a major earthquake off the coast of Russia, this article explains the science behind tsunamis and the necessary safety precautions. Tsunamis are typically generated by large, shallow underwater earthquakes that cause vertical movement of the seafloor. While they travel at jet-speed in the deep ocean, they slow down and increase dramatically in height as they approach shallow coastlines, creating powerful and destructive surges. Experts emphasize that even small tsunamis are dangerous and urge people in coastal areas to heed all evacuation warnings immediately by moving to higher ground.</p>

          <p>A Chinese-led research expedition has discovered and filmed "thriving communities" of life at depths of over 9 kilometers in the Pacific Ocean, challenging previous assumptions about the limits of life. Using a human-occupied submersible, scientists observed vast fields of tube worms, clams, and bacterial mats in the pitch-dark, high-pressure environment. This life is not fueled by sunlight but by chemosynthesis, converting chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide seeping from the ocean floor into energy. The findings suggest these unique ecosystems may be widespread in the deepest parts of the ocean.</p>
