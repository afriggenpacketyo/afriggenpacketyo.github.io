          <p>General Motors announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street estimates, reporting an adjusted earnings per share of $2.53 on $47.12 billion in revenue. Despite the positive report, the company's stock saw a slight dip amid ongoing uncertainty from US auto tariffs, which GM estimates could have a significant financial impact. CEO Mary Barra stated the automaker is actively working to mitigate these costs through manufacturing adjustments and other initiatives while affirming its full-year guidance. The company is also navigating the potential end of EV tax credits, adding another layer of complexity to its future plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The German media group Südwestdeutsche Medienholding (SWMH), which owns several major newspapers including Süddeutsche Zeitung, has confirmed it was the target of a significant cyberattack. The company stated that unauthorized individuals briefly accessed its internal network in mid-July, affecting all connected publications. SWMH successfully contained the breach, ensuring that newspaper production and online reporting continued without disruption. The incident has been reported to the police cybercrime unit, and external IT security experts are assisting with the investigation to identify the perpetrators and strengthen the company's cybersecurity defenses against future attacks.</p>

          <h2>British Medical Association Warns NHS Strike Plan Puts Patients at Risk</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 06:34:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British Medical Association (BMA) has raised serious concerns that NHS England's strategy for the upcoming resident doctors' strike could endanger patients. The union argues that the directive to minimize cancellations of routine procedures will stretch senior doctors, who are covering for their striking colleagues, too thinly. This approach contrasts with previous strikes where non-urgent care was widely rescheduled to ensure emergency services remained safely staffed. The BMA warns this new plan could lead to last-minute cancellations and potential patient harm, while talks between the government and the union to avert the walkout continue over pay restoration demands.</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola is set to report its second-quarter earnings, with Wall Street analysts projecting positive results, forecasting earnings per share of 83 cents on $12.54 billion in revenue. Despite company executives warning of challenging comparisons to a strong quarter last year, optimism remains high due to Coke's significant pricing power and global market presence. The company is also navigating potential choppiness from trade tariffs, though its full-year organic revenue growth forecast remains strong at 5% to 6%. The report comes as rival PepsiCo noted a decline in its North American beverage volume, suggesting a complex market environment for the beverage giants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The death of Phillip Reeder, a 52-year-old unarmed white man in Irondale, Alabama, has been officially ruled a homicide by the county coroner. According to the autopsy and his family's lawyers, who have viewed unreleased bodycam footage, Reeder died of heart failure associated with cocaine use and police restraint, which included an officer kneeling on his neck for over three minutes. The family's attorneys have drawn direct comparisons to the 2020 death of George Floyd, highlighting Reeder's pleas of "I can't breathe." The city of Irondale disputes the family's characterization of the events, denying that a knee was used on his neck.</p>

          <p>A detailed report reveals the intense internal divisions and dramatic negotiations within the House Republican conference to pass President Trump's major legislative bill. The process involved all-night sessions and a significant charm offensive from the White House to win over holdout members, particularly from the fiscally conservative wing of the party. Republican leadership, including Speaker Mike Johnson and Whip Tom Emmer, struggled to maintain unity, with some hard-line members bypassing them to negotiate directly with the president. The saga highlights the fragile GOP majority and the complex dynamics that will likely influence future legislative battles, including upcoming government funding deadlines.</p>

The report identifies that approximately 11% of Trump's working-class supporters hold these economically progressive and socially moderate views.

The failure to extend this benefit, which was not included in President Trump's recent tax bill, would create a "subsidy cliff," where even a small increase in income could cause an enrollee to lose the entire credit, leading to significantly higher monthly costs.

This spending surge favors both traditional defense giants and emerging tech firms, subsidizing expensive and sometimes underperforming weapons systems.

For the past month, his eldest son, a Marine veteran, has become the family's spokesperson, navigating the complex immigration system and taking over his father's landscaping business to support the family. After 24 days in detention, Barranco was released on bond but still faces an uncertain future. The case highlights the difficult situation faced by mixed-status families and the complexities of immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>The estimated cost for constructing the Sizewell C nuclear power plant in Suffolk has surged to £38 billion, a significant increase from the previous official figure of £20 billion. Project officials clarified that earlier estimates did not account for inflation and risk, and that the new figure will add approximately £1 per month to household energy bills during the construction phase. The UK government confirmed it will take a 44.9% stake in the project, alongside investments from private companies like Centrica and EDF. Despite the rising costs, proponents argue the plant is essential for providing clean, homegrown power for millions of homes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a new sanctions regime targeting the global criminal networks behind people-smuggling operations. The measures will allow for asset freezes, travel bans, and financial restrictions against individuals and companies involved, including gang leaders, corrupt officials, and suppliers of small boats. This policy is a central component of the government's strategy to clamp down on illegal small boat crossings of the English Channel. Foreign Secretary David Lammy described the sanctions as a first-of-its-kind initiative designed to disrupt the business model of gangs who prey on vulnerable people, though questions remain about international enforcement.</p>

The agency reported its staff accommodation was struck three times, and that Israeli soldiers entered the premises, detained male staff members at gunpoint, and forced women and children to evacuate. One WHO staff member remains in detention. A separate strike damaged the agency's main warehouse, which is a critical hub for humanitarian aid.

The shake-up is larger than initially expected, with about half a dozen changes intended to renew the party's policy focus and present a unified front against the Labour government. The move comes eight months into Badenoch's leadership, as the party continues to poll behind Labour and Reform UK.</p>

          <p>The UK government borrowed £20.7 billion in June, a figure £6.6 billion higher than the same month last year and more than analysts had expected. The Office for National Statistics attributed the rise to increased spending on public services and soaring debt interest payments, which have been driven up by inflation. This is the second-highest June borrowing figure on record, adding to the financial pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves. Economists suggest that with this trend and recent reversals on planned welfare cuts, the government may be forced to implement tax hikes in the upcoming autumn budget. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union's proposal to condition development aid on African countries' cooperation with migration enforcement is facing strong condemnation from policy experts across Africa. Critics label the move as coercive and neo-colonial, arguing it reduces African nations to the role of border guards rather than treating them as equal partners. They contend that the policy ignores the root causes of migration, such as poverty and conflict, which are sometimes exacerbated by European trade and foreign policies. This approach, they warn, weaponizes aid, undermines trust, and could push African nations toward alternative global partnerships with countries like China and Russia.</p>
