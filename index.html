          <p>Following a militant attack in India-administered Kashmir that resulted in the deaths of 26 people, Indian authorities have detained at least 1,500 individuals and demolished homes linked to suspected militants. India has accused Pakistan of supporting the attack, leading to heightened tensions between the two nations, including the suspension of visas and trade. Some Kashmiri residents allege that Indian security forces rigged homes with explosives before demolition, a charge authorities have not addressed. A member of Parliament from Kashmir's ruling party stated that these actions serve the agendas of right-wing factions on both sides, further complicating the situation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced his intention to reinstate Columbus Day, criticizing Democrats for diminishing Christopher Columbus's legacy and appealing to Italian-American voters. This follows President Biden's recognition of Indigenous Peoples Day alongside Columbus Day, which aimed to acknowledge the exploitation of indigenous populations following Columbus's arrival in the Americas. Trump has long opposed viewing American history through a lens of diversity and oppression, while Columbus Day gained prominence as a nod to the country's growing diversity and as a response to anti-Italian sentiment in the late 19th century.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing criticism after a two-year-old U.S. citizen was deported to Honduras with her mother, and the mother of a one-year-old girl was deported to Cuba, separating them indefinitely. Lawyers argue that these actions violate due process, as the individuals were arrested during routine check-ins with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) with little opportunity to communicate with family or legal counsel. The ACLU and other groups have condemned the actions as abuses of power, while ICE maintains that the parents chose to take their children with them. The Supreme Court has intervened in similar cases, ordering the administration to facilitate the return of individuals mistakenly deported.</p>

The move has led to disruptions at nonprofit organizations, including potential layoffs and the shuttering of a national crime victims hotline. Some of the grant funds have been restored following media attention, but many organizations remain affected.

This strategy aims to initiate negotiations that could potentially lead to tariff reductions, although the ultimate outcome remains uncertain. (not investment advice)</p>

Homan stated that it's a parent's decision whether to take a child or leave them with relatives, and that having a U.S. citizen child does not make someone immune from immigration laws.

          <p>Ten individuals, mostly born in the 1950s and dubbed the "grandpa robbers," are set to appear in court in Paris for the armed robbery of Kim Kardashian in 2016. The robbers, dressed as policemen, stole approximately $10 million worth of jewelry from Kardashian, including her engagement ring. One of the robbers, Yunice Abbas, later confessed that they were unaware of Kardashian's celebrity status and that the robbery was intended as his last job before retirement.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's approval ratings are declining as he approaches 100 days in office, with a majority of Americans disapproving of his handling of the presidency. Polls indicate that his approval rating is the lowest for any newly elected president at this point in their term in more than seven decades. The decline in approval represents a shift from the uptick in favorability ratings Trump experienced upon returning to the White House in January.</p>
