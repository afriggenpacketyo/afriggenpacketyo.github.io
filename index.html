          <p>Spirit Airlines has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection again, marking its second filing in a year after failing to stabilize financially since its last restructuring. The budget carrier plans to significantly reduce its network and fleet to cut costs by hundreds of millions annually, a more drastic step than previously taken. This move comes after the airline posted significant losses, warned of its inability to survive without more cash, and faced pressures from high costs and weaker domestic travel demand. The company's future remains uncertain as it navigates this difficult period, with labor unions warning of potential furloughs and rivals looking to attract its customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A UK Court of Appeal has overturned a High Court injunction that would have forced the removal of 138 asylum seekers from the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex. The initial ruling was deemed "seriously flawed" for failing to consider the logistical challenges of relocating the migrants. The decision comes amid ongoing protests at the hotel, which were triggered after an asylum seeker housed there was charged with sexual assault. The local council, which sought the injunction based on alleged planning rule breaches, has indicated it may appeal to the Supreme Court. The ruling is seen as a significant moment in the broader national debate over housing asylum seekers in hotels.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has ended the 'de minimis' tax exemption, which previously allowed imported parcels valued under $800 to enter the country without tariffs. This change means online orders from abroad will now be subject to duties, likely leading to higher prices and longer delivery times for American consumers. The White House stated the move closes a loophole exploited for illicit goods like fentanyl and counterfeit products, while proponents claim it will level the playing field for U.S. businesses. Experts warn that common consumer goods could see significant price increases, with one analysis suggesting a 51% hike for a pair of slippers from China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singer Sabrina Carpenter has responded to the controversy surrounding the original cover art for her new album, “Man’s Best Friend,” which depicted her on her knees at a man's feet. In a recent interview, Carpenter stated she was shocked by the backlash, as she and her inner circle did not perceive it as problematic. She explained that her artistic intention was to explore themes of control and the lack of it, particularly from a young woman's perspective. After the initial criticism, an alternative, less provocative cover was released, but Carpenter maintains that the original image was about the humanity of making mistakes and learning from them.</p>

          <h2>Review: 'Caught Stealing' Delivers Gritty Style but Lacks Substance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 17:35:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Darren Aronofsky's new crime comedy, "Caught Stealing," is a stylish but ultimately shallow thriller set in 1998 New York City. The film stars Austin Butler as Hank Thompson, a former baseball prospect who becomes entangled in the city's criminal underworld over a mysterious key. Despite a talented cast including Zoë Kravitz and Regina King, the characters are described as cartoonish and underdeveloped. The article praises the film's gritty, nostalgic atmosphere that evokes Aronofsky's early work but criticizes its lack of compelling action and emotional stakes. Ultimately, the movie is deemed a disposable throwback that prioritizes its cool aesthetic over a meaningful story.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1 billion for the upcoming Saturday night drawing after no grand prize winner emerged from Wednesday's drawing. The new total, which has a cash value of $453.1 million, was revised upward from an initial estimate of $950 million due to strong national ticket sales. This marks the sixth time in the game's history that the jackpot has reached the billion-dollar threshold. No one has won the grand prize since May 31, and the odds of winning remain exceptionally low at 1 in 292.2 million. The winner can choose between a lump-sum payment or an annuity paid over 30 years.</p>

Investigators determined Hayes was driving recklessly at nearly 80 mph in a 40 mph zone just before the collision. In response to the charges, the university has indefinitely suspended Hayes from all athletic activities. Hayes was a highly-touted four-star recruit who appeared in 12 games during his freshman season with the team.</p>

The protest aims to draw attention to severe budget cuts facing the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (Septa), which he attributes to Republican inaction in the legislature. Septa is facing a $213 million deficit, leading to service reductions that impact workers, students, and the elderly. Kenyatta frames his march as part of a "time honoured American tradition" of protest, contrasting the struggles of working people with what he describes as legislators enjoying leisure activities instead of addressing the funding crisis.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has unanimously blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans residing in the U.S. The Ninth Circuit panel upheld a lower court's injunction, stating that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the administration's action was unlawful. The court found that the governing statute does not permit the Secretary of Homeland Security to arbitrarily vacate a prior extension of TPS, a program designed to be insulated from political shifts. This ruling provides temporary relief for TPS holders, many of whom faced job loss and potential deportation as their protections were set to expire.</p>

The charges against Carey are not for the act of flag burning itself but for lighting a fire in a non-designated area and in a manner that threatened property. The president's order seeks to navigate the Supreme Court precedent by focusing on prosecutions under other "content-neutral laws" and has reignited the debate over free speech and patriotic symbols.</p>

This article argues that such actions represent an "ominous turn in political lawfare," selectively targeting political opponents for a felony that is widespread but rarely prosecuted. The author highlights the hypocrisy, noting that President Trump himself was found liable for inflating assets on loan applications and that other Republican officials have faced similar mortgage-related accusations without consequence.

They argue the shooter's primary motivation appears to be a desire for notoriety within online communities that glorify mass killers.

Additionally, access for teenage users will be limited to chatbots focused on educational and skill-development purposes. The move comes after Sen. Josh Hawley launched a probe and a report from Common Sense Media recommended that no one under 18 should use Meta AI due to fundamental safety failures. The changes will roll out in English-speaking countries in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>News that Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa is considering not seeking reelection has led to widespread mockery online, with critics recalling her controversial comments from a 2024 town hall. During that event, when a constituent warned that Medicaid cuts would cause deaths, Ernst dismissively replied, "well, we all are going to die." This remark has since been used to criticize her perceived lack of compassion. Following the report of her potential retirement, social media users have sarcastically referenced the comment, making jokes about the "death" of her political career. Ernst is expected to make an official announcement about her decision next month.</p>

The claim alleges false imprisonment and racial profiling, stating that masked ICE and Border Patrol agents had no probable cause when they surrounded their vehicle and handcuffed the boy before realizing he was not the suspect they were seeking. The incident has fueled local outrage and fear regarding immigration enforcement tactics near schools. The Department of Homeland Security defended the agents' actions, stating they were conducting a targeted operation on a "criminal illegal alien."</p>

The father reported that his wife, Kayla, had experienced no symptoms of what is known as a "cryptic pregnancy."

          <p>With over a third of Senate seats up for election in 2026, the landscape for control of the chamber is becoming clearer. Democrats face a challenging map, defending 13 seats while Republicans defend 24, many in solidly red states. Key battlegrounds are emerging in states like North Carolina, where a competitive open-seat race is expected, and Georgia, where incumbent Democrat Jon Ossoff is considered vulnerable. Retirements by Democratic senators in New Hampshire, Michigan, and Minnesota are creating potential pickup opportunities for the GOP. Meanwhile, a contentious Republican primary is brewing in Texas, where incumbent John Cornyn faces a challenge from Attorney General Ken Paxton.</p>

CEO Max Levchin attributed the strong performance to increased transaction frequency and growth in both consumer and merchant numbers, noting continued strength in consumer spending. The results were bolstered by key partnerships with Shopify and Amazon, which helped offset the recent loss of Walmart as a client to a competitor. (not investment advice)</p>

State Farm is seeking an 11% rate hike on top of a 17% emergency increase granted in May. The judge denied a motion by the Department of Insurance to separate the claims inquiry from the rate hearing, a move consumer advocates believe is crucial for tying rate increases to the actual value and service policyholders receive.</p>

Antony, who had a successful loan spell at Betis last season, has been seeking a permanent move after being sidelined by United's manager. Betis stated they could not afford the transfer fee or the player's wage demands, though unverified reports suggest a dispute over outstanding contract payments may also be a factor in the collapse of the deal.</p>
