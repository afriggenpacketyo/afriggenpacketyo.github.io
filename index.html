            <p>On Easter Sunday in National Harbor, Maryland, police responded to a stabbing call where a man and a woman were critically wounded. The suspect then set fire to the apartment before fleeing, prompting officers to respond to National Harbor where they encountered the suspect still armed with a knife. During the encounter, two officers discharged their weapons, fatally striking the suspect. The stabbing victims are in critical but stable condition, and the Maryland Attorney General's Independent Investigations Division is investigating the officer-involved shooting.</p>

            <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee suggests that President Trump's tariffs could lead to an "artificially high" start to economic activity followed by a summer drop-off. Businesses are stockpiling inventory and consumers are accelerating purchases in anticipation of the tariffs, which could inflate economic activity initially but lead to a slowdown later in the year. Sectors like the auto industry are particularly likely to stock up on inventory, and Goolsbee expressed optimism about the country's longer-term economic outlook.</p>

            <p>A draft executive order from the Trump administration proposes sweeping changes to the U.S. State Department, including closing embassies in Sub-Saharan Africa and consolidating regional bureaus.

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen stated that his trip to El Salvador was to support Kilmar Ábrego García’s right to due process, emphasizing that if those rights are denied, everyone’s constitutional rights are threatened. He noted the White House's claims that Ábrego García was a member of the MS-13 gang, though he has not been charged with any gang-related crimes, and the Supreme Court has ordered his return to the US be facilitated. Van Hollen accused administration officials of lying about the case and criticized comments by Gavin Newsom.</p>
