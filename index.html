          <p>Oil prices are surging following U.S. military action in the conflict between Iran and Israel, escalating tensions in the Middle East and raising concerns about potential disruptions to oil supplies. Experts are warning of possible triple-digit oil prices as investors monitor Iran's response, particularly threats to block the Strait of Hormuz, a critical artery for global oil trade. The U.S. joined the conflict by striking Iranian nuclear facilities. A prolonged closure of the Strait could lead to significant oil price spikes, potentially retesting the highs seen in 2022, as Western forces would likely intervene to reopen it.

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Okinawa, volunteers like Takamatsu Gushiken continue to search for the remains of approximately 200,000 people killed during the three-month conflict. Gushiken, who has dedicated over four decades to this effort, seeks to return the remains to their families, expressing concern that many are buried under buildings, fields, jungles, and caves. Controversy has arisen over the quarrying of soil from southern Okinawa, the site of the bloodiest fighting, for the construction of a new U.S. air base. Gushiken and others view this as a desecration of the war dead, advocating for the preservation of these areas as peace memorials. </p>

          <p>French police are investigating a staged wedding at Disneyland Paris after staff became suspicious that the "bride" was a 9-year-old Ukrainian girl. A man reportedly hired the park for a private event involving hundreds of extras, leading staff to believe it could be an illegal child marriage. The girl's mother claimed she wanted her daughter to feel like a Disney princess for the day.

          <p>Okinawa marked the 80th anniversary of the end of the Battle of Okinawa, a devastating WWII ground battle between Japan and the United States that resulted in over 200,000 casualties, including many local residents. A memorial service was held at the Peace Memorial Park in Itoman, attended by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Okinawa Governor Denny Tamaki. The event included the addition of 342 names to the list of war dead inscribed on monuments, bringing the total to 242,567. The island remains a strategic location, hosting a significant portion of U.S. forces in Japan, which fuels anti-base sentiment among Okinawans due to noise, pollution, and crimes committed by American service members.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. missile strikes in Iran, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) held conference calls with governors and law enforcement officials to discuss the impact on the U.S. threat environment. While there is no specific intelligence of a direct, credible threat against the U.S. homeland, officials urged vigilance for increased cyber activity and potential risks to Jewish institutions. The Secure Community Network (SCN) reported a surge in violent posts directed at the Jewish community on social media after the U.S. strikes. DHS noted that Iran's retaliatory efforts against the U.S. homeland likely depend on the extent to which it believes U.S. actions threaten the regime's stability.</p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is receiving renewed attention as Japan approaches its first period without giant pandas in over half a century. China's decisions on leasing pandas abroad are typically revealed during high-level bilateral talks. Experts suggest a new loan may be announced during a potential visit by a Chinese leader to Japan later this year, amidst intensifying Sino-U.S. rivalry. The move would be a gesture of goodwill towards Tokyo.</p>
