          <p>Meta's finance chief Susan Li stated that Asia-based e-commerce exporters, particularly Chinese online retailers, have decreased their ad spending on Facebook and Instagram due to President Trump's trade policies. This reduction is linked to the impending end of de minimis trade exemptions for Chinese imports, impacting companies like Temu and Shein. Meta's advertising sales in the Asia-Pacific region fell below projections, and the company anticipates continued headwinds to its advertising business.
