          <p>President Trump is scheduled to speak with Russian President Putin and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to address the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. According to Trump's social media posts, the primary focus of these conversations will be to halt the 'bloodbath' resulting in the deaths of thousands of soldiers weekly, as well as discussing trade. This renewed contact with Putin follows unsuccessful peace talks in Istanbul, where Putin declined to participate, and underscores Trump's belief that a meeting between him and Putin is essential for resolving the conflict. The article highlights the continued long-range strikes by both sides and the stark differences in their approaches to peace negotiations.</p>

          <p>Despite Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s testimony to Congress that no working scientists had been fired, top brain scientists at the National Institutes of Health received layoff notices. These scientists, including distinguished investigator Richard Youle, are still facing termination, which could disrupt their research and the careers of their staff. Kennedy's claim has drawn criticism from laid-off scientists at other health agencies, including the CDC, where labs investigating outbreaks of viral hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases were eliminated.

          <p>President Trump is pushing a comprehensive legislative package, dubbed the 'big, beautiful bill,' through Congress, aiming to extend tax cuts, introduce new tax breaks, increase spending on immigration enforcement and the military, and raise the debt ceiling. The bill proposes deep cuts to Medicaid, clean energy, student loans, and food stamps to offset some of the costs, sparking controversy and raising concerns about its economic impact. Critics argue that the bill's reliance on deficit spending could have painful economic consequences in the current high-inflation, high-interest-rate environment.

          <p>Maine schools are caught in a political dispute with the Trump administration, which threatens to cut federal funding due to a disagreement over transgender athletes' participation in school sports.
