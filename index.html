          <p>Canada has withdrawn its planned 3% digital services tax on large technology companies, a move made to restart trade talks with the United States. The tax, which would have affected giants like Google and Amazon, was set to be collected but was rescinded after President Trump threatened to terminate all trade discussions, calling the policy an "egregious" attack. The decision was praised by U.S. officials and business groups, aiming to mend recent tensions and focus on a new economic partnership ahead of a July 21 deadline for new trade terms.</p>

The Congressional Budget Office estimates it will add nearly $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.

          <p>The price of gold, a commodity often viewed as a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, is subject to constant fluctuation based on various market forces. As of June 27, 2025, the price stood at $3,272.56 per ounce, but this figure is influenced by factors including supply and demand, global economic conditions, and inflation rates. Geopolitical uncertainty, interest rates set by central banks, and the strength of the U.S. dollar also play significant roles in determining its value.

This preliminary data from Europe's largest economy could provide reassurance to the ECB that its monetary policy is effectively curbing price pressures across the eurozone. However, analysts note that service inflation remains elevated and that the disinflationary trend is partly driven by external factors, such as falling energy prices. The ECB is expected to remain cautious, likely making one more interest rate cut this year before pausing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate's major spending bill has undergone last-minute revisions that benefit the fossil fuel industry while accelerating the phase-out of clean energy tax credits, drawing sharp criticism from figures like Elon Musk. The updated legislation adds new support for coal and proposes eliminating electric vehicle credits by September, while also imposing a new tax on some wind and solar projects. These changes come as a new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add at least $3.3 trillion to the national debt, raising concerns among fiscal conservatives.

          <p>The UK government is set to release more details about concessions made to its controversial welfare reform bill in an effort to prevent a rebellion from its own Labour MPs. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was forced to scale back the proposed cuts after facing significant opposition, reducing the expected savings from £5 billion to £2 billion. The original plans to restrict eligibility for Personal Independence Payments (Pip) and cut Universal Credit's health element sparked backlash.

While the U.S. has often viewed its southern neighbors with condescension, Latin American nations have a long tradition of embedding collective social rights into their foundational principles, unlike the U.S. Constitution's focus on individual rights. From early anti-slavery movements to enshrining rights to healthcare and education, the region's focus on "the common good" offers a different model for democratic governance that prioritizes societal well-being.</p>

          <h2>Cognition Expert Explores How Dogs Perceive the World Through Smell</h2>

          <p>Understanding how dogs experience the world requires recognizing that smell is their primary sense, according to dog cognition researcher Alexandra Horowitz. Unlike humans, who are visual creatures, dogs construct their reality from olfactory information, mapping their environment and even perceiving the passage of time through changing scents. For dogs, smells are not simply good or bad but are crucial data points about their surroundings. This fundamental difference in perception means that while humans can form deep bonds with their pets, the inner world of a dog remains a delightful and complex mystery, shaped by a sense we barely utilize.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Examines the Reality of the Iranian 'Sleeper Cell' Threat in the U.S.</h2>

          <p>Following the recent conflict between Iran, Israel, and the U.S., American security agencies have warned of potential retaliatory attacks from Iranian-backed "sleeper cells" within the country. While experts confirm that Iran likely maintains small clandestine cells for surveillance and targeted operations, they suggest that activating them for a major attack on U.S. soil is a contingency reserved for moments of existential threat. The current narrative, amplified by some politicians and media outlets, may overstate the immediate danger, as Iran's recent actions suggest a desire to de-escalate direct conflict with the United States rather than inflame it.</p>
