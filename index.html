          <p>An Iranian missile struck a hospital in southern Israel, causing damage and injuries, which led to strong condemnation from Israeli officials. Israel's defense minister accused Iran of war crimes and vowed to hold Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accountable, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised a strong response. The Israeli military has been instructed to intensify attacks on strategic and governmental targets within Iran. Meanwhile, President Trump is considering direct U.S. involvement in the conflict, which includes potential strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.</p>

          <p>During a press conference about the installation of new flagpoles at the White House, President Trump jokingly questioned the immigration status of the construction workers present. This remark followed a question about his administration's deportation efforts, during which he mentioned the removal of "murderers, drug dealers, and people that are mentally insane." Trump's comments came as his administration continues to pursue stringent immigration policies, including mass deportation programs. He added that the flagpoles were a gift from him to the White House, which he felt was missing them.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly becoming more comfortable with the idea of military strikes against Iran's Fordo nuclear facility, according to sources familiar with the intelligence. The potential operation would involve multiple strikes, utilizing American B-2 stealth bombers and 30,000-pound "bunker-buster" bombs. This consideration comes amid ongoing tensions and a lack of response from Iran regarding nuclear talks, with Trump seeking input from his base on the matter. The Israelis have discovered that they did not take out all air defenses in Iran as they had previously thought, adding to concern.</p>

          <p>Destroying Iran's nuclear program is a difficult task, given the advanced and hardened nature of facilities like the Fordo plant, which is built deep underground. The U.S. possesses the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) "bunker buster" and the B2 Spirit stealth bomber capable of deploying it, making a U.S. strike a possibility. However, multiple strikes may be necessary, and the extent of the damage would be uncertain, potentially requiring ground personnel.

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has cut the VA Servicing Purchase (VASP) program, which helped veterans behind on their mortgages avoid foreclosure. This decision has drawn criticism from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, as well as from veterans themselves, who now face worse options than other homeowners. The VA cited concerns about the program's cost, while critics argue that it removes a crucial safety net for veterans. The VASP program had provided low-interest-rate mortgages to over 33,000 veterans, but now many face potential foreclosure or having to sell their homes.</p>

          <p>With a significant heat wave expected to hit much of the United States, it's crucial to take precautions when planning outdoor activities. Checking the heat index, wearing lightweight clothing, and opting for shady environments can help mitigate the risks of heat-related illnesses. Recognizing the symptoms of heat exhaustion, staying hydrated, and taking frequent breaks are also essential for staying safe in hot weather. Extreme heat is the No. 1 weather-related killer in the United States, and warmer-than-normal temperatures are expected throughout the summer.</p>

          <h2>Passing Star Could Disrupt Earth's Orbit, Simulations Suggest</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates a passing star could cause more havoc in our solar system than previously believed, potentially disrupting the orbits of planets, including Earth. Simulations suggest a small chance of Earth being involved in a planetary collision or ejection over the next four billion years. While these events are not considered probable, the risk of instability for planets like Mars and Mercury could increase significantly. The gravitational tug from a passing star could destabilize even previously stable objects like Pluto.</p>

          <p>Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel is calling on the UK government to support the US if it attacks Iran, despite concerns raised by the UK's top legal adviser regarding international law. Patel argues that the UK cannot "hide behind legal advice at a time of crisis" and should work alongside allies like the US and Israel. She suggested the UK could assist the US through the use of bases or refueling aircraft, emphasizing the need to degrade Iran's nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities.
