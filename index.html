          <p>Jasveen Sangha, dubbed the "Ketamine Queen," has agreed to plead guilty to five federal charges related to the drug overdose death of actor Matthew Perry. According to the Justice Department, she supplied the ketamine that led to his passing in October 2023. Sangha is the last of five individuals charged in the case to enter a guilty plea. The plea agreement also includes admissions to her involvement in another fatal overdose in 2019 and maintaining a residence for drug distribution.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Justice Department. The suit challenges a new rule that links federal grants for crime victim services to cooperation with immigration enforcement. The states argue this condition is illegal, as the original law establishing the grants does not mention immigration, and it forces them to choose between critical funding and their sanctuary policies. They seek an injunction to block the rule, which they claim undermines trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities.</p>

The holiday originated from the labor movement's fight for better working conditions in the late 19th century. While most government offices, banks, and Costco will be closed, major retailers like Target and Walmart, along with most grocery stores and fast-food chains, are expected to remain open.

          <p>A proposal for a new, large-scale Chinese embassy at London's former Royal Mint site is highlighted as a symbol of China's growing global influence and long-term diplomatic strategy. The opinion article argues that while the project faces some political opposition over security concerns, its approval could signal the UK's continued importance as a global capital. The author contrasts China's investment in its diplomatic presence with the UK's recent sales of prominent embassy properties, suggesting different approaches to international relations and the projection of power.</p>

The findings align with public sentiment, as a majority of Americans report their income is not keeping up with the rising cost of living. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iran is on the brink of a severe water crisis, with officials warning that its ten million residents could face water shortages within weeks. The impending crisis is attributed to a combination of a prolonged drought, extreme summer heat, and governmental mismanagement of the country's water resources and dams. This situation poses a significant threat to the population and highlights the critical challenges Iran faces in managing its natural resources amidst changing climate conditions and internal policy failures.</p>

          <p>Leaked audio recordings have revealed that former Israeli military intelligence chief, Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, stated that 50,000 deaths in Gaza were "necessary and required for future generations." In the remarks, aired by Israeli television, Haliva suggested that for every Israeli killed on October 7, 50 Palestinians should die, regardless of whether they are children, to send a message. Haliva, who resigned over intelligence failures leading to the attack, has since confirmed the authenticity of the remarks from a private discussion but said they were taken out of context.</p>

          <h2>Retail Inventory Method Accounting May Obscure True Impact of Tariffs on Profitability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 15:38:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A specific accounting practice known as the retail inventory method (RIM), used by major retailers like Walmart and Target, could temporarily distort their reported profitability as new tariffs take effect. Because RIM uses an average cost-to-retail ratio rather than the actual cost of each item, it can initially overstate profits when product costs rise suddenly. While this effect normalizes over several quarters, it creates a disconnect between a company's operational efforts to mitigate tariffs and what is reflected in its short-term financial statements.

          <p>The U.S. State Department has revoked more than 6,000 visas for international students due to violations of U.S. law, overstays, and alleged support for terrorism. The department stated that the most common violations included assault, DUI, and burglary. This action is part of the Trump administration's broader crackdown on immigration and follows new policies requiring enhanced social media screening for visa applicants. The move has drawn criticism from Democrats, who argue it is an attack on due process for students legally in the country.</p>

          <p>The musical "& Juliet" offers a modern, feminist reimagining of Shakespeare's classic tragedy, powered by the pop hits of producer Max Martin. The show's premise has Juliet choosing not to die and instead embarking on a journey of self-discovery in Paris with her friends. The review praises the production for its energetic choreography, clever book by David West Read, and powerful vocal performances, particularly from Rachel Webb as Juliet. It is described as a euphoric and witty dance party that successfully turns a tragic tale into a feel-good celebration.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While there are no federal age limits for purchasing annuities, most insurance companies impose their own restrictions, typically capping buyers at around 80 to 85 years old. The optimal age to buy depends on individual retirement strategy; purchasing in one's late 50s or 60s can allow for growth, while buying an immediate annuity closer to retirement age provides a stable income stream. Waiting until one's 70s can result in higher monthly payouts due to shorter life expectancy calculations, but it also risks reduced product availability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The third-ever observed interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, is exhibiting unusual characteristics, including a glow of light ahead of its motion without a corresponding cometary tail. Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb has pointed to this as evidence that the object may be generating its own light. He proposed two possibilities: it is either a rare radioactive fragment from a supernova or an artificially powered spacecraft. While acknowledging the need for more evidence, Loeb has successfully encouraged NASA to use its Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to observe the object during its close approach this fall.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is now citing the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act to scrutinize wind energy projects, a move critics suggest is aimed at hindering renewable energy development rather than genuine concern for wildlife. While wind turbines do pose a threat to eagles, conservationists point out that far greater threats include climate change—the very problem wind energy helps address—and habitat loss. Critics also note the irony, as the administration has simultaneously worked to weaken other environmental regulations, including protections for migratory birds and endangered species.</p>
