          <p>On May 16, Sinti and Roma across Europe commemorate their resistance against Nazi persecution and genocide, continuing their fight against antiziganism today. Holocaust survivor Mano HÃ¶llenreiner recounted how Sinti and Roma prisoners in Auschwitz armed themselves with smuggled tools and resisted transportation to the gas chambers in 1944. The prisoners' resistance led to the transfer of some to other camps, while those remaining, mostly women, children, elderly, and sick individuals, were eventually murdered. Historian Karola Fings notes the long-standing lack of research into this resistance, highlighting the solidarity displayed by those seeking survival in the face of horror.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Parliament is currently debating a bill to legalize assisted dying in England and Wales, marking a significant moment for potential societal change. The bill has undergone substantial revisions, including the removal of a High Court judge's requirement for each assisted death request, replaced by a panel of experts. MPs are considering amendments to ensure no obligation for medical staff to participate and to prevent doctors from discussing assisted death with under 18s unless initiated by the patient. Broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen has advocated for assisted dying, while opponents express concerns about the potential harm to vulnerable individuals and the role of religious beliefs in the debate.</p>

          <p>As of 12:01 a.m. Friday, NJ Transit rail engineers have gone on strike due to disagreements over pay raises, causing a complete shutdown of train service and inconveniencing over 300,000 daily commuters. NJ Transit is advising people to work from home and has implemented a contingency plan involving enhanced bus service, which can only accommodate about 20% of daily train riders. Commuters can also use Amtrak, PATH, SEPTA, light rail, or ferry services, with NJ Transit rail tickets and passes being cross-honored on its bus and light rail lines. New York City Emergency Management is coordinating with NJ Transit to mitigate the impact, including deploying staff to monitor traffic conditions and disruptions.</p>

The White House touted deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars for U.S. companies, including a large order from Qatar for Boeing passenger jets, although some agreements were already in progress.

          <p>The House Republican tax bill proposes a temporary $4,000 deduction for older adults, framed as a "bonus" aimed at helping retirees keep more money. This provision is an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits, a concept previously touted by President Trump. The deduction would be available to adults ages 65 and over from 2025 through 2028, phasing out for single filers with incomes over $75,000 and married couples filing jointly with incomes over $150,000. While this deduction would reduce the amount of income subject to taxes, it is not as generous as a tax credit.</p>

          <p>Michelle Goldberg reflects on the Democratic Party's initial insistence that Joe Biden was fit for reelection, arguing that many Democrats were deceiving themselves. She suggests the party now needs to grapple with its tendency toward groupthink, inertia, and risk aversion, rather than solely blaming Biden and his inner circle. Goldberg highlights a new book revealing Biden's decline was worse than publicly admitted and underscores that voters recognized the problem, questioning why party insiders could not.</p>

While Britain has reached an agreement with the Trump administration, many Asian countries face punitive duties and are trying to negotiate at a sensitive time in their own domestic politics.</p>

          <p>India's financial strength, political connections, and media influence have solidified its dominance in global cricket, raising concerns about the game's equity and diversity. The election of Jay Shah, son of India's Home Minister, as chairman of the International Cricket Council (ICC) has fueled worries about the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)'s control over global cricket. The BCCI's financial power, largely derived from the Indian Premier League (IPL), allows it to shape tournament schedules and ICC media rights, leading to criticisms of a monopolistic structure that threatens smaller cricketing nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's denouncements of "activist judges" for allegedly obstructing his agenda are not unprecedented, as criticism of the federal courts has occurred throughout U.S. history. The term "judicial activism," coined in 1947, has been used by presidents from both parties to accuse courts of exceeding their constitutional role. Trump's criticism marks a highly politicized phase, where judicial rulings are frequently contested and used as political fodder, leading to rare rebukes from Chief Justice John Roberts.</p>
