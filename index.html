          <p>A monsoonal weather pattern is bringing a continued threat of heavy rain and flash flooding to parts of the western and central United States this weekend. Eastern New Mexico and western Texas are under a Level 2 of 4 threat for excessive rainfall, with areas like Ruidoso, New Mexico, on alert for flooding near recent burn scars. Meanwhile, southern Florida is expected to see more hot and stormy conditions, though the heaviest rainfall has likely passed.

          <p>In the wake of Charlie Kirk's killing, the lack of a clear motive for the alleged shooter, Tyler Robinson, has fueled intense political debate across the United States. Utah's governor stated that investigators believe the suspect was indoctrinated with leftist ideology, a claim that has shaped conservative responses. The incident has highlighted the nation's deep political divisions, with figures like Donald Trump blaming "radicals on the left" while others call for unity. The conversation underscores the polarized environment in which the assassination occurred.</p>

          <p>It has been revealed that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's office explicitly questioned Lord Peter Mandelson about his links to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before appointing him as US ambassador. The questions were prompted by initial vetting that flagged the relationship, though Mandelson's answers were deemed sufficient at the time. His subsequent dismissal came after newly surfaced emails showed supportive messages he sent to Epstein after his 2008 conviction. The controversy has intensified scrutiny of the Prime Minister's judgment and the government's vetting procedures.</p>

          <p>A massive "Unite the Kingdom" rally in London, organized by activist Tommy Robinson, drew tens of thousands of demonstrators who honored the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk. During the event, Elon Musk appeared via video link, condemning the left as the "party of murder" following Kirk's assassination. The march was billed as a demonstration for free speech and in defense of British heritage, with many attendees carrying English flags and chanting for their country back. The rally highlights the international resonance of Kirk's death within right-wing movements.</p>

          <p>The United Nations General Assembly voted 142-10 to approve a nonbinding resolution supporting a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The measure endorses the "New York Declaration," which outlines a phased plan to end the nearly 80-year conflict and urges the creation of a Palestinian state. The resolution was co-sponsored by France and Saudi Arabia, but the United States and Israel were among the nations that voted against it, with their representatives calling the declaration a "gift to Hamas" that undermines diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is seeking to fine Boeing $3.1 million for numerous safety violations, including those related to the January door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 Max jet. The proposed penalty covers hundreds of quality system failures identified at Boeing and subcontractor Spirit AeroSystems' factories between late 2023 and early 2024. The FAA also found that a Boeing employee pressured an inspector to improperly sign off on an aircraft to meet delivery schedules, adding to concerns about the company's safety culture.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University.

          <p>A couple who left their New York City lives behind for two years shares the transformative experience of living as nomads in ten different cities. By selling 90% of their belongings and living out of suitcases, they learned to prioritize experiences over possessions, break out of monotonous routines, and live on a smaller budget. The adventure, which they undertook before getting married and starting a family, strengthened their relationship and deepened their sense of self. They found that embracing minimalism and constant change ultimately enriched their lives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Fulton County judge has dismissed the sweeping RICO conspiracy charges against 61 defendants involved in protests against Atlanta's "Cop City" police training center. The judge ruled that the Georgia Attorney General's office lacked the authority to bring the case after local district attorneys had declined to prosecute. The decision is a major blow to the state's two-year effort to use laws designed for organized crime to prosecute a protest movement. While the state plans to appeal, the ruling invalidates the core of the controversial indictment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid social media trends where some users report developing hyperpigmentation after using popular lip oils, a medical expert advises caution. Dr. Rebecca Small, a clinical professor, explains that the thin skin on lips is vulnerable to sun damage, which can be magnified by oils lacking SPF protection. She notes that irritants in some products, like plumping agents or fragrances, can cause inflammation leading to skin darkening. To use lip oils safely, she recommends choosing products with broad-spectrum SPF and avoiding common irritants like peppermint or citrus.</p>

          <p>The first deportation flights of migrants from the UK to France are expected to begin next week under a new 'one in, one out' pilot scheme. The deal, announced in July, allows the UK to return asylum seekers who cross the Channel in small boats, provided their claims are withdrawn or inadmissible. In exchange, the UK will accept an equal number of vetted asylum seekers directly from France. The policy is part of the Labour government's broader strategy to tackle the increasing number of small boat crossings.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has declared that the U.S. will only impose "major" sanctions on Russia if all other NATO nations agree to do the same and cease buying Russian oil. In a letter to his counterparts, Trump criticized some allies for their continued energy purchases from Moscow, stating it weakens their negotiating position. He also proposed that the alliance collectively impose 50% to 100% tariffs on China to further pressure an end to the war in Ukraine. The ultimatum places new conditions on U.S. action against Russia.</p>

          <p>The UCLA Bruins football team suffered a crushing 35-10 defeat to New Mexico, dropping their record to 0-3 and intensifying pressure on second-year coach DeShaun Foster. The team has struggled profoundly this season, plagued by a lack of discipline, a porous defense, and an inability to score, having not led at any point in any game. The loss has led to calls for Foster's dismissal and raises serious questions about the program's direction under athletic director Martin Jarmond. The Bruins are currently the only winless team in the Big Ten conference.</p>
