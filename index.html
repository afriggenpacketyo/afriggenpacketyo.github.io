          <h2>Former President Trump Proposes Additional 10% Tariff on Nations Aligned with BRICS Policies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 00:53:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump announced a proposal to levy an additional 10% tariff on any country that aligns with what he termed the "Anti-American policies of BRICS." This statement came as the BRICS nations met and issued a joint declaration criticizing unilateral protectionist measures and trade-distorting tariffs. The bloc, which recently expanded to include nations like Iran and Saudi Arabia, aims to increase the influence of Global South countries and challenge Western-dominated financial institutions. The Trump administration also confirmed it will begin sending letters detailing country-specific tariff rates, with new duties potentially taking effect on August 1 for partners without a U.S. trade agreement.

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in central Texas have resulted in at least 82 fatalities, with search and rescue operations ongoing for more than 40 missing people. A significant tragedy occurred at Camp Mystic, an all-girls Christian summer camp, where at least 10 campers and one counselor are still unaccounted for after the Guadalupe River rose dramatically. The camp's director was among those killed while attempting to save children. College football coach Wade Lytal has taken to social media to plead for prayers and help in finding his missing daughter, Kellyanne. The disaster has drawn a major response, with hundreds of first responders deployed and a federal disaster declaration signed for the hardest-hit areas.</p>

          <h2>DOJ and FBI Review Concludes No Jeffrey Epstein 'Client List' Exists and Confirms Suicide</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 00:47:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive review by the Justice Department and the FBI has concluded that there is no evidence of a so-called "client list" of Jeffrey Epstein's associates, and it reaffirmed the official finding that he died by suicide in 2019. According to a memo, investigators did not find evidence to support charges against any uncharged third parties, a conclusion likely to frustrate those who believed his high-profile connections would be implicated. The review, ordered under the Trump administration, sought to address widespread speculation and conspiracy theories about a government cover-up. Officials stated that perpetuating unfounded theories does not serve the primary goal of combatting child exploitation and bringing justice to victims.</p>

          <p>An Australian jury has found Erin Patterson guilty of murdering three of her estranged husband's relatives by serving them a meal containing poisonous death cap mushrooms. The 50-year-old was also convicted of the attempted murder of a fourth relative who survived the July 2023 lunch. Prosecutors argued Patterson intentionally poisoned the beef Wellington dish, while her defense claimed the mushrooms were included by accident and that she lied to investigators out of panic. The highly publicized trial involved over 50 witnesses and detailed the complex family dynamics and Patterson's actions following the deaths. She now faces a potential life sentence for the killings.</p>

          <p>Global markets are reacting with confusion after the Trump administration provided conflicting information regarding the deadline for new U.S. tariffs, suggesting an August 1 effective date rather than the expected July 9. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that letters are being sent to trading partners, warning that higher tariffs will be imposed if deals are not advanced. The lack of clarity, combined with former President Trump's threat of an additional 10% tariff on BRICS-aligned nations, has created significant uncertainty for investors. This ad-hoc approach to trade policy has led to modest declines in Asian stock indices and a slight dip in U.S. futures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly criticized Elon Musk's announcement of a new political party, the "America Party," calling the idea "ridiculous" and a source of "disruption and chaos." The move signals a major falling out between the two, who were previously allies, with Musk having led a government efficiency task force. Musk formed the party after clashing with Trump over a tax and spending bill he claimed would bankrupt the country. In a social media post, Trump stated he was saddened to see Musk go "completely 'off the rails,'" and highlighted their policy disagreements, particularly over the termination of electric vehicle tax credits.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina, but it continues to pose a significant threat of flash flooding across the Carolinas and into Virginia. The system is expected to bring 2 to 4 inches of rain, with localized amounts up to 6 inches, prompting flood watches for the region. In Chatham County, North Carolina, heavy rainfall caused a highway to collapse and flooded over 100 roads. While the storm's winds have weakened, authorities are warning residents about dangerous surf and rip currents along the Atlantic coast and urging caution on water-covered roadways as the system moves northeast.</p>

          <p>A global trend of declining birth rates is accelerating, with women worldwide now having fewer than half the children they did in the 1960s, creating significant future challenges for economies and social structures. Researchers attribute this shift to increased female economic independence and changing life priorities, leading many to delay or opt out of parenthood. In the U.S., the fertility rate has fallen to a record low of 1.6, well below the 2.1 needed for population stability. This demographic shift raises concerns about a shrinking workforce, the sustainability of social safety nets like Social Security, and could lead to depopulation in many developed nations this century.</p>

          <p>A housing crisis across Europe is fueling political disenfranchisement as soaring prices and rents make homeownership unattainable for many, a situation described by Barcelona's mayor as a "political timebomb." This article argues that the crisis is exacerbated by the increasing dominance of financial institutions like private equity firms, which have treated housing as a lucrative asset class, particularly since 2008. These institutional investors, driven by a duty to maximize profits, contribute to rising costs through practices like "renoviction" and by opposing measures that would increase housing supply. This shift has transferred power from residents to investors, deepening inequality and social despair across the continent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mexico secured its 10th Gold Cup title with a 2-1 victory over the United States in a heated final in Houston. The decisive goal came from a second-half header by Edson Álvarez, which was confirmed after a VAR review overturned an initial offside call. The win was contentious, as U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino was incensed by a non-call on a potential handball penalty against Mexico just minutes before their winning goal. The match, played before a largely pro-Mexico crowd, saw the U.S. take an early lead before Mexico equalized and eventually dominated possession and scoring chances to defend their 2023 title.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Elon Musk's vow to create a new political entity, the "America Party," confronts a complex and expensive web of state and federal laws designed to favor the two-party system. Election law experts note that establishing a nationally recognized third party is a daunting task, requiring navigation of 50 different sets of ballot access rules, which often involve collecting vast numbers of signatures and surviving legal challenges from Democrats and Republicans. While Musk's immense wealth could fund such an effort, it would be a multi-year project costing hundreds of millions. The move follows a public feud with former President Trump over federal spending and tax policies.</p>

          <p>Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), an al-Qaeda affiliate, has rapidly become one of Africa's most lethal jihadist organizations, escalating violence across the Sahel region, particularly in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. Formed in 2017, the group exploits local grievances and government instability to recruit fighters and impose a strict interpretation of Islamic law. In the first half of 2025 alone, JNIM claimed over 280 attacks in Burkina Faso, doubling its activity from the previous year. The group's expansion and increased operational tempo pose a severe threat to regional stability, overwhelming national armies and contributing to a series of military coups in the affected countries.</p>

          <p>The BRICS group of emerging economies is calling for the United Nations to take the lead in establishing global rules for artificial intelligence to ensure fair and inclusive governance. In a statement from their summit in Rio de Janeiro, leaders described AI as a "unique opportunity" but warned it could widen the digital divide without proper oversight. They stressed the need for technical standards developed with public sector and UN involvement to ensure trust, security, and interoperability. The bloc also proposed voluntary guidelines for responsible AI development, demanding equal access to AI technologies for all countries, especially those in the Global South.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, a long-standing Christian girls' camp in Texas, became the center of a national tragedy when a sudden, violent flood on the Guadalupe River swept through its grounds. The deluge, which saw the river rise 26 feet in about 45 minutes, destroyed low-lying cabins and killed campers and the camp's director, with others still missing. Survivors described horrific scenes of destruction and heroic efforts by counselors to save the children. The camp, operated by the same family for generations, was known as a cherished summer destination for girls from across Texas and the U.S. to build friendships and grow spiritually in a picturesque riverfront setting.</p>

          <p>A recent round of indirect ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, has concluded in Doha without a significant breakthrough. According to a Palestinian official, messages were exchanged but key gaps between the two sides remain unresolved, with talks expected to resume. Hamas is reportedly holding to its demands for a guaranteed end to hostilities and a full withdrawal of Israeli troops, conditions Israel has previously rejected. The talks occurred as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu prepared to meet with U.S. President Trump to discuss the war, and as Israeli military operations continued across Gaza, resulting in dozens of Palestinian casualties.</p>

          <p>Firefighters are making significant progress battling the Madre fire in San Luis Obispo County, California's largest wildfire so far this year, with containment reaching 30%. The blaze has burned over 80,000 acres since it began on Wednesday near New Cuyama. Improved weather conditions and an influx of nearly 1,400 personnel have bolstered efforts to control the fire, which threatens the Carrizo Plain National Monument and its endangered species. Evacuation orders remain in effect for over 200 people, and about 50 structures are still under threat, though officials are hopeful for continued progress before a potential midweek heatwave complicates the fight.</p>

          <p>The Washington Nationals have fired manager Dave Martinez and general manager Mike Rizzo following a sixth consecutive losing season since their 2019 World Series victory. The decision came after the team was swept by the Boston Red Sox, dropping their record to 37-53. Owner Mark Lerner cited the team's poor on-field performance as the reason for the change, stating a "fresh approach and new energy" is needed. Rizzo had been with the organization since 2009, building the roster that won the franchise's first championship, while Martinez managed the team for over six seasons. Senior VP Mike DeBartolo will take over as interim GM.</p>
