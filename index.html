SBI Shinsei Bank is now the only major domestic lender to fully repay government bailout funds received during that era. This move signifies a return to financial health and stability for the institution. The repayment symbolizes closure on a past financial crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several sexcam models have shared their experiences of being recruited into the industry while still in school, highlighting the exploitation and challenges faced by underage performers. Studios in Colombia often target teenage girls with promises of easy money, despite it being illegal to employ webcam models under 18. Models described being pressured into performing sexual acts they found degrading, with studios taking a significant portion of their earnings. Major webcam platforms claim to have checks to prevent underage performers, but these are often circumvented. The global sexcam industry continues to grow, raising concerns about the safety and well-being of its performers.</p>

          <p>IVF patients are being cautioned about unregulated "concierge clinics" after one such clinic went bust, leaving clients without treatment or refunds. These online companies act as middlemen between patients, donors, and doctors, but are not regulated by the fertility watchdog. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) is calling for stronger laws to protect patients. Several patients lost significant amounts of money and faced disruptions to their treatment plans when Apricity Fertility ceased operations. This situation highlights the risks associated with unregulated fertility services.</p>

The ABC initially argued her post breached its editorial policy, but after the ruling, apologized to Lattouf. The court awarded her damages of A$70,000, and further penalties may be considered.
