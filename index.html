          <p>Amber heat health alerts have been issued across England as temperatures are expected to exceed 30C, posing significant risks to health and social care services. The UK Health Security Agency warns of increased demand on services, difficulties managing medicines, workforce challenges, and potential rises in deaths, particularly among the elderly and those with health conditions. The rising temperatures are attributed to an area of high pressure drawing hot weather from Western Europe. Some locations in Lincolnshire and Suffolk have already met the heatwave threshold, with temperatures expected to remain high through Friday.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering military action against Iran's nuclear facility, specifically the Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant, according to a source familiar with the intelligence. The plan involves multiple strikes, and preparations are underway. Trump is also gauging the MAGA base's reaction through Vice President JD Vance and has been briefed on security at U.S. Army bases, which are vulnerable to Iranian retaliation. This consideration arises after Israel's discovery that some Iranian air defenses were not neutralized as initially believed, adding to the concern.</p>

          <p>Former Chinese central bank chief Zhou Xiaochuan warned that US dollar-backed stablecoins could accelerate the ‚Äúdollarisation‚Äù of the international monetary system. He expressed concerns that while other countries are considering their own local-currency stablecoins, only USD-backed stablecoins could have a worldwide influence. This comes as the US Senate passed stablecoin legislation establishing federal guardrails for US dollar-pegged stablecoins, creating a regulated pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars. Stablecoins aim to combine the efficiency of digital assets with the reliability of traditional money by pegging their value to fiat currencies.</p>

          <p>A judge has ruled that messages between Blake Lively and Taylor Swift are admissible in Justin Baldoni's legal battle with Lively, deeming them relevant to the case. Lively sued Baldoni and his studio, alleging sexual harassment on the set of 'It Ends With Us' and a campaign to damage her reputation, which he denies. Baldoni's lawyers had previously sought the messages directly from Swift but dropped the subpoenas after objections from her legal team. Lively's spokesperson stated that Baldoni is trying to exploit Swift's popularity and distract from the harassment allegations.</p>

Annually, Obama deported more people than Trump, logging over 3.1 million ICE deportations during his eight years, peaking in 2012 with over 407,000 removals. In contrast, the first Trump administration deported a maximum of 269,000 people in 2019, totaling fewer than 932,000 deportations across four years.

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed Tennessee's ban on transition-related healthcare for minors to remain in effect, a decision critics say undermines gender equality. The ruling, in United States v Skrmetti, permits facially sex-discriminatory statutes so long as they impose gendered limits on the conduct of people of both sexes. The court circumvented sex equality provisions, potentially weakening the 14th amendment's applicability to sex discrimination cases. Critics argue this sets a dangerous precedent, eroding protections for trans people and potentially impacting cis women and others not conforming to gender stereotypes.</p>

          <p>This article examines how President Trump's policies, particularly on immigration and travel, could negatively impact Los Angeles' hosting of the World Cup and Olympics. Despite his initial support, Trump's actions, including immigration raids and potential travel bans, threaten the inclusivity and global nature of these events. Concerns are growing that these policies could discourage foreign visitors and athletes, potentially undermining the economic benefits and international goodwill associated with hosting such events. Promoters of major sporting events always maintain that the games are ‚Äúnonpartisan‚Äù and nonpolitical.</p>
