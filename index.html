          <p>The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), responsible for the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, is preparing for deep staff reductions as its carry-over funding nears depletion during the ongoing government shutdown. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers warned that 80% of NNSA employees, roughly 1,400 individuals, face furlough, raising concerns about national security. While essential functions related to safety and property protection will continue with a smaller staff, the cuts highlight the critical impact of the shutdown on vital federal agencies. The article underscores the severity of the funding lapse, now among the longest in modern history.</p>

          <p>U.S. electricity companies are struggling to accurately forecast power demand from the artificial intelligence boom, as tech firms shop large data center projects to multiple utilities, creating uncertainty. Former FERC Chairman Willie Phillips noted regions have already readjusted huge projected increases downwards, raising concerns about potential overspending on infrastructure. While experts agree on a historic increase in electricity consumption, utilities need firm financial commitments to avoid billions in unnecessary investments. The article highlights the complex challenge of balancing speculative AI growth with grid reliability and rising consumer electricity prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK stock market experienced a sell-off, with major banks like Barclays and Standard Chartered seeing share price drops, following warnings of fraud and bad loans from two U.S. regional lenders, Western Alliance Bank and Zions Bank. This sparked broader fears about the health of the banking sector and private credit market, leading to a dip in the FTSE 100 index and declines in European and Asian markets. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon also cautioned about potential wider issues after recent failures in the private credit market. The article reflects global investor nervousness and a flight to safe havens like gold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Relatives in a Trinidadian fishing village are mourning two men believed killed in a U.S. airstrike on a boat allegedly transporting drugs, accusing President Trump of “killing poor people” without due process. Trump labeled the six killed as “narcoterrorists,” but families demand justice and question why the boat was destroyed instead of occupants being detained. The article highlights community betrayal by their own government and fear among fishers, who now avoid traditional routes. Activists warn of threats to Caribbean sovereignty amidst renewed U.S. militarization, condemning the “war on drugs” in the region.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for Luigi Mangione, accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are seeking dismissal of the indictment or removal of the death penalty, arguing the Trump administration is prejudicing his right to a fair trial. They claim President Trump's social media posts calling Mangione "a pure assassin," and subsequent Justice Department reposts, blur the line between the White House and prosecutorial independence. The defense expresses concern about tainting the jury pool, asserting that government actions are deliberately designed to harm Mangione's prospects, making this case unique among death penalty proceedings.</p>

          <p>A CNBC All-America Economic Survey reveals President Trump's net approval rating on the economy has dropped to a record low of -13, with 42% approving and 55% disapproving. This decline is attributed to Americans' increasingly negative views on the economy, jobs, inflation, and the ongoing government shutdown, for which 53% blame Republicans and the president.

          <p>A historic global agreement to reduce shipping emissions, which would have established the world's first internationally mandated targets for the industry, has been abandoned after Saudi Arabia and the U.S. successfully ended the talks.

This outcome, despite broad industry support for consistent global standards, reflects significant political pressure. The article notes the deal's delay means a carefully planned timeline for 2028 regulations is no longer feasible, raising concerns about rising global emissions.</p>
