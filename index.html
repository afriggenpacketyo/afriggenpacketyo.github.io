          <p>During a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem faced criticism from Democratic senators regarding the potential return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S. and DHS spending. Senator Chris Van Hollen questioned Noem on compliance with a Supreme Court decision to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return, while Noem asserted the government is following the law. Senator Chris Murphy accused Noem of fiscal mismanagement and violating asylum laws, while Noem countered that the Biden administration allowed millions into the country illegally. Noem also discussed plans for FEMA and CISA, facing Republican caution on dismantling FEMA and defending changes to CISA's mission.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Political scientists Steven Levitsky, Lucan Way, and Daniel Ziblatt argue that America has crossed the line into competitive authoritarianism, where opposition to the government comes with a price. They contend that the Trump administration has weaponized government agencies to punish critics, raising the cost of opposition for many Americans. The article cites examples such as investigations into political opponents, targeting of law firms perceived as unfriendly, and threats against universities and media outlets. The authors emphasize that while the situation is not as dire as in dictatorships, the trend is alarming and requires a collective defense of democracy from civil society.</p>

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts publicly defended the importance of an independent judiciary, emphasizing its role in checking the excesses of Congress or the executive branch. His remarks come amid criticism from President Trump and his allies, who have accused judges of overstepping their bounds, especially concerning rulings against the President's agenda. Roberts also reiterated his previous stance against calls for impeachment of judges due to disagreements with their decisions, asserting that impeachment is not the appropriate response and the normal appellate review process should be followed.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to allow it to terminate humanitarian parole for over 500,000 migrants from Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Venezuela. This request follows a lower court's decision to halt Secretary Noem's attempt to end the program, arguing that individualized decisions are necessary rather than a blanket termination.

          <p>An autopsy of Mikal Mahdi, a South Carolina man executed by firing squad, indicates that the shooters largely missed his heart, causing him to suffer for an extended period before dying. The autopsy revealed two wounds on his chest instead of three, and none of the bullets directly hit his heart, contradicting the state's protocol. Lawyers for Mahdi argue that the execution was "botched" and caused him excruciating pain, violating the constitutional ban on cruel or unusual punishment.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners considering a HELOC this May should be aware of potential minimum draw requirements that could impact the cost-effectiveness of this borrowing option. Lenders may require an upfront draw, ongoing minimum usage during the draw period, or both, potentially leading to unnecessary interest charges. These rules can complicate repayment strategies, especially with variable-rate HELOCs, and borrowers should carefully review the fine print to ensure the terms align with their borrowing needs. Alternatives like home equity loans or waiting until ready to draw more funds may be worth considering.</p>

          <p>Economists have shifted back their forecasts for lower borrowing costs as President Trumpâ€™s tariffs raised the risk of higher inflation and slower growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank is waiting to see how Trump's policies will affect the economy before making any moves on interest rates. The Fed may be on hold for longer than expected, and economists are increasingly coalescing around September as the most plausible time for the Fed to restart interest rate cuts. The possibility of a larger-than-usual rate cut is also on the table.</p>

          <p>Stocks surged following President Trump's announcement of a trade deal with the United Kingdom, driven by optimism about reduced trade barriers. Boeing shares rose due to the UK's agreement to buy airplane parts, confirming a thesis that its planes could reduce trade deficits. Goldman Sachs also saw strong gains, with investors betting that more trade deals are on the way, potentially boosting dealmaking activity. Goldman's president noted strong demand for capital markets transactions with a more certain economic backdrop.</p>

          <p>After Liam Payne's death with a $32 million estate and no will, a British court granted administrative responsibilities to his ex-girlfriend, Cheryl Tweedy, and a music industry lawyer. They are tasked with preserving the estate until a general grant is made by the court, but have limited authority over the estate. Payne, a One Direction singer, died after ingesting various intoxicants in Argentina. Police found drug paraphernalia in his hotel room, and an autopsy showed designer drugs in his bloodstream.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a deal over tariffs on some goods traded between the countries. President Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports from countries around the world remains in place and still applies to most UK goods entering the US, but the deal has reduced or removed tariffs on some of the UK's exports, including cars, steel and aluminium. Car tariffs have been cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, and a 25% tariff on steel and aluminium imports into the US has been scrapped. What will be agreed on pharmaceuticals is still unknown.</p>

Mahdawi, who led protests against Israel's war in Gaza, was released from custody after a judge ruled he raised a "substantial claim" that the government arrested him to stifle speech.

          <p>The Milken Institute Global Conference saw a mix of emotions among financial titans, ranging from anxiety amid volatile markets and trade tensions to growing optimism after a rocky start to President Trumpâ€™s second term. While some expressed nervousness, others highlighted technology, cost-cutting, and the direction of the economy as reasons for optimism. However, uncertainty remains, with some suggesting fund managers are painting a rosier outlook and noting the potential for increased investment in Europe due to the uncertain future in the U.S. The role of the dollar as the worldâ€™s reserve currency was also a concern.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the broad terms of a trade deal with Britain, potentially easing the burden of his sweeping tariffs. The deal keeps the 10% tariff on U.K. imports but lowers tariffs on British autos. In exchange, the U.K. will ease trade barriers on U.S. agricultural products, like beef and ethanol, and fast-track U.S. imports through U.K. customs. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the framework will boost trade, protect jobs, and open market access, but also acknowledged the need for further negotiations.</p>
