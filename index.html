          <p>David Kaczynski, who turned his brother Ted Kaczynski (the Unabomber) in to the FBI, has formed a deep friendship with Gary Wright, a man severely injured by one of his brother's bombs. The article explores David's initial guilt and his wife's suggestion to connect with the victims as a path toward healing. While most victims did not engage, Wright responded, and the two found common ground in their respective journeys of recovery and forgiveness. Their unlikely bond, developed over years of joint public appearances, serves as a powerful example of reconciliation emerging from profound violence and tragedy.</p>

          <p>A CNBC investigation details the alarming trend of 'nudify' apps and websites that use AI to create nonconsensual, explicit deepfakes of individuals from ordinary photos. The report focuses on a group of women in Minnesota who discovered a friend had used their social media images to generate such content, causing significant emotional trauma. Despite the harm, the man broke no existing laws, highlighting a major legal gap that lawmakers are now trying to address. Experts warn that these services are easily accessible and that the psychological damage to victims is profound, comparable to that of revenge porn.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi argues that certain mindsets, rather than a lack of skill or ambition, often prevent people from increasing their income. The first limiting belief is feeling ashamed for not already knowing how to make more money, which prevents individuals from seeking necessary help or education. The second is the false expectation that success should come easily if one is talented, ignoring the need for patience and systematic effort. Finally, the habit of procrastination, or telling oneself they will start 'later,' allows years to pass without taking meaningful action. Sethi emphasizes that overcoming these mental blocks is the crucial first step toward achieving financial goals.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has committed to starting the construction of three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its strategy to boost economic growth and address the housing crisis. Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced the plan, identifying Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites. This initiative is central to Labour's ambitious goal of building 1.5 million new homes by 2029, emulating the post-war government's new town developments. However, the plan faces challenges, including industry cost pressures and criticism from some local communities who feel uninformed about the project's scale.</p>

          <p>The comedian hired as the Ryder Cup's master of ceremonies, Heather McMahan, has stepped down and apologized after being recorded leading the crowd in a profane chant targeting golfer Rory McIlroy. The incident occurred on the first tee Saturday morning, contributing to what was described as a toxic and ugly atmosphere at the Bethpage event. McIlroy was repeatedly subjected to personal abuse from spectators throughout the day, prompting the PGA of America to bring in state police for his group.

          <h2>Experts Question Social Media Trend Claiming Magnesium Lotion on Feet Improves Sleep</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A popular TikTok trend suggests that applying magnesium lotion to the bottoms of one's feet at bedtime can improve sleep quality and balance hormone levels, but medical experts remain skeptical. Dermatologists and sleep psychologists interviewed by Fox News state there is limited scientific evidence to support the claim that magnesium can be effectively absorbed through the skin, especially the thick skin on the feet, to produce systemic effects. Experts suggest that any perceived benefits are more likely due to the relaxing ritual of a nightly foot massage rather than the magnesium itself. They recommend focusing on evidence-based sleep hygiene practices for more reliable results.</p>

          <p>A new proposal to redraw California's congressional map, aimed at creating five new Democratic seats, has placed Republican representative and Trump ally Doug LaMalfa in a precarious position. The plan, which voters will decide on in a special election, is a direct response to Republican gerrymandering in other states and could significantly alter the political landscape of LaMalfa's conservative northern California district. The potential redistricting has energized both Democrats, who see it as a chance to counter Trump's agenda, and Republicans, who view it as a partisan power grab that unfairly merges rural and urban interests. The outcome could have major implications for control of the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats are refusing to support legislation to fund the government unless Republicans agree to reverse cuts to Medicaid and extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA). With government funding set to expire, this ultimatum creates a high-stakes standoff that could lead to a federal shutdown. Democrats believe they have leverage by focusing on healthcare, a potent issue with voters, especially as millions face losing insurance or seeing costs rise due to recent Republican-led legislation.

This progress is attributed to an accumulation of small but significant improvements, including the widespread adoption of working smoke alarms and automatic sprinklers.

          <p>A sustained Russian aerial assault lasting over 12 hours struck seven regions across Ukraine, resulting in at least four deaths in Kyiv and more than 70 injuries nationwide. The barrage involved nearly 600 drones and dozens of missiles, making it one of the heaviest attacks in recent months and causing extensive damage to civilian infrastructure, including a cardiology institute and residential buildings. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack as "vile," vowing retaliation and highlighting that it occurred as the UN General Assembly concluded. The attack also prompted neighboring Poland to scramble its fighter jets as a preventative measure.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is actively pursuing deals with U.S. mining companies to secure a domestic supply chain for critical minerals and reduce reliance on China. Following a Pentagon decision to take an equity stake and provide a price floor for rare earth miner MP Materials, industry leaders are anticipating similar government support for other companies. Miners of rare earths, lithium, and other strategic minerals are seen as potential targets for federal investment to stabilize volatile prices and encourage domestic production. This shift toward strategic capitalism signals the administration's willingness to intervene in the market to counter China's dominance in the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is expecting its eight-day "golden week" holiday, which begins this week, to generate approximately 2.4 billion journeys, providing a significant stimulus to its consumer economy. This major travel period, combining National Day and the Mid-Autumn Festival, is a critical time for domestic tourism and spending. According to the transport ministry, the vast majority of these trips, around 1.87 billion, will be made by car, reflecting a preference for personal vehicle travel. The first day of the holiday is projected to be the busiest, with an estimated 340 million journeys expected, surpassing travel numbers from this year's Lunar New Year.</p>

          <p>A senior Member of Parliament has suggested that Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and its supply chain may require further government assistance beyond the recently announced £1.5 billion loan guarantee. The support comes as the automaker's UK production has been halted for nearly a month due to a major cyber-attack, putting immense financial pressure on its network of suppliers. Liam Byrne, chair of the Commons Business and Trade Select Committee, warned that without a concerted effort to bolster cybersecurity, such disruptive attacks will become more common. Concerns remain that the loan may not be sufficient to prevent the collapse of smaller firms within the vast supply chain.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that jury nullification, a historic legal mechanism, may become a necessary tool for ordinary citizens to resist the Trump administration's alleged use of the Justice Department for political persecution. Jury nullification occurs when a jury acquits a defendant they believe to be guilty of violating a law they consider unjust or unjustly applied. The author suggests that as the administration targets political opponents with what are described as pretextual prosecutions, jurors have the right and power to refuse to convict. This act serves as a final check on executive power and a way to protect the rule of law from being corrupted for political ends.</p>

          <p>A Texas teenager, Benjamin Elliott, is on trial for the murder of his twin sister, Meghan, whom he fatally stabbed in her sleep in 2021. Immediately after the incident, Elliott called 911, claiming he had just woken from what he thought was a dream and realized what he had done. His defense argues that he was sleepwalking, a condition with a history in his family, and therefore did not have criminal intent. A sleep disorder expert who studied Elliott supports this claim, but prosecutors remain skeptical, pointing to the nature of the wounds and other details from the night of the killing, leaving a jury to decide the mysterious case.</p>

While these policies have earned praise from the IMF and financial markets, critics highlight their severe human impact, including a rise in unemployment and poverty.

The author argues that the administration has broken the 'social contract'—the idea that government requires the consent of the governed and must operate within limits—by defying court orders, attacking the judiciary, and revoking legal statuses arbitrarily. The article highlights the Supreme Court's role in enabling this crisis by frequently siding with the executive branch and weakening judicial checks on its power, contrasting this with Brazil's recent conviction of its former president for similar anti-democratic actions.</p>

Tool marks indicate it was crafted with iron tools, placing its creation in the historical period after European contact.

          <p>Food pantries in Maine are struggling to meet increasing demand due to a combination of federal funding cuts, diminishing food supplies, and a critical shortage of volunteers. The state's hunger relief network relies heavily on an aging volunteer workforce, many of whom are retirees, making it difficult to perform the physical labor required. The Trump administration's cuts to USDA food assistance programs have reduced the amount of free food available, while anticipated cuts to SNAP benefits are expected to drive more people to seek help. This strain is forcing some pantries to consider turning away people from outside their immediate area, challenging the long-standing mission of providing food for all.</p>
