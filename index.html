        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a 5% increase following President Trump's indication that tariffs on China would not be as high as initially anticipated, coupled with Elon Musk's announcement that he would dedicate more time to Tesla. This surge occurred despite the company's first-quarter results revealing a 20% year-over-year decline in automotive revenue and a 71% drop in net income, falling short of analysts' expectations. Musk stated he would reduce his involvement with The Department of Government Efficiency to concentrate on Tesla, a move welcomed by investors. Trump also signaled confidence in Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, further contributing to positive market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg confirmed that China has stopped accepting deliveries of Boeing aircraft due to ongoing trade disputes and tariffs imposed by the US. Some 737 Max planes intended for Chinese airlines have been returned to the US, and Boeing is considering redirecting future deliveries to other customers. Ortberg emphasized that the company is actively managing the situation to minimize disruption and maintain its recovery, citing strong demand for the 737 Max from other airlines. Despite the challenges, Boeing reported a narrower-than-expected loss for the first quarter, with airplane deliveries increasing significantly. Optimism remains for Boeing's ability to navigate the trade war's impact.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has accused the Trump administration of acting in 'bad faith' in the case of Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadorian man who was deported despite a court order against it. The judge demanded that the administration provide specific details to support its claims of privilege, stating that they were obstructing the legal process. This development is part of a larger trend of courts pushing back against the Trump administration's efforts to defy judicial orders regarding deportations. Other judges have extended temporary blocks on deportations and questioned the administration's use of an 18th-century law to expedite removals.</p>

          <p>Several corporations have announced plans to expand their manufacturing operations in the United States since the start of President Trump's second term, coinciding with the implementation of new tariffs. While not all companies explicitly cite tariffs as the primary reason, the White House has promoted these moves as supporting domestic job creation. Companies like Johnson & Johnson, Apple, and Chobani are committing billions of dollars to expand U.S. facilities. However, some trade experts remain skeptical that tariffs alone are sufficient to drive such strategic shifts, noting that factors like labor costs and regulatory environments also play a significant role.</p>

The article criticizes proposals such as 'baby bonuses' and limiting Fulbright grants to scholars with children, while neglecting measures to address paid family leave, affordable childcare, and maternal mortality rates. It contends that the movement seeks to restrict women's prospects to childbearing and housekeeping, undermining their personal liberty and professional opportunities.</p>

          <p>A deadly attack in India-administered Kashmir, which left at least 26 tourists dead, poses a significant security dilemma for India and undermines the government's narrative of stability in the region. The attack, claimed by The Resistance Front (TRF), targeted a popular tourist location and raises concerns about tourist safety, particularly with the upcoming Amarnath Yatra pilgrimage. Analysts suggest the attack is intended to destabilize India's Kashmir narrative and signal Pakistan's continued influence over Kashmir militancy. The Indian government faces pressure to strengthen security without escalating conflict with Pakistan.</p>

          <p>Refugees from Myanmar residing in camps along the Thai-Myanmar border are facing severe cuts to their food allowances due to a foreign aid shortfall, rising demand, and inflation. Charities are being forced to drastically reduce food support to over 80% of the 100,000-plus refugees, many of whom rely on this aid for survival. The cutbacks stem from reduced funding from the US State Department, combined with rising refugee numbers and economic factors. The refugees, largely barred from working outside the camps, are facing increased food insecurity and potential malnutrition.</p>

          <p>South Korea is deeply divided ahead of the June election to replace the impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, with little sign of unity among its citizens. The nation is split along ideological lines, exacerbated by the recent declaration of martial law, with vocal protests from both conservative and liberal factions. Economic fears, concerns over North Korea, and generational divides are further contributing to the polarization. The increasing reliance on social media for news consumption is also intensifying the political divide, with echo chambers and extreme speech becoming prevalent.</p>
