          <p>Senator Maria Cantwell addressed concerns about trade policies and their impact on consumers and the economy during an interview on "Face the Nation." She highlighted the bipartisan support for her efforts to regain control over trade and emphasized the anxiety among consumers and retailers regarding rising costs and inflation. Cantwell also criticized the administration's trade war, citing the damage caused by previous tariffs on Washington state's agricultural exports and the potential for further economic devastation. She advocated for innovation and investment in American manufacturing to outpace competition rather than relying on tariffs that increase costs for consumers. (not investment advice)

          <p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended President Trump's tariffs, claiming they won't increase costs for American consumers because other countries will bear much of the tariff burden. He stated that over 50 countries have reached out to negotiate. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers countered, arguing tariffs will increase inflation and decrease consumer spending power, potentially costing companies trillions. Hassett denied the market crash was a strategy to pressure the Fed to lower interest rates and stated Russia was excluded from tariffs due to ongoing negotiations regarding Ukraine.

          <p>The United States is revoking all visas for South Sudanese passport holders due to South Sudan's failure to comply with US efforts to repatriate its citizens. The Department of State cited South Sudan's "taking advantage of the United States" as the reason for the action. The move affects all visa appointments and existing visas, preventing South Sudanese citizens from entering the US until the matter is resolved. The decision underscores the Trump administration's strict stance on immigration and repatriation.

          <p>An op-ed argues that President Trump's new tariff regime, triggered by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, faces significant implementation challenges. The policy goals, which include correcting global imbalances and restoring manufacturing, surpass the current federal government's capacity to effectively and timely implement the tariffs. The author highlights concerns about understaffing, underfunding, and a lack of interagency coordination, potentially leading to bureaucratic bottlenecks and economic distortions. The op-ed also criticizes the lack of a formal rulemaking process and congressional oversight.

          <p>Top Trump administration officials claim that over 50 nations have reached out to the White House to begin trade talks following the implementation of sweeping new tariffs. The officials portray the tariffs as a strategic repositioning of the US in the global trade order, downplaying the economic fallout from the market turmoil. However, analysts and investors attribute the stock market drop to the tariffs, citing concerns about inflation and economic growth. The logistics of holding simultaneous negotiations with so many countries remain unclear. (not investment advice)

          <p>Vietnam has formally requested that the Trump administration delay the implementation of sky-high tariffs while the two sides negotiate. Vietnamese Communist Party chief To Lam was among the first world leaders to speak with Trump after the tariff announcement. The request is a test of how much President Trump is willing to haggle over his protectionist trade agenda. Vietnam's economy has boomed in recent years on the back of soaring manufacturing and exports.
