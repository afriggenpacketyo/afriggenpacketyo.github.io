          <p>Kumamoto Prefecture in Japan has started a bus tour of ten bronze statues of "One Piece" characters to boost tourism and recovery following the 2016 earthquakes. The statues, created by Kumamoto native Eiichiro Oda, are located across nine municipalities, serving as reminders of the disaster and symbols of reconstruction progress. The tour, initially for domestic tourists, may include translation services for international visitors due to the series' global popularity. The tour costs 28,000 yen per person and includes visits to a quake memorial museum and a damaged local railway.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan indicates that nearly 30% of couples in common-law relationships avoid legal marriage due to the requirement to adopt a single surname. The rate is higher among those in their 20s, with over 60% stating they would marry if separate surnames were permitted. Japan is reportedly the only country mandating a shared surname upon marriage, a law opposed by some who fear it impacts traditional family values. The survey estimates that over a million people in Japan are in common-law relationships, with many desiring legal marriage if surname laws were more flexible.</p>

Despite Burns' conviction, the Salarnos have attended numerous parole hearings to keep him incarcerated, driven by their belief that he remains a danger.

          <p>Katy Perry has faced criticism after her Blue Origin spaceflight and subsequent world tour, with many labeling her dance moves as "cringe." Critics argue that Perry's pop star persona, once celebrated, now feels out of touch and that her attempts at reinvention have been unsuccessful. Her comeback single, Woman's World, received a lukewarm reception, and her association with producer Dr. Luke has drawn criticism. Some observers suggest that Perry's recent actions and messages clash with current pop culture trends, contributing to the negative response.</p>
