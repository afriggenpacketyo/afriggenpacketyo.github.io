          <p>As the stock market experienced a significant downturn due to President Trump's tariffs, Democrats have criticized him for spending the weekend golfing instead of addressing the economic concerns. Prominent figures like Senator Adam Schiff and Representative Eric Swalwell voiced their disapproval, highlighting the perceived disconnect between Trump's activities and the financial anxieties of Americans. Trump, however, encouraged people to "HANG TOUGH" in a post on his Truth Social platform. He also claimed to have won his club championship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has vowed to sign a trade deal with the US only if it is in the UK's "national interest," amid concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The UK is hoping to sign an agreement to limit the impact on the UK, which has been hit with a 10% import duty, with a 25% tariff on British cars. Starmer emphasized that he would not pursue a trade deal at any price. The government says it wants to overturn US tariffs as part of a wider "economic deal" with the Trump administration.</p>
