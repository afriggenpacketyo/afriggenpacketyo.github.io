            <p>Over 100 civilians, including children and aid workers, have been killed in attacks on the city of el Fasher and two nearby camps in Sudan's Darfur region. The UN and aid organizations have condemned the assaults, blaming the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) for the violence. The attacks have targeted health infrastructure, preventing access to healthcare for internally displaced people, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. The ongoing war between the RSF and the army has created the world's largest humanitarian crisis, forcing over 12 million people from their homes and pushing communities into hunger.</p>

            <p>Sarah Palin's defamation case against The New York Times is undergoing a retrial after a judge's misstep in the initial 2022 suit. The case stems from a 2017 Times editorial that Palin's attorneys argue accused her of inciting murder in a 2011 shooting in Tucson, Arizona. The retrial comes amid a shifting media landscape where defamation cases are becoming more common, and the outcome could impact protections for the press under the First Amendment. Palin is not seeking to recover loss of income, jobs, or other paid opportunities.</p>

            <p>Comedian Stewart Lee reflects on how Sam Peckinpah's film 'Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid' resonates in the current political climate, particularly with Donald Trump's influence. Lee draws parallels between the film's themes of American freedoms under attack from big business and the transactional nature of modern politics. He suggests that standing up to avaricious authoritarians, like Billy the Kid, leads to negative consequences, while those who bend to tyranny, like Pat Garrett, survive and prosper. Lee's stand-up show, initially deemed pessimistic, now seems prescient in the face of contemporary events.</p>

            <p>Legal experts are debating whether the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act could make it harder for married women to vote, particularly those who have changed their last names. The act requires proof of U.S. citizenship for voter registration, but birth certificates may not match current names for women who have taken their spouse's name. Some argue the bill could disenfranchise millions, while supporters claim states can determine additional acceptable documents. Experts worry about uneven policies across states and the potential for disenfranchisement.</p>

            <p>Gaza is described as a 'killing field' by the UN Secretary General, with Palestinians facing annihilation through bombings, disease, and starvation. Israel's aid blockade and destruction of agricultural land have exacerbated the humanitarian crisis, with water also being used as a weapon of war. There are accusations of genocide and incitement to violence by Israeli politicians, while attempts to suppress free speech on Palestine have turned the issue into a domestic one. The author expresses frustration with the lack of international concern and calls for continued vocal opposition to the situation.</p>

            <p>President Trump's attacks on law firms representing causes at odds with his administration are causing a chilling effect on pro bono work. Civil rights organizations report that some firms are declining to take on politically sensitive cases due to concerns about political ramifications. This curtailment of pro bono assistance could lead to fewer challenges to potentially unconstitutional government actions, impacting equal justice under the law. Some law firms are fighting back against Trump's actions, but the overall climate is one of fear and uncertainty.</p>

            <p>Chinese scientists have developed an innovative solution to combat toxic oil spills by transforming moss into an oil-absorbing material. This material repels water and offers a cheap, efficient, and environmentally friendly method for cleaning up oil spills. The oil absorbent, developed by researchers from Guizhou Education University, was made by treating sphagnum moss with chemicals to alter its properties, resulting in an oil absorption capacity that outperformed conventional bio-based absorbents.</p>

            <p>President Trump's rapidly changing tariff policies are causing panic buying and paralysis among US consumers and businesses. The tariffs, including a 10% tax on most imports and a 145% duty on goods from China, are expected to lead to higher prices and potential shortages. Some consumers are stocking up on goods, while others are delaying purchases due to uncertainty. Economists predict that the tariffs could lead to a recession and higher unemployment rates.</p>

            <p>A new era of grim austerity is emerging in the workplace, with hypersurveillance and inflexible practices becoming fashionable again. The Trump administration's Doge department is reportedly using AI to monitor federal employees' emails for anti-Trump sentiment. Despite this, Gen Z workers are prioritizing work-life balance and seeking companies with secure contracts and ample benefits, rejecting roles that demand long hours and churn. There is serious generational friction, but it’s hard to picture an outcome in which this gentler vision of work is the side that succeeds.</p>

            <p>PGA Tour Enterprises is considering an offer to take part ownership of the United States element of the Ryder Cup, a move that would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. This comes amid ongoing uncertainty regarding a unification deal between the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF). The potential purchase of real estate is also being explored as an option for using the $1.5 billion investment from the Strategic Sports Group (SSG). The unification of golf looks no closer.</p>

            <p>Scientists from King's College London have successfully grown a human tooth under laboratory conditions, marking a significant breakthrough in regenerative dentistry. The team has introduced a special material that enables cells to communicate, mimicking the environment of growing teeth. While it may take years before this technology is available for patients, lab-grown teeth offer a more durable and biologically compatible solution than fillings or implants. The scientists are exploring different methods to transplant the lab-grown teeth into a patient's mouth.</p>

            <p>The article questions Britain's desire to maintain a close relationship with Donald Trump following the imposition of tariffs on British goods. It highlights the economic consequences of Trump's policies and suggests that Britain should instead strengthen its ties with the European Union. The author criticizes the government's adherence to self-imposed red lines that prevent rejoining the customs union and single market. The article argues that Britain's economic interests require a shift away from Trump and closer alignment with the EU.</p>
