          <p>A 76-year-old man named Jon Ruben has been arrested and charged with child cruelty in England. He is accused of giving candy laced with a sedative to boys at a summer camp, causing eight children and one adult to be hospitalized as a precaution. The incident occurred at Stathern Lodge, a facility owned by a Christian charity, which has stressed it is not connected to the individuals who hire the venue. Ruben has been detained until his next court hearing and has not yet entered a plea.</p>

          <p>Marc Maron's latest HBO Max special, "Panicked," is analyzed as the culmination of a trilogy of stand-up performances dealing with personal and societal anxieties. The article highlights Maron's consistent comedic style, which blends cantankerous observations with deep, recursive self-reflection on topics ranging from aging to potential childhood sexual abuse. Rather than seeking simple entertainment, Maron uses comedy as a vehicle to process a world in decline, maintaining his authentic voice. The special showcases a comedian who has remained true to his introspective, often dark, style throughout his career.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in Miami has ordered Tesla to pay over $240 million in damages, finding the company partially responsible for a 2019 crash that killed one person and injured another.

The verdict is significant as many similar cases are settled out of court, and it could encourage more lawsuits against the company. Tesla stated the verdict is "wrong" and plans to appeal the decision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average monthly cost for nursing home care in Germany has climbed to over €3,200, a sum that far exceeds the average pension and creates significant financial strain for many elderly citizens. Experts attribute the sharp increase to rising wages for care workers and new staffing requirements, which have outpaced the support provided by the country's long-term care insurance. With Germany's population aging, the system is facing potential collapse, prompting calls for urgent reforms, such as increasing taxes or expanding contribution requirements to sustain care for the elderly.

This finding contradicts the narrative that Obama-era officials manufactured intelligence about Russian interference in the 2016 election. The revelation adds to a body of evidence, including the Mueller report, that affirmed the intelligence community's assessment of Russian meddling.</p>

Circuit Court ruled that while the administration can deny access to the discretionary asylum system, it cannot ignore U.S. laws that mandate protection for migrants facing persecution or torture if deported. This decision partially upholds a lower court ruling that found the president's proclamation closing the asylum system defied federal law.

The decision stems from a lawsuit over raids conducted by the Trump administration that sparked protests and fear within the region's Latino community.

          <p>The European Union is considering punitive measures against Israel due to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, but the plan is stalled by deep divisions among its 27 member states. For the first time, the European Commission has proposed concrete actions, such as barring Israeli startups from EU research funds, citing violations of human rights. However, countries like Germany and Hungary have been hesitant to support such measures, while others like Spain and Ireland are pushing for a stronger response. This internal split highlights the EU's ongoing struggle to form a united policy toward Israel amid the conflict.</p>

          <p>A SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule has safely delivered a new international crew of four to the International Space Station. The Crew-11 mission includes two NASA astronauts, a Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut, who will begin a long-duration stay aboard the orbiting laboratory. Their arrival will allow the four members of the previous Crew-10 to return to Earth next week. The mission comes as NASA considers extending crew stays from six to eight months as a potential cost-saving measure, a change the new crew members have said they would welcome as a gift.</p>

          <p>Counter-terrorism police have made a seventh arrest in the investigation into a break-in at RAF Brize Norton, where activists damaged two military aircraft. The incident, for which the recently proscribed group Palestine Action claimed responsibility, caused an estimated £7 million in damages. The latest arrest is of a 22-year-old man on suspicion of terrorism-related offenses. Four other individuals have already been charged and remanded in custody in connection with the June break-in, which prompted a security review of all UK military bases and led to the government banning Palestine Action as a terrorist organization.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has taken a position in Equinix, a leading data center operator, following a stock drop caused by investor concern over increased capital expenditures. The article suggests that Elliott, with its deep experience in the data center sector, sees the spending as a necessary response to rising demand from AI and hyperscalers, promising long-term returns. Elliott could help Equinix by improving its market communication, optimizing its cost structure, and executing its growth strategy more effectively. This engagement could be amicable, potentially leading to a board seat for the activist investor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Democrats must persistently connect Donald Trump to the Jeffrey Epstein scandal to expose him as a protector of corrupt elites. The author suggests framing the issue not just as a lurid scandal, but as a clear example of a two-tiered justice system where the powerful shield each other from accountability. The recommended message is simple and repetitive: Trump protects his wealthy friends at the expense of ordinary Americans. By linking the Epstein affair to broader issues, Democrats can create a powerful narrative that resonates with voters' existing feelings of being abandoned.</p>

          <p>An investigation by The Guardian has identified Johnathan "Chris" Booth as the creator of a rapidly growing, openly neo-Nazi YouTube channel. The channel, which gained over 50,000 subscribers in two months, featured antisemitic and racist content and appeared to be monetized through YouTube's ad program before being terminated following the inquiry. Booth, who is married to a local Republican official in Michigan, used the platform to promote "national socialist" ideology. The report highlights concerns about extremism on major platforms and how such creators can build a following and generate revenue from hate speech.</p>

          <p>Indigenous leaders are condemning Donald Trump's proposal to reopen Alcatraz as a prison, calling it an affront that erases the island's vital history as a site of Native American resistance. After the federal prison closed in 1963, Indigenous activists occupied the island for 19 months, a pivotal event that spurred major positive shifts in federal policy toward Native sovereignty. Critics argue that reopening the prison not only ignores this legacy but also retraumatizes communities by echoing past injustices. They contend the focus should be on honoring this history, not building a new monument to incarceration.</p>

          <p>With Southwest Airlines introducing assigned seating, the question of whether to pay for an early boarding upgrade becomes more relevant for all travelers. According to travel experts, the primary reason to purchase this perk is to guarantee space for a carry-on suitcase in the overhead bins, which often fill up quickly. Travelers can gain priority boarding by paying for an add-on, holding an airline's co-branded credit card, or booking a premium fare. For those traveling light or willing to risk having to gate-check their bag, the extra cost may not be necessary.</p>

          <p>The article explains the complex neobladder reconstruction surgery that football coach Deion Sanders recently had for bladder cancer. The procedure involves removing the patient's bladder and constructing a new one from a segment of their own small intestine. Surgeons describe how they reshape the intestinal tissue into a sphere and connect it to the kidneys and urethra. While the body adapts well and doesn't reject the tissue, patients must retrain themselves to use the new bladder, which lacks the nerves to signal when it's full. Sanders' public discussion of the challenges is praised for reducing stigma.</p>

          <p>Russia has had a muted official response to President Trump's announcement that he ordered nuclear submarines to move closer to Russia, a move he said was triggered by a social media spat with former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Russian media outlets have been largely dismissive, with commentators calling the move a "temper tantrum." The article notes that the Kremlin has not issued a statement or announced any reciprocal military movements. This lack of reaction suggests Moscow may not be taking the threat seriously, viewing it as part of Trump's unpredictable political style rather than a genuine military escalation.</p>

          <p>In an interview, philosopher Mark C. Taylor argues that humanity's survival depends on overcoming the illusion of the isolated, individual self. He contends that the modern, anthropocentric worldview, which separates human consciousness from nature, has led to catastrophic climate change. The solution, he suggests, lies in recognizing our profound interconnectedness within a web of life and information, viewing ourselves not as masters of nature but as integral parts of it. This relational understanding is essential for addressing the existential threats we face from technology and environmental collapse.</p>
