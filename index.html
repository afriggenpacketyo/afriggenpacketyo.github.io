          <h2>Experts Dispute Trump's Tariff Calculation Method</h2>

          <p>President Trump's recently announced tariffs, which he described as 'reciprocal,' have been met with skepticism from economic experts who say the calculations used by the administration are misleading. Trump claimed the tariffs were based on the 'combined rate of all their tariffs, non-monetary barriers and other forms of cheating,' but economists have found that the numbers were determined by dividing each nation's trade deficit by the value of its imports, then halving the result.  Experts argue this formula doesn't align with modern trade deficit definitions and is unlikely to achieve the administration's goals, potentially leading to damaging trade wars. The White House defended the calculation by saying that it assumes persistent trade deficits are due to a combination of tariff and non-tariff factors that prevent trade from balancing.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new tariffs, including a 25% hike on goods imported from South Korea, are impacting the K-beauty industry, potentially raising prices for American consumers.  Beauty enthusiasts, who have long enjoyed affordable, high-quality Korean skincare products, are bracing for the changes, with some stockpiling favorites before prices increase.  The tariffs will test the strength of the K-beauty brand in the US, as some companies may need to shift production to the US to avoid the tariffs, potentially losing the allure of authentic Korean formulations. The founder of KraveBeauty has announced that the tariff will hit their next shipment to the U.S. and will have to be passed on to customers.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is temporarily halting shipments of its UK-made vehicles to the United States for a month to assess the impact of President Trump's new 25% tariffs on imported cars and light trucks.  The US is a significant market for JLR, accounting for nearly a quarter of its sales, and the company is working to address the new trading terms with its business partners.  This pause in shipments raises concerns about the broader impact of tariffs on the British car industry, which employs approximately 200,000 people in manufacturing, and comes as Britain seeks to secure a trade deal with Washington.</p>

          <h2>New Book Questions Liberal Groupthink on COVID-19 Pandemic Response</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book by political scientists Stephen Macedo and Frances Lee argues that liberals were wrong about the pandemic, suggesting that aggressive COVID-19 policies, such as lockdowns and school shutdowns, were misguided and deserved more public debate. The authors contend that public health authorities and the media often pushed these measures without adequately weighing their costs and benefits, and ostracized those who disagreed.  They argue that many stances presented as public health consensus were not as grounded in empirical evidence as many Americans may have believed, and that policies became overly politicized.</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has conducted a large-scale missile defense test in the Gobi Desert, involving the firing of as many as 16 ballistic missiles on a single target. The test aimed to evaluate a cutting-edge radar system's ability to thwart saturation attacks, signaling Beijing’s growing confidence in its capacity to counter advanced threats. The dual-band phased array radar system successfully detected and tracked all missiles before they hit the target, achieving high precision and accuracy. This marks the first public disclosure of China’s land-based early warning radar capabilities.</p>

          <p>Attorneys are reporting that Venezuelans with legal permission to live and work in the United States are being unlawfully arrested and detained by federal authorities. These individuals, who have temporary protected status (TPS), are being held despite the law explicitly prohibiting their detention based on immigration status.  Lawyers believe the Trump administration may be preemptively arresting these individuals in preparation for mass deportations if TPS is eventually revoked.  The arrests and detentions are raising concerns about potential violations of due process and the disregard for legal protections.</p>

          <p>Inactive investors, also known as 'dead' investors, often achieve better investment returns than active traders due to their 'buy and hold' strategy.  Active trading tends to incur higher costs, taxes, and emotional decision-making, leading to poorer performance.  Data shows that the average stock investor's return lagged the S&P 500 stock index by 5.5 percentage points in 2023, highlighting the detrimental impact of bad habits on investment outcomes.  \&#x3c;br/\&#x3e\&#x3c;i\&#x3e(not investment advice)\&#x3c;/i\&#x3e</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariff announcement has triggered significant turmoil in the stock market, surpassing worst-case scenario expectations.  The plan to impose tariffs on nearly all US trading partners has led to retaliatory measures from China and concerns about a global trade war. The stock market has responded negatively, with the Nasdaq entering a bear market, and economists are expressing concerns about the potential for slower growth and higher inflation.  The situation highlights the challenges of retooling the US economy to focus on production rather than consumer spending.</p>

          <p>Laura Loomer, a far-right figure known for her racist and extremist views, has gained significant influence in President Trump's White House, raising concerns about the direction of his administration. Loomer reportedly met with Trump and influenced the firing of National Security Council staff members, and has been asked to compile a list of perceived disloyal individuals at the State Department. Her presence in Trump's inner circle highlights the president's increasing willingness to associate with individuals who have expressed racist and bigoted ideas.  This marks a shift from Trump's first term, where such figures were often kept at a distance.</p>
