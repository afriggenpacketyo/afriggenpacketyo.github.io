          <p>Following a deadly tornado in St. Louis that killed five people, the city's emergency management chief, Sarah Russell, has been placed on administrative leave. The city's sirens, intended to warn residents, were not activated prior to the tornado's arrival. Russell was attending an offsite workshop when the National Weather Service issued a tornado warning and contacted the Fire Department to activate the sirens, but the directive was ambiguous. Additionally, the Fire Department's siren activation button was found to be broken, and St. Louis fire captain John Walk will serve as the interim emergency management commissioner.</p>

          <p>President Trump is pressuring Republican holdouts to support a massive budget package containing his second-term agenda, despite wariness from both fiscal conservatives and blue-state Republicans. House Speaker Mike Johnson is aiming for a vote on the bill, possibly within hours, after a "productive" meeting with Trump and members of the House Freedom Caucus. The legislation faces challenges in the Rules Committee, with conservatives pushing for deeper spending cuts and blue-state Republicans opposing provisions on state and local tax deductions. All Democrats are expected to oppose the bill, making Republican unity crucial for its passage.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized South Africa for seizing land from white farmers, falsely accusing the government of persecution. However, during his first term, Trump pushed to take land for his border wall using eminent domain, a power he has also utilized as a casino developer. This article highlights the contradiction between Trump's condemnation of land seizures abroad and his own use of similar tactics domestically. It includes an interview with a Texas farmer who had to give up his land for the border wall, illustrating the impact of eminent domain on private landowners.</p>

While the bill does not expand abortion access or list specific medical exceptions, it specifies that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment. It defines a "life-threatening" condition as one capable of causing death, with supporters saying the bill will avoid confusion among doctors.

          <p>The Trump administration is in a legal battle to prevent Mahmoud Khalil, a detained Columbia University graduate and pro-Palestinian protest leader, from having a "contact visit" with his wife and newborn son. Khalil, a legal permanent resident, has not been accused of a crime but the administration argues his presence threatens its foreign policy. A judge ordered the administration to allow Khalil a meeting with his wife and lawyers, but it remains unclear if he will be allowed to hold his son, with officials citing security concerns.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston found that the Trump administration violated an order barring officials from deporting people to countries not their own without sufficient notice. The administration deported eight immigrants to a third country after giving them little more than 24 hours' notice. The judge described the action as "unquestionably violative" and said it could result in criminal contempt. The flight carrying the deportees landed in Djibouti, and the judge ordered that the men be provided access to a lawyer and given an interview to determine if they feared being sent to a different country.</p>

A Cambridge University-led study found that using different scans from traditional mammograms could treble the number of cancers detected in this group. Women with dense breasts have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, but cancers are harder to spot because they look whiter on the x-rays, the same colour as early-stage cancers. The study suggests that alternative scanning methods, such as enhanced mammograms and fast MRI scans, could significantly improve cancer detection rates.</p>
