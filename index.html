          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has issued a reminder that Costco membership cards are not acceptable forms of identification at airport security checkpoints. This clarification comes after the implementation of the REAL ID requirement for domestic flights on May 7th. The TSA emphasized that travelers must present a REAL ID-compliant driver's license, a passport, or another federally-approved form of identification, such as a Department of Defense-issued ID. The REAL ID Act was passed in 2005 following recommendations from the 9/11 Commission report to enhance federal identification standards for air travel.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that the recent phone call between President Trump and President Xi Jinping could provide temporary relief for Asian countries navigating the rivalry between the U.S. and China. The call, described as "very positive" by Trump, is seen as a potential diplomatic breakthrough after weeks of escalating tensions. However, this detente might also complicate the strategic calculations of these countries as they seek to balance trade relations with China and navigate U.S. policies. Despite the positive development, some experts believe the relationship between the two powers remains fragile.</p>

This trend has been observed since the summer of 2024, as more mainland companies turn to Hong Kong's stock exchange for capital infusions.

          <p>Japanese securities firms are donating shareholder perks, such as food and beverage gifts, to nonprofit organizations that support children living in poverty. The Japan Securities Dealers Association started the program in 2020, facilitating the donation of approximately 2,300 items by March of this year. These donations, including rice and ready-made foods, are delivered to single-mother households and served at gatherings for children. This initiative helps address the needs of vulnerable populations amidst rising inflation.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran immigrant mistakenly deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration, has been brought back to the U.S. to face federal charges of conspiracy to transport undocumented migrants. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the Salvadoran government agreed to return Abrego Garcia after being presented with an arrest warrant. Abrego Garcia's attorney argues that his client is being punished before being given a chance to defend himself. The indictment alleges that Abrego Garcia was involved in a smuggling ring that transported migrants, including MS-13 gang members, into the U.S.</p>

This money is largely used to cover the accommodation costs of thousands of asylum seekers. The Home Office stated it is committed to ending asylum hotels and is speeding up asylum decisions to save taxpayers' money. However, the scale of government aid spending on asylum hotels has meant huge cuts in UK support for humanitarian and development priorities across the world.</p>
