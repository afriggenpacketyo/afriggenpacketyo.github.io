          <p>A sudden storm caused four tourist boats to capsize in a scenic area of Guizhou province, China, resulting in the deaths of 10 people and injuring over 70. More than 80 people were thrown into the Wu River, a tributary of the Yangtze, when strong winds, rain, and hail struck. President Xi Jinping has called for all-out efforts to find the missing and care for the injured, emphasizing the importance of strengthening safety measures at tourist attractions and public venues. The capsized boats were reportedly not overloaded, each having a maximum capacity of about 40 people.</p>

          <p>Labour minister Lucy Powell is facing calls for her resignation from sexual assault survivors after describing the grooming gangs scandal as a “dog whistle” issue during a BBC radio program. Her comments, made in response to a discussion about a documentary on grooming gangs, have been widely criticized for belittling victims' experiences. While Powell has issued an apology, stating that she was challenging political point-scoring rather than the issue itself, survivors and political figures have condemned her remarks and called for further action.</p>

          <p>Joy Air, a regional airline in western China, has suspended all flights due to labor disputes and a debt crisis, leaving some pilots to deliver food for income. The airline, supported by the Shaanxi provincial government, operates domestic routes connecting smaller cities with regional hubs. The suspension is primarily due to a lack of profitable routes, as high-speed rail networks are replacing internal routes within Shaanxi, offering cheaper alternatives.</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to impose 100% tariffs on movies made in foreign countries, causing concern in the Australian film industry. Trump claims the American movie industry is dying and blames foreign nations for offering incentives to attract filmmakers. The Australian government has vowed to stand up for the rights of the Australian screen industry. The potential tariffs could affect the export of Australian content to the US and reduce the attractiveness of Australia as a location for foreign film productions.</p>

The study examined domesticated and wild rose samples, revealing that their common ancestor likely had single-petal flowers with yellow color and seven leaflets. Roses, known as the 'queen of flowers,' are one of the most extensively cultivated ornamental flowers, with pink and red roses becoming synonymous with the flower.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the Battle of Berlin, the city still exhibits scars from the intense fighting that marked the end of World War II in Europe. Despite significant restoration and modern development, bullet-ridden facades and gaps in rows of houses serve as reminders of the past. Post-war Berlin was divided and later reunited, becoming a symbol of both Cold War division and eventual reconciliation. The article emphasizes the resilience of Berlin and its people in rebuilding after the devastation of the war.</p>
