          <p>Congressional Republicans indicate that any legislative action to provide a permanent solution for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program is contingent on President Trump's initiative. Despite some bipartisan support for protecting the approximately half a million beneficiaries, the coalition of Republicans advocating for a fix has diminished over the years. Lawmakers who previously supported such measures now emphasize that the administration's current focus on border enforcement and mass deportation takes precedence, leaving the future of DACA recipients in a state of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Faced with soaring housing prices, a growing number of Americans, particularly younger generations, are co-buying homes with friends or relatives. This trend allows individuals to overcome the significant financial advantage that couples possess in the real estate market by combining incomes and assets. While this approach provides a pathway to homeownership, it also introduces unique legal and personal challenges, prompting experts to advise co-buyers to create formal written agreements to protect their investments and relationships in case of future disagreements or life changes.</p>

The bombardment, which involved nearly 500 drones and over 40 missiles targeting seven regions, resulted in at least four deaths in Kyiv, including a 12-year-old girl, and wounded dozens across the country. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attack on civilian infrastructure as a vile act, highlighting its timing at the close of the UN General Assembly week and vowing a firm response.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, stated that China is extremely close to the United States in semiconductor capabilities, describing the gap as mere "nanoseconds." He advocated for American tech companies to compete globally, including in China, to maximize U.S. economic influence and technological proliferation. Huang highlighted China's vibrant, entrepreneurial tech industry and deep talent pool as reasons why the U.S. must actively engage in competition rather than rely solely on restrictions to maintain its lead in the critical sector.

          <p>Moldovans are voting in a crucial parliamentary election that will determine the nation's geopolitical direction, choosing between closer integration with the European Union or aligning with Russia. The election is marked by high tensions, with President Maia Sandu accusing Russia of "massive interference" and attempting to destabilize the country. Ahead of the vote, two pro-Russian parties were disqualified over concerns of illegal financing, adding to the charged atmosphere as Sandu's pro-EU party risks losing its majority.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has reimposed a wide range of economic and military sanctions on Iran through the "snapback" mechanism of the 2015 nuclear deal. Triggered by the UK, France, and Germany over Iran's non-cooperation with nuclear inspectors, the move further pressures an already crippled Iranian economy. The sanctions are expected to exacerbate hardships for ordinary citizens, who are facing record inflation, soaring food prices, and increasing anxiety over the nation's future and the potential for renewed military conflict.</p>

          <p>Despite having one of the tallest squads in the Premier League and hiring a new specialist coach, Newcastle United has struggled to convert set-piece opportunities into goals this season. The team has shown a shift in tactics, such as an increased use of long throws, but has only scored once from a corner or free-kick. This article analyzes the team's approach and the challenge they face in making their physical advantage count, especially as they prepare to face Arsenal, a team that has been highly effective from dead-ball situations.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: US TikTok deal may represent a strategic victory for China</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that the recent deal structuring TikTok's U.S. operations is not the decisive victory for the United States that it appears to be. The author contends that while the agreement increases U.S. ownership, it leaves TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, as the single largest shareholder. This arrangement, the article suggests, allows China to retain significant leverage and influence over the platform's powerful algorithms, potentially making the deal a major strategic triumph for Beijing in the long run.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to recent claims about autism from the Trump administration, this opinion article highlights the positive traits often associated with autistic individuals. The author argues that qualities such as an intense capacity for focus, adherence to facts, a strong sense of social justice, and deep empathy stand in stark contrast to Donald Trump's own behavior. The piece reframes autism not as a tragedy to be cured, but as a different way of being that offers valuable lessons in joy, love, and honesty.</p>

          <p>As the regular season concludes, the Los Angeles Dodgers are grappling with several key roster uncertainties ahead of their wild-card series. The health of key players like Max Muncy and Will Smith remains a primary concern, leaving their availability for the postseason opener in question. Furthermore, the team must finalize its pitching staff, particularly the bullpen composition, and determine its starting rotation, with decisions on these crucial spots likely to be made just before the playoffs begin.</p>

          <p>The town of Rock Springs, Wyoming, is taking a significant step to acknowledge a dark chapter in its history by dedicating a new, prominent monument to the victims of the 1885 anti-Chinese massacre. The event, where a mob of white miners killed 28 Chinese laborers, was previously marked only by a small, obscure plaque. The new statue and commemoration efforts, which include archaeological digs at the former Chinatown site, represent a community-led move toward reconciliation and educating current residents about the town's violent, anti-immigrant past.</p>

          <h2>Weak consumer spending in China leads to lower hairy crab prices before holiday week</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 00:00:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of hairy crabs, a popular seasonal delicacy in China, has fallen significantly just before the country's eight-day "super golden week" holiday. Industry insiders attribute the price drop to a combination of increased production and weak consumer demand, which is seen as a key indicator of the health of domestic spending. The sluggish market for this luxury food item reflects broader concerns about consumption doldrums within the Chinese economy as it faces a critical test during the major holiday period.
