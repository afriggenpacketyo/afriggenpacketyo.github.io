          <p>In this New York Times article, Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist, encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack and stop striving for perfection, highlighting that flaws are essential for children to learn acceptance and resilience. She points out the historical tendency of psychiatry to blame mothers and stresses the importance of give-and-take in relationships, suggesting mothers should not feel pressured by societal expectations or internalize blame for their children's problems. Ross provides a lighthearted quiz to help mothers recognize they are good enough, emphasizing that imperfections are a normal and healthy part of motherhood.</p>

The article explains that mortgage rates are influenced by factors such as global demand for U.S. Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve interest rate policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. High mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential home buyers, contributing to a sluggish start to the spring home-buying season.</p>
