          <p>The Trump administration has revoked the U.S. visa of Colombian President Gustavo Petro, citing his "reckless and incendiary actions." The decision followed a speech Petro gave at a demonstration in New York City, where he allegedly urged U.S. soldiers to disobey orders. This diplomatic escalation comes amid existing tensions, including Petro's previous calls for a criminal investigation into President Trump regarding U.S. military actions in the Caribbean. The move highlights the strained relationship between the two administrations.</p>

          <p>South Korea is facing a severe demographic crisis as its birth rate, one of the lowest in the world, threatens to undermine decades of economic progress. Projections from the Bank of Korea and the Korea Development Institute warn that the nation could face economic contraction by the 2040s due to a shrinking workforce. Despite the government investing over $270 billion in incentives to encourage childbirth, these measures have had little effect. The crisis also has significant implications for the country's pension system and military readiness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Startup founders are sharing their experiences with business failure, highlighting the intense personal and professional challenges involved. Serial entrepreneur Ismael Dainehine and others describe the process as painful, often leading to a loss of identity and the difficult task of laying off employees. The article explores how founders transition back to corporate life, where they may face an "entrepreneurship penalty" from recruiters but can also be highly valuable employees due to their broad experience. Ultimately, reframing success around a deep sense of purpose is key to bouncing back.</p>

          <p>To attract more foreign visitors and stimulate its tourism sector, China is continuing to relax its entry requirements for many travelers. The country now offers several visa-free options, including a transit program that allows passport holders from 55 nations to stay for up to 10 days in many parts of the mainland. Recently, Beijing also extended its 30-day visa-free stay policy to include Russian citizens. These measures are designed to lower the bureaucratic and financial hurdles that have traditionally made visiting China more difficult for international tourists.</p>

          <p>Political discourse in Hungary is growing increasingly acrimonious, marked by hate speech and pressure on independent media in the lead-up to elections. The governing Fidesz party, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has been accused of using taxpayer-funded propaganda to paint political opponents as enemies. This has prompted public protests, with tens of thousands demonstrating in Budapest against the toxic political climate. Despite the introduction of the EU's European Media Freedom Act, Fidesz's dominance over state and private media outlets continues to stifle free expression.</p>

          <p>The United Nations is poised to reimpose comprehensive economic and military sanctions on Iran after a decade, following accusations from the UK, France, and Germany that Tehran has failed to meet its nuclear deal commitments. The move comes after Iran increased its banned nuclear activities following the US withdrawal from the JCPOA deal in 2016. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has condemned the sanctions as "unjust and illegal," while insisting his country does not seek nuclear weapons. The reimposition of sanctions significantly heightens regional tensions.</p>

          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada showcases more than just a battle for the title; it highlights the vast financial gap in the sport. England's team is fully professional, with players on full-time contracts backed by millions in funding. In contrast, the Canadian team relies on minimal national funding and had to launch a public fundraising campaign to cover its World Cup preparations. Despite the disparity, Canada has performed exceptionally, demonstrating that clever preparation and player dedication can challenge even the best-funded teams on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Nine months into his second term, President Donald Trump is actively pursuing his campaign promise of retribution against perceived political enemies, raising concerns about the expansion of presidential power. His administration has openly encouraged the Justice Department to target political opponents, leading to the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, and has pressured media outlets critical of his presidency. Supporters justify these actions as a necessary response to politically motivated prosecutions against Trump, while critics warn these moves represent a significant shift towards authoritarianism.</p>

A recent demonstration in Berlin, organized by politician Sahra Wagenknecht, drew over 10,000 people calling for peace negotiations and an end to all arms deliveries to war zones. While the movement is currently fragmented, some observers believe it could grow, particularly with the debate over reintroducing compulsory military service mobilizing young people.

Reeves is urging the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor the potential economic benefits of such a deal into its forecasts ahead of the autumn Budget.

In a 6-3 decision, the conservative majority ruled that the administration's asserted harms to its conduct of foreign affairs outweighed the potential harm to aid recipients. The dissenting liberal justices argued the decision conflicts with the constitutional separation of powers, which grants Congress authority over federal spending. This ruling supports the administration's broader policy of significantly reducing U.S. foreign aid operations.</p>

          <p>Chinese companies like Huawei and AI start-up DeepSeek are making significant strides in reducing the nation's dependence on U.S. semiconductor technology. Spurred by U.S. trade restrictions, Huawei has unveiled its latest Ascend AI chips and hardware, designed as powerful alternatives to Nvidia's processors. Simultaneously, DeepSeek, developer of a world-class AI model, announced a shift toward supporting these domestically produced chips. This growing confidence in home-grown technology aligns with Beijing's directive for its tech giants to stop purchasing Nvidia chips tailored for the Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that MyPillow founder Mike Lindell defamed election technology company Smartmatic by repeatedly making false statements that its machines rigged the 2020 presidential election. The judge identified 51 specific instances where Lindell falsely claimed Smartmatic interfered with results in Los Angeles County. However, the court deferred a decision on whether Lindell acted with "actual malice," a standard Smartmatic must still prove to be awarded damages. Lindell, a prominent ally of President Trump, has vowed to continue his fight against voting machine companies.</p>

          <p>U.S. Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley is facing criticism for his strategy after a challenging opening day at Bethpage left his team trailing Europe 5 ½ to 2 ½. Questions were raised about his decision to stick with the pairing of Collin Morikawa and Harris English for the Saturday foursomes, despite their heavy defeat on Friday to the same European duo. Bradley defended his choices, stating the team has a plan and will not panic. The U.S. players struggled on the greens, and the captain emphasized the need for a different mindset as they play from behind.</p>
