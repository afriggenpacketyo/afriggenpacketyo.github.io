          <p>This article discusses three insurance policies that seniors should consider this spring to enhance their financial protection. Medicare supplemental insurance can cover co-pays and deductibles not covered by traditional Medicare. Long-term care insurance can help with costs associated with nursing homes, assisted living, or in-home care. Whole life insurance offers a cash component that can be borrowed from while alive and provides a payout to beneficiaries after death. The article advises seniors to research their options and secure coverage sooner rather than later, as prices generally increase with age. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Florida has become the second state, after Utah, to ban fluoride in tap water, a move signed into law by Governor Ron DeSantis. The law prohibits local governments from adding fluoride to water systems, citing concerns about overexposure. This decision contrasts with the views of dentists and public health advocates, who consider water fluoridation a safe and effective way to maintain dental health. Miami-Dade County had already voted to remove fluoride from its water ahead of the statewide ban, sparking controversy over potential long-term health consequences, as this article highlights the debate surrounding the new law.</p>

          <p>A new genetics study has traced the migration of the first people to colonize the Americas back to modern-day Russia, approximately 20,000-30,000 years ago. The research suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. The study also found that early settlers split into groups that became isolated in different environmental settings, leading to the development of distinct genetic traits. Researchers believe the new genetic data shows natural barriers, such as the Amazon rainforest and the Andes mountain range, led to the isolation of these Indigenous groups.</p>

The issue before the court is whether federal judges have the power to block presidential actions through nationwide injunctions. A ruling in Trump's favor could allow him to implement his order ending automatic citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and certain foreign residents.</p>

          <p>Walmart has announced that it will be increasing prices on some items due to tariffs, despite a temporary reprieve on duties for Chinese imports. CFO John David Rainey warned investors about the unprecedented speed and magnitude of the price increases. The company is committed to keeping prices low relative to competitors and will absorb some of the higher tariff costs, but shoppers will likely see increases toward the end of May and more in June. Walmart has also taken steps to reduce tariff exposure, such as switching to alternative materials.</p>
