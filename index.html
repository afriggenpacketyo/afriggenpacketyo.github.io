          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 20:24:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate has passed bipartisan legislation to help thousands of military veterans avoid foreclosure on their homes. This bill addresses a critical gap left after the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) ended a previous homeowner assistance program, leaving veterans with fewer options than other homeowners. The new law will allow veterans who have fallen behind on payments to move those missed payments to the end of their loan term, thus making their mortgage current. This action by Congress aims to rectify a series of administrative stumbles and provide a stable safety net for veterans facing financial hardship.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 20:22:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump asked a group of House Republicans for their opinion on whether he should fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a move that would be legally contentious and could destabilize financial markets. Sources indicate that many in the room supported the idea, and the president has publicly confirmed the conversation while escalating his criticism of Powell's performance and the Fed's interest rate policies. The administration has also increased pressure by accusing Powell of mismanaging a renovation of the Fed's headquarters, an allegation he denies. This development underscores the growing tension between the White House and the traditionally independent central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has labeled the controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein case a "Hoax" and "bulls***," lashing out at members of his own party who are demanding more transparency from his administration. In a social media post, he accused these Republicans of being "weaklings" who are doing the Democrats' work and stated he no longer wants their support. The president's comments highlight a significant rift within the GOP, as prominent figures like House Speaker Mike Johnson have called for the Justice Department to release more information. This internal party conflict comes after the DOJ announced its review found no evidence of an Epstein "client list."</p>

          <p>A coalition of 20 states has sued the Trump administration, targeting the Department of Homeland Security and FEMA for unlawfully terminating a key disaster mitigation program. The lawsuit argues that the executive branch overstepped its authority by shutting down the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, which Congress had funded. This program provided federal money for projects like elevating buildings in flood zones and improving stormwater systems, and its cancellation threatens hundreds of planned projects. The states are seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the reallocation of these funds, which they claim are vital for protecting communities from natural disasters.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports fell for the second straight month in June, contracting by 0.5% year-over-year and fueling fears of a potential recession for the export-reliant economy. The decline was driven by a sharp drop in shipments to key partners, including an 11.4% decrease to the United States and a 4.7% fall to China. The situation is exacerbated by the U.S. imposing a 25% "reciprocal tariff" on Japanese imports, with no trade deal in sight to provide relief. Exports of automobiles to the U.S., a critical sector for Japan's economy, plunged by 26.7%, highlighting the significant impact of the ongoing trade dispute. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Mike Pence has publicly called for the Trump administration to release all government files related to the investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein, stating that "the time has come" for transparency. In a direct contrast to President Trump, who has dismissed the matter as a "hoax," Pence argued that the American people deserve to see the facts, while emphasizing that the names of victims must be protected. Pence's remarks underscore the deep division within the Republican party over the handling of the Epstein case. The Justice Department recently concluded its review, finding no evidence of a "client list" but identifying over 1,000 victims.</p>

Former USAID Inspector General Paul Martin and other officials allege the cuts were politically motivated, targeting programs with keywords like "gender" or "climate" rather than being based on performance reviews. Critics argue that the administration dismantled oversight mechanisms, making it difficult to verify claims of misuse while putting lifesaving humanitarian programs at risk.

The quake, which occurred about 50 miles south of Sand Point, initially triggered a more severe tsunami warning, prompting some coastal communities to evacuate to higher ground. However, authorities later downgraded the alert to an advisory before canceling it altogether, stating that large, widespread waves were not expected as the event occurred in shallow water. While the earthquake was felt across the region and followed by several aftershocks, there have been no reports of significant damage or injuries.</p>

The first officer reportedly expressed surprise and panic on the recording as this action would have stopped fuel from flowing to the Boeing 787 Dreamliner's engines.

Many families struggle to pay these costs upfront, especially those on Universal Credit who receive childcare benefits in arrears.

The recall affects certain 2021-2024 Bronco Sport and 2020-2022 Escape models equipped with 1.5L engines. As an interim solution, Ford dealers will provide a free software update to detect a leak, reduce engine power, and lower engine temperatures to mitigate the danger. Owners will be notified when a permanent remedy becomes available, marking another major safety recall for the automaker this year.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military conducted airstrikes on Syria's defense ministry in Damascus and government forces in the south amid escalating sectarian violence in Suweida province that has killed over 300 people. Israel stated its actions were to protect the local Druze population from Syrian government "gangs," while Syria condemned the strikes as "treacherous aggression." Following the attacks, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that "specific steps" had been agreed upon to end the "horrifying situation," with Syrian state media later reporting a troop withdrawal from Suweida. The strikes and subsequent diplomatic efforts highlight the volatile and complex multi-party conflict unfolding in the region.</p>

          <p>Shares of GrabAGun, an online firearms retailer with Donald Trump Jr. as a shareholder and advisor, fell by more than 20% during their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The public debut followed a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), and Trump Jr. was present to ring the opening bell, hailing the moment as a "vindication" against "woke nonsense." Despite raising $179 million from the merger, the stock's poor performance under the ticker "PEW" marks a rocky start for the company. The venture is one of several recent examples of the Trump family and allies backing companies tied to conservative political causes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A catastrophic data breach by the UK government in 2022, which was concealed by a court-ordered super-injunction, has now been made public, revealing that thousands of Afghans who sought UK protection were put at risk. A spreadsheet containing the personal details of nearly 19,000 Afghan applicants was accidentally emailed outside the secure government system, potentially exposing them to Taliban reprisals. The government secretly launched a relocation program, the Afghanistan Response Route, to extract those affected without informing them of the leak. So far, the covert operation has cost £400 million and relocated approximately 900 individuals and their families, with many more still potentially in danger.</p>

          <p>A group of seven Liberal Democrat MPs, including party leader Sir Ed Davey, has formally asked the UK's culture secretary to intervene after football club Crystal Palace was demoted from the Europa League. The club was moved to the lower-tier Conference League by UEFA for breaching multi-club ownership rules, as owner John Textor also holds a majority stake in French club Lyon, which also qualified. The MPs described the punishment as "disgraceful," "disproportionately punitive," and a "heart-breaking" decision for fans who recently celebrated the team's first major trophy win. They argue the process has been opaque and raises serious questions about fairness in football governance.</p>

          <p>An article from The Atlantic explores how the Jeffrey Epstein conspiracy theory has grown into a powerful narrative that even its original proponents, including Donald Trump, can no longer control. After years of fanning the flames of a government cover-up, Trump is now dismissing the story as a "hoax" and attacking his own supporters who demand the release of the "client list," causing a rift in his base. The story's power lies in its mix of known facts, a genuine mystery about Epstein's death, and the specter of a secret list implicating powerful elites. This has created an unstable political force that transcends party lines and now threatens to undermine the very leader who helped create it.</p>

          <p>The German government has committed to passing new legislation by the end of the year to crack down on gangs smuggling migrants to the United Kingdom. This move, announced during the German chancellor's visit to the UK, will make it illegal in Germany to facilitate illegal migration to a non-EU country like the UK. Currently, such an act is not technically a crime in Germany. The new law will empower German authorities to target the supply chain for small boat crossings, including warehouses used to store boats and engines, reflecting a new level of cooperation between the two nations to address the issue.</p>

This postponement is part of a larger trend in the L.A. area, where several community events have been canceled or rescheduled following aggressive ICE sweeps that have stoked terror among immigrant populations.

          <p>A legislative effort in Nebraska to repeal a state law that bans individuals with past drug convictions from receiving federal food assistance has narrowly failed. The ban is a remnant of "war on drugs" era policies that several other states have already eliminated. Proponents of the repeal argued that the law creates unnecessary barriers for people re-entering society and trying to rebuild their lives, often affecting their ability to feed themselves and their families. Despite a push to change the policy, lawmakers fell just short of the votes needed, keeping the long-standing restriction in place for the foreseeable future.</p>

While quarterly revenue fell slightly short of estimates and unit revenues declined, the airline projects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for the year. This updated guidance comes after a rocky start to the year for the industry, which saw weaker-than-expected domestic demand.

          <p>More than 20 children have been placed in the custody of a California child-welfare agency as authorities investigate a Los Angeles-area couple who are their legal parents. The investigation began after an infant suffered a traumatic head injury, allegedly from being shaken by a nanny, leading police to discover 15 children in the couple's home and another six elsewhere. The children, ranging from two months to 13 years old, were born via surrogacy, with some surrogate mothers now claiming they were misled and unaware of the scale of the arrangement. The complex case involves allegations of child abuse and neglect, prompting a multi-agency investigation including the FBI.</p>

          <p>As the bankrupt Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans moves to settle 633 clergy abuse claims, church investors are arguing that nearly half of these claims could be legally dismissed. The arguments center on claims filed after the court's deadline or those that are duplicates or involve clergy from outside the archdiocese's authority. If these claims are thrown out, it could jeopardize the entire $210-$235 million settlement, as a smaller pool of victims would make it easier for dissenting claimants to gather enough "no" votes to kill the deal. The church has also revealed its public archive of abuse files will only include clergy named in three or more claims.</p>

          <p>A landmark British study has demonstrated that creating "three-parent" babies can successfully prevent children from being born with devastating inherited mitochondrial diseases. Researchers used the technique, known as mitochondrial donation, to help families have eight healthy children by replacing a mother's defective mitochondrial DNA with healthy DNA from a female donor. The resulting babies carry the primary genetic material from their two parents, ensuring they inherit their main traits, but are free from the mother's heritable disorder. While hailed as a pioneering breakthrough, the technique remains controversial due to ethical concerns about genetic manipulation and creating "designer babies."</p>
