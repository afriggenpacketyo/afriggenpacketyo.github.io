          <p>In Nepal, a two-year-old girl named Aryatara Shakya has been chosen as the new Kumari, or "living goddess," a revered figure for both Hindus and Buddhists. Selected from the Shakya clan based on strict criteria, she will live in a temple palace in Kathmandu for several years, making public appearances only during festivals. While her family gains elevated social status, the tradition raises concerns about the challenges former Kumaris face when they return to normal life after reaching puberty.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates the United States is approaching herd immunity against the human papillomavirus (HPV), the primary cause of cervical cancer, due to a successful and long-running vaccination program for adolescents. The research found that high vaccination rates among both boys and girls have led to a significant decline in HPV infections, even protecting unvaccinated women. While this progress is promising, experts caution that maintaining high vaccine uptake is crucial to sustain this community-wide protection and prevent a resurgence.</p>

          <p>China has introduced a new "K-visa" to attract foreign talent in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics by removing the need for employer sponsorship. The policy has triggered significant online criticism from Chinese citizens who fear it will disadvantage local graduates in an already challenging job market. Despite the backlash, state media defends the program as necessary for China's technological advancement, arguing that the country still lacks high-level talent and that fears of mass immigration are overstated.</p>

The shutdown's timing is critical as it delays key economic data, complicating the Federal Reserve's upcoming decisions. Analysts suggest that while the shutdown was the immediate catalyst, ongoing geopolitical conflicts and political instability are also driving investors to diversify their portfolios with assets like gold.

          <p>The U.S. federal government has officially shut down after Republican and Democratic lawmakers failed to agree on a spending bill, halting many government services and furloughing hundreds of thousands of federal employees.

This marks the 21st government funding gap since 1977, raising concerns about economic disruption and the well-being of federal workers, similar to the record 35-day shutdown in 2018-2019.</p>

Over time, "hocus pocus" became a shorthand for magic and trickery, with the shortened term "hoax" emerging around 1800 to describe a grander, more elaborate deception, distinguishing it from a simple lie or deceit.</p>

          <p>A massive brown bear named Chunk has been voted the winner of the 2025 Fat Bear Week, an annual competition celebrating the bears of Alaska's Katmai National Park as they bulk up for winter hibernation. Chunk's victory was particularly notable as he overcame a broken jaw earlier in the summer, demonstrating remarkable resilience in learning to fish despite his injury. The popular online contest, which draws voters from over 100 countries, highlights the bears' success in preparing for the harsh winter months ahead.</p>

          <p>A Nigerian man, deported from the U.S. to Ghana as part of a controversial "third-country" agreement, claims he and five others were secretly transferred across the border to Togo by Ghanaian officers. The man stated they were told they were being moved to better accommodations but were instead abandoned in the neighboring country without proper documentation. This incident raises further questions about the implementation of the U.S. deportation policy and Ghana's role in accepting deportees from various West African nations.</p>

          <p>A growing safety scandal in Australia has led to the recall of 18 sunscreen products after testing revealed they did not provide their claimed level of sun protection. An investigation by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) identified a shared base formula as the issue, with some products testing as low as SPF 4 instead of the advertised 50+. The crisis has raised significant concerns about a U.S.-based testing laboratory used by many brands, prompting a broader review of SPF testing requirements in the country.</p>

However, the plan's strength in political momentum is matched by its weakness in specific details, creating ambiguity that allows for conflicting interpretations. While the proposal mentions a "pathway to Palestinian self-determination," Netanyahu has already publicly reiterated his opposition to a Palestinian state, highlighting significant diplomatic hurdles.</p>

While acknowledging that room for future cuts has emerged, the RBI remains cautious, opting for a patient approach before implementing further monetary policy changes. (not investment advice)</p>
