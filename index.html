          <h2>Republicans Divided Over State and Local Tax Deduction in Upcoming Tax Bill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 14:55:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A faction of Republicans is jeopardizing President Trump's legislative agenda due to disagreements over the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. Some Republicans aim to eliminate or significantly limit the deduction, while others, particularly those from high-tax states like New York and New Jersey, insist on lifting the $10,000 cap imposed in 2017. Raising the cap would be costly, potentially exceeding $1 trillion over a decade, and could jeopardize other tax cuts Republicans are prioritizing. The article highlights the political challenges and fiscal constraints surrounding the SALT deduction, which has long been a contentious issue, and the potential impact on public services and homeownership in high-tax areas.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that President Trump intends to maintain a 10% baseline tariff on all countries, even after the recently announced trade deal with the United Kingdom. This policy means that despite the new trade agreement, goods from the U.K. will still be subject to a 10% tariff. The Trump administration's broader trade strategy includes imposing tariffs on various imports, including steel, aluminum, and vehicles, to promote reciprocity and fairness in international trade. The article also notes that the U.K. had relatively low tariffs on most U.S. goods prior to April 2025, while also including the UK's average tariff rate.</p>

          <p>While tech giants like Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon reported strong first-quarter ad sales, signs of a slowdown are emerging due to President Trump's trade war. Meta noted reduced spending from Asia-based e-commerce exporters due to the end of a trade loophole, and Alphabet and Pinterest executives expressed concerns about broader macroeconomic uncertainty. Snap even withdrew its second-quarter guidance due to the unpredictable economy.
