          <p>Rivian Automotive is laying off approximately 4.5% of its workforce due to increasing market challenges, impacting marketing, vehicle operations, sales, delivery, and mobile operations teams. CEO RJ Scaringe stated these changes are necessary to scale efficiently and build a profitable business as the company prepares to launch its new R2 models next year. The company's vehicle sales increased by 32% in the third quarter, but its 2025 delivery forecast was narrowed, and it flagged a larger adjusted core loss this year. These layoffs reflect the challenges EV manufacturers face amid changing regulations and slower-than-expected demand. Optimism is tempered by the need for restructuring in a competitive market.

          <p>Thousands of Starbucks workers are preparing to vote on whether to strike due to stalled contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United, which began in May 2024 but broke down in December. The union is demanding increased hours, higher take-home pay, and a resolution for alleged unfair labor practices, while Starbucks claims it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are noneconomic proposals. Previous strikes have had limited impact, and Starbucks recently closed some locations and cut jobs, raising questions about its revitalization strategy. The situation reflects ongoing labor tensions within the company.</p>

Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI researchers, utilizes a multi-cloud architecture, running its Claude language models across Google's TPUs, Amazon's Trainium chips, and Nvidia's GPUs, assigning specialized workloads to each platform. Anthropic's annual revenue run rate is approaching $7 billion, powering over 300,000 businesses, showcasing its rapid growth and efficient infrastructure strategy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford Motor exceeded third-quarter earnings expectations but lowered its 2025 guidance due to the impact of a fire at a Novelis aluminum supplier plant, which is disrupting production of profitable trucks and SUVs. The fire is expected to cost Ford between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, but the company plans to mitigate much of that impact by increasing manufacturing of impacted vehicles once supplies are available. Ford plans to add 1,000 workers to plants in Michigan and Kentucky to increase pickup truck production and recoup 50,000 units in 2026. Despite the setback, Ford remains on track to cut $1 billion in costs this year as part of its Ford+ plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is overseeing the construction of a new ballroom at the White House, financed by private donors including Big Tech companies and defense contractors, raising ethical concerns. The project, estimated to cost $300 million, is proceeding during a federal government shutdown, leading to criticism about the appropriateness of such an opulent project when ordinary citizens face financial strain. Critics argue that the donations from companies seeking government favor could lead to corruption and quid-pro-quo arrangements. Despite Trump's insistence that no taxpayer money will be used, the financing model has sparked debate about potential conflicts of interest and influence peddling.</p>

This action follows World Aquatics' 2022 policy limiting transgender women's participation to those who transitioned before age 12 or Tanner Stage 2 of puberty. Caldas's wins at a U.S. Masters Swimming event earlier this year sparked controversy and criticism from competitors. The decision has been applauded by some who believe it upholds fairness in women's sports, while others may view it as discriminatory.</p>

          <p>Electric truck maker Rivian is laying off hundreds of employees in an attempt to save cash amid a slowdown in demand and the expiration of federal tax credits. The layoffs, affecting about 4.5% of the workforce, come as demand for electric vehicles stalls and the vehicles get harder to afford. Rivian reported a 32% increase in vehicle sales in the third quarter but lowered its estimate of sales for the full year. The company is preparing to launch a new, more affordable model to boost sales, while Tesla also released lower-priced versions of its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams will endorse Andrew Cuomo in the city’s mayoral race, following months of tension between the two Democrats turned independents. Adams revealed his intention after ending his own re-election campaign, which saw him register poor polling numbers. Adams plans to campaign alongside Cuomo in neighborhoods where he maintains strong support, focusing on issues of gentrification and community engagement. The race has been dominated by the fight between Cuomo and the democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, with both Mamdani and the Republican nominee refusing Adams’s endorsement.</p>

Andre will be on probation for two years and will serve 60 days on house arrest, and he will also be required to register as a sex offender and pay fines. The charges stem from an incident where Andre was accused of entering a girls’ sports locker room after being told not to enter, with a student reporting that she saw Andre staring at her while she was changing.

          <p>The upcoming release of September's consumer price index report is expected to be a market-moving event due to a lack of recent economic data, with economists anticipating a monthly increase of 0.4%. This would put the 12-month inflation rate at 3.1%, a slight increase from August, and economists at Goldman Sachs expect upward pressure on categories such as communication, household furnishings, and recreation due to tariffs. Geopolitical uncertainty and trade tensions have raised worries about higher prices slowing economic growth, and the CPI report should help answer some of these questions. The report will also influence the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, where another interest rate cut is expected. (not investment advice)</p>

While a large number of California Democrats support Newsom running for president in 2028, overall voter opinion is split, and the poll also reveals that Californians believe the state sets a good example on technology, culture, and environmental policy. However, they do not think it sets a good example on housing, tax, economic, or political policy, with most describing the cost of living in the state as unmanageable. The poll also examines voter consideration of potential candidates for the 2026 gubernatorial race.</p>

Rates have fallen for two consecutive weeks and are just slightly above their three-year low from September, making it a potentially smart time for buyers to take action. Buyers should consider that rates are slowly moving lower but could reverse course due to various factors, including Federal Reserve policy.

          <p>With gold prices swinging sharply, investors can capitalize on the volatility through trading gold mining stocks, using gold ETFs or futures for short-term plays, and buying physical gold on dips. Gold mining stocks often move in tandem with the price of gold but with greater leverage, and gold ETFs offer diversified exposure to the sector. Gold-backed ETFs or futures contracts allow for precise trading of gold's price movements, while buying physical gold during sharp price drops can be a smart long-term strategy. The key to success is flexibility and strategic thinking, given the current market's uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
