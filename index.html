          <p>Lithuania's central bank is formally investigating Robinhood's new tokenized stock product following a public warning from OpenAI that it had no involvement with the offering. The product allows EU users to gain indirect exposure to private company shares, such as OpenAI and SpaceX, through blockchain-based tokens. Regulators are now seeking clarification on the product's structure and whether Robinhood's communications to consumers were clear, fair, and not misleading, casting uncertainty on the new venture.

          <p>This article contrasts Apple's recent strategic moves, highlighting the major box office success of its film "F1" as a significant victory for its services division and long-term investment strategy. However, this triumph is juxtaposed with Wall Street's growing concerns over the company's progress in artificial intelligence. Despite its vast resources, Apple's AI suite, particularly its Siri assistant, is seen as lagging behind competitors like Google and OpenAI, posing a potential long-term risk to its hardware dominance.</p>

          <p>A new U.S. law introduces a temporary tax deduction for seniors, but policy experts caution that it does not eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits as some have claimed. The bill creates a new "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals over 65 who fall within specific income thresholds, which is set to expire in 2028. Critics argue that the measure disproportionately benefits wealthier seniors and could place additional financial strain on the already fragile Social Security trust fund. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Xbox executive producer faced significant criticism for a now-deleted LinkedIn post that suggested laid-off employees use AI chatbots like ChatGPT for emotional support. The advice was posted shortly after parent company Microsoft confirmed up to 9,000 job cuts, many impacting its Xbox division. The post was widely condemned on social media as tone-deaf and insensitive, highlighting a disconnect between corporate management and the human impact of the mass layoffs in the tech industry.</p>

          <p>Apple has formally appealed a 500 million euro fine levied by the European Union, calling the penalty "unprecedented." The EU's executive body fined the tech giant for violating the Digital Markets Act (DMA), finding that its App Store rules unfairly restricted developers from informing users about cheaper purchasing options available outside the app. Apple contends that the EU's mandates are harmful to users and confusing for developers, and that it has already made changes to comply with the law.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce a new law extending the right to bereavement leave for parents who suffer a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Currently, statutory leave is only granted for losses after this point, often forcing those who experience earlier loss to use sick leave. This proposed change, championed by campaigners, would provide at least one week of unpaid leave, formally recognizing early pregnancy loss as a bereavement and aiming to reduce the associated stigma.</p>

A key example is China's BeiDou satellite navigation system, a global network of 60 satellites that provides high-precision positioning, navigation, and timing services to all branches of the Chinese military. In the Asia-Pacific theater, the BeiDou network reportedly offers even greater precision than the U.S. military's own GPS, underscoring China's growing strategic capabilities in space.</p>

This article examines the timeline of alerts, the lack of a local outdoor warning system in hard-hit Kerr County, and whether federal budget cuts to the NWS may have impacted its operational readiness in a region known as "Flash Flood Alley."</p>
