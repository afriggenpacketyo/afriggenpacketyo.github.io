            <h2>Trump Administration Exempts Tech Products from New Tariffs</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-12 11:46:29 EDT</div>

            <p>The Trump administration has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronic components from recently imposed reciprocal tariffs, including the 145% levies on Chinese imports. This decision follows concerns from U.S. tech companies about potential price increases on gadgets, as much of their manufacturing occurs in China and other countries. The exemptions, retroactive to April 5th, are a significant win for companies like Apple and Samsung, potentially preventing substantial losses in market value and consumer price hikes. The move also reflects a broader strategy to address trade imbalances while minimizing the impact on American consumers and businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>While the technology sector received a reprieve from Trump's tariffs, many other U.S. industries are facing potential 'irreversible' damage from the 145% tariffs on Chinese imports. Supply chain executives report canceled freight orders and abandoned shipments from China, particularly affecting furniture, toys, apparel, and footwear. Small businesses are especially vulnerable, lacking the resources to absorb the increased costs or find alternative sourcing. The situation is causing significant disruption, reminiscent of the pandemic's impact on supply chains, and raising concerns about widespread product shortages and lost sales.</p>

            <p>Dive teams are continuing their search in the Hudson River for wreckage from a helicopter crash that killed all six people on board, including a Siemens executive and his family. Authorities believe a missing rotor part could be crucial in determining the cause of the crash, which occurred near Jersey City, New Jersey. Preliminary investigations suggest a rotor may have broken off, leading to the uncontrolled descent into the water. The NTSB is investigating the incident and examining the pilot's log books and the helicopter's maintenance records.</p>

            <p>Backed by the U.S., Israel is expanding its military offensive in Gaza, particularly in Rafah and the Morag Corridor, aiming to pressure Hamas for the release of remaining hostages. Israeli officials suggest increased chances of a hostage deal, possibly within two weeks, with coordinated efforts between the U.S. and Israel. The IDF has completed the takeover of the Morag Axis to create a buffer zone and degrade Hamas's operational capabilities.

            <p>The annual bird survey reveals concerning declines in bird populations across the UK, particularly for starlings, which are at their lowest numbers since 1979. Overall, bird populations have decreased by 2% in the UK and 7% in England over the past five years, attributed to climate change, habitat loss, and bird flu. The RSPB suggests simple garden changes, such as leaving grass uncut and avoiding pesticides, to help improve survival rates. The article also touches on the increasing issue of shoplifting, particularly at Greggs, and the potential causes behind this trend.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's tariff strategy is being criticized as an outdated vision that ignores the realities of modern manufacturing and global supply chains. The idea of bringing iPhone manufacturing back to the U.S. is seen as unrealistic due to the lack of skilled labor and the complexity of the phone's supply chain. TSMC's experience setting up a chip fabrication plant in Arizona highlights the challenges and costs associated with reshoring manufacturing, including the need for extensive training and higher production expenses.</p>

            <p>Observers suggest that the escalating tariff war between the U.S. and China could end quickly once negotiations begin, given both sides' openness to dialogue. The recent exchange of escalating duties saw Trump raising levies on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting Beijing to respond with tariffs of 125% on U.S. goods. Trump later paused tariffs higher than 10% for most trading partners, except China. The potential for a swift resolution hinges on the willingness of both nations to engage in meaningful discussions and find common ground.</p>

The remains of caskets were also found during routine site preparation work. The university says the discovery was not unexpected since the site occupies a portion of the former Monument Cemetery. Temple has a protocol in place for when human remains are discovered, including notifying the Philadelphia Coroner's office and law enforcement. Students expressed shock at the discovery.</p>

            <p>Americans are changing their spending habits in response to Trump's tariff policies, with some stocking up on goods, delaying purchases, or cutting back on unnecessary expenses. The uncertainty surrounding tariffs is causing anxiety and prompting consumers to reconsider their spending priorities. Some are seeking to buy goods before prices rise, while others are reducing consumption and focusing on savings. Small business owners are also feeling the impact, with some reporting less demand for their services.</p>

            <p>US support for Ukraine has not slowed the provision of American weapons to Taiwan or Israel, but there are supply chain problems that need “prudent reforms and substantial new investments”, according to a Washington-based think tank. Insufficient spending has damaged the US defense industrial base, and Washington might not be able to sustain the supply of weapons to its partners without a major shift. The Donald Trump administration has pledged a record US$1 trillion in defense spending for next year.</p>

The South has been the desirable place in previous years because it's more affordable on the coast, but insurance costs and property taxes have gone up.</p>

            <p>Alex Garland's film, Warfare, co-directed with Ray Mendoza, offers a gritty and realistic depiction of a military operation from the 2006 Battle of Ramadi during the Iraq War. Unlike typical war movies, Warfare focuses on the tension and waiting that exists during battle, rejecting the typical storytelling structure of action films. The film aims to provide an intimate portrait of one of Mendoza’s personal recollections, challenging viewers to confront the ambiguity and tedium of war without narrative embellishment.</p>

            <p>UK residents visiting the US were down 14.3% in March compared with the same month in 2024, with analysts attributing the decline to Trump's protectionist rhetoric and reports of deportations. Travel industry experts express concerns about a potential larger drop in summer travel bookings. Some travellers from other countries also seemed to avoid the US in March – visitors from western Europe who stayed at least one night in the US were down 17% in March, year on year. The travel industry is worried that the US is becoming less welcoming.</p>

These volunteers are building and training others to use first-person view (FPV) drones equipped with explosives. These drones are used to target enemy vehicles, trenches, personnel, and even tanks. While Ukraine is at the cutting edge of drone innovation, it lags behind Russia in drone production, making the efforts of these volunteer drone makers vital to the war effort.</p>

            <p>Hundreds of flights have been canceled and trains suspended in China as strong winds, with gusts up to 93mph, hit the capital Beijing and northern regions. Millions were urged to stay indoors, and some state media outlets warned that people weighing less than 50kg may be "easily blown away". Parks were shut, trees were reinforced, and residents were advised to avoid non-essential travel. The strong winds are from a cold vortex system over Mongolia and are expected to last through the weekend.</p>

            <p>Davina McCall has revealed that her benign brain tumour "is not coming back" following recent MRI scans, after undergoing surgery in November. The former Big Brother host underwent surgery in November after a colloid cyst was found earlier that month during a health check-up as part of her menopause advocacy work. A benign tumour is not cancerous, but such cysts tend to grow slowly, according to the Brainstrust charity. McCall added she wanted to challenge the assumption many people have that benign brain tumours are not life-threatening, as they can still be.</p>

            <p>The croquet teams from St. John's College and the neighboring U.S. Naval Academy held their annual matchup on Saturday, April 5. The yearly competition between the small liberal arts college lauded for its "great books" curriculum and the famed school for naval officer training began in the early 1980s. The midshipmen exited the building single-file, dressed in pristine white uniforms. The Johnnies, notoriously secretive about their uniforms, made their entrance costumed as the tournament's grass croquet courts, complete with mini wickets, mallets, balls and clips.</p>
