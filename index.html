          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order imposing a new $100,000 annual fee for each H-1B visa, which is granted to skilled foreign workers. The order, intended to curb perceived abuse of the program, has drawn sharp criticism from business leaders and immigration experts who argue it will stifle innovation and drive talent away from the United States. Tech giants like Amazon have been major beneficiaries of the program, and smaller businesses fear they will be priced out entirely, potentially harming American competitiveness in key sectors.

The service in Arizona is expected to draw tens of thousands, with President Trump and Vice President JD Vance among the scheduled speakers. Kirk, the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA, will be posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The assassination has intensified national conversations about political violence, with bipartisan condemnation alongside sharply divided rhetoric about its causes.</p>

Anti-abortion groups are holding "March for Life" rallies in Berlin and Cologne, with counter-protests also planned. Simultaneously, the "Fridays for Future" movement has called for climate rallies in 70 cities to protest the government's energy policies, including plans to build new gas-fired power plants.

          <p>The assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has exposed a deep societal divide, which is being amplified by social media platforms where conflicting narratives about the killer's motives are spreading rapidly. While public figures offer polarized interpretations, an official charging document presents a more complex picture of the suspect as a lone actor with a mix of personal and political motivations. This article analyzes how social media's algorithms and incentive structures reward rapid, often speculative, takes over nuanced information, fragmenting public understanding of major events.</p>

          <p>American critical infrastructure, particularly local water and wastewater treatment facilities, is facing a growing number of severe cyberattacks from foreign actors linked to Iran, Russia, and China. These attacks have already caused system disruptions in states like Pennsylvania and Texas, raising national security alarms about the vulnerability of these often under-resourced systems. In response, a new volunteer initiative called Project Franklin is pairing cybersecurity experts from the DEF CON community with small-town operators to help bolster defenses against these sophisticated threats.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Neuroscientist Tom Bellamy's book explores "limerence," a term for intense romantic infatuation characterized by intrusive thoughts and emotional dependency. The state can be a normal part of early love but becomes problematic when the affection is unreciprocated or uncertain, leading to an addiction-like cycle in the brain's reward system. Bellamy suggests strategies to break free, such as limiting contact with the object of obsession, reframing positive daydreams into negative ones, and focusing on new personal goals to create a sense of purpose outside the infatuation.</p>

This follows similar actions against other prominent female musicians and screenwriters, often initiated after social media campaigns by pro-government voices.

          <p>Following a successful general election, the UK's Liberal Democrat party is grappling with its future strategy at its annual conference. While leader Sir Ed Davey's playful, stunt-focused campaign style garnered significant media attention and helped win seats, polling suggests voters may now view it as making the party look less serious. The party must now decide how to build on its success, whether to continue targeting traditional Conservative voters or expand its focus, and how to articulate a substantive policy platform beyond its current focus on care and patriotism.</p>

          <p>As several key European allies like France and Canada move to recognize Palestine as a state, the German government is maintaining its position not to do so in the short term. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has stated that recognition should be the final step of a comprehensive peace process, a stance critics find unrealistic given the current conflict. Germany's policy is complicated by its historical responsibility for Israel's security, creating a difficult balancing act between supporting its ally and responding to growing domestic and international pressure to take a stronger stance on the Gaza war.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence is being increasingly adopted in workplaces as a tool to combat employee burnout by automating repetitive tasks and managing workloads. However, studies suggest AI can also be part of the problem, with frequent users reporting higher rates of burnout due to the cognitive load of learning new systems and the pressure to take on more work. Experts advise that while AI can be a helpful assistant, companies must manage its implementation carefully to ensure it genuinely lightens employee burdens rather than simply creating capacity for more tasks.</p>

          <p>Many individuals who have achieved significant and rapid weight loss using popular injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro are now facing an unintended consequence: large amounts of loose, excess skin. This outcome has dented the self-confidence of some, who feel their new appearance does not match their expectations. Surgical removal, known as body contouring, is often the only effective solution but is rarely covered by the NHS as it is considered cosmetic. The high cost of private surgery presents a new financial and emotional hurdle for those on their weight-loss journey.</p>

          <h2>Parents Increasingly Opting Out of School WhatsApp Groups Due to Stress and Negativity</h2>

          <p>The ubiquitous school parent WhatsApp group, intended for sharing information, is becoming a source of stress and anxiety for many, prompting some to leave the chats entirely. Parents cite the high volume of notifications, the tendency for discussions to become divisive and negative, and the prevalence of competitive parenting as primary reasons for their departure. While the groups can be useful for logistical coordination, they also contribute to an uneven distribution of school-related administrative tasks, often falling disproportionately on mothers, and can create unnecessary conflict for schools to manage.</p>

          <p>Early in-person voting has commenced in Virginia's gubernatorial election, a key political contest viewed as a bellwether for the Trump administration's policies. The race between Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and Democratic former Rep. Abigail Spanberger is heavily influenced by national issues, particularly the administration's cuts to the federal workforce, which have a significant impact on the state's large number of government employees. Spanberger is positioning herself as a bulwark against these cuts, while Earle-Sears is aligning with the economic record of the state's popular outgoing Republican governor.

          <p>U.S. Northern Command is actively testing and evaluating various counter-drone systems to defend sensitive national security sites from unauthorized incursions. At a recent event at Eglin Air Force Base, dozens of companies demonstrated technologies ranging from acoustic detection systems to interceptor drones that capture hostile craft with nets. The initiative comes in response to a rising number of drone intrusions over U.S. military installations, with officials aiming to establish rapid response teams capable of neutralizing any drone threat across the country within 24 hours.</p>
