          <p>President Trump asserted that the U.S. has "complete and total control of the skies over Iran," a statement that contradicts earlier claims that Israel's offensive was independent. This declaration raises questions about the extent of U.S. involvement in the ongoing conflict, especially considering that the U.S. has been assisting Israel in fending off Iranian counterstrikes. Trump also mentioned that the U.S. knows the whereabouts of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and is considering joining Israel's strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, though there is internal disagreement among his advisors. The White House has not provided further details regarding Trump's comments on Khamenei's location or the U.S.'s role in the conflict. The situation remains tense as the U.S. balances its support for Israel with the desire to avoid direct military entanglement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court is considering the legality of President Trump's decision to deploy California's National Guard in Los Angeles to protect federal immigration authorities during enforcement operations. The legal challenge centers on whether the president exceeded his authority by invoking Title 10, claiming that protests against immigration raids constituted a form of rebellion. California officials argue that Trump's actions undermine the state's sovereignty and the First Amendment rights of protesters, while the Trump administration asserts that courts should not second-guess the president's military judgments. The court's decision will have significant implications for the balance of power between the federal government and states regarding the use of the National Guard.</p>

          <p>New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, a Democratic mayoral candidate, was arrested by ICE agents at federal immigration court while observing proceedings and requesting a judicial warrant in a particular case. According to Lander's office, he was taken into custody while escorting a defendant out of the courtroom. The Department of Homeland Security stated that Lander was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer, claims disputed by Lander's wife, who witnessed the arrest. The incident has sparked outrage and condemnation from fellow politicians and advocates, who view it as an abuse of power and a threat to democracy, particularly given Lander's role as a public official.</p>

This announcement follows Amazon's layoff of over 27,000 employees since 2022, with additional cuts made this year in its North America stores and devices and services units.

Trump denied recent reports of contact with Iranian leaders and reiterated his stance that Iran should have accepted a previous deal to avoid the current conflict. He also dismissed an intelligence assessment suggesting Iran was not actively developing nuclear weapons, asserting that they were close to obtaining one.</p>

Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar spoke with Lee, and he subsequently removed the posts, though he did not offer an apology.

Trump, initially hesitant, has shifted towards supporting Israel's defense and hinted at potential U.S. action, possibly to pressure Iran back to negotiations on its nuclear program. The internal debate reflects broader tensions within the Republican party regarding foreign policy and the use of American military power.</p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have introduced a "no tax on tips" proposal as part of their multitrillion-dollar tax cut package, aiming to fulfill a campaign pledge by President Trump. This measure is similar to a House GOP provision, offering a tax deduction on qualified tips, defined as cash, charged, or shared tips, available from 2025 through 2028 for both employees and independent contractors. However, the Senate version caps the deduction at $25,000 per year and gradually reduces its value for individuals earning over $150,000 ($300,000 for married couples), unlike the House bill, which has no cap and a hard income limit of $160,000. The tax break would only apply to tipped workers in occupations that "customarily and regularly" received tips before December 31, 2024, with the Treasury Secretary tasked with publishing a list of eligible occupations.

          <p>Lawmakers from both parties are working to limit President Trump's authority to order U.S. strikes on Iran without congressional approval, citing the Constitution's provision that only Congress can declare war. Republican Representative Thomas Massie and Democratic Representative Ro Khanna introduced a resolution to block U.S. strikes, while Senator Tim Kaine is leading a similar effort in the Senate. These actions come as tensions between Israel and Iran escalate, prompting concerns that the U.S. could be drawn into a conflict without proper congressional authorization. The resolutions aim to ensure that Congress has a formal role in decisions regarding military action against Iran.</p>

          <p>Lawyers for R. Kelly, the disgraced R&B singer, claim he was hospitalized due to an "overdose" caused by officials at a North Carolina prison, though sources indicate it was for routine medical care. Kelly is currently serving a 30-year prison sentence for racketeering and sex trafficking charges. A court filing by Kelly's attorney alleges mismanagement by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons and claims that Kelly was denied surgery by prison officers. The Bureau of Prisons has declined to comment on the specifics of Kelly's confinement due to privacy and security reasons.</p>

          <p>Many Americans struggle with medical debt due to high healthcare costs, deductibles, and unexpected bills. Effective relief options include negotiating directly with providers, applying for hospital financial assistance or charity care, and utilizing a medical bill advocate to identify errors. Debt consolidation or management programs can help manage medical debt mixed with credit card debt, while debt settlement should be considered a last resort. Starting the process early and exploring available options increases the likelihood of avoiding lasting financial damage.</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly dismissed US intelligence reports stating that Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon, choosing instead to align himself with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's warnings of Iran's imminent nuclear ambitions. This stance isolates Trump's Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, who has maintained the intelligence community's assessment that Iran is not close to a nuclear breakout. The shift in policy comes as the Trump administration appears closer to a strike on Iran, raising concerns about the potential for a new foreign conflict and the influence of hard-line voices within the administration.</p>

The growth in streaming is attributed to free ad-supported streaming TV offerings, the rise of YouTube, and the transformation of traditional media companies into streaming-first entities.
