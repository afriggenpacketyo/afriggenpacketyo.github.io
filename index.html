          <p>The Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba, Israel, sustained significant damage following an Iranian ballistic missile strike, according to the hospital's director. The attack impacted an admission building and a surgical building, causing a fire and demolishing several wards. Although the affected building had been evacuated, 40 people across the hospital were injured. The strike is part of the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran, escalating tensions in the region.

          <p>This article provides a profile of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, amidst escalating tensions with Israel. Following an Iranian missile strike on an Israeli hospital, Israel's Defense Minister vowed to hold Khamenei accountable, even referring to him as a "modern day Hitler." The article details Khamenei's rise to power after the 1979 revolution and his consolidation of authority, marked by suppressing dissent and supporting militant groups. Experts highlight his anti-Israel stance and determination to confront Israel, which contributes to the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. The situation remains volatile, with Khamenei showing no signs of backing down. The optimism score is low due to the portrayal of a leader escalating conflict and suppressing human rights.</p>

Despite recent interest rate adjustments, high-yield savings accounts continue to provide competitive returns, making them suitable for short-term financial goals and emergency funds.

          <p>Retirement professionals highlight common annuity mistakes seniors should avoid, including not understanding fees, choosing the wrong type of annuity, failing to designate a beneficiary, and withdrawing excessive funds.

Seniors should ensure the annuity aligns with their income needs, risk tolerance, and long-term goals. Seeking advice from a qualified financial planner can help seniors make informed decisions about annuities.
