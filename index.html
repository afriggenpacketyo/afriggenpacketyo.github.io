            <p>Donald Trump indicated that Buckingham Palace is planning a second state visit for him in September, following an invitation from King Charles. This would be his second state visit to the UK, with the first one having taken place in 2019 during his first term, hosted by the late Queen Elizabeth II. Palace sources confirm an invitation has been issued, but discussions are still ongoing to finalize a suitable date and venue, likely Windsor Castle due to ongoing renovations at Buckingham Palace. Trump expressed his respect for King Charles and the royal family, noting his mother's Scottish heritage and plans to open a new golf course in Aberdeenshire named after her.</p>

            <p>Millions of people are expected to face travel disruptions over the Easter weekend due to rail engineering works, airport strikes, heavy traffic, and adverse weather conditions. Network Rail is carrying out over 300 engineering projects, including significant work at London Euston, which will be closed from Saturday to Monday. The RAC warns of potential "big jams" on roads, estimating nearly 20 million journeys on Good Friday, with traffic hotspots expected in various locations. Gatwick Airport anticipates strikes by ground handling staff, affecting several airlines, while the Met Office has issued yellow warnings for rain in parts of the UK, potentially leading to difficult driving conditions and transport delays.</p>

            <p>President Trump is focusing on Greenland and Panama to revitalize the Monroe Doctrine, aiming to exclude outside powers, particularly China, from the Western Hemisphere. Trump sees Greenland's strategic Arctic location and Panama's vital canal as key to deterring Chinese influence and securing American interests. The administration is taking steps to secure the Panama Canal amidst concerns about Chinese control, and considering increasing troop presence in Panama. This strategy aligns with historical precedents from WWII and the Cold War, emphasizing the importance of forward bases for national defense and securing vital shipping lanes.

            <p>The Trump administration is significantly reducing the scope of the State Department's annual reports on international human rights, removing critiques of abuses such as harsh prison conditions, government corruption, and restrictions on political participation. The reports will no longer condemn governments for denying freedom of movement, peaceful assembly, or retaining political prisoners without due process. This move signals a potential retreat from America's role as a global human rights watchdog, raising concerns among human rights defenders about the impact on international pressure to uphold fundamental freedoms. The revised reports are expected to be released in May.</p>

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that Trump's tariffs are likely to lead to higher prices, causing Trump to lash out against Powell. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as director of Health and Human Services, is promising to unearth the true cause of autism by September, contradicting the CDC's view that increased diagnoses are due to better diagnostic tools.

            <p>Following the toppling of Bashar al-Assad's regime, Syrians are experiencing unprecedented social freedoms, with open political debates and the return of exiled intellectuals. However, concerns are growing about the future of democracy and the role of Islam in the new regime, with potential restrictions on art and a concentration of power in the hands of the new president, Ahmed al-Sharaa. While there have been some positive appointments, questions remain about judicial independence and the potential for Sharia law to influence the legal system. Despite the newfound freedoms, the future remains uncertain, with tensions and violence in some regions.</p>

He was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2011 for his heroism in Afghanistan, saving the lives of 36 people during an ambush.

            <p>The NHL's current playoff format, introduced in 2014, is facing criticism for creating predictable and repetitive matchups, diminishing the excitement of the postseason. The Los Angeles Kings, for example, will face the Edmonton Oilers for the fourth consecutive year in the first round. Some suggest changing the regular-season points system to incentivize regulation wins and shift the standings, but Commissioner Gary Bettman remains resistant to a rethink. While the format aimed to intensify rivalries, it has instead led to a sense of déjà vu for fans, raising questions about its long-term effectiveness.</p>

            <p>A UCLA international graduate student has been detained at the U.S.-Mexico border by Customs and Border Protection, adding to concerns about visa cancellations. The student's detention comes after the Trump administration canceled over 1,000 visas of foreign students, including some at UCLA. The administration has not given detailed reasons for the visa cancellations, but some attorneys believe they are related to criminal records checks, even for minor infractions. Community members rallied at UCLA in support of the detained student, urging the university to defend its international students.</p>

            <p>China has missed several key targets in its 'Made in China 2025' plan, which aimed to achieve self-sufficiency in technology, according to the European Chamber of Commerce in China. While the country has exceeded targets in autos, it has not reached goals in aerospace, high-end robots, and manufacturing value-added growth. China has attained technological dominance in shipbuilding, high-speed rail, and electric cars. The plan's emphasis on domestic tech development has also increased global worries about security risks and overcapacity in some sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Ancient silk paintings from China's Ming dynasty provide new insights into the domestication of brown rats, suggesting they may have spread globally via Zheng He's treasure ship fleets. The artwork, dating from 1425-1435 AD, depicts domesticated brown rats with coat color variation, predating known records in Japan by over two centuries. Researchers theorize that domesticated brown rats stowed away on Zheng He's ships during the Ming dynasty, contributing to their worldwide distribution. Brown rats are believed to have originated in northern China and Mongolia.</p>
