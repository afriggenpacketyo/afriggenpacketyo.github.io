          <p>China is experiencing a significant coffee boom, with consumption rapidly expanding beyond major cities into the countryside. This trend is fueled by a growing number of rural cafes that leverage unique natural settings to attract social media-savvy customers. While the coffee industry is now valued at $42 billion and expected to continue its double-digit growth, some observers question the long-term sustainability of this influencer-driven business model, as the novelty for consumers may fade quickly. The article highlights the cultural shift as coffee challenges tea's traditional dominance.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is proceeding with votes on a massive domestic policy bill championed by President Trump, which includes significant tax cut extensions and welfare program reductions. Democrats are strongly opposed, citing projected cuts to health insurance for millions and a $3.3 trillion increase in national debt. The legislative process has been contentious, with Democrats employing delay tactics and some Republicans, like the retiring Thom Tillis, expressing opposition over broken promises. The bill's passage in the Senate remains uncertain, requiring near-unanimous Republican support before it returns to the House. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has escalated his opposition to the Trump-backed domestic policy package, suggesting he will support primary challengers against Republicans who vote for it. Citing the bill's $5 trillion increase to the debt ceiling and "insane" spending levels, Musk has called the legislation a "disgusting abomination" and threatened to form a new "America Party" if it passes. His criticism marks a significant break from his previous alliance with Trump, focusing on what he sees as a betrayal of fiscal conservatism by the Republican party.

          <p>Two firefighters were killed and a third was critically wounded in an ambush near Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, after responding to a wildfire that authorities believe was intentionally set to lure them to the location. The suspect, identified as 20-year-old Wess Roley, was later found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound following a large-scale law enforcement response. According to his family, Roley had once aspired to be a firefighter, making the motive for the attack unclear. The incident has been described as a "heinous direct assault" on first responders.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have made moves in the opening of NBA free agency, agreeing to a two-year, $12 million deal with forward Jake LaRavia. This signing came shortly after the team lost a key defensive player, Dorian Finney-Smith, who reportedly agreed to a four-year, $53 million contract with the Houston Rockets. Finney-Smith had been an important contributor for the Lakers, valued for his defensive versatility. LaRavia, a 6-foot-7 wing, brings strong three-point shooting to the team, having shot over 42% from beyond the arc last season.</p>

          <p>The British government has launched a "landmark" review of its parental leave and pay policies, aiming to modernize a system that critics have called outdated and flawed. The review will examine maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave, which have been largely unchanged for decades. Campaigners have praised the move, noting that issues like low take-up of shared leave and unaffordable paternity pay need to be addressed. The current statutory paternity leave is the least generous in Europe, and the system's complexities are seen as a barrier for many working families.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has revealed a massive fraud scheme where North Korean IT workers, using false identities, gained remote employment at over 100 U.S. companies, including some in the Fortune 500. The operation, designed to evade international sanctions, generated millions of dollars to fund North Korea's weapons programs. U.S.-based facilitators allegedly helped by creating front companies and hosting "laptop farms" to enable remote access for the North Korean operatives.

This shift indicates a "story-dominated market" where the potential of an idea is valued highly, often over immediate earnings or Federal Reserve policy considerations.

Parents face challenges such as difficulty booking GP appointments, getting time off work, and a lack of clear reminders about their child's immunization schedule. The decline has led to a resurgence of preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough. The report recommends improving access through NHS apps, expanding vaccination services, and enhancing the role of health visitors to provide better support to families.</p>

Jassy explained that the competitive nature of Amazon's marketplace, with over two million sellers, also helps keep prices down, as some sellers will absorb costs to gain market share.

          <p>Shares of coal miner Core Natural Resources saw a nearly 3% increase after the company provided an update on its Leer South mine in West Virginia. The mine had been shut down for a second time due to "combustion-related activity," but the company reported that its essential longwall mining equipment was largely unaffected. Investors responded positively to the news that Core is maintaining its full-year sales volume forecast for coking coal, a key product. Despite this reassurance, the recurring shutdowns at a major facility suggest ongoing operational challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Millions of households in England, Scotland, and Wales will see their energy bills fall by 7% starting this week under the latest price cap set by the regulator Ofgem. This translates to a reduction of about Â£11 per month for a typical household. However, analysts warn that prices are unlikely to fall much further and remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. Future costs for the winter are uncertain, with geopolitical instability in the Middle East posing a potential risk to wholesale energy prices, which could reverse the current downward trend.</p>

However, significant questions remain about the technological feasibility and immense cost of the system.

          <p>Despite fears of renewed inflation, recent U.S. tariffs have not yet caused a significant spike in consumer prices, according to economic data. Economists attribute this to several short-term mitigation strategies employed by businesses. Many companies engaged in "front-loading" by stocking up on inventory before the tariffs hit, while others are temporarily absorbing the costs. Additionally, some importers are using legal loopholes like foreign trade zones to delay duty payments. Experts warn that these buffers are temporary and price increases could still materialize later if tariffs remain high. (not investment advice)</p>
