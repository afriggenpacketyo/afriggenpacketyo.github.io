          <p>President Trump announced that Ed Martin will not be his nominee for the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia due to a lack of support, expressing disappointment but stating that a new nominee will be announced soon. Martin's past defense of January 6th rioters and inflammatory rhetoric were factors in the waning support, particularly from Republican Senator Thom Tillis. Martin, who served as interim U.S. attorney, faced criticism for firing or demoting attorneys involved in investigating the January 6th attack and for threatening political opponents with criminal investigations. His term as interim attorney is set to expire on May 20th. Optimism score cannot be calculated as this is about a political appointment.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal framework with the U.K., aiming to lower tariffs and provide a political win for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal is the first rolled out in Mr. Trump's second term. While details are still being finalized, the agreement includes increased U.S. access to the U.K. market, particularly for agricultural products, and reduces non-tariff barriers. A 10% tariff on U.K. imports remains, but the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. are subject to that rate, with additional vehicles facing higher rates. The framework is expected to generate $6 billion in revenue for the U.S.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Office for Students (OfS) indicates that over 40% of universities in England are anticipating financial deficits by the summer, prompting course closures and asset sales to cut costs. The primary driver of this financial strain is a decline in international student enrollment, particularly following visa changes in 2024. Universities have become increasingly dependent on international student fees as domestic tuition fees have not kept pace with inflation. The OfS is working with institutions under pressure to ensure student protection plans are in place in case of closure.</p>

          <p>The House passed a bill introduced by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the "Gulf of America," codifying an executive order signed by President Trump. The bill passed with a vote of 211 to 206, facing opposition from Democrats who view it as a waste of taxpayer money. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the name change would cost less than $500,000 over five years to update federal documents and maps. The White House has restricted Associated Press reporters' access over the news organization's decision to use the original name.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new sanctions targeting Iranian oil exports, increasing pressure on Iran as U.S. and Iranian officials prepare for another round of nuclear talks. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control is targeting a "teapot" refinery in China and three port terminal operators for their involvement in purchasing and facilitating the delivery of Iranian oil. These sanctions are part of a broader effort to exert maximum economic pressure on Iran and prevent the regime from generating revenue to further its destabilizing agenda. Vice President JD Vance indicated the U.S. is negotiating toward a "complete cessation" of Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden criticized President Donald Trump's second term, calling it the "worst 100 days any president's ever had" during an appearance on ABC's "The View". Biden took responsibility for Trump's initial victory, citing voter concerns about border security and the cost of living during his administration. He expressed disappointment but not surprise at Vice President Kamala Harris's loss, attributing it to sexism. The Bidens addressed reports of cognitive decline and accusations that Jill Biden was isolating the former president, defending his capabilities and involvement in public life.</p>

While the market reacted positively, analysts caution that headwinds and volatility are expected due to ongoing trade negotiations with other countries. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent noted that the U.S. is currently negotiating deals with 17 trading partners.</p>

Analysts suggest that recent market uncertainty has benefited Bitcoin, as investors question the safe-haven status of the U.S. and seek clarity on trade policy.

          <p>In a society increasingly characterized by loud egos and declining well-being, cultivating a quiet ego offers a countercultural strategy for personal happiness. A quiet ego, as defined by psychologists, involves balancing self-focus with consideration for others, perspective-taking, a growth mindset, and detached awareness. Research indicates that individuals with a quiet ego experience greater happiness, improved mood balance, superior life satisfaction, and a stronger sense of life's meaning. The article suggests practical ways to cultivate quiet ego through self-reflection, questioning conventional wisdom, and adopting virtues like charity, humility, self-awareness, and hope.</p>

The Fed voted to keep its benchmark interest rate steady, citing economic uncertainty created by tariffs and concerns about rising unemployment and inflation.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain, the first since launching his effort to overhaul the global trading system through tariffs. He also suggested a call with China‚Äôs leader Xi Jinping was possible. Trump stated that the agreement with the U.K. will cement the relationship between the two countries for many years to come, and that many other deals are in serious stages of negotiation. The developments come as Trump faces scrutiny over the lack of visible progress in trade talks with China, as the clock ticks on the 90-day pause in his reciprocal tariffs on all countries.</p>

          <p>Since President Trump announced plans for mass deportations and rescinded protections for hospitals and clinics, healthcare facilities have seen a jump in no-shows. Doctors, nurses, and social workers are increasingly concerned that immigrants with serious medical conditions are forgoing care due to fear of apprehension by immigration officials. A KFF survey revealed that 31% of immigrants reported worries about immigration status negatively affecting their health. Healthcare officials warn of potential consequences, including infectious diseases spreading, worsening chronic illnesses, and dangerous birth complications. NYU Langone sent a memo to employees warning them not to try to protect illegal migrants.</p>

Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries information from DNA to create proteins, and mRNA vaccines use this to trigger an immune response by coding for viral proteins. They are being studied for a wide range of diseases, including cancer and genetic disorders. The article clarifies that mRNA vaccines cannot affect a person's DNA and emphasizes that they have been proven safe. Concerns surrounding mRNA vaccines have grown, and some lawmakers want to ban them and the government is cutting funding.</p>

          <p>A pathologist hired by attorneys for condemned inmates claims that an inmate put to death last month in South Carolina's second firing squad execution was conscious and likely in extreme pain for up to a minute after the bullets missed their target and failed to quickly stop his heart. An autopsy photo of Mikal Mahdi's torso showed only two distinct wounds from the three prison employees who volunteered for the firing squad and had live ammunition in the April 11 execution, according to the pathologist's report. Witnesses to the execution heard Mahdi cry out as the shots were fired, groan again some 45 seconds later and let out one last low moan just before he appeared to draw his final breath at about 75 seconds.</p>

Chapter 7 bankruptcy comes closest to offering a full financial reset by eliminating many unsecured debts, but eligibility is income-based. Chapter 13 bankruptcy creates a repayment plan, lasting three to five years, while also discharging eligible unsecured debts at the end of the term. Alternatives to bankruptcy include debt consolidation, debt management, and debt settlement.</p>
