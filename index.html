          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court to overturn a court order that reinstated Department of Education employees who were terminated as part of an effort to dismantle the agency. Officials argue that a U.S. District Judge in Boston lacked the authority to mandate the rehiring of these workers. The mass layoffs affected more than 1,300 employees, reflecting the administration's continued efforts to streamline and reduce the size of the federal government. The legal challenge highlights the ongoing battle between the administration and the judiciary over the scope of executive power and agency restructuring.</p>

          <p>Employers in the U.S. added 139,000 jobs in May, exceeding economists' forecasts and indicating a steady labor market despite economic challenges like tariffs.

Although job growth was slightly weaker compared to previous months, analysts suggest the labor market is holding up, particularly in the health care, leisure, and hospitality sectors. Experts caution that economic headwinds could still impact growth in the coming months, and the Federal Reserve is likely to remain on the sidelines regarding interest rate changes.

          <p>The Freedom of the Press Foundation has enlisted prominent lawyers, including Abbe David Lowell and Norm Eisen, to pressure Paramount Global to abandon settlement efforts with President Trump. The group argues that a settlement would harm the media company's credibility and shareholder value. The lawyers warn that approving a settlement to gain FCC approval for a sale to Skydance Media could violate fiduciary duties and federal anti-bribery statutes. The involvement of high-profile legal figures underscores the gravity of the situation and the potential implications for press freedom.</p>
