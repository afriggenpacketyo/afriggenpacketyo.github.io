          <p>Australia achieved a dominant 176-run victory to complete a series sweep after bowling out the West Indies for just 27 runs, the second-lowest total in Test cricket history. The historic collapse occurred on the third day of the day-night Test in Jamaica, with Australian pace bowler Mitchell Starc taking a remarkable 6-9. Starc's performance included the fastest five-wicket haul in Test history and saw him surpass 400 career Test wickets. The result was a significant disappointment for the West Indies, who had been in a position to win after dismissing Australia for only 121 in their own second innings.</p>

          <p>Following Chelsea's 3-0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the FIFA Club World Cup final, player Cole Palmer expressed confusion about President Donald Trump joining the team on stage during the trophy celebration. Palmer, who was named the tournament's top player, stated he was aware the president would be at the game but was surprised by his appearance on the stand. President Trump attended the match at MetLife Stadium with FIFA President Gianni Infantino, highlighting their strengthening relationship as the U.S. prepares to co-host the 2026 World Cup. The event is anticipated to bring significant economic benefits to host cities across North America.</p>

          <p>A large-scale cannabis operation in California, recently raided by federal immigration agents, is also the subject of an active state investigation into illegal child labor. The California Department of Cannabis Control confirmed it opened a probe into Glass House after receiving a complaint, although a prior site visit in May found no violations. During the federal raid, agents arrested 361 people and reported finding at least 14 migrant children, who were transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services. Glass House has denied ever employing minors, while the Department of Homeland Security stated the children were rescued from potential exploitation and trafficking.</p>

Firefighters arrived to find heavy flames and smoke, rescuing numerous residents over ladders, though five firefighters sustained minor injuries. While the cause is under investigation and not currently considered suspicious, the building's sprinkler system and staffing levels are being scrutinized.

          <p>The UK Home Office has announced it will restart processing asylum claims from Syrian nationals, ending a seven-month pause that began after the fall of the Assad regime. The government has issued new guidance for officials, stating that a breakdown in law and order does not inherently justify a claim and that each case must be assessed individually. This decision, which could lead to enforced returns to Syria, comes after Foreign Secretary David Lammy's recent visit to the country and as other European nations resume processing claims. The move affects over 7,000 Syrians who were left in limbo, unable to work or settle permanently in the UK.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent shift to a tougher policy on Russia, including authorizing new weapons for Ukraine and threatening tariffs, is reportedly driven more by personal frustration than a strategic change. According to White House sources, Trump feels that Vladimir Putin has made him look weak by ignoring his repeated calls to end the war in Ukraine. After months of deferring to Moscow, Trump was reportedly insulted by Putin's defiance and subsequent military escalations, which undermined his belief that he could broker a quick peace deal. This has led to the authorization of significant defensive aid for Ukraine, financed by NATO allies, to bolster Kyiv's capabilities and pressure Moscow.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a 17.09% tariff on most fresh tomatoes imported from Mexico following the breakdown of trade negotiations. The move is intended to protect U.S. tomato farmers from what the Commerce Department calls unfair trade practices and artificially low pricing by Mexican producers. Proponents, like the Florida Tomato Exchange, believe this will help the domestic industry, but opponents, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, warn it will increase consumer prices and could lead to retaliatory actions. This decision aligns with the administration's broader policy of using tariffs to address trade imbalances. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision, handed down on the court's 'shadow docket,' effectively allows the administration to implement an executive order aimed at closing the department by eliminating the staff needed to run its programs. In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued this gives the executive the power to repeal statutes by defunding them, a practice known as impoundment.

In a social media post, Bridgewater confirmed the suspension but stated his commitment to the school, even offering to volunteer from the bleachers if necessary. Last season, Bridgewater led the team to a state championship in his first year as coach before briefly returning to the NFL as a backup for the Detroit Lions.</p>

The grueling 135-mile course runs through California's Death Valley, featuring extreme temperatures and significant elevation changes. Becker finished the race with approximately three hours to spare, successfully settling a "score" after falling just short of the 48-hour cutoff in 2022. His achievement is a testament to his perseverance and the support of his experienced coaching and crew team.</p>

Haskell had pleaded not guilty to dismembering his wife, Mei Haskell, and killing her parents, whose bodies were never found. The case gained notoriety after a dismembered torso was discovered in a dumpster and day laborers reported being hired to dispose of suspicious bags. The district attorney stated that Haskell's death is a "cruel act" that robs the victims' family of the chance to face him in court and achieve justice for his barbaric actions.</p>

The announcement also hinted at forthcoming dietary guidelines that would elevate the status of dairy products, including full-fat options.

The National Park Service has closed the North Rim for the remainder of the season, and officials and visitors are mourning the loss of the beloved National Historic Landmark.</p>

          <p>President Trump has stated he is giving "serious consideration" to stripping comedian Rosie O'Donnell of her U.S. citizenship, citing that she is "not in the best interests of our Great Country." The threat, made on social media, appears to be a response to O'Donnell's long-standing and vocal criticism of the president. This move has been condemned as a brazen attack on free speech, suggesting the president views both speech and citizenship as conditional privileges he can revoke. While the legal basis for such an action against a native-born citizen is virtually nonexistent, the threat itself is seen as an alarming escalation in punishing political opponents.</p>

With costs soaring from $1.9 billion to $2.5 billion, White House officials have criticized the project as overly expensive and ostentatious, adding to their existing frustration with the Fed's interest rate policies. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell defended the project, stating many claims are exaggerated and that cost overruns are due to unforeseen issues and inflation. In response to the criticism, Powell has requested a review of the project by the Fed's inspector general. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The controversy surrounding Jeffrey Epstein has evolved significantly since his 2019 arrest and death, recently causing a major rift within the MAGA movement. A timeline of events shows that after years of speculation, the Trump administration's Department of Justice announced in July 2025 that Epstein did not keep a 'client list' and that no more files would be released. This contradicted expectations fueled by some conservative commentators and even Attorney General Pam Bondi, leading to accusations of a cover-up from within Trump's own base. The resulting turmoil has led to public infighting and a rare moment of widespread criticism against the administration from its own supporters.</p>

          <p>Search and recovery operations for victims of the catastrophic July 4 flash floods in Texas have been intermittently suspended due to new flooding threats. Heavy rains have caused rivers in the hard-hit Hill Country to rise again, creating dangerous conditions for volunteer and official search crews. The initial flooding killed at least 130 people, including dozens of children at a summer camp, and about 160 people remain missing in the region. Authorities are urging extreme caution as the already saturated ground and rising water levels continue to pose a significant risk, particularly around low water crossings.</p>

Researchers analyzing U.S. poison center data found that while these pouches, like the popular brand Zyn, are smoke-free, they contain nicotine that can be highly toxic to children. The study noted that ingestions of these products were more likely to result in serious medical outcomes or hospitalization compared to other nicotine products. Health advocates express concern that the flavored and colorfully packaged pouches are attractive to children, despite being marketed to adult smokers.</p>
