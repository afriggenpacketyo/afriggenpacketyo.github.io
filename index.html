          <p>MasterChef presenter John Torode acknowledged he is the subject of a racist language allegation from 2018 or 2019. The claim was upheld during an inquiry into separate misconduct allegations against his co-host, Gregg Wallace. In a social media post, Torode stated he has no memory of the incident and does not believe it happened, but noted he had apologized at the time it was said to have occurred. This development follows a wider investigation by the show's production company that substantiated 45 allegations concerning Wallace's on-set behavior.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla is defending its Autopilot system in a federal court in Miami in the company's first wrongful death trial. The lawsuit stems from a 2019 crash in Key Largo, Florida, where a Model S using Autopilot struck a parked vehicle, killing a 22-year-old woman and severely injuring her boyfriend. The plaintiffs argue that design defects in the Autopilot system failed to detect the obstacle, causing the fatal accident. Tesla maintains the driver was distracted and responsible for the crash, stating the technology is not self-driving and does not absolve the driver of their duty to remain attentive.</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced he will continue his bid for New York City mayor as an independent candidate in the general election. This decision comes after he was decisively defeated in the Democratic primary by democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani. In his announcement, Cuomo asserted that the primary election had low turnout and that the fight to lead the city is not over. Mamdani, who ran on a platform focused on affordability, expressed confidence in his position and suggested Cuomo is struggling to accept the primary result.</p>

          <p>A 57-year-old farm worker, Jaime Alanís, has died from injuries sustained after falling from a greenhouse roof during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at a California cannabis farm. His family described him as a hardworking and innocent man who was the sole provider for his wife and daughter. The raid, part of the Trump administration's enhanced immigration enforcement, resulted in the arrest of at least 200 workers. The Department of Homeland Security stated Alanís was not being pursued by law enforcement when he fell, but the incident has sparked outrage over the chaotic nature of these operations.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan coalition of 24 states and the District of Columbia has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for freezing over $6 billion in federal education grants. The funds, intended for K-12 schools and adult education programs, were abruptly withheld just weeks before the start of the new school year. State officials argue the freeze creates an impossible financial situation for districts that have already set their budgets and signed contracts. The withheld grants support a wide range of services, including programs for migrant students, English language learners, and professional development for teachers. (not investment advice)</p>

The Dragon Bravo Fire grew rapidly due to strong winds, exhibiting extreme behavior and expanding to over 5,700 acres. Firefighting efforts were complicated when a water treatment facility burned, causing a chlorine gas leak that forced an evacuation of personnel. The loss of the iconic lodge, a central feature for visitors since the 1930s, has been described as a devastating blow to Arizona's history, prompting calls for an investigation into the fire's handling.</p>

In a 6-3 decision, the majority allowed the layoffs to continue while the case is appealed, with the court's liberal justices dissenting sharply.

This marks the first time since the annual count began in 2005 that overall homelessness has fallen for two consecutive years.

          <p>England fast bowler Jofra Archer made a dramatic and successful return to Test cricket, playing a crucial role in his team's victory over India at Lord's. After 1,597 days away from the format due to multiple serious injuries, Archer took five wickets in the match, the most of any England bowler. His performance, which included maintaining high pace throughout the five days, was instrumental in securing the win and answered doubts about his ability to withstand the rigors of red-ball cricket. Archer's comeback was celebrated by fans and teammates, adding a powerful weapon back into England's bowling attack.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is asking a federal appeals court to overturn a judge's order that has barred immigration agents from conducting "roving patrols" across seven counties in Southern California. The Department of Justice argues the injunction inflicts irreparable harm by preventing the executive branch from enforcing immigration laws. The lower court's order was granted after a lawsuit challenged the chaotic and aggressive sweeps, finding that agents were likely violating constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. This legal battle escalates the fierce conflict over the administration's mass deportation policies and tactics.</p>

A combination of high mortgage rates, rising inventory, and falling demand is contributing to the softening prices, particularly in the South and West.
