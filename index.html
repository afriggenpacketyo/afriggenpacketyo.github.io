          <p>Ahead of a high-stakes summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Trump participated in a virtual meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and leaders from several NATO nations. The discussions were organized to ensure European and Ukrainian perspectives are considered, as allies fear being sidelined in peace negotiations that could favor Moscow. Zelenskyy emphasized the need for coordinated pressure on Russia to end the war, stating there are no signs of Russian de-escalation. The article details European concerns that any deal made without their involvement could compromise regional security and Ukrainian sovereignty.</p>

          <p>Following a landmark antitrust ruling that found Google illegally monopolized the search market, the U.S. Department of Justice has proposed forcing the company to sell its Chrome browser. In response, AI startup Perplexity has made an unsolicited offer of $34.5 billion to acquire the web browser. The potential sale of Chrome, which is central to Google's multi-billion dollar advertising business, represents a significant threat to the tech giant's market dominance. This development comes as other major companies like OpenAI and Yahoo have also expressed interest in the asset.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled a shift in Gaza ceasefire negotiations, indicating that efforts are now centered on a single, comprehensive deal to release all remaining hostages. This new approach moves away from the previously discussed plan of a phased release during an initial 60-day truce. While a Hamas delegation is in Cairo for preliminary talks, mediators see a potential window for progress in the coming weeks. However, significant obstacles remain, as Israel demands Hamas relinquish control of Gaza, a condition the group has consistently rejected.</p>

          <p>Scientists in Australia have identified a new species of ancient whale that lived 26 million years ago, describing it as a "deceptively cute" but formidable predator. The discovery was based on a well-preserved skull found on Victoria's Surf Coast, a region known for significant fossil discoveries. Named Janjucetus dullardi after the local who found it, the creature was about the size of a dolphin but possessed sharp, slicing teeth, belonging to a group of prehistoric whales called mammalodontids. This finding provides new insights into the evolution of whales and their adaptation to marine life.</p>

          <p>A new spending law from the Trump administration includes the largest-ever cut to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), a significant safety net for low-income families. This article explores the potential dual impact of these reductions, affecting not only the families who rely on the benefits but also the independent grocery stores that serve them. With reduced spending power for SNAP recipients, local grocers, who have already faced a difficult five years, may experience a significant decline in business. The cuts raise concerns about food security and the economic stability of small businesses in vulnerable communities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities in Juneau, Alaska, have issued urgent evacuation warnings as the city braces for potentially record-breaking floods from the Mendenhall Glacier.

The National Weather Service predicts a new record crest for the Mendenhall River, surpassing severe floods in previous years that damaged hundreds of homes. This annual event, exacerbated by climate change, has prompted the installation of temporary barriers to protect properties as a more permanent solution remains years away.</p>

          <p>A commentary article from The Guardian argues that Israel is systematically killing journalists in Gaza and is no longer attempting to hide its actions, citing the recent killing of six media workers in a tent. The author, from the Committee to Protect Journalists, claims this is part of a long-standing pattern where Israeli forces kill journalists with impunity, often accusing them of terrorism without credible evidence. The piece criticizes the muted response from the international community and journalism organizations, suggesting this inaction enables further attacks on the press.</p>

She also shares her personal relationship with technology, admitting her own fallibility when it comes to apps like TikTok. To escape the real-life dystopian trends, she emphasizes the importance of disconnecting and connecting with nature, or as she puts it, "you gotta touch grass."</p>

          <p>For the first time, researchers have created a comprehensive map of the approximately 8,700 cattle feeding operations in the United States, revealing that California has more feedlots and feedlot acreage than any other state. The study, which also mapped hog farms, provides a crucial database for analyzing the environmental and health impacts of these facilities. Researchers found that these operations are associated with degraded air quality and lower socioeconomic well-being in nearby communities. The data is intended to help local governments and organizations develop more targeted policies for the agricultural sector.</p>

Because the University of California is a public institution, the author contends that this move is an attack on California's state tax dollars. The piece highlights UC's vast economic contributions to the state and its role in educating Californians.

          <p>On the 90th anniversary of its creation, Social Security is facing a significant political crisis, argues columnist Michael Hiltzik. He contends that the Republican party is pursuing a long-term strategy to dismantle the program, citing recent efforts to cut staff and a Treasury Secretary's comment about a "back door for privatizing Social Security." The column asserts that these actions are designed to weaken public trust in the system to pave the way for privatization. Hiltzik concludes that the program's financial challenges are solvable, but the primary threat is a partisan effort to undo this foundational New Deal program.</p>
