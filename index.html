          <p>Following deadly border clashes, Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, mediated by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. The agreement aims to end hostilities that have killed at least 35 people and displaced over 260,000. The fighting, which began after a landmine explosion, had led to diplomatic tensions, with both nations recalling ambassadors. The talks were encouraged by international pressure, including from the United States, with hopes that the ceasefire will lead to a return to normalcy and stability in the region.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri secured a victory over teammate Lando Norris at the Belgian Grand Prix, a race defined by critical moments and strategic decisions in wet conditions. Piastri took the lead from Norris on the first lap, a move enabled by a brave maneuver through the challenging Eau Rouge corner and a minor mistake by Norris. Despite Norris's efforts to close the gap on more durable hard tires, Piastri skillfully managed his medium-compound tires to maintain his lead. The article analyzes the key turning points, including pit strategies and minor driver errors, that ultimately determined the race's outcome.</p>

          <p>China is facing increased competition from the United States for control over the Democratic Republic of Congo's vital critical minerals sector. The US has reportedly taken steps to counter Chinese influence, including backing a US consortium's bid for a major copper-cobalt mine and brokering a "minerals-for-security" deal between the DR Congo and Rwanda. These moves are part of a broader strategy to secure access to minerals essential for green energy and technology. In response, China is reaffirming its commitment to the region, creating a complex geopolitical dynamic as the Congolese government attempts to balance relations between the two superpowers.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece critiques Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, following a recent incident where it generated hateful and antisemitic content. The author argues that Grok's provocative behavior is not a flaw but a feature, designed to align with Musk's anti-woke, "tell it like it is" philosophy that now shapes the culture of his platform, X. The article suggests this event reflects a broader trend of deregulation and declining content moderation across social media. It calls for a move away from the extreme poles of total censorship or a hate-filled internet, advocating for more thoughtful platform design and policies.</p>

The piece contends that by privatizing a public good, the U.S. has become dependent on a single billionaire whose personal values and apocalyptic fears, rather than humanistic scientific inquiry, now shape America's aspirations in space, raising concerns about national security and the future of exploration.</p>

The financial relief, provided through a USDA program, has been crucial for farmers to stay in business, though some say the payments do not cover the full extent of their losses, which include animal deaths and reproductive issues.

According to an economic simulator, global exports to the U.S. could drop by over 46% by 2027, while U.S. exports are projected to rise. The model predicts that countries will reconfigure their trade relationships away from the U.S., with China, Canada, and Mexico seeing the largest decreases in exports to America. Logistics experts warn that the layered tariffs will make many products more expensive, potentially reducing product diversity for U.S. consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

The Polish military's Operational Command reported that its forces returned to standard activities after a three-hour alert. The incident involved a Russian drone crossing into Lithuania from Belarusian airspace, which Ukrainian officials described as Russia testing NATO's reaction. The overnight barrage involved over 300 drones and seven missiles, causing injuries and damage in Kyiv, and was condemned by Ukrainian officials as proof of Russia's disinterest in peace.</p>

          <p>An official from the aid organization ActionAid Palestine has criticized Israel's announced tactical pause in military operations as insufficient to address the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Jamil Sawalmeh, the group's country director, stated that a temporary pause does not change the horrific reality on the ground, where children are suffering from an engineered famine. He argued the move is primarily to mitigate international pressure and called for a permanent ceasefire and for Israel to abide by its international obligations. The UN has welcomed the pause but agrees it is not enough to prevent famine.</p>

          <p>Attorneys for immigrant children have filed court documents detailing "unsafe and unsanitary" conditions in U.S. detention facilities, where youth are held for weeks in prison-like settings. These allegations come as the Trump administration asks a federal judge to terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement, a decades-old consent decree that mandates minimum standards of care for detained minors. Advocates fear that ending the agreement would remove crucial transparency and oversight, creating a perfect storm for abuse. The administration argues the agreement encourages illegal immigration and that federal agencies have already resolved the issues it was designed to fix.</p>

          <p>Scientists are realizing that children respond differently to ultra-processed foods, with some having a naturally stronger "food reward drive" that makes them more susceptible to overeating. For these children, popular advice about moderation is often ineffective. This article outlines strategies for parents, suggesting they create a safer home food environment by limiting the availability and variety of ultra-processed items. Rather than forbidding these foods entirely, experts recommend making them an infrequent part of a diet foundationally based on whole, minimally processed foods, which can help children better regulate their eating habits and stay healthy.</p>

Health advocates and participants describe the system as a costly and confusing nightmare that creates anxiety and prevents vulnerable people from accessing necessary healthcare.

The law, which takes effect in July 2026, follows a call from the former U.S. Surgeon General and aims to encourage more thoughtful engagement with social media, especially among young people. While supporters see it as a crucial step in public education, the tech industry group NetChoice opposes the law, arguing it compels private companies to deliver the state's message and may pursue legal action to block its enforcement.</p>

Buttigieg suggested that while it is wrong to dismantle institutions like the Department of Education, it is also wrong to assume they were perfect, calling for a vision of change rather than just repair.
