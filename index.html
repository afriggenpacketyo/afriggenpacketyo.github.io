          <p>Tesla stock experienced a rebound of over 3% following a significant drop fueled by a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, which resulted in a $152 billion decrease in the company's market capitalization.

Dilly Dally had spent five months at the LMC, recovering from wound complications after the surgery. She joins other rehabilitated loggerheads in returning to the wild, and will be tracked via satellite to monitor her movements and adaptation.

Most cases have been concentrated in Gaines County, home to a Mennonite community with historically low immunization rates. Two unvaccinated children from the affected region have died from the disease, marking the first U.S. measles deaths since 2015.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mark Dybul, who led George W. Bush's PEPFAR program to combat AIDS, expresses concern about its future due to potential funding cuts. President Trump has requested Congress to rescind $8.3 billion in foreign aid, including $400 million for PEPFAR, which could drastically reduce work on HIV and other infectious diseases. Dybul highlights PEPFAR's success in saving lives and building health systems, emphasizing that it was intended to be a temporary program, but cutting funding now could jeopardize the gains made. He recalls a visit to Namibia where PEPFAR's support transformed a dire situation, giving hope to those affected by HIV/AIDS.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to reduce national security and public safety threats posed by drones in the United States. The order establishes a task force to detect and identify drones and crack down on unlawful uses like spying and drug smuggling, prioritizing airspace security for the upcoming FIFA World Cup in 2026 and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028. The order aims to boost U.S. development and commercial use of drones, as well as encourage the development of supersonic jets and electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOLs). Federal response to foreign-made drones and protection of critical infrastructure will be boosted by the order.</p>

This includes utilizing AI-powered humanoid robots for deliveries, which would go directly to customers' doors from Rivian electric vans. The company is testing these robots at a San Francisco "humanoid park" obstacle course. Analysts view humanoid delivery robots as a key driver of market share gains in Amazon's logistics network, projecting potential annual savings of $2 billion to $3 billion by 2030.

With President Trump's push to quadruple nuclear power capacity, Vexler believes there's a need for more domestic enrichment capacity. He argues that competition is essential in the market, where Western enrichment capacity is mainly controlled by European entities.</p>

Flowers points out that job growth is primarily concentrated in health care, leisure, and hospitality, sectors that could be vulnerable to policy changes.

          <p>This New York Times guest essay argues that the Trump administration's actions, including Elon Musk's involvement in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), stem from an anti-managerial political thought. This perspective views a permanent ruling class of unaccountable managers and bureaucrats as having usurped democracy. The essay suggests that much of populist politics is part of an anti-managerial revolution aimed at rolling back bureaucratic control. Understanding this anti-managerialism is essential for grasping the Trump administration's efforts to transform institutions from government to corporations.</p>
