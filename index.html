          <p>Ian Wilkinson, the sole survivor of a deadly mushroom lunch in Australia, testified that he and his wife were happy to be invited to the lunch hosted by Erin Patterson, who is on trial for murder. The meal resulted in the deaths of Wilkinson's wife, Heather, and two other relatives. Wilkinson recounted experiencing severe illness after the meal and being rushed to urgent care after doctors suspected mushroom poisoning, noting that Patterson served the food and ate from a different plate. He described his relationship with Patterson as friendly but not close, adding that she seemed like a normal person to him.</p>

The new government also confronts the surge of the far-right AfD party and questions surrounding American security guarantees. Merz has chosen some cabinet members from the private sector, an unusual move, and the Social Democrats have selected younger, lesser-known politicians for their ministries.

          <p>Friedrich Merz is set to become Germany's new chancellor, facing significant challenges including a stagnant economy, strained relations with the United States, and the rise of a nationalist party. Despite lacking executive government experience, Merz has taken aggressive steps to address these issues, such as criticizing President Trump and relaxing fiscal restraint policies to invest in national defense. However, his shifting stances have alienated some conservative voters, and he begins his term with low approval ratings. Despite criticisms, supporters view Merz as an agile politician capable of delivering on growth, defense, and immigration.</p>

          <p>China's largest trade fair, the Canton Fair, experienced unexpected growth in deals signed during its spring edition, driven by a record high in overseas attendance. Despite the absence of most American buyers, the fair's overall transaction volume rose by 3% year-on-year, with a significant portion of visitors from countries involved in China's Belt and Road Initiative. This performance has boosted confidence in China's export sector and its ability to cope with a prolonged trade war with the US.

          <p>Bangladesh's garment industry, a crucial economic driver for the country, faces potential disruption from proposed US tariffs. The country, which relies heavily on garment exports, particularly to the United States, is already grappling with economic instability following recent political upheaval. A 37% tariff, though currently paused, and a broader 10% tariff could significantly impact the industry's competitiveness and the livelihoods of millions of workers. Despite improvements in factory conditions and sustainability, the tariffs pose a major challenge to Bangladesh's economic growth and stability.</p>

          <p>President Trump has closed a loophole that allowed cheap goods from China to enter the United States without tariffs, potentially slowing the flow of shipments from e-commerce companies and impacting delivery services like UPS, FedEx, and DHL. The de minimis exemption, which allowed goods worth $800 or less to be imported without tariffs, has been eliminated for imports from mainland China and Hong Kong. This change could lead to a decline in revenue for logistics companies and airlines, though some companies are attempting to mitigate the impact by shifting sales to other regions. Temu, a major e-commerce company, has already shifted to using locally based sellers in the US.</p>

The funding is intended to address the "08:00 scramble" for same-day appointments and improve patient satisfaction, which has declined since the pandemic due to fewer in-person consultations.

He also questioned why Newark was not included in a recent bonus offered to air traffic controllers, despite experiencing significant operational disruptions. United Airlines is cutting flights at Newark due to the problems, and the FAA has instituted a "flow constrained area" to manage traffic.</p>

The proposal aims to retain film and television production in the United States, particularly in California, which has lost business to states and countries offering incentives. The tax credit would be modeled after California's existing program and seeks to counter the potential negative impacts of tariffs on the industry. The industry has been seeking help, just not necessarily this kind.</p>

          <p>Three people died and at least seven are missing after a small boat capsized off the coast of San Diego, California. At least 16 people, including two children, were on board the panga-style fishing boat when it overturned near Torrey Pines State Beach. The US Coast Guard is treating the incident as a suspected human smuggling operation. Four people were taken to the hospital, and it remains uncertain if any other victims are in the water.</p>

The Knicks capitalized on their momentum in the fourth quarter and overtime to secure the victory. Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown each had 23 points for the Celtics, but their poor shooting from beyond the arc proved costly.</p>
