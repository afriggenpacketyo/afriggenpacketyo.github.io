            <p>United States stocks closed lower on Tuesday, reversing an earlier rally due to renewed worries about President Trump's tariffs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.8%, while the Nasdaq dropped 2.1%, and the S&P 500 declined by 1.5%, nearing bear market territory. This downturn follows Trump's tariff announcement last week, causing significant market turbulence, although Asian and European markets showed some recovery earlier in the day. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed an additional 50% tariff on China, bringing the total to 104%. (not investment advice)</p>

Sampson acknowledged that Sharp should have shot-faked and driven to the paint, emphasizing the importance of getting a shot on the net in such situations, despite the defensive pressure from Florida.

He has previously stated that tariffs are essentially a tax on goods, paid by consumers, and has warned of their potential to aggravate inflation and disrupt international trade.

            <p>President Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson are pushing for the passage of a budget resolution that is crucial for extending Trump's tax cuts, despite opposition from some House Republicans who believe it doesn't cut enough spending. The House must adopt the Senate-passed resolution to advance the president's agenda, but nearly a dozen House Republicans have expressed opposition or serious concerns about the $1.5 trillion gap between the House and Senate versions. The resolution is the first step in the reconciliation process, allowing Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate.</p>

The judgment, which includes $364 million in disgorgement for "ill-gotten gains" and $100 million in interest, stems from a case where Trump, his sons, and a former executive were found to have inflated property valuations to cheat banks and insurers. The interest continues to build at a rate of over $114,000 per day, and while the case is under appeal, the debt continues to grow.</p>

The turquoise alert system, named after a sacred stone, will function similarly to Amber or Silver Alerts, sending notifications to cellphones when law enforcement is notified of a missing Native American. Other states like California, Washington, and Colorado have implemented similar alert systems.</p>

            <p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) revealed that a February hack of its email systems was a "major incident" that compromised "highly sensitive information." The breach involved data related to the financial condition of federally regulated financial institutions used in examinations and supervisory oversight processes. The OCC, which regulates and supervises national banks, is conducting a full review of the incident with external cybersecurity experts and is reviewing its IT security policies to prevent future attacks. Hackers had access to over 150,000 emails for several months. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Over fifty years ago, the existence of government records on magnetic tape brought down a president. In 1971 the secret service installed Sony open-reel tape recorders throughout the White House, to guarantee that Richard Nixon’s presidency would be “the best chronicled” in American history. Three years later the Supreme Court unanimously agreed that the tapes of 42 conversations had to be handed over to Congress, after Nixon himself had refused. His failure to co-operate was one part of the articles of impeachment prepared against him. The contents of one tape, the so-called “smoking gun”, showing Nixon’s attempt to cover-up the Watergate scandal, led to his resignation.</p>

            <p>A reverse mortgage can help boost the income of homeowners aged 62 and above. In today's shifting economic climate, marked by persistent inflation, high rates and other challenges, many Americans are seeking additional income sources to alleviate the financial pressures they're facing. For senior homeowners, one viable option is a reverse mortgage, which is a unique type of mortgage that allows individuals aged 62 or older to convert a portion of their home equity into cash. The most common type of reverse mortgage is the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), which is insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). (not investment advice)</p>

Three healthy dire wolf puppies were created by modifying cells from a living gray wolf and implanting the embryos into a surrogate domestic dog. Critics argue that the resulting animals may only superficially resemble the extinct species and may not be able to fulfill the same ecological role. The company is also working on de-extincting the woolly mammoth and has created mice with woolly hair.</p>

However, he faced skepticism from GOP lawmakers on the Senate Finance Committee who sought clarity on the broader strategy. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that Trump directed his trade team to create "tailor-made trade deals" with countries seeking tariff cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The UK government is contemplating nationalizing British Steel due to growing fears that the company's blast furnaces in Scunthorpe could run out of raw materials soon. Chancellor Rachel Reeves has reassured workers that nationalization is an option if necessary, emphasizing the steel industry's strategic importance. British Steel, owned by Chinese company Jingye since 2020, has claimed significant financial losses and has rejected a government offer of £500m to partly fund a switch to electric arc furnaces. Negotiations are at a critical point as the potential lack of raw materials threatens the site's viability.</p>
