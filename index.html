          <h2>Trump Proposes Using Tariff Revenue for Citizen Rebate Checks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 14:25:58 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is considering a proposal to issue rebate checks to Americans, funded by new tariff revenues. The idea is being explored as a way to return money to taxpayers, possibly targeting certain income levels, while also aiming to pay down the national debt. The article provides context on the significant tariff revenue collected and notes that such a plan would require new legislation from Congress to authorize the Treasury Department to issue the payments. It also mentions previous rebate checks issued during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>This article explores whether homeowners can close on a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) in under two weeks. While the typical process takes two to six weeks due to necessary verification steps like appraisals and underwriting, faster closings are possible. The article advises that success depends on the lender's efficiency, the borrower's preparedness with documentation, and the possibility of an appraisal waiver. It provides actionable tips for homeowners looking to speed up the process, such as getting prequalified and choosing a lender known for quick turnarounds.</p>

          <p>Intel's stock price dropped by 9% following an announcement that the company is cutting costs and may discontinue its chip foundry business if it fails to secure a major customer. Despite beating quarterly earnings estimates, investor concerns mounted over the struggling manufacturing division, which has been unable to attract significant external clients. CEO Lip-Bu Tan acknowledged the company had "invested too much, too soon," leading to underutilized factories and an $800 million impairment charge. The move adds uncertainty to Intel's future product roadmap and its competition with rivals like Nvidia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump addressed his past association with Jeffrey Epstein, deflecting questions by pointing to others like Bill Clinton who also socialized with the deceased sex offender. When asked about a potential pardon for Epstein's convicted accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, Trump stated it was something he had not thought about but acknowledged he had the authority to do it. The comments came as Maxwell was meeting with the Department of Justice for a second day, where her lawyer confirmed she was answering all questions truthfully and had not been offered any deal for clemency.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced a temporary suspension of its officials' participation in all think tank events, a significant departure from its long-standing practice of engaging with the civilian national security community. A spokesperson stated the move aims to prevent the Department of Defense from lending credibility to organizations that promote "globalism" and are perceived as opposing the current administration's values. The decision follows the Pentagon's withdrawal from the Aspen Security Forum and indicates that future event participation will undergo a thorough vetting process to ensure alignment with the administration's agenda.</p>

          <p>A new series on the Britbox streaming service, titled "Outrageous," explores the dramatic and often controversial lives of the six famous Mitford sisters. These British aristocrats became notable figures in the 20th century for their divergent political affiliations, which ranged from communism to fascism, and their high-profile social lives. The article references a 1989 NPR interview with Jessica Mitford, one of the sisters, where she discussed her communist beliefs and her well-known book about the funeral industry.

          <p>This article investigates why in-flight Wi-Fi service remains unreliable despite two decades of availability and promises of improvement. The core issue is not the Wi-Fi itself but the back-end connection to the internet, which relies on either slower air-to-ground technology or better but not universally adopted satellite systems. Airlines are slowly upgrading their fleets, prioritizing larger jets on long-haul routes, leaving many regional and short-haul planes with subpar service. While airlines now see reliable internet as a competitive necessity rather than a luxury, a full, consistent rollout is still projected to be years away.</p>

The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) system uses a five-phase scale, with famine (Phase 5) requiring three conditions to be met: at least 20% of households face extreme food shortages, 30% of children suffer acute malnutrition, and the daily death rate from non-trauma causes exceeds two per 10,000 adults. Experts note that collecting reliable data in conflict zones is a major challenge, meaning people are often already dying of starvation before a formal declaration is made.</p>

The family, including four children, was on a charter flight to Baghdad when a court ruled to suspend their deportation, but the decision was not communicated in time. The case has drawn criticism due to the 2014 genocide against the Yazidi minority by the "Islamic State," making their return to Iraq particularly perilous.

For the second, which involves a brother-in-law making jokes about eating disorders in front of children, the advice is to confront the bully directly and set firm boundaries, prioritizing the well-being of oneself and one's children over maintaining family peace at all costs.</p>

The report, which compares median home prices to median incomes, labels markets with a price-to-income ratio of nine or higher as "impossibly unaffordable." San Jose, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, and Honolulu are the U.S. cities on the list, which is topped by Hong Kong. The study attributes these high prices to land-use policies that restrict growth, forcing many potential homebuyers into prolonged renting and making it difficult to save for a down payment.

          <p>A five-day strike by resident doctors in England over a pay dispute is causing significant disruptions to the National Health Service (NHS), leading to the cancellation of numerous operations and appointments. Patients are sharing stories of frustration and anxiety, with some fearing their conditions, including cancer, will worsen due to the delays. One man whose kidney cancer surgery was postponed described the delay as a potential "death sentence." While the government insists disruption will be minimal, the walkout is expected to have a major impact, echoing previous strikes that led to over a million cancellations.</p>

          <p>A cross-party group of 220 British MPs has signed a letter urging Prime Minister Keir Starmer to formally recognize the state of Palestine. The letter argues that UK recognition would send a powerful message of support for the Palestinian people's rights and is a vital step toward a two-state solution. The move increases pressure on the government, especially after France recently committed to recognizing Palestinian statehood. In response, Starmer stated that recognition must be part of a broader, practical plan that leads to a lasting peace and security for both Israelis and Palestinians.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the SHARE Act, has been introduced in Congress to incentivize public companies to distribute stock to their rank-and-file workers. The legislation would offer a 3-percentage-point corporate tax rate discount to large companies that grant at least 5% of their stock to the lowest-paid 80% of their employees. Proponents argue the bill could transfer nearly $4 trillion in stock value to millions of middle-class Americans, expanding ownership and potentially increasing employee loyalty. The goal is to allow more workers to share in the financial success of the companies they help build. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has announced that single adult male asylum seekers who refuse to relocate from hotels to other designated accommodations will face eviction and could become homeless. The new "Failure to Travel" guidance is intended to create consequences for those who do not comply with transfers, which the government says are necessary to end the costly use of hotels for asylum housing. The policy has been introduced amid pressure to reduce the hotel population and follows a series of demonstrations near a hotel housing asylum seekers. Critics suggest focusing on processing claims and allowing asylum seekers to work would be more effective solutions.</p>

          <p>This article provides a consumer warning about the potential pitfalls of 0% APR balance transfer credit cards. While these cards can be a useful tool for paying down high-interest debt, failing to clear the balance before the promotional period ends can have costly consequences. The regular, often high, interest rate will apply to the remaining balance, and some cards may even charge deferred interest retroactively from the transfer date. To avoid these outcomes, the article advises creating a strict payoff plan, avoiding new purchases on the card, and considering other debt relief options if the balance is unmanageable.</p>

The coroner noted "shortcomings" in his care, including the fact that Thorpe had not been seen in person by mental health professionals for over four months before he died.

Trump's comments follow his administration's allegations that Obama committed a "treasonous conspiracy" to undermine the 2016 election, a claim based on declassified documents that intelligence experts say do not alter the conclusion of Russian interference. Obama's office has dismissed the accusations as a "weak attempt at distraction" from other issues facing the Trump administration.
