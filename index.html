          <p>President Trump has extended the deadline for a decision on imposing 50% tariffs on goods from the European Union to July 9th. This decision came after a request from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for more time to negotiate a trade deal. Trump had previously expressed frustration with the EU, suggesting a 50% tariff rate due to stalled negotiations. Von der Leyen stated that the EU is prepared to advance talks quickly to reach a favorable agreement, emphasizing the importance of the EU-US trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the perceived 'silence' from the United States following recent Russian attacks emboldens President Vladimir Putin. This statement comes after Russia launched a significant aerial assault involving 367 drones and missiles, resulting in numerous casualties, including children. Zelensky argues that stronger international pressure is necessary to halt Russia's aggression, while Trump acknowledged being unhappy with Putin's actions but did not elaborate on a specific response. The Ukrainian President believes that further sanctions are needed to weaken Russia's war efforts and promote ceasefire discussions.</p>

          <p>A New York sportscaster made a subtle jab at Caitlin Clark after a controversial no-foul call during the Indiana Fever's loss to the New York Liberty. With seconds remaining, Natasha Cloud stole the ball from Clark without a foul being called, leading to mixed reactions. The sportscaster suggested Clark exaggerated the contact, saying Cloud got "all ball." Fever coach Stephanie White criticized the officiating, calling one non-call "egregious," highlighting the need for consistency in officiating. The coach stated she felt the officiating was disrespectful and the system for voicing concerns is not working.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa has lodged a formal complaint with the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) following a controversial incident during their match against Manchester United.

Match of the Day pundits and Villa's captain John McGinn have criticized the decision, labeling it an error that significantly impacts Villa's Champions League qualification chances. The referee's decision prevented the Video Assistant Referee from reviewing the play, further fueling the controversy.</p>

          <p>Five years after George Floyd's murder sparked widespread Black Lives Matter protests, a backlash has taken hold, marked by a shift in political discourse and policy. While the initial protests led to widespread support for racial justice, there has been a retrenchment, with President Trump championing what some consider 'white grievance'. Despite initial support, public opinion on the Black Lives Matter movement has declined, and efforts to address racial inequality have faced resistance. However, some changes, such as police body cameras and data collection on police brutality, have persisted, and activists continue to advocate for racial justice.</p>

Lischinsky, an Israeli Embassy research assistant, and his partner, Sarah Milgrim, were killed by a gunman who shouted 'Free, free Palestine!' during the attack. The U.S. authorities are investigating the incident as a hate crime and a crime of terrorism. The service blended religious traditions, and Foreign Minister Gideon Saar attended the ceremony, delivering a eulogy for Lischinsky, whom he described as a committed patriot.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has been accused of monetizing the presidency to an unprecedented degree, with profits far outweighing public outcry. The Trump family has collected significant fees from various ventures, including a new cryptocurrency, overseas real estate deals, and an exclusive club in Washington. The acceptance of a luxury jet from Qatar for the president's use has also raised ethical concerns. While Democrats have criticized these activities, they have struggled to gain traction due to the normalization of such practices and the lack of official investigations.</p>
