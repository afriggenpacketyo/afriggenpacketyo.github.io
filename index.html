          <p>The killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk prompted reactions from numerous political figures, including former presidents Joe Biden and Barack Obama, who condemned the violence. The article also highlights Kirk's past statements as a gun rights advocate, where he argued that some gun deaths were a worthwhile cost for protecting the Second Amendment. This context adds a layer of complexity to the aftermath of his death by firearm. The event is placed alongside other recent acts of political violence.</p>

          <p>South Africa's cricket team secured a 14-run victory over England in the first T20 match of their series, which was significantly affected by rain in Cardiff. The game was initially reduced to nine overs per side, with South Africa setting a strong pace before another rain delay. England's revised target was 69 runs in just five overs, a challenging chase that ultimately fell short despite a quick 25 runs from Jos Buttler. The series will continue at Old Trafford, where more rain is anticipated.</p>

          <p>China showcased its new JL-1 nuclear-capable air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) during a recent military parade in Beijing. According to state media, the missile has a range of up to 8,000 kilometers and possesses hypersonic speed and terminal maneuverability, making it difficult to intercept. The JL-1 is designed to be carried by a modified H-6N strategic bomber, which can be refueled mid-air, significantly extending its operational reach and bolstering China's airborne nuclear deterrent capabilities.</p>

This decline in shipping volume is affecting major product categories like furniture and electronics, leading ocean carriers to announce blank sailings and raising concerns about a broader economic cooling effect.

          <p>An Israeli airstrike in Doha, Qatar, targeted Hamas leaders, killing six people and drawing condemnation from Qatar, which labeled it an act of "state terrorism." The attack has stunned the U.S.-allied Gulf nation, which hosts both Hamas's political office and a major American military base. The strike jeopardizes ongoing Gaza ceasefire negotiations, for which Qatar has been a key mediator. U.S. President Trump expressed that he was "very unhappy" with the unilateral Israeli action, which he was not notified of in advance.</p>

          <p>Oracle shares experienced their best day since 1992, soaring nearly 36% after the company reported an astounding backlog of performance obligations driven by demand for its cloud and AI infrastructure. The surge added $244 billion to the company's market capitalization, briefly making founder Larry Ellison the world's richest person. This historic gain came despite the company narrowly missing quarterly revenue and earnings expectations, as investors focused on the massive future growth projected in its cloud business.

The sample, taken from an ancient river valley in the Jezero Crater, contains mineral patterns and textures that on Earth are often byproducts of microbial life. While nonbiological explanations cannot be ruled out, researchers are excited by the finding and emphasize the need to bring the sample back to Earth for definitive analysis.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has launched a petition against FIFA's use of dynamic pricing for the 2026 World Cup, calling the practice an "affront to the game" that prioritizes profit over fans. Mamdani argues that the pricing model will make it impossible for many ordinary fans to attend matches, potentially harming the atmosphere of the tournament. His petition calls for an end to dynamic pricing, the reservation of 15% of tickets for local residents, and a cap on resale prices on FIFA's official platform.</p>

          <p>The recent raid by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at a Hyundai electric-car plant in rural Georgia is being framed as a significant strategic error for the Trump administration. The operation, which was the largest worksite raid in Homeland Security's history, detained 475 foreign workers, mostly South Korean nationals with visa issues. This action occurred in a Republican-supporting area and targeted a major foreign investment, creating friction with a key ally and contradicting the administration's usual focus on Democratic-led sanctuary cities.</p>

          <p>This opinion article examines the recent controversy surrounding a social media post by the Holocaust Museum LA that used the phrase "Never again. For anyone." The author argues that the fierce backlash, which accused the museum of diluting Jewish suffering, reflects a broader shift away from a universalist interpretation of Holocaust memory. The piece traces the varied historical uses of the slogan, from anti-fascist prisoners to Zionist nationalists, concluding that its meaning has become contested, with some now wielding it to defend Israeli state actions and reject solidarity with other groups.</p>

The disaster, which killed 241 of the 242 people on board and 19 on the ground, has prompted the airline to conduct a "significant safety pause" to review all procedures. While the investigation is ongoing, a preliminary report indicated confusion in the cockpit led to the fuel being cut off shortly after takeoff.</p>
