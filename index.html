          <p>President Donald Trump acknowledged that Americans might experience some economic strain due to the ongoing trade war with China, suggesting they may need to make do with fewer goods. Trump argued that China relies heavily on the U.S. market and would ultimately suffer more from the trade dispute. He insisted that many goods imported from China are unnecessary for Americans and emphasized the need for a fair trade deal. Trump stated that Americans might have two dolls instead of thirty, and those two dolls might cost a couple of bucks more.</p>

This move comes as other logistics providers are pulling back from serving rural customers due to high costs, according to Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide operations, Udit Madan.

          <p>This article details how the Trump administration used a wartime law to expedite immigrant deportations, focusing on the deportation of Venezuelans to a high-security prison in El Salvador. The article reveals that El Salvador's president, Nayib Bukele, sought assurances that the deportees were indeed gang members. It also outlines how Trump aides identified the Alien Enemies Act as a means to bypass due process in deportations.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court appears divided over whether Oklahoma can use public funds to support a Catholic charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, which integrates Catholic teachings into its curriculum. The case raises questions about the First Amendment's stance on government establishment of religion versus the protection of religious freedom. Republican appointees on the court seemed sympathetic to the school, while Democratic appointees expressed concerns. The outcome could affect laws in 46 other states that authorize charter schools and potentially blur the lines between government support for private and religious schools.</p>

          <p>Despite campaign promises to cut spending, President Trump's administration has spent over $200 billion more in the first 100 days compared to the same period last year. This increase is attributed to rising costs in areas like military spending, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and debt payments. While the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has focused on smaller targets like foreign aid, the largest areas of spending remain largely untouched. The administration claims to have saved $160 billion through DOGE, but independent analyses suggest the actual savings are lower, representing a small fraction of the national debt.</p>

          <p>This article from La Times Espanol discusses how a recent agreement between the IRS and ICE is causing fear among immigrants, particularly those who have been paying taxes using ITIN numbers. The agreement allows ICE to access tax data of up to five million people, many of whom are undocumented immigrants. Legal challenges have been filed to block the agreement, arguing it violates federal law and decades of privacy protections. The Trump administration has also implemented a policy requiring immigrants over 14 to register with USCIS, raising concerns about mass deportations.</p>

These factors include the federal funds rate, the prime rate, loan-to-value ratio, credit score, and miscellaneous economic data. The article advises borrowers to shop around and secure rate offers from at least three different lenders to determine which is truly offering the lowest HELOC rate. It also advises that taking risks with a home equity borrowing product, which uses your home as collateral, is generally worth avoiding. This is not investment advice.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's election victory as Canada's prime minister comes with the challenge of governing a divided nation, particularly with a generational divide in voting patterns. Young voters, concerned about housing affordability and the cost of living, coalesced around the Conservatives, while older voters supported the Liberals. The Liberals managed to gain more than a dozen seats in a historic comeback election, but the Conservatives also made significant gains, enough to block the Liberals from forming a decisive majority government.</p>

Reshoring manufacturing can help make the drug supply chain more robust, decreasing the risk of disruptions. However, it could elevate production costs and drug prices, raising affordability concerns. Meanwhile, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said uncertainty around pharmaceutical tariffs is deterring the company from further investing in U.S. manufacturing and research and development.</p>
