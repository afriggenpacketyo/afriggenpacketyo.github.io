          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has arrived in Beijing by train to attend a military parade commemorating the 80th anniversary of Japan's surrender in World War II. He joins Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, signaling a strengthening alliance between the three nations. This gathering occurs amidst Western concerns that Pyongyang and Beijing are providing crucial military and economic support for Moscow's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The meeting underscores a deepening strategic alignment in opposition to Western-led global initiatives.</p>

          <p>Despite a 13% decrease in drug misuse deaths in 2024, Scotland continues to have the highest fatality rate in Europe for the seventh consecutive year, with 1,017 deaths recorded. Experts attribute the long-standing crisis to deep-rooted socioeconomic issues, including deindustrialization and poverty, which have fueled addiction for decades. While the recent drop is welcomed, officials express concern over the emergence of potent synthetic opioids like nitazenes, fearing they could reverse this progress. The crisis is compounded by historical cuts to addiction services and the prevalence of so-called "deaths of despair."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rights group in Indonesia, KontraS, reports that at least 20 people are missing following widespread protests across the country. The demonstrations were initially sparked by a government decision to increase perks for lawmakers, which critics noted were excessively high compared to the minimum wage. The unrest escalated after footage emerged of paramilitary officers running over a delivery driver, leading to at least eight deaths and over 1,200 arrests. President Prabowo Subianto has since canceled a trip to China and announced the revocation of the controversial lawmaker benefits.</p>

          <p>The Northern Lights were visible across various parts of the UK, from Scotland to Kent, following a significant solar storm. The phenomenon, caused by a coronal mass ejection from the Sun, created vibrant auroral displays as solar energy interacted with the Earth's atmosphere. Space weather forecasters predict the heightened solar activity could continue, potentially reaching a G4 "Severe" storm level. This would increase the chances for the aurora to be seen across the entire country, even with the naked eye, before activity is expected to return to normal.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region closed with mixed results as investors processed developments from the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit and ongoing uncertainty regarding U.S. tariffs. Sentiment was influenced by President Trump's comments about India potentially reducing tariffs to zero, which he described as a late offer. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a slight increase, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and mainland China's CSI 300 both declined.

          <p>In a series of policy memos requested by the French and German governments, economists have advised the European Union to accept defeat in the solar panel manufacturing sector. French economist Jean Pisani-Ferry, a co-author of the recommendations, stated that China's industry is now so far ahead that reviving a competitive European solar industry is no longer feasible. He argued that since solar panels do not create the same kind of ongoing energy dependence as resources like natural gas, ceding this market is not a significant strategic loss.

This trade friction coincides with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attendance at the SCO summit, where he met with Russian and Chinese leaders.

          <h2>Tesla's Initial Orders in India Fall Short of Expectations</h2>

          <p>Since its launch in mid-July, Tesla has reportedly received just over 600 orders in India, a figure that is below the company's internal expectations. The electric vehicle maker now plans to ship a modest 350 to 500 cars to the country this year, with the first batch arriving from Shanghai in early September. Tesla launched its Model Y at a price of about $70,000, which includes India's high import tariffs on EVs. The lower-than-anticipated demand highlights the challenges Tesla faces in the price-sensitive Indian market, where EV infrastructure is still developing and overall EV adoption remains low.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of former Premier League players, including Danny Murphy and Brian Deane, claim they lost tens of millions of pounds due to poor advice from financial firm Kingsbridge Asset Management. The players were encouraged to invest in high-risk, unregulated film financing and property schemes in the 1990s and 2000s, which ultimately failed. Now, despite being told by police they were "victims of crime," they face huge tax bills from HMRC, with some having been made bankrupt and losing their homes. The campaign group, V11, is seeking to change the law to protect victims of financial crime from these severe tax consequences.</p>

          <h2>British Pubs Face Widespread Closures in 2025 Due to Rising Costs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) predicts that one pub is set to close every day in 2025 across Great Britain, totaling 378 closures for the year. This decline is attributed to a combination of rising operational costs—including increased minimum wage, National Insurance, and business rates—and reduced consumer spending. Pub managers have been forced to pass some costs onto customers, pushing the average price of a pint over £5. Industry leaders are urging the government to provide support by cutting business rates and VAT in the upcoming budget to prevent further damage to a vital UK sector.</p>

          <p>Belgium's Foreign Minister has announced that the country will officially recognize an independent Palestinian state at the upcoming UN General Assembly. The move will be accompanied by "tough sanctions" on the Israeli government, which the minister stated is intended to pressure Israel to respect international law, not to punish its people. The announcement comes as Israeli strikes in Gaza City reportedly killed 13 people ahead of a planned offensive. Belgium joins several other nations, including Australia, Canada, and France, that have declared their intention to recognize Palestinian statehood.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sport of pickleball is experiencing a surge in popularity in China, with online sales of related equipment increasing more than six-fold compared to the previous year. This trend reflects a broader shift towards active lifestyles in the country, boosted by social media influencers and a renewed interest in racquet sports. Unlike in the U.S., where the sport grew in public spaces, pickleball's rise in China is driven by for-profit businesses building courts in urban areas. The rapid growth presents significant opportunities for both local entrepreneurs and international brands looking to tap into this new consumer trend.</p>

          <p>Utah has embarked on a goal to build 35,000 affordable starter homes in five years to address a severe housing shortage that has pushed homeownership out of reach for many young people. The state has offered low-interest construction loans to incentivize developers, but progress has been slow, with only about 5,100 homes built or started so far. Housing experts argue that more significant zoning reforms, such as allowing smaller lot sizes, are needed to truly move the needle. Despite the challenges, some developers are creating new homes priced under $400,000 for first-time buyers, though demand continues to far outpace supply.</p>

          <p>Legendary NFL coach Bill Belichick's first game as head coach for the University of North Carolina's football team resulted in a lopsided 48-14 home loss to TCU.

However, TCU dominated the rest of the game, scoring 41 unanswered points and capitalizing on UNC's turnovers, including a pick-six and a fumble returned for a touchdown.

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a Democrat from New York and the longest-serving New Yorker in the House, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026. Citing a "necessity for generational change in the party," the 78-year-old congressman said his decision was influenced by the need for younger leadership to confront the political challenges posed by Donald Trump. First elected in 1992, Nadler had a prominent career, chairing the House Judiciary Committee and serving as a manager during Trump's first impeachment. His retirement opens up a key seat in a district he has represented for over three decades.</p>
