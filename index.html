          <p>President Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and leaders from NATO nations are convening for virtual meetings in advance of the scheduled summit between Mr. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. European and Ukrainian leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, are actively working to ensure their perspectives are heard, as they express concerns about being sidelined from the high-stakes discussions. Zelenskyy has firmly stated that any peace talks concerning Ukraine must include their direct participation, categorically rejecting any proposals for territorial concessions. The White House describes the upcoming summit as a "listening exercise" for President Trump, aimed at gaining a clearer understanding of how to potentially bring the four-year conflict to an end, amidst European fears of unfavorable concessions.</p>

          <p>Four years after the collapse of property giant China Evergrande Group, millions of Chinese homebuyers remain trapped in the crisis, many living in unfinished or "barely liveable" properties despite having prepaid for them. The US$300 billion debt crisis triggered by Evergrande's downfall halted construction on housing projects nationwide, leaving families in severe financial distress. Rebecca Wei's experience in Luoyang exemplifies this widespread issue, with her apartment delivered as little more than a shell, lacking basic utilities and fire safety compliance. This ongoing situation underscores the profound and lasting impact of the property market's instability on ordinary citizens and the challenges in resolving the widespread housing predicament.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine highlights severe, often overlooked, health risks posed by climate change, particularly for women and children globally. Extreme heat, malnutrition from crop failures, and air pollution from fossil fuels are linked to higher rates of preterm birth, stillbirths, infant and maternal death, and increased child mortality, especially in impoverished regions. The article details how rising temperatures exacerbate conditions like preeclampsia and how wildfire smoke contributes to low birth weight. Urgent climate adaptation plans are needed, integrating maternal and child health considerations and sustained aid from developed countries to mitigate these multiplying dangers, as the crisis is already unfolding.</p>

          <p>For the first time since the 1920s, Paris's Seine River has officially reopened for public swimming, fulfilling a long-standing promise that was finally realized with the recent Olympic Games. Designated swimming areas with newly built docks, such as one near the Eiffel Tower, are now attracting both Parisians and tourists eager to cool off amidst successive heat waves. The extensive cleanup efforts, including the construction of massive overflow tanks to manage sewage during heavy rains, have made this historic return to river bathing possible. This development allows the city to embrace a tradition once depicted in Impressionist paintings, offering a picturesque and refreshing urban escape for residents and visitors alike.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House is tempering expectations for President Trump's upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, describing it primarily as a "listening exercise" rather than a deal-making event. White House Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt stated that the meeting aims for President Trump to gain a better understanding of how to end the Ukraine conflict, noting that only one party to the war will be present. Concerns are rising in Kyiv and among European allies that Trump might push for peace at the cost of territorial concessions, a notion Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly rejected. Analysts suggest the premise of "land swapping" has further diminished hopes for a successful outcome, with the White House reeling back expectations in the days leading up to the meeting.</p>

          <p>China has announced it will cease all engagement with Czech President Petr Pavel, strongly deploring and opposing his recent birthday visit to the Dalai Lama in India. Beijing lodged serious protests, asserting that Pavel's "provocative action" severely violated its "one-China political commitment." This meeting marks the first time a sitting Czech president has met the Dalai Lama during his stay in India, escalating diplomatic tensions between the two nations. The Chinese embassy in the Czech Republic had previously expressed resolute opposition, urging adherence to the one-China policy to maintain healthy and stable bilateral relations, indicating a significant diplomatic fallout from the encounter.</p>

          <p>France, the U.K., and Germany, known as the E3, have informed the United Nations of their readiness to trigger "snapback sanctions" on Iran if it fails to re-enter nuclear talks by the end of August 2025. These sanctions, built into the 2015 nuclear deal (JCPOA), allow for the automatic reimposition of UN penalties if Iran significantly breaches the agreement. The threat follows escalating tensions and Iran's uranium enrichment reaching 60% purity, far beyond the deal's limits, and comes after recent bombings of Iranian nuclear facilities. Tehran insists its program is for civilian purposes but has not accepted terms to abandon enrichment, making a diplomatic solution increasingly urgent. (not investment advice)</p>

Human rights groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, along with former State Department officials, have widely criticized the report itself.

          <p>UK police forces will now be encouraged to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects charged in high-profile and sensitive investigations under new guidance from the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC).

Policing Minister Dame Diana Johnson welcomed the move, stating the government expects police to release these details in "most cases." The change follows incidents where a lack of information allowed false narratives to spread, contributing to public unrest.

Conversely, the Justice Department argues the deployment was legal, aimed at protecting federal property and personnel, asserting no violation occurred. The ongoing trial explores whether Trump's declaration of the protests as a "rebellion" justified the use of Title 10, with the judge repeatedly questioning the extent of presidential discretion in such matters and the existence of a "constitutional exception" to the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals 13 Child Deaths from Window Falls in UK Rented Accommodation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by the NHS-funded National Child Mortality Database (NCMD) reveals that 13 children under 11 have died from falls out of windows in rented or temporary accommodation in England since 2019. The authors stress these deaths are "entirely preventable," urging landlords to prioritize fixing faulty windows and ensuring appropriate locks or restrictors are in place. This alarming finding is supported by a housing watchdog's report, which likens window safety defects in social housing to widespread issues like damp and mould. Families express terror over "unsafe" windows, while a Manchester consultant notes an unusually high number of child window fall injuries recently, prompting calls for updated regulations requiring child-resistant restrictors in all rented homes.</p>

          <p>South Korea's former first lady, Kim Keon Hee, has been arrested as investigators seek to charge her with various suspected crimes, including bribery, stock manipulation, and meddling in candidate selection. Her arrest warrant was granted due to the risk of evidence destruction. This marks a historic moment, as she and her husband, former President Yoon Suk Yeol, are the first ex-presidential couple to be jailed simultaneously over criminal allegations. The investigation into Kim is one of three sweeping special prosecutor probes launched under Seoul's new liberal government, targeting Yoon's presidency, including his martial law decree and an alleged cover-up in a marine's drowning death, highlighting a turbulent period in South Korean politics.</p>

          <p>The New York Liberty defeated the Los Angeles Sparks 105-97 in a high-scoring WNBA battle, overshadowed by a significant injury to Sparks sophomore star Cameron Brink. Brink exited the game just before halftime with a tweaked left ankle and did not return, raising concerns for the team's future games. Despite strong performances from Dearica Hamby and Azurá Stevens, who combined for 38 points, the Sparks struggled defensively against the Liberty's efficient offense, led by veteran Emma Meesseman. The game also saw visible frustration from Sparks coach Lynne Roberts towards the officials, adding to the team's tough night and contributing to their overall defeat.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and international universities reveals that multinational enterprises (MNEs) were responsible for 25% of all company emissions in China over the past two decades. Published in Nature Communications, the research highlights MNEs as a significant yet often overlooked factor in global carbon inequality. The study also found that economic benefits from these foreign firms primarily accrued to China's eastern coastal regions, while central and western inland areas bore heavier environmental pressures. This raises new issues for scientific assessments of carbon emission responsibilities for foreign-owned enterprises, suggesting a need for re-evaluation of environmental impact accountability.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump Tariffs Shatter Switzerland's Long-Standing Isolation and Complacency</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 00:00:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's imposition of 39% tariffs on Swiss exports has shattered Switzerland's long-held sense of "splendid isolation" and economic complacency. The US is Switzerland's largest export market, and the tariffs threaten to "annihilate" sales, causing a major identity crisis for the export-dependent nation. The article highlights Switzerland's history of neutrality and low defense spending, benefiting from the free world without sharing its burdens, a "have your cake and eat it" policy that no longer works. This unexpected move has left the Swiss establishment "clueless" on how to respond, forcing a re-evaluation of its foreign policy and potentially its relationship with the EU, as Brussels now gets a better trade deal than Berne.

          <p>Mexico has extradited 26 high-ranking cartel figures to the United States, marking the latest major deal with the Trump administration aimed at dismantling criminal networks. Among those transferred are Abigael González Valencia, a leader of "Los Cuinis" allied with CJNG, and Servando Gómez Martinez, also known as "La Tuta," a notorious former head of the Knights Templar cartel. This is the second such transfer in months, occurring as the U.S. ratchets up pressure on drug smuggling and designates cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. The move signals increased cooperation between the two governments, with the U.S. agreeing not to seek the death penalty for the extradited individuals, reinforcing efforts against cross-border crime.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the high-profile Massachusetts retrial concerning the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe. She was, however, convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol and sentenced to one year probation. The defense argued Read was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement and others present at the scene, while prosecutors maintained she hit O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die. The complex case involved extensive testimony, conflicting evidence regarding a Google search and vehicle damage, and a previous hung jury, culminating in a verdict that has drawn strong reactions from both sides, including calls for police accountability.</p>
