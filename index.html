          <h2>AI Startup Perplexity Makes Unsolicited $34.5 Billion Offer for Google's Chrome Browser</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AI startup Perplexity has made a surprising $34.5 billion bid to acquire Google's Chrome, the world's most popular web browser. In a letter to Google's parent company, Alphabet, Perplexity argued that moving Chrome to an independent operator would enhance user safety and choice. The offer comes as Google faces intense antitrust scrutiny, with a federal judge potentially ordering a breakup of its search business. However, industry investors have dismissed the bid as a "stunt," noting the offer is significantly below Chrome's estimated value and that it is unclear if Google has any intention of selling the browser.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The meeting follows Trump's efforts to broker a ceasefire, including setting a deadline for Russia to agree or face more sanctions. The location in Alaska, once Russian territory, holds historical significance and will be hosted at a major U.S. military base. While the White House has framed the summit as a "listening exercise," discussions may involve controversial proposals, such as territorial swaps, which Ukraine has firmly rejected.</p>

          <p>U.S. National Guard troops and federal agents have been deployed on the streets of Washington D.C. after President Trump assumed control of the city's police force to address what he termed "out of control" violent crime. The deployment involves approximately 800 Guard troops and 500 federal agents, with armored vehicles seen near government buildings. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has criticized the move as an "authoritarian push," while acknowledging the shared goal of reducing crime. The action coincides with a manhunt for a homicide suspect and ongoing debates over the city's actual crime statistics.</p>

          <p>South Korea's former first lady, Kim Keon Hee, has been arrested on multiple charges including stock fraud, bribery, and influence peddling, making her the first in the nation's history to face such action. The allegations involve accepting luxury items, such as a valuable pendant and designer bags, as bribes in exchange for political influence. Prosecutors sought her arrest over concerns she might destroy evidence related to the investigation. This development follows the impeachment of her husband, former president Yoon Suk Yeol, who is also facing trial for attempting to impose martial law.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has mandated that the Trump administration reinstate hundreds of National Science Foundation (NSF) research grants for UCLA that were abruptly frozen. The ruling stated the administration's suspension of the funds, which affected over a third of a $584 million freeze, violated a previous court order. The government had justified the cuts by citing allegations of discrimination and antisemitism at the university. This case represents the first legal challenge to the mass grant suspensions, with the judge determining that the indefinite suspensions were effectively terminations and ordering the administration to report on its compliance.</p>

One detainee, a DACA beneficiary since he was a child, was arrested during a traffic stop and sent to the facility. This occurs as ICE detentions reached a record high, with data showing nearly half of those detained lack a criminal record. An ICE official maintained that all detainees committed a crime by entering the country illegally, a statement which conflates a civil violation with a criminal offense.</p>

          <p>A new annual report from the Trump administration's State Department has asserted that the human rights situation in the United Kingdom has "worsened" over the past year. The document specifically cites concerns over restrictions on freedom of expression, particularly political speech deemed "hateful" or "offensive," and threats of antisemitic violence. It points to the government's response to the 2024 Southport attacks and the implementation of buffer zones around abortion clinics as examples of chilling free speech. A UK government spokesperson responded by stating the country is proud to uphold freedoms while ensuring citizen safety.</p>

The policy targets a range of purchases, including smaller transactions and larger ones for cars and education.

Cancers affecting the pancreas, oesophagus, stomach, and lungs still have 10-year survival rates below 20%. In contrast, survival for melanoma and breast cancer has risen dramatically due to advances in early detection and targeted treatments. Researchers and cancer charities are calling for a new government strategy to focus on cutting wait times, improving early detection, and investing in research for these harder-to-treat cancers.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has officially acknowledged that France used "repressive violence" in Cameroon during the African nation's fight for independence in the 1950s. In a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, Macron accepted France's role and responsibility for events that cost "tens of thousands of lives." This admission follows a 2022 report commissioned by France which detailed how the French army used forced displacement, internment camps, and brutal militias to suppress the independence movement. The acknowledgment is part of a broader, though often contested, effort by Macron for France to confront its colonial history.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders have publicly appealed to President Trump to defend their security interests during his upcoming summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. With European nations excluded from the direct talks, there is widespread anxiety that a deal could be struck at Ukraine's expense, potentially involving territorial concessions. The leaders issued a statement emphasizing that a lasting peace must respect Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. This appeal highlights European fears that if Russia succeeds in Ukraine, Putin may set his sights on other European countries next, making the summit's outcome critical for the continent's stability.</p>

          <p>Health experts are warning of an increased risk from Vibrio vulnificus, a "flesh-eating" bacteria, as rising ocean temperatures allow it to thrive in more coastal areas. The bacteria, which enters the body through open wounds or consumption of raw seafood, can be deadly, killing one in five infected individuals. Cases are now being reported further north in the U.S., including the Carolinas and even Connecticut. Florida has reported five deaths this year. Microbiologists note that hurricane season heightens the danger, and they urge people to be aware of the symptoms for early treatment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market rallied significantly, with major indices approaching record highs, following the release of a new inflation report. Data for July showed consumer prices rose 2.7% from a year earlier, which was slightly below economists' expectations and fueled hopes for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. This positive data increased traders' bets on a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, which would lower borrowing costs and stimulate the economy. The report provides the Fed with more flexibility as it navigates its goals of managing inflation while maintaining a healthy job market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California peach farmers are facing a difficult harvest, with some yields down by 30%, due to warmer winter weather disrupting the trees' necessary dormant cycle. Stone fruit trees require a certain number of "chill hours" below 45 degrees to properly regulate nutrients for the growing season, a process that was interrupted by inconsistent temperatures. This climate-driven impact is affecting farmers' livelihoods and is beginning to be felt by consumers, who are paying more per pound for peaches. One family farm has found that its older groves have proven more resilient to the temperature swings.</p>

The order follows a lawsuit filed on behalf of detained migrants who described overcrowded, filthy rooms with open toilets, a lack of hygiene products, and inedible food. The judge mandated specific capacity limits, regular cleanings, and the provision of sleeping mats and soap. In his ruling, the judge cited a "very serious threat of continuing irreparable injury" and expressed a lack of confidence that conditions would not backslide without an enforceable order.</p>

This marks the second major transfer this year and comes as the White House continues to pressure Mexico to intensify its crackdown on drug trafficking. The extradited individuals are wanted for violent offenses and organized crime. The move demonstrates ongoing, albeit tense, collaboration between the two countries on security issues, particularly the fight against fentanyl smuggling, with Mexico stipulating that none of the prisoners would be eligible for the death penalty.</p>

          <p>Residents in parts of Juneau, Alaska, are being urged to evacuate as a "glacial outburst" flood from the Mendenhall River threatens the area. The flooding occurs when an ice dam on the Mendenhall Glacier collapses, releasing a massive volume of water from a glacial lake. This phenomenon, exacerbated by climate change, has caused significant damage in recent years, destroying homes and infrastructure. Authorities have installed miles of emergency flood barriers but are advising evacuation as a precaution, with the river expected to crest at potentially record-breaking levels.
