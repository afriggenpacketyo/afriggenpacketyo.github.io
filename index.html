          <p>A 42-year-old Michigan man, Bradford James Gille, faces terrorism and assault charges for a knife attack at a Traverse City Walmart that injured 11 people. Gille, who has a history of mental illness, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The terrorism charge was applied due to the attack's broad impact on the community's sense of safety. Authorities, assisted by the FBI, are still investigating the motive, while all victims are expected to survive their injuries.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase claims that fintech data aggregators like Plaid are "massively taxing" its systems with excessive and unnecessary data requests, or API calls. According to an internal memo, only 13% of 1.89 billion requests in June were customer-initiated, with the rest used for purposes like product improvement or data harvesting. The bank, citing rising infrastructure costs and increased fraud risks linked to these transactions, is preparing to charge new fees for data access, a move that could significantly impact the fintech industry.

          <p>The University of California system offered admission to its largest-ever class of California first-year students for fall 2025, increasing the in-state admission rate to 77%. Despite financial pressures and a slight dip in total applicants, the data shows continued growth in racial diversity, with Latinos remaining the largest admitted group for the sixth year. The university also increased offers to international and out-of-state students to offset potential enrollment declines due to higher tuition and changing federal policies.</p>

          <p>The 4% rule is a well-known retirement guideline suggesting that withdrawing 4% of a portfolio annually, adjusted for inflation, will likely make savings last 30 years. When applied to annuities, this rule serves as a benchmark to compare the guaranteed income stream of an annuity against traditional portfolio withdrawals. While an annuity might offer a higher initial payout rate and protection against outliving savings, it often lacks inflation adjustments and flexibility. The article suggests that combining both strategies can offer a balance of security and growth for retirees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal, President Donald Trump's legal team has asked a federal court to order a swift deposition of media mogul Rupert Murdoch. The request cites Murdoch's advanced age of 94 and "recent significant health scares" as reasons he may be unavailable for trial. Trump is suing the Journal, owned by Murdoch's News Corp, for $10 billion over an article about an allegedly fake letter celebrating sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's birthday, which Trump claims he never wrote.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has issued a nationwide injunction, ordering the Trump administration to continue providing Medicaid reimbursements to all Planned Parenthood clinics. The ruling blocks a provision in a recent tax bill that aimed to cut off the organization from the federal insurance program for low-income people. In her decision, Judge Indira Talwani stated that restricting the clinics' ability to provide healthcare would likely lead to adverse health consequences, such as an increase in unintended pregnancies and untreated STIs.</p>

The author contends that the label "human animals" used by an Israeli official was a justification for the subsequent destruction of Gaza's society and the engineered famine. The article describes how the desperate struggle for survival, including facing death to get food, erodes the sense of self and humanity among Gazans.</p>

In a rambling response to a question, Trump detailed the "opulent and beautiful" renovations at his property, causing apparent discomfort for Starmer.

The two-year POINTER study involved over 2,100 sedentary people in their 60s and 70s. Those who followed an intensive regimen of aerobic exercise, a Mediterranean diet, and cognitive training showed improved mental function equivalent to being one to two years younger. The results suggest that lifestyle interventions can alter the trajectory of age-related cognitive decline.</p>
