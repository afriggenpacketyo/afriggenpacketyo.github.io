        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A security guard was shot and injured during a struggle in the emergency room of Evanston Hospital, a suburb north of Chicago. The incident began when a Crisis Alternative Response Evanston (C.A.R.E.) team approached a man experiencing a mental health issue near a Taco Bell. The man agreed to be taken to the hospital, but he became agitated during the intake process, leading to a confrontation with hospital staff. Security intervened, and during the ensuing struggle, the man lunged for his belongings, revealing a weapon, resulting in shots fired and a security officer being wounded; the man was taken into custody. The emergency room was temporarily placed on lockdown, and authorities are grateful for the quick response of hospital personnel. The Optimism score for this article is moderately low due to the violence in a place of healing. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, preventing the enforcement of a ban that would stop Harvard University from accepting international students. Judge Allison Burroughs, based in Massachusetts, stated that Harvard would face "immediate and irreparable injury" if the ban were implemented. This order is in response to a lawsuit filed by Harvard, accusing President Trump of a "government vendetta" aimed at suppressing free speech. Trump has claimed the ban is necessary for national security, alleging Harvard hasn't done enough to combat antisemitism on campus. The order provides temporary relief to Harvard and its international students amid ongoing legal battles. </p>

          <p>Karen Read, on trial for the murder of her boyfriend John O'Keefe, denied noticing a confrontation between O'Keefe and ATF Agent Brian Higgins in a bar hours before O'Keefe's death. Read's lawyers played video footage that appeared to show O'Keefe and Higgins gesturing aggressively at one another, but Read told reporters she wasn't paying attention to the interaction. Read stated that she was primarily conversing with a witness, Karina Kolokithas, during that time. The defense is attempting to suggest that Higgins may have been involved in a fight with O'Keefe prior to his death, as Read's defense team has been inviting witness testimony to illustrate other potential causes for his injuries, including a potential fight with Higgins, who was not charged with a crime but was carrying on a flirtatious relationship with Read behind O'Keefe's back. </p>

          <p>North Korea has successfully raised a capsized 5,000-ton naval destroyer, which was damaged during a failed launch in May, according to state media. Leader Kim Jong Un has set a deadline for the ship's repairs to be completed this month, viewing it as a crucial asset. An investigation was launched into the failed launch, resulting in the arrest of four officials, and the cause of the damage remains unclear to outside observers. The destroyer is Pyongyang's second known destroyer, purportedly capable of carrying nuclear missiles, and South Korean intelligence suggests it may have been developed with Russian assistance. The recovery of the ship shows the country's determination to maintain its naval capabilities. </p>

          <p>The Ukrainian Air Force has reported ballistic missile attacks on Kyiv, with air defense measures activated in the capital. Mayor Vitaly Klitschko reported injuries and urged residents to seek shelter, while officials indicated that Russian drones are entering the city. Metro tracks between two stations in Kyiv were damaged, and the Ukrainian Air Force reported cruise missiles heading towards other regions of Ukraine. The escalation of attacks comes as U.S.-brokered peace talks between Ukraine and Russia have failed to progress, and there is evidence that Russia is preparing to retaliate for drone strikes against Russian military sites. </p>

          <p>Japanese startup ispace Inc. has announced that it failed again to become the country's first private company to achieve a successful lunar landing. The Tokyo-based company believes its lunar lander, Resilience, impacted the Moon's surface after failing to slow sufficiently during its descent. This marks the company's second unsuccessful attempt, following a previous failure in 2023. Despite the setback, ispace aims to quickly catch up with U.S. companies that have already achieved this feat, as Resilience was transporting a rover and equipment for experiments. </p>

          <p>More retailers and food brands are offering items with fewer ingredients, prompted by concerns around ultra-processed food (UPF). This trend is driven by consumer demand for simpler, more recognizable ingredient lists, as highlighted by Matthew Hopkins, founder of IND!E. However, some nutritionists, like Dr. Laura Wyness, express concern that focusing solely on ingredient lists may lead to the omission of fortified nutrients. Dr. Jibin He suggests that simplifying formulas and using new processing technologies can help create less processed products while maintaining food safety and extending shelf life.

          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders are often denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention, unlike adults who receive credit for time served. This means that the time kids spend in detention often doesn't count toward any incarceration they may face at the conclusion of their court case. In about two dozen states, there's no such thing as time credit in juvenile delinquency cases, adding months to the duration that kids are confined away from their families.
