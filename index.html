          <h2>Japan's Bond Market Signals Concerns Over Potential Capital Outflows and Market Instability</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's bond market is sparking concerns about capital flight from the U.S. and a carry trade unwind as long-dated yields reach near record highs. Analysts suggest that rising Japanese government bond yields could prompt Japanese investors to repatriate funds from the U.S., potentially triggering global financial market instability. A carry trade unwinding, exacerbated by the Bank of Japan's scaling back of bond purchases, could further destabilize U.S. financial assets as higher yields strengthen the yen, impacting domestic appetite to invest abroad. Michael Gayed warns that this scenario, coupled with the U.S. administration's goal to lower bond yields and weaken the dollar, could lead to a repeat of last August's market turbulence (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Super Heavy booster and Starship rocket exploded during its ninth test flight, marking the third consecutive setback for the company. The un-crewed mission experienced a first-stage booster explosion and a major fuel leak in the second-stage Starship spacecraft, leading to it spinning out of control and blowing up during reentry. Despite the setback, Elon Musk affirmed that SpaceX would increase its Starship launch cadence to approximately one launch every three to four weeks, following recent FAA approval to increase launch frequency. Musk noted that the Starship made it to the scheduled ship engine cutoff, representing an improvement over the last flight, and that there was no significant loss of heat shield tiles during ascent.</p>

          <p>A record number of puffins, 43,626, have been recorded on Skomer Island off the Pembrokeshire coast, marking a conservation success story amidst declining global populations. Skomer's isolation protects the birds from predators and human impact, contributing to their thriving population, with conservationists attributing the success to an abundance of food and the absence of predators. The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales conducts annual seabird counts to monitor the population, despite the fact that puffins are listed as vulnerable to extinction on the global IUCN Red List due to pollution, food shortages, and climate change.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Elon Musk's role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is 'continuing and permanent,' despite the White House's attempts to characterize it as temporary. A lawsuit filed by 14 states alleges that Musk's sweeping cuts and changes to the federal government are unconstitutional because he is not a Senate-confirmed officer. Judge Tanya Chutkan decided that President Trump could be dismissed as a defendant but allowed the case to move forward, citing that the states made a credible argument that Musk occupies a continuing position and exercises significant authority without proper appointment by Congress.</p>

The police use a 'soft' approach, contrasting with typical drug raids, to minimize disruption and trauma to families and neighbors while executing search warrants. Offenders are almost always male and come from all walks of life, including teachers, lawyers and police officers. The unit conducts around 700 child sexual abuse investigations annually, safeguarding between 600 and 800 children, with investigations prioritized based on the risk to children.</p>

Canadian officials, including Prime Minister Mark Carney, have repeatedly stated that the country is not for sale, and King Charles III gave a speech emphasizing Canada's ability to thrive independently. Trump announced that the U.S. had selected the architecture for the $175 billion missile defense system, which he said would include Canada, and that the system is expected to be fully operational within three years.</p>

The law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually across various industries, accounting for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. The trading system will allot maximum emission allowances, with companies needing to purchase carbon credits for emissions exceeding their threshold, creating an incentive for emissions reduction. While designed to lower emissions, companies may pass on decarbonization costs to consumers through price increases.</p>

          <p>A military simulation in Oklahoma, organized by MilSim West, has transformed into a re-enactment of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, drawing in participants who emulate the war's sights and sounds without the trauma. The event, dubbed 'Fall of Salsk,' involves two teams, NATO and Russian forces, battling with plastic pellet guns in a dystopian world where George W. Bush is in his sixth term. While the organizers claim the simulations are purely fantasy, many participants use the real-world conflict as a reference point for uniforms and equipment, with some even purchasing gear from military surplus stores that source directly from Ukraine's battlefields.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration attempts to negotiate a nuclear deal with Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been threatening to disrupt the talks by striking Iranâ€™s main nuclear enrichment facilities. This disagreement over the best approach to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon has led to tension between President Trump and Netanyahu. Israeli officials fear that Trump's eagerness for a deal may result in allowing Iran to maintain its uranium enrichment facilities, while Netanyahu insists that only dismantling all of Iran's nuclear infrastructure constitutes a 'good deal'. Israeli officials have signaled their preparation to attack Iranian nuclear sites, even without American assistance.</p>

          <p>A British think tank, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), has warned that a Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army (PLA) attack on Taiwan is 'unlikely in the near future' but 'not impossible' due to potential miscommunication with the US under President Donald Trump. The IISS report highlights strained US-China relations characterized by 'deep mutual distrust and a lack of dialogue mechanisms'. Despite tactical improvements during the previous Biden administration, the report cautions that these are unlikely to 'significantly alter the strategic direction of the two great powers' during Trumpâ€™s second term.</p>

          <p>Accusations have emerged that Viktor Orban's government in Hungary is using a recent espionage row with Ukraine to undermine his main political rival, the opposition Tisza party. The spat involves arrests, diplomatic expulsions, and public accusations, with Ukraine's SBU security service claiming to have uncovered a Hungarian espionage network. Orban, seen as Russia's closest ally in the EU, has been critical of Ukraine's EU membership and has maintained trade relations with Russia.

          <p>New security rules in India requiring CCTV camera manufacturers to submit hardware, software, and source code for government assessment have sparked clashes between global makers of surveillance gear and Indian regulators. The policy, driven by India's alarm about China's surveillance capabilities, has led to warnings of supply disruptions and added to regulatory disputes. Manufacturers like Hikvision, Xiaomi, and Dahua must now undergo testing by Indian government labs before selling their products, but industry representatives claim insufficient testing capacity and government scrutiny of sensitive source code are causing delays. The policy applies to all internet-connected CCTV models made or imported since April 9.</p>
