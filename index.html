          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia at 15, is set to be canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known for his technological skills, Acutis created websites to document miracles, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." The Vatican has attributed two miracles to him, a necessary step for sainthood, fast-tracking his canonization in an effort to inspire faith among young people. A shrine containing a strand of his hair has been established at the London church where he was baptized, drawing an increasing number of pilgrims.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Men's National Team suffered a concerning 2-0 defeat to South Korea in a friendly match, continuing a string of disappointing results just months before hosting the World Cup. The experimental, MLS-heavy roster struggled with defensive communication and failed to capitalize on scoring opportunities against a sharp South Korean side. Both goals highlighted disjointedness in the American defense, with LAFC's Son Heung-min playing a key role for the visitors. The loss underscores the team's ongoing slump and the urgent need for improvement as the global tournament approaches.</p>

          <p>With Dame Anna Wintour stepping down as editor-in-chief of US Vogue after nearly four decades, the iconic fashion magazine confronts a pivotal moment regarding its future relevance. Wintour, who will remain as global editorial director, is credited with merging high fashion with mainstream culture, famously placing celebrities like Madonna on the cover. Her successor, Chloe Malle, inherits the challenge of navigating a digital landscape where social media often dictates trends. The transition prompts questions about whether Vogue's cultural authority was tied more to Wintour's personal brand than the magazine itself.</p>

The incident occurred Saturday afternoon in a non-residential area, and authorities confirmed there were no survivors from the fiery wreck. The exact number of victims has not yet been specified, though the aircraft model seats a pilot and four passengers. The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration have launched an investigation to determine the cause of the crash, with an investigator expected on site Sunday.</p>

          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka successfully defended her U.S. Open title, defeating American Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) in the final. The victory marks Sabalenka's fourth Grand Slam singles title and her first of the year, following losses in the Australian Open and French Open finals. Despite a tense moment when she failed to serve out the match at 5-4, Sabalenka regained her composure to dominate the tie-break. For Anisimova, it was another Grand Slam final defeat, though her performance showed improvement from her Wimbledon final loss earlier in the year.</p>

          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has plummeted by more than 80% following the Trump administration's decision to end a long-standing tariff exemption for low-value imports. The change eliminated the "de minimis exemption" for parcels valued at $800 or less, shifting the burden of customs duty collection to carriers. According to the Universal Postal Union, the new rules caused major operational disruptions, as many international postal operators and airlines were not equipped to handle the new collection requirements. Consequently, 88 postal operators have suspended some or all services to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

In anticipation of heightened ICE activity, organizers of the city's Mexican Independence Day festival postponed the event, citing community safety concerns.

          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital border system, known as the Entry/Exit System (EES), starting this autumn. The system will replace manual passport stamping for non-EU citizens entering the 29-country Schengen Area by digitally tracking entries and exits. On their first use, travelers from countries like the UK will need to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, at automated kiosks. While EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel long-term, concerns remain about potential for significant delays and long queues during the initial registration phase.</p>

          <p>The recent NFL game between the Chargers and the Chiefs in São Paulo, Brazil, highlights the league's long-term strategy for global growth. As the first of a record seven international games this season, the event is part of a broader effort to build a year-round presence in new markets, rather than staging one-off events. The NFL reports having 36 million fans in Brazil and is investing in media deals, like one with Globo, to expand its reach. The successful game, which saw the Chargers upset the Chiefs, demonstrates the league's commitment to becoming a true global sports property.</p>

          <p>Ethan Guo, a 20-year-old American social media influencer, has been released after being detained for two months at a Chilean air base in Antarctica. Guo was held after landing his small Cessna aircraft without proper authorization while attempting to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents. He was released on the condition that he pay $30,000 in penalties, donate his raised funds to a childhood cancer foundation, and not enter Chile for three years. Guo described his detention as a "mundane" experience and praised the Chilean people for their hospitality.</p>

          <p>England secured a 2-0 win against Andorra in their World Cup qualifier, but the uninspired performance has done little to quell concerns about the team's direction under manager Thomas Tuchel. Despite dominating possession, England struggled to create clear chances, relying on an own goal and a Declan Rice header to defeat the world's 174th-ranked team. Critics suggest the team has arguably regressed since Tuchel took over, lacking the creativity and momentum expected of a top side. The lackluster display, which saw many fans leave early, raises questions ahead of a tougher upcoming match against Serbia.</p>

          <p>Contrary to the common advice to lease electric vehicles, new data from Experian reveals that a significant number of EV buyers from American brands are choosing to finance or pay cash. In the second quarter of 2025, 70% of Tesla Model Y customers and 42% of Model 3 customers opted to buy rather than lease. Similarly, nearly 38% of Ford Mustang Mach-E and 40% of Chevy Equinox EV buyers chose to purchase their vehicles. This trend bucks the industry norm, where leasing is often preferred due to concerns about rapid depreciation and battery replacement costs. (not investment advice)</p>

The man, identified as Jesus Munoz-Gutierrez, was part of a group of eight non-South Sudanese nationals sent there by the Trump administration. This practice of deporting migrants to third-party countries has been criticized by rights groups as a violation of international law. The repatriation was coordinated between South Sudan's foreign ministry and the Mexican Embassy in Ethiopia, highlighting the complex diplomatic challenges created by the controversial U.S. policy.</p>

According to the national transport safety office, the cable connecting the two carriages gave way, causing the upper car to derail and crash into a building. The report states that the brakeman's attempt to apply emergency brakes was unsuccessful. The cable was reportedly only 337 days into its expected 600-day operational lifespan, and a full investigation into the catastrophic failure is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured pole position at the Italian Grand Prix with a record-breaking lap, surpassing the fastest times ever recorded in Formula 1 history. Both Verstappen and McLaren's Lando Norris beat the previous record set in 2020, with Verstappen's lap achieving an average speed of 164.466mph. The new record is attributed to a combination of factors, including the current cars' lower drag, a recently resurfaced Monza track with better grip, and modified kerbs. Verstappen expressed cautious optimism about converting his pole position into a race win against the typically strong race pace of McLaren.</p>
