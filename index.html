          <p>Palantir, an artificial intelligence software company, has experienced astronomical growth since its 2020 public debut, with shares surging over 1,700% and its market valuation surpassing $430 billion. The company recently achieved its first quarter with over $1 billion in revenue, driven significantly by U.S. government contracts, including a recent $10 billion deal with the U.S. Army. While U.S. revenues have quintupled, international commercial revenues have shown a decline, raising analyst concerns. Despite a high forward price-to-earnings ratio, investors are paying a premium for this leading AI stock, reflecting high growth expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Monterey Car Week auctions, a major event for collectible cars, anticipate tepid sales between $367 million and $409 million this year, marking a third consecutive year of decline from the 2022 peak. The high-end market is particularly weak, with only one car priced over $10 million, the fewest in over a decade. Experts attribute this slowdown to a generational shift, as Baby Boomers downsize their collections while younger buyers, like millennials and Gen Z, prefer newer, more affordable, and practical models from the 1980s-2000s. This shift has led to an oversupply and falling prices for older models, with more sales moving to the private market to avoid public discounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a 12-year-old Glasgow school pupil, has been recognized by Time magazine as one of its 'girls of the year' for her innovative solar-powered blanket designed to assist homeless individuals. Her invention, which converts sun energy into stored heat for use at night, emerged from a school engineering competition and was developed into a prototype by engineering firm Thales. Thirty-five units have already been deployed by Homeless Project Scotland in Glasgow, providing crucial warmth for rough sleepers. Rebecca's achievement highlights how imagination can translate into real-world impact, inspiring young people in STEM fields despite her own musical aspirations.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Solnit's opinion article critiques Donald Trump's attempt to take control of Washington D.C., framing it as an illegitimate power grab fueled by false claims of rising crime. The author highlights the hypocrisy, noting that official data shows violent crime in D.C. is at a 30-year low, contrasting this with the 2021 Capitol attack incited by Trump. Solnit argues that this move aligns with authoritarian agendas that demonize diverse cities to justify harsh law enforcement and control, diverting attention from other controversies. The article emphasizes that such actions are a war on rights and diversity, urging defense against propaganda.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's deployment of 800 National Guard troops to Washington D.C. and placing city police under federal supervision is framed as a crime crackdown, but D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and legal experts dispute the necessity, citing a 30-year low in violent crime. The article explains that Trump's authority is unique to D.C. due to its federal status, making similar interventions in states like Chicago or Los Angeles far more difficult without state governor approval. Critics view the move as an authoritarian push and a distraction from other political issues, warning it could damage public trust in military institutions.</p>

Owner Amy Tran, who provided affordable groceries to low-income and elderly residents, faced declining foot traffic due to gentrification, increased crime, and fear from recent ICE raids. The article details a series of burglaries and an assault on Tran's daughter, resulting in significant financial losses for the family.

          <p>An article from The Atlantic explores the centuries-old quest to define "genius," tracing its evolving meaning from a person's inner spirit to a measurable, inherited quality. Historically, figures like chess wizard Paul Morphy and mental calculator Zerah Colburn were once celebrated as geniuses, only to be largely forgotten. The article highlights how the 19th-century scientific pursuit of understanding genius, influenced by Darwinism, led to the controversial concept of eugenics, with devastating societal consequences like forced sterilizations. It concludes by emphasizing the role of luck and social conditions in success, cautioning against a purely individualistic view of exceptional talent.</p>

Spain accounts for approximately a quarter of the 629,000 hectares burned across the EU this year. While arson arrests have been made, the severity of these blazes is linked to climate change, which scientists say is making heatwaves hotter, longer, and more frequent, intensifying wildfire risks across Southern Europe.</p>

          <p>As high interest rates persist, individuals with credit card debt are exploring debt forgiveness and debt management as distinct relief strategies. Debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to settle for less than the full amount, potentially saving significantly on the balance but impacting credit scores and incurring tax implications on forgiven debt. Conversely, debt management, facilitated by credit counseling, restructures payments with lower interest rates, allowing full repayment over time while preserving or improving credit. The article advises choosing based on financial hardship, income stability, and credit goals, emphasizing that both require a clear plan for financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Perplexity AI's $34.5 billion bid for Google's Chrome browser marks a dramatic moment for the tech giant, intensifying scrutiny ahead of its IPO anniversary and a looming antitrust remedies decision. The U.S. Department of Justice previously called for Google to divest Chrome, arguing it creates an unfair playing field for search competitors. Google faces significant challenges, including shelling out billions for AI infrastructure while traditional search faces disruption from AI alternatives like ChatGPT. Analysts are now valuing Alphabet's various businesses, with some suggesting a complete breakup could benefit shareholders despite potential stock drops from a Chrome divestiture.

Many students, like Lily-Rose Williamson who achieved three A*s for Oxford medicine, celebrated their hard work paying off.

This development, which does not affect NHS-prescribed rates, impacts the estimated 1.5 million UK individuals using weight-loss drugs, with most paying privately.

          <p>Tapestry, the parent company of Coach and Kate Spade, saw its shares plunge after forecasting a $160 million impact from tariffs in the coming fiscal year, which will bite into profits despite projected sales growth. Chief Financial Officer Scott Roe noted that the earlier-than-expected end of "de minimis" exemptions, which allowed duty-free imports under $800, is a significant factor. Retailers and consumer brands are increasingly grappling with higher costs from tariffs, implementing strategies such as shifting manufacturing, raising prices, and trimming promotions. Despite the profit headwinds, Tapestry maintains that demand for its products remains strong. (not investment advice)</p>

While a Fed cut could stimulate the economy, it also risks fueling inflation, especially with President Trump's tariff policies.

The article notes the PIF's annualized returns have fallen, but it is broadening its funding base and plans to increase investments in high-growth areas like artificial intelligence.
