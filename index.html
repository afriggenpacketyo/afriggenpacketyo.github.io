          <p>Giorgio Armani, the legendary Italian fashion designer, has passed away at the age of 91, his company confirmed. He established his luxury fashion house in 1975, building it into a global empire synonymous with natural sophistication, and remained its CEO and sole shareholder throughout his life. Armani, who worked until his final days, had expressed a wish for a gradual succession, involving close associates and family, and reflected on regretting not spending more time with loved ones.</p>

          <p>Danish renewable energy firm Orsted is suing the Trump administration to overturn an order halting construction of its Revolution Wind farm off New England. The project, 80% complete and fully permitted, was stopped on alleged national security grounds, which Orsted claims is a pretext for President Trump's long-standing animosity towards wind power. This legal challenge highlights the administration's recent aggressive stance against the renewable energy sector, including significant funding cancellations for related infrastructure projects.</p>

          <p>Justice Amy Coney Barrett stated the Supreme Court's role is to interpret the law, not impose its own values, ahead of her book release, as the court faces a longshot bid to revisit same-sex marriage. She clarified that overturning Roe v. Wade does not automatically threaten other precedents grounded in the 14th Amendment, such as those for contraception or gay marriage. Barrett specifically rebuffed Hillary Clinton's prediction that the court would return gay marriage decisions to the states, emphasizing the need for judicial independence from external criticism.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer, the UK opposition leader, has repeatedly declined to confirm whether he would dismiss Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner if his standards adviser concludes she breached the ministerial code. Rayner referred herself for investigation after admitting to underpaying stamp duty on a property, attributing the error to incorrect legal advice. While Starmer expects a swift and comprehensive report, he avoided comparisons to past political controversies, emphasizing his commitment to upholding the integrity of the ministerial code.</p>

          <p>Figma's stock plummeted nearly 20% on Thursday, reaching its lowest price since its July IPO, despite second-quarter revenue largely aligning with expectations at $249.6 million, a 41% year-over-year increase. Analysts characterized the report as a "non-event," but noted the stock's "hyper-volatility" after its initial surge. The design software vendor forecasted 33% growth for the third quarter, yet its net retention rate slightly declined, contributing to investor concerns following its high-profile market debut.
