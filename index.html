          <p>The long-standing feud within The Beach Boys has resurfaced following the funeral for co-founder Brian Wilson. Bandmate Al Jardine publicly criticized Mike Love's eulogy, claiming Love used the speech to focus on his own achievements, such as writing "Good Vibrations," rather than showing compassion for Wilson. Jardine described Love as having "megalomania problems" and recounted past conflicts, including lawsuits and a contentious 2012 reunion tour. The comments highlight the decades of internal strife that have plagued the iconic and commercially successful band.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for Donald Trump, was not lawfully appointed as the acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. The decision came after her appointment was challenged in two separate criminal cases, with the judge concluding she has been exercising her duties without legal authority since July 1, 2025. As a result, the judge disqualified her from participating in ongoing criminal cases handled by her office. The ruling has been stayed to allow the Trump administration an opportunity to appeal the decision.</p>

While the storm is not expected to make a direct landfall in the U.S., it brought tropical storm conditions to the Outer Banks, prompting evacuation orders and a state of emergency declaration. The National Hurricane Center continues to warn of life-threatening surf and dangerous rip currents along most of the U.S. East Coast. Storm surge warnings remain in effect for parts of North Carolina, and a tropical storm warning is active for coastal areas and Bermuda.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is expanding its immigration crackdown by reviewing the records of more than 55 million foreign nationals who currently hold valid U.S. visas. This "continuous vetting" process will search for any potential violations or ineligibilities that could lead to visa revocation and deportation for those already in the country. The criteria for review have also been broadened to include "anti-American" views found on social media and ideologies deemed antisemitic. This policy represents a significant escalation of screening measures for both new applicants and existing visa holders.</p>

          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining traction among wealthy investors as a way to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated assets. The process involves exchanging a diversified portfolio of stocks for shares in a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it launches, effectively postponing the tax bill until the ETF shares are sold. While this method can be highly effective, it comes with strict diversification requirements and high investment minimums, often starting at $1 million. Financial advisors note that while the strategy can seem "like magic," investors must be comfortable holding the resulting ETF for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

The redesign removes the familiar image of "Uncle Herschel," an overall-clad man leaning on a barrel, which has been a staple of the brand's identity for decades. This change is part of a broader effort by the 55-year-old chain to refresh its image and menu to appeal to a more contemporary audience.

Speaking at a manufacturing facility near Atlanta, Vance framed the legislation as a way for the government to support working Americans. During his speech, he criticized Georgia's Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff for voting against the measure, which shifts funding from social programs to tax reductions and increased immigration enforcement. Ossoff countered by stating the bill is already harming Georgia hospitals and will cause millions to lose health coverage, setting the stage for a major campaign issue in the 2026 midterms.</p>

The group's military capabilities have been significantly degraded, and it faces pressure not only from Israel's impending assault on Gaza City but also from Arab nations urging it to relinquish control. In this context, Hamas's recent acceptance of a ceasefire proposal is seen as a move to buy time and preserve its remaining leverage, namely the Israeli hostages.

          <p>China's ambassador to India has publicly expressed strong support for New Delhi in its trade dispute with the United States, calling for collaboration between the two nations to stand up to what he termed U.S. "bully" tactics. The statement came in response to steep tariffs of up to 50% imposed on India by the Trump administration. The Chinese envoy, Xu Feihong, asserted that China would "firmly stand with India" to uphold the multilateral trading system. This rare display of solidarity occurs as both Asian powers face aggressive tariff policies from Washington.</p>

          <p>A directive issued by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has reportedly ordered the U.S. intelligence community to stop sharing information regarding Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations with its closest allies. According to U.S. intelligence officials, the memo classifies all related analysis as "NOFORN" (no foreign dissemination), specifically blocking its distribution to the "Five Eyes" intelligence alliance, which includes the U.K., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The move has raised concerns among some former officials that it could undermine trust and critical intelligence sharing, while others argue that withholding sensitive information on diverging interest areas is a standard practice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As U.S. credit card debt surpasses $1.2 trillion and delinquency rates climb, an article details the criteria for qualifying for debt forgiveness programs. These programs, typically run by debt relief companies, negotiate with creditors to settle debts for less than the full amount owed. Generally, consumers who are most likely to qualify are those with at least $7,500 in unsecured debt, those experiencing significant financial hardship such as job loss or medical emergencies, and those who are already behind on their payments. For these borrowers, creditors are often more willing to negotiate a settlement rather than risk a total loss from bankruptcy.</p>

          <p>Two senior House Democrats, Reps. Jamie Raskin and Frank Pallone, are investigating the $8 billion merger between Paramount and Skydance Media over concerns of improper dealings with President Donald Trump. The lawmakers are questioning whether the companies acquiesced to "illegitimate demands" from Trump to secure FCC approval for the deal. The probe was prompted by a $16 million settlement Paramount paid to end a lawsuit from Trump regarding a "60 Minutes" interview shortly before the merger was approved. The letter from the congressmen raises concerns that the payment and other alleged side deals could constitute an illegal bribe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has terminated a multi-million dollar federal grant for a California sex education program after the state refused to remove references to gender identity and transgender people from its curriculum. The Administration for Children and Families argued that such topics were outside the scope of the federally funded Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP). California officials declined to alter the curriculum, stating it was medically accurate and legally sound. This move is seen by advocates as part of a broader effort by the administration to restrict comprehensive sex education and promote abstinence-only programs.</p>

          <p>A South Texas woman, Lizelle Gonzalez, who was arrested on a murder charge in 2022 for using an abortion pill, has filed new details in her lawsuit against the local district attorney and sheriff. Her attorneys allege that officials pursued the case despite knowing that Texas law exempts a pregnant person from criminal homicide charges for ending their own pregnancy. The charges were eventually dropped after public outcry, but the lawsuit claims her constitutional rights were violated. The case highlights the legal complexities surrounding the criminalization of abortion, particularly self-managed medication abortions.</p>

          <p>A New York state appeals court has overturned the massive monetary penalty, which had grown to over $500 million, imposed on Donald Trump and his company in the civil fraud case brought by Attorney General Letitia James. The court ruled that the fine was excessive and violated the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment. However, the five-judge panel upheld the underlying verdict that Trump and other defendants committed business fraud by inflating asset values to secure favorable financial terms. The non-monetary sanctions, designed to curb the company's business practices, were also left in place by the ruling.</p>

Videos of the incident, showing hecklers yelling "Go f*ck a couch," quickly went viral on social media.
