          <p>A major heat wave in eastern North America has led to dozens of hospitalizations due to heat-related illnesses. Over 150 people became ill at a New Jersey graduation ceremony, prompting a state of emergency declaration by the city's mayor, while six people required hospital treatment during a concert in Washington D.C. Heat warnings are in effect across the US Midwest, East Coast, and parts of Canada, impacting over 160 million people with experts cautioning that high humidity levels will exacerbate the risk of heat-related illness. The extended duration of the heatwave, with minimal nighttime relief, further intensifies the health risks. The Mid-Atlantic region is expected to face the most intense conditions by Thursday, followed by the eastern Ohio Valley into Friday. </p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang called for international collaboration on trade, despite increasing tariffs and other barriers, at the World Economic Forum's annual "Summer Davos" event in Tianjin, China. Li emphasized that globalization is irreversible and urged countries to avoid turning trade into a political or security issue. He added that engaging in the international economy is a way of "reshaping the rules and order," calling on countries to keep to the "right" path. While Li did not directly address U.S. tensions or the Israel-Iran conflict, his comments reflect China's desire to maintain its position in the global economy amidst geopolitical uncertainties. </p>

          <p>California leaders have reached a tentative agreement on a $321.1 billion state budget, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal. The deal addresses a $12 billion budget deficit through borrowing, tapping into state reserves, and shifting funding. Key elements include a housing caveat requiring CEQA exemptions, changes to Medi-Cal funding, and shifting money from the general fund to other sources. The budget also accounts for potential federal funding losses and anticipates future financial challenges. </p>

          <p>A preliminary US intelligence assessment indicates that recent US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by only a few months. According to Reuters, Tehran would be able to restart its nuclear program relatively quickly, contradicting President Trump's claims that the strikes "fully obliterated" Iran's nuclear program. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt dismissed the assessment as "flat-out wrong," while Trump maintained on his Truth Social platform that Iran's nuclear sites are "completely destroyed." The extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear facilities remains unclear. </p>

However, some analysts remain skeptical, citing China's strict capital controls and geopolitical risks as deterrents to large-scale investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City's Democratic mayoral primary is a battle between state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani and former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani, a democratic socialist, focuses on affordability, while Cuomo is viewed as a moderate. The race is being watched nationally as a proxy war between left-wing and moderate Democrats. Cuomo faces criticism over his past sexual harassment scandal and Covid-19 nursing home deaths, while Mamdani's critics question his experience. </p>

          <p>An initial classified assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency found that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months. The assessment indicates that the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities were sealed off, and some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes. White House officials have disputed the findings, claiming the strikes "obliterated" Iran's nuclear capabilities. A classified briefing for Congress on the administration's actions in Iran was cancelled. </p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago, impacting the way suns are born. Researchers studied thousands of stars using data from Europe's Gaia space telescope and other sky surveys. The findings indicate that as the Milky Way evolved, newly formed stars began spinning up to 10 times faster than their older counterparts. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. </p>
