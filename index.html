          <p>A 21-year-old illegal immigrant from India, released by the Biden administration after a 2022 border crossing, is accused of causing a fiery semi-truck crash in San Bernardino County, California, that killed three people. Jashanpreet Singh allegedly plowed his big rig into slow-moving traffic without braking, with toxicology tests confirming impairment. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has lodged a detainer, as Singh is not in lawful immigration status. This incident highlights ongoing concerns regarding the release of illegal immigrants pending hearings who later commit crimes, alongside broader issues of English language proficiency for truck drivers.</p>

          <p>The US military has for the first time attacked and destroyed two alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Pacific, killing five people. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth equated these alleged traffickers to 9/11 terrorists, signaling an expansion of the controversial campaign previously focused on the Caribbean. The CIA reportedly provides intelligence for these strikes, raising concerns about transparency and legal justification. Legal experts question the administration's "non-international armed conflict" theory against cartels, as this escalation has drawn condemnation from civil liberties groups and South American nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's central bank held its benchmark interest rate at 2.5%, extending a pause since May, primarily due to concerns over household debt. This decision aligns with economist expectations and follows new, stricter property regulations in Seoul aimed at curbing borrowing. While inflation remains stable and economic growth outlook improves, uncertainties from ongoing US trade talks and potential tariff impacts pose risks. The Bank of Korea monitors housing market stability and household debt, with analysts suggesting a possible rate cut in November if trade and housing policies progress. (not investment advice)</p>

Key issues included ICE raids, homelessness, housing, and Mamdani's support for Jewish New Yorkers, which led to accusations of stoking hatred. Mamdani advocated for freezing rent and a $30 minimum wage, while Cuomo highlighted his experience and Sliwa focused on crime and criticizing his opponents. The debate was marked by frequent interruptions and personal attacks, with candidates struggling to name a 2028 presidential choice.</p>

          <p>New Jersey's attorney general has filed a lawsuit against Amazon, alleging the company violated state anti-discrimination laws by mistreating thousands of pregnant employees and those with disabilities. The complaint asserts that Amazon placed workers on unpaid leave, denied reasonable accommodations, and retaliated against them, including firings for failing to meet "rigid productivity requirements." Amazon denies the accusations, stating it approves over 99% of pregnancy accommodation requests and doesn't have fixed quotas. The lawsuit seeks compensatory damages, civil fines, and policy changes, following a years-long investigation into the company's warehouse practices.</p>

          <p>California's special election on Proposition 50, a Democratic-led effort to redraw congressional districts, is experiencing unexpectedly high early voter turnout. Over 3.4 million mail ballots have been returned, comparable to a presidential election year, with Democrats significantly outpacing Republicans. Governor Gavin Newsom and former President Obama, who endorsed the proposition, highlight its importance for national democracy against partisan gerrymandering. Despite concerns from some Republicans about potential voter suppression tactics, the strong early Democratic showing suggests an advantage for Proposition 50's passage, aiming to counter efforts to entrench power.</p>

Rising inflation, coupled with over $1 billion in cuts to federal food aid programs, has led to fewer donations for non-profits like Harvesters, which serves nearly 375,000 people daily. The situation is exacerbated by the ongoing government shutdown, which is withholding SNAP payments, and the Trump administration's cancellation of the annual USDA report on food insecurity.

          <p>Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine are making strides in preventing breast cancer recurrence by targeting dormant "sleeper cells." These cells, which can break away from a primary tumor and later cause cancer to spread, were identified in patients like Illeana Casiano-Vazquez, who had an aggressive form of triple-negative breast cancer. A clinical trial successfully used drugs to eliminate these cells, with only two out of 51 participants experiencing recurrence after seven years, significantly below the expected rate. The next step involves larger trials and exploring applicability to other cancers, offering new hope.</p>

This marks a significant policy shift for Trump, who previously relied on trade measures, and comes amid reports of a canceled meeting with Vladimir Putin.

          <p>A family of three was rescued by the Coast Guard off Cape Cod after their 30-foot pleasure boat caught fire, forcing them to swim to a small island. The mother, father, and son spent almost two days sheltering in a barn on Naushon Island before the son managed to use the boat’s washed-up marine radio to make a mayday call. A relative alerted authorities when the family didn't return as expected. The family was flown to a hospital, with one member in critical condition, highlighting the importance of quick thinking and quality safety equipment in survival situations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Menopause screening will be officially incorporated into NHS health checks in England starting next year, for women aged 40 to 74. The initiative aims to identify women who could benefit from advice and support, including treatments like hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or counselling, thereby bringing menopause into mainstream health discussions. Health Secretary Wes Streeting hopes this will improve support, as many women suffer in silence due to lack of information and stigma. Campaigners welcome the move but emphasize the need for staff training and improved uptake of health checks, particularly in marginalized communities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is preparing to deploy dozens of federal agents, potentially over 100, to the San Francisco Bay Area for a major immigration enforcement operation. This move, which includes using a US Coast Guard base in Alameda, has drawn strong condemnation from California leaders, including Governor Gavin Newsom, who likened it to a "dictator's handbook." San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie has pledged resistance, enacting executive actions to support immigrant communities. The deployment is expected to trigger a showdown, with community groups mobilizing and civil rights organizations providing guidance on resisting federal agents.</p>

          <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband's pledge to cut UK energy bills by £300 faces doubt, as the economist behind the original savings estimate says the analysis needs updating. Pawel Czyzak of Ember, the energy think tank, indicated that rising offshore wind costs and other factors could "wipe out" the projected savings by 2030. While Miliband's department stands by its commitment to lower bills through clean power, a new report from the Tony Blair Institute urges a shift from "Clean Power 2030" to "Cheaper Power 2030," suggesting measures like axing carbon taxes on gas.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new sanctions on Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil are described as a "punch to the gut" for Moscow's war economy, aimed at degrading its revenue for the Ukraine war. This bold policy shift, moving beyond trade measures, signifies a strategic gamble to corner Putin, with Europe mirroring Washington's stance to maintain Western unity. While the sanctions carry the risk of surging global energy prices and domestic economic sting, the White House believes the geopolitical payoff will outweigh these costs.

          <p>Helen Ledwick, a former BBC journalist, is raising awareness about pelvic organ prolapse, a common but often taboo condition she experienced two weeks after her second childbirth. Prolapse occurs when pelvic organs slip from their position, causing physical and emotional distress, yet many women and health professionals lack awareness. Ledwick felt isolated and received unhelpful initial advice, leading her to launch a podcast and write a book to break the silence. Women's health specialists confirm the prevalence of such issues, emphasizing that symptoms can vary and can be improved through exercises or medical treatment.</p>

          <p>New port fees enacted by the Trump administration's U.S. Trade Representative have unexpectedly burdened Atlantic Container Line (ACL), a US-based ocean carrier, with an estimated $34 million annual tariff bill. The company was reclassified under Section 301 terms, leading to fees based on net tonnage capacity rather than cargo type, despite its unique hybrid container-Ro/Ro vessels primarily carrying containers. ACL's CEO, Andrew Abbott, warns that these fees could force the company to relocate operations, impacting US importers and exporters who rely on its specialized service.
