            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey reveals that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. due to high costs. Most companies believe reshoring would double their expenses and instead plan to relocate supply chains to lower-tariff countries. Automation is expected to dominate if manufacturing returns to the U.S., with companies favoring it over human workers. A majority of respondents feel the Trump administration is "bullying corporate America," and cancellation of orders is the most widespread reaction to the tariffs.</p>

            <p>LVMH shares plummeted following a disappointing first-quarter sales report, briefly losing its position as the world's largest luxury firm to Hermès. The decline was attributed to weaker demand in the U.S. and China, particularly for cognac, and a slowdown in the key fashion and leather goods division. Analysts cited ongoing economic uncertainty and trade tensions as factors impacting the luxury sector. The luxury sector, reliant on global supply chains and U.S. consumer demand, is facing a host of headwinds from U.S. President Donald Trump's volatile trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>With tariffs creating economic uncertainty, some Americans are considering keeping physical cash at home for emergencies. While not every financial planner deems it essential, having $500 to $1,000 in cash for unforeseen issues like power outages or natural disasters is reasonable. Financial advisors caution against hoarding too much cash, as it is not FDIC-insured and does not earn interest. They advise being discreet about storing cash at home to avoid becoming a target for thieves.</p>

The team was scheduled to assess issues like food insecurity, unsafe drinking water, and toxic chemical exposure. The CDC's involvement was crucial due to their expertise and resources, and the cuts are expected to impact both federal and local responses to future disasters. The CDC said that the goal is to streamline divisions within the agency and get rid of redundancies.</p>

Questions have arisen regarding who is selling off Treasurys, with concerns about holdings by Chinese and Japanese investors. Debt concerns and hedge fund selling may have contributed to the sell-off. One basis point is equal to 0.01% and yields move inversely to prices. (not investment advice)</p>
