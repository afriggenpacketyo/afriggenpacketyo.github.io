          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos recently sold nearly three million company shares, valued at approximately $665.8 million, as part of a pre-announced plan. This transaction is a component of a larger strategy to sell up to 25 million Amazon shares by May 2026. Despite the sale, Bezos remains the largest shareholder with over 900 million shares, valued near $200 billion, and continues to serve as the company's chairman. The sale occurred shortly after his high-profile wedding celebration in Venice. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration has officially eliminated the requirement for most travelers to remove their shoes at U.S. airport security checkpoints. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the immediate, nationwide policy change, citing significant advancements in screening technology over the past two decades. The rule was originally implemented in 2006 following the failed "shoe bomber" attempt in 2001. This change, praised by airline industry groups, aims to improve the travel experience while maintaining high security standards.</p>

          <p>The death toll from catastrophic flooding in Texas has risen to 109, with an additional 161 people reported missing in the hard-hit Kerr County area. Governor Greg Abbott described the damage as "catastrophic" and deflected questions about blame, calling such inquiries the "word choice of losers." The disaster has left families devastated, with many residents desperately searching for missing loved ones amidst the immense destruction along the Guadalupe River.

          <p>Devastating flash floods along Texas's Guadalupe River claimed at least 109 lives over the holiday weekend, with dozens still missing. A confluence of weather factors, including moisture from a tropical system, led to the river rising 26 feet in just 45 minutes. Officials are now facing intense scrutiny over the timeliness and adequacy of their emergency warnings, as many survivors reported receiving no alerts. The disaster has prompted a massive search and rescue operation and discussions about funding a more robust flood warning system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the death toll from the Texas floods climbed past 100, with 161 people still missing, authorities are facing difficult questions about their response. Officials leading the search efforts have been accused of evading questions regarding the timeline of emergency alerts, particularly why warnings were not issued sooner. Despite a National Weather Service alert at 1:14 a.m., the Kerr County sheriff stated he was not aware of the floods until hours later. The official focus remains on recovery, but pressure is mounting for a review of the alert system's failures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The catastrophic Texas floods highlight a critical failure in emergency alert systems, where generic warnings like "Move to higher ground" proved insufficient. While the National Weather Service issued timely alerts, local authorities in Kerr County were slow to issue specific evacuation orders, and a previously considered river siren system was never funded. This event is part of a broader pattern of failures in emergency communication, seen also in recent California fires and Maui. Experts argue for better training, clearer messaging, and multi-platform alert strategies to prevent future tragedies.</p>

The bow was torn from the heavy cruiser by a Japanese torpedo during the Battle of Tassafaronga in November 1942, an event that killed over 180 crew members. Despite the catastrophic damage, the crew heroically saved the ship, which was later repaired and returned to service.

          <p>Four men, including two active members of the Canadian Armed Forces, are facing terrorism-related charges for an alleged plot to create an anti-government militia. According to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the group conducted military-style training and planned to forcibly seize land in the Québec City area. A police search uncovered a significant cache of explosive devices, dozens of firearms, and thousands of rounds of ammunition. The arrests highlight growing concerns about extremism within the Canadian military, which has been under pressure to address the issue.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he is nominating U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. The nomination follows recent joint U.S.-Israeli military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities, which both leaders hailed as a success. Netanyahu presented Trump with a nominating letter during a dinner in Washington, where they also discussed a potential 60-day ceasefire in Gaza. The visit and nomination occur amid ongoing conflict in Gaza and international discussions about the future of the region and Iran's nuclear program.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), projects that the annual cost of the state pension 'triple lock' will reach £15.5 billion by 2030, three times its original estimate. The policy, which guarantees the state pension rises by the highest of inflation, wage growth, or 2.5%, has driven pension spending up significantly. The OBR warned that due to such age-related spending pressures, the UK's public finances are on an unsustainable long-term path, a situation exacerbated by recent reversals of planned spending cuts.

          <p>This opinion article examines the political strategy behind social welfare policy in the U.S. following recent Republican-led cuts to means-tested programs like Medicaid. The author challenges the progressive argument that universal programs, like Social Security, are inherently more politically resilient than targeted benefits. Citing historical data, the article shows that means-tested programs have grown substantially over the past 50 years, while some universal benefits have faced cuts. It concludes that the strongest arguments for universalism are based on policy effectiveness, not necessarily political durability.</p>

          <p>The family of an off-duty San Diego police officer has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Riverside County after he was found dead outside a jail shortly after his release. Lawrence David Orso was arrested for DUI and, according to the suit, collapsed just 10 minutes after being released from the Murrieta jail. The complaint alleges that jail staff were "deliberately indifferent," ignoring his complaints of chest pains and other signs of medical distress, and released him while he was still significantly intoxicated and unwell.</p>

          <p>U.S. beef prices have reached their highest levels since tracking began in the 1980s, driven by a classic case of high demand and low supply. The nation's cattle herd is at its smallest size since the 1960s, largely due to multi-year drought conditions that have forced ranchers to sell off cattle. Despite the availability of cheaper alternatives like pork and poultry, American demand for beef has remained remarkably strong. Experts predict that prices will likely continue to rise and remain elevated for the next several years as herds are slowly rebuilt.</p>

While Judge Amit P.

The Department of Justice had terminated the grants, stating the funds would be redirected to support law enforcement operations and combat violent crime.</p>
