          <p>Prominent Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives has been appointed chairman of Eightco Holdings, a company pivoting its strategy to accumulate Worldcoin (WLD) as its primary treasury asset. The company announced a $250 million private placement to fund the acquisition of the token associated with Sam Altman's biometric identity project. Ives expressed strong belief in Worldcoin's potential as a standard for human authentication in an AI-driven future, distinguishing this move from typical token strategies. This follows a trend of public companies adopting crypto treasury strategies, hoping to mirror the success of firms like MicroStrategy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Nature Climate Change reveals a direct correlation between warmer weather and increased consumption of products with added sugar among Americans. Researchers analyzed household purchase data from 2004 to 2019, finding that sugar intake, primarily from sweetened beverages and frozen desserts, rose sharply as temperatures climbed between 54 and 86 degrees Fahrenheit. The trend was more pronounced among lower-income and less-educated groups, potentially due to differences in work environments and health awareness. This pattern raises public health concerns, as excessive sugar consumption is linked to obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt exceeding $1.21 trillion and average interest rates above 21%, many Americans are facing significant financial strain. This article suggests that generic debt-reduction strategies are often ineffective and advocates for personalized assistance. It outlines three primary avenues for help: credit counseling agencies that offer comprehensive financial analysis and debt management plans, debt relief experts who negotiate directly with creditors to potentially reduce the amount owed, and proactively contacting credit card issuers to inquire about hardship programs or temporary rate reductions. These tailored approaches can provide a more effective path to financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A strike by members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union has severely disrupted London Underground services, forcing commuters to find alternative transportation such as buses, bikes, and taxis. The union is demanding improved pay and a reduction of the standard work week from 35 to 32 hours, citing the strain on employees and a budget surplus at Transport for London (TfL). However, TfL management argues that this demand is "simply unaffordable" and would cost hundreds of millions, damaging the transit authority's finances. The industrial action has drawn criticism from some commuters and public officials, who are urging a swift resolution.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is set to accompany President Donald Trump on a state visit to the United Kingdom, joining other prominent U.S. business leaders. This move highlights Nvidia's strategic efforts to maintain a strong relationship with the Trump administration as the company seeks new licenses to export its advanced Blackwell AI chips to China. Huang has been actively engaging with President Trump, arguing that allowing Nvidia to sell chips to China benefits U.S. national security by maintaining American leadership in the AI sector.

          <p>Congress is considering legislation to establish a national standard for how collegiate athletes can be compensated for their name, image, and likeness (NIL), aiming to regulate what some call a "Wild West" landscape. A House bill proposes a federal framework that would supersede varied state laws and permit schools to pay athletes directly, but it faces opposition from Democrats who argue it infringes on athletes' rights to unionize. Meanwhile, major sports players' associations oppose the bill for limiting athletes' negotiating power. The debate highlights a deep divide on whether student-athletes should be classified as employees and how to balance fairness with the traditional model of college sports.</p>

The 59-year-old victim was a respected professor emerita at the College of Veterinary Medicine. Police responded to a call on Saturday and discovered her body in a wooded area, noting injuries consistent with an assault by a sharp object. Authorities have since arrested 28-year-old Harold Rashad Dabney, charging him with capital murder for both kidnapping and robbery, as he allegedly stole the victim's truck after the attack.

The force of the impact ripped the bus apart and dragged it down the tracks. Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash as emergency services continue to work at the scene.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has denied President Donald Trump's request to overturn the $83.3 million judgment awarded to writer E. Jean Carroll for defamation. The Second Circuit panel upheld the verdict, rejecting Trump's arguments that the damages were excessive and that he should have presidential immunity. The court affirmed that Trump's defamatory statements in 2019 were materially identical to those made in 2022, for which a separate jury had already found him liable for sexual abuse and defamation. The judges also ruled that a recent Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity did not apply to this case, bringing Carroll closer to finalizing the long-fought legal victory.</p>

          <p>Following a weak August jobs report, traders are increasingly pricing in the possibility of a significant interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. While a quarter-point reduction at the upcoming meeting is still the most likely scenario, with 88% probability, the chance of a more aggressive half-point cut has risen to 12%. The disappointing labor market data, showing minimal payroll growth and a rising unemployment rate, is pressuring the FOMC to resume easing measures. However, economists believe the bar for a 50-basis-point cut remains high due to persistent inflation, creating a conflict between the Fed's dual mandates of stable prices and full employment.

          <p>The second-largest Powerball jackpot in history, totaling $1.787 billion, will be split between two winning tickets sold in Missouri and Texas. Each winner can choose between a lump sum of $410.3 million or an annuitized prize of $893.5 million before taxes. However, their final take-home amounts will differ significantly due to state tax laws. The Texas winner will benefit from the state having no income tax on lottery winnings, while the Missouri winner will face an additional state tax withholding of at least 4%, potentially costing them over $16 million from the lump sum. This highlights the impact of local tax policies on large lottery prizes.</p>

          <p>Democratic members of the Senate Banking Committee are insisting that Stephen Miran, a nominee for the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, must resign from his position as a White House economic adviser to avoid a conflict of interest. At his confirmation hearing, Miran stated he would only take an unpaid leave from the Council of Economic Advisers, but Democrats argue this is insufficient for ensuring independent judgment on monetary policy. In a formal letter, they have demanded his full resignation, warning that they will not advance his nomination without this commitment. The Federal Reserve Act requires governors to devote their "entire time" to the board's business.</p>

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has granted an interim stay, allowing the Trump administration to proceed with the removal of Federal Trade Commission (FTC) member Rebecca Kelly Slaughter for the time being. The decision pauses a lower court's order that had reinstated Slaughter, who argued her firing violated a law protecting commissioners from removal except for specific causes like neglect of duty or malfeasance. This case is part of a broader trend where the administration is challenging the independence of various federal agencies. The Supreme Court will now take more time to consider the administration's full request to overturn the lower court's ruling.</p>

          <p>Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson has expressed regret for shoving a fan in the stands during a game against the Buffalo Bills. The incident occurred after Jackson and teammate DeAndre Hopkins were celebrating a touchdown, when a fan reached out and slapped both of their helmets. Jackson stated that he "let my emotions get the best of me" and acknowledged that he should have let security handle the situation. The fan was ejected from the stadium, and Jackson was not penalized during the game. Despite the apology, the night ended in disappointment for the Ravens, who lost a significant lead and the game in the final moments.</p>

          <p>The French government has collapsed after Prime Minister François Bayrou lost a no-confidence vote in the legislature by a margin of 364-194. The ousting marks a significant political crisis for President Emmanuel Macron, who must now appoint his fourth prime minister in the last year. Bayrou's government fell after he gambled on securing support for deep public spending cuts to address France's national debt, a move that backfired as lawmakers united against him. This political turmoil creates renewed uncertainty for Europe's second-largest economy as it confronts major domestic and international challenges, including budget deficits and geopolitical instability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate approaches a one-year low, prospective homebuyers can take proactive steps to secure even better loan terms. Experts advise focusing on improving one's credit score, as higher FICO scores directly translate to lower interest rates. Making a larger down payment, ideally 20% or more, also reduces risk for lenders and can lead to more favorable terms and the avoidance of private mortgage insurance. Additionally, borrowers should consider alternatives to the traditional 30-year fixed loan, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which often feature lower initial rates and can be refinanced later.

The bullpen's 4.21 ERA ranks 19th in the majors, a situation worsened by injuries to key pitchers.

After lower federal courts dismissed their lawsuit, the parents are now petitioning the nation's highest court to rule on whether schools can implement such policies without parental involvement.
