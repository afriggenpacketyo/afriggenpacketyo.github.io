          <p>Former President Joe Biden has chosen his home state of Delaware as the location for his presidential library and museum. A newly formed foundation, governed by a board of former aides and political allies, will oversee the project's planning and fundraising. The decision affirms Biden's deep political roots in Delaware, where he served as a senator for 36 years. The foundation now faces the significant challenge of raising hundreds of millions of dollars for the legacy project, which aims to be a center for civic leadership and historical reflection.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has strongly criticized a federal judge's ruling that prevents the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over a million Venezuelan and Haitian nationals. A DHS spokesperson labeled the TPS program as a "de facto amnesty program" and described the ruling as an action by "unelected activist judges" that obstructs the will of the American people. The administration vows to use every legal option to end the protections, which were granted due to dangerous conditions in the immigrants' home countries.</p>

          <p>A large and complex fire erupted in a restaurant located within the BBC's former Television Centre headquarters in west London, requiring 100 firefighters and 15 engines to control the blaze. The fire, which broke out in the early hours, led to the evacuation of residents from the building, which now contains apartments, a hotel, and active television studios. Crews worked for over 12 hours to manage the incident, using turntable ladders and drones to tackle the smoke billowing from the iconic building's rooftop.</p>

          <p>A new chapter is beginning at California's Point Reyes national seashore after a landmark deal resulted in the buyout of 12 organic dairy and cattle operations, opening over 16,000 acres for conservation. The Nature Conservancy is leading a five-year restoration effort, which will controversially use new herds of cattle for targeted grazing to remove invasive plants and help native species recover. While the transition is seen as a major environmental victory by some, it has created tension within the local community over the loss of multigenerational ranches and the region's organic dairy supply.</p>

          <p>The Universal Postal Union (UPU), a UN agency, has reported a dramatic plunge of over 80% in postal traffic to the United States after the Trump administration abolished the 'de minimis' exemption for small packages. This change subjects all parcels to tariffs and has caused major operational disruptions, leading 88 international postal operators to suspend shipping to the US. The UPU stated that operators were not given enough time to implement systems for collecting duties, and it is now working on a technical solution to resolve the issue.</p>

          <p>A 57-year-old man has died after being attacked by a suspected large shark while surfing off a popular beach in northern Sydney, Australia. The man, who was surfing with friends, reportedly disappeared underwater before his body was found floating in the surf with significant injuries. Despite resuscitation attempts by fellow surfers who brought him to shore, he could not be saved. Authorities have closed nearby beaches for at least 24 hours while they patrol the area and work to identify the species of shark involved.</p>
