          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 19:06:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision along ideological lines, has cleared the way for the Trump administration to continue withholding over $4 billion in foreign aid that Congress had already approved. This ruling reverses a federal judge's order earlier this month that mandated the release of these funds by the end of September. Conservative justices argued that the President's foreign policy authority superseded claims by international aid groups, questioning their standing to sue. Justice Elena Kagan, in her dissent, criticized the use of the emergency docket, highlighting the lack of sufficient briefing, oral argument, and deliberation. This action employs a controversial and rare "pocket rescission," a mechanism not utilized since the 1970s, allowing the President to bypass legislative consideration for fund cancellations near the budget year's end.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant breakthrough has emerged in the infamous 1991 Austin yogurt shop murders, with deceased serial killer Robert Eugene Brashers identified as a suspect. Retired Austin detective John Jones, one of the original investigators, confirmed this development, stating the connection was established through DNA evidence. Brashers, a known serial killer and sexual assaulter linked to at least three other murders between 1990 and 1998, died by suicide in 1999. The firearm he used in his death is reportedly consistent with a bullet casing discovered in a drain at the yogurt shop. This identification provides a crucial lead in a case that has remained unsolved for over three decades, bringing a glimmer of hope for the victims' families.</p>

          <p>Team Europe has secured a commanding three-point lead over the USA on the opening day of the Ryder Cup, marking their first such advantage on American soil in 21 years. Despite American captain Keegan Bradley's optimistic outlook, Europe dominated both sessions, winning five of the first six matches. Notable performances included Jon Rahm's stellar play and Tommy Fleetwood's magnificent putting, which helped secure a crucial victory. Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry also contributed a vital half-point in a captivating final joust. This strong early showing positions Europe as clear favorites heading into Saturday's morning foursomes, raising questions about the US team's strategies and putting considerable pressure on Captain Bradley.</p>

          <p>Famed money manager Howard Rubin and his former personal assistant, Jennifer Powers, have been arrested on federal charges of sex trafficking and transporting women across state lines for commercial sex acts spanning a decade. Prosecutors detailed allegations of severe abuse, including non-consensual conduct and brutalization of women, which often required medical attention, occurring in luxury hotels and a Manhattan penthouse converted into a "sex dungeon." Rubin was ordered detained without bail, as prosecutors argued he was a flight risk and had discussed hiring a "hit man" to target women who filed civil lawsuits against him. The indictment further alleges they spent over $1 million to operate this trafficking network, often targeting vulnerable women and structuring payments to evade financial reporting obligations.</p>

          <p>Legal experts are cautioning that President Trump's persistent public attacks on former FBI Director James Comey and the unusual leadership changes within the prosecuting attorney's office could significantly undermine the case against Comey. Comey faces charges of making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding, stemming from his 2020 testimony regarding anonymous sources. The integrity of the prosecution is being questioned due to reported pushback from career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office and the controversial appointment of a White House aide, who lacks prosecutorial experience, days before the indictment. Defense lawyers are expected to argue selective or vindictive prosecution, leveraging Trump's years of public condemnation and the irregular circumstances surrounding the charges.</p>

          <p>Wag Hotels, a well-known pet hotel chain with locations in California, has agreed to pay $150,000 to settle a consumer protection lawsuit. The suit alleged the business mistreated pets and failed to report dog bites as legally required, stemming from a 2023 investigation that uncovered claims of inexperienced employees, inadequate staff training, and understaffed facilities. These issues reportedly led to pets being improperly fed, medicated, or returned to owners in poor condition. One severe incident involved a dog attacking four employees at a Santa Clara facility, requiring hospitalization. While Wag Hotels maintains the settlement was mutual and denies wrongdoing for "isolated incidents" that have since been addressed, the case highlights the critical importance of pet safety and care standards in such facilities.</p>

          <p>The Leigh Leopards have advanced to the Super League semi-finals after a dominant 26-10 victory against Wakefield Trinity in the play-off eliminator. The hosts, who finished nine points ahead of Trinity in the regular season, established a strong 18-0 lead by halftime through tries from Keanan Brand, Isaac Liu, and Josh Charnley. Although Jayden Myers scored an early second-half try for Wakefield, a Gareth O'Brien penalty and Alec Tuitavake's score solidified Leigh's advantage, making Cameron Scott's superb solo effort a mere consolation. This decisive win earns Leigh a challenging semi-final trip to second-placed Wigan, as they continue their bid to reach their first Grand Final.</p>

          <p>Assata Shakur, a significant figure in the Black liberation movement and a U.S. fugitive, has died in Havana, Cuba, at the age of 78 due to advanced age and health conditions. Shakur, also known as Joanne Deborah Chesimard, was convicted in 1977 for the murder of a New Jersey State Trooper during a 1973 shootout and escaped prison in 1979, eventually receiving political asylum in Cuba. Her presence in Cuba has been a long-standing diplomatic issue between the two nations, with the U.S. consistently seeking her return. While the FBI classified her as a "most wanted terrorist," her supporters regarded her as a political prisoner, and her autobiography and writings gained renewed relevance during the Black Lives Matter movement as a symbol of resistance.</p>

Investigators believe he targeted the NFL offices, accusing the league of concealing brain injury dangers for profit. While emphasizing the tragic loss of victims, CTE expert Chris Nowinski highlighted that Tamura's 12 years of playing contact sports put him at risk, underscoring the need for greater brain trauma prevention in young athletes, given CTE's potential impact on judgment and behavior.</p>

          <p>Palestinians are intensifying their demand for an official apology and reparations from the UK government concerning alleged colonial-era war crimes committed during the British Mandate in historical Palestine from 1917 to 1948. This push comes in the wake of Britain's recent recognition of a Palestinian state, a move welcomed by Palestinians but deemed insufficient without addressing historical injustices. A comprehensive 400-page legal petition, submitted by 13 families, documents alleged abuses including murder, torture, expulsion, and collective punishment, which a 2022 BBC review had also detailed. Petitioners argue that acknowledging these historical actions is crucial for genuine understanding and healing, with the Deputy Prime Minister reportedly set to review the submission, drawing parallels with previous UK apologies for colonial abuses elsewhere.</p>

Count 1 of the indictment accuses Comey of making false statements to Congress under oath in September 2020. He is alleged to have "willfully and knowingly" lied when he denied authorizing anyone at the FBI to act as an anonymous source for news reports concerning an investigation connected to "PERSON 1," whom sources identify as Clinton. "PERSON 3," believed to be Comey's long-time friend and former personal lawyer Daniel Richman, is reportedly the individual Comey authorized to disseminate this information.

          <p>The U.S. federal government is on the brink of a shutdown due to a congressional deadlock over funding, prompting economists to warn of substantial economic fallout. A new analysis from EY-Parthenon suggests each week of disruption could cost the U.S. economy around $7 billion, leading to suspended pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers and delayed services. While mandatory spending programs like Social Security and Medicare would continue, administrative services could be affected. Economists emphasize that a shutdown would erode investor and consumer confidence, delay federal procurement, and complicate monetary policy decisions by potentially postponing critical economic data releases. This uncertainty presents a heightened risk, particularly as the economy already navigates existing challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

Microsoft, a significant contractor for the U.S. government, has not yet responded to the request.

This move, which Hegseth stated was based on a review panel's conclusion, is part of the Trump administration's broader initiative to "Restore Truth and Sanity to American History." It reverses a review ordered by his Democratic predecessor. Hegseth's announcement dismisses long-standing calls from Democratic lawmakers and Native Americans to revoke the medals, as they consider the event a brutal massacre of hundreds of unarmed Lakota men, women, and children, rather than a legitimate battle. Critics argue this decision sanitizes a genocidal past and prioritizes political narratives over historical accuracy and justice for Indigenous peoples.</p>

          <p>An individual aged 66, holding a $250,000 mortgage at a 3.4% rate and $770,000 in equity investments, is contemplating whether to use their investments to pay off the mortgage. Financial advisors recommend diversifying beyond a 100% equity exposure as one approaches retirement, suggesting safer havens such as shorter-duration bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and Treasury inflation-protected securities. While a portfolio of $500,000 in the S&P 500, with a 4% annual withdrawal adjusted for inflation, could last over 30 years, delaying Social Security benefits until age 70 could increase annual payouts by roughly 8%. However, recent research challenges the universal benefit of delaying Social Security past 67, indicating it's most advantageous for those expecting to live well past their life expectancy.

          <p>September marks Prostate Cancer Awareness Month, underscoring that approximately one in eight men will be diagnosed with this disease, which stands as the second-leading cause of cancer death among American men. Crucially, if detected early, prostate cancer is highly curable, thanks to advancements like CyberKnife radiation therapy. This non-invasive technology precisely targets tumors in various body areas, including the prostate, delivering high-powered beams from over 1,400 angles while minimizing harm to surrounding healthy tissue. MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, an early adopter on the East Coast, has successfully treated over 2,400 prostate cancer patients using CyberKnife, completing treatment in just five sessions, a stark contrast to the up to 40 sessions required by conventional radiation. Patients typically experience no pain, require no anesthesia or incisions, and enjoy significantly quicker recovery times, often returning home the same day.</p>

          <p>Newly released, partially redacted documents pertaining to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, provided by Congressional Democrats, name prominent figures including Elon Musk and Prince Andrew. The files, sourced from the Jeffrey Epstein Estate, indicate an invitation for Musk to Epstein's private island in December 2014, though Musk has previously stated he declined such visits. Additionally, a flight manifest from May 2000 lists Prince Andrew as a passenger on a flight with Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of sex trafficking. Other notable individuals like internet entrepreneur Peter Thiel, former Trump advisor Steve Bannon, and Microsoft founder Bill Gates are also mentioned in the released schedules and logs. The reports clarify that there is no suggestion those mentioned were aware of Epstein's alleged criminal activities.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s health policy agenda is characterized by a conservative nostalgia, seeking solutions in past practices and expressing deep skepticism towards modern medical institutions. This approach, integral to the "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement, capitalizes on a significant decline in public trust in organizations like HHS and the CDC, a sentiment amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. RFK Jr.'s philosophy, which prioritizes the "purity of nature," consistently extends from environmental advocacy to questioning the efficacy and safety of vaccines and processed foods. Experts express concern that this self-sustaining skepticism, now deeply embedded within the MAGA right, could encourage risky health practices, such as raw milk consumption, and potentially undermine public health, possibly requiring a major medical advancement or outbreak to rebuild widespread trust.</p>

          <p>Major broadcast station owners Sinclair and Nexstar have announced the reinstatement of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" to their ABC affiliate stations, effective Friday, following a temporary, week-long suspension. The show's preemption stemmed from comments Kimmel made regarding the alleged murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and President Trump's MAGA movement, impacting roughly 20% of U.S. viewers. This incident sparked broader discussions about media influence, First Amendment protections, and the role of local broadcasters. Both Sinclair and Nexstar asserted that their decisions were made independently of government interaction, underscoring their commitment to responsible broadcasting, community interests, and fact-based, unbiased content. Sinclair also mentioned proposing measures to ABC and Disney to enhance accountability and viewer feedback, though these have not yet been adopted.</p>

His attorney contends that the agents' conduct violated constitutional rights and basic human decency, characterizing it as an assault on civil rights amidst an aggressive mass deportation campaign.

Tennessee Governor Bill Lee announced the operation, clarifying that any National Guard troops involved would serve in unarmed support roles unless specifically requested by local law enforcement. While Memphis Mayor Paul Young acknowledged the community's mixed feelings, he expressed his goal to leverage these federal resources effectively, building upon the city's recent progress in reducing violent crime and existing joint task forces.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) has asserted to the Supreme Court that President Trump's proposed dismissal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, based on allegations of mortgage fraud, would not trigger a "financial market disaster." Solicitor General D. John Sauer pressed the high court to permit Cook's removal while her ongoing lawsuit against the president continues, arguing that Trump faces "irreparable harm" from current lower-court decisions. Conversely, Cook's legal team maintains that Trump's "manufactured charges" predate her tenure on the Fed Board and do not meet the "for cause" removal standard outlined in the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. They warn that granting Trump's request would significantly undermine the Federal Reserve's traditional independence, potentially leading to market instability and disruption.
