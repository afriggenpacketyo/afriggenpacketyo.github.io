The Pentagon's review aims to ensure alignment with the president's 'America First' agenda. While the review creates uncertainty, it's not expected to lead to a complete abandonment of Aukus.  The review might signal a shift in approach to managing potential conflict in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>
