          <h2>UK Government to Publish Nationalities of Foreign Offenders</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government will release data on the nationalities of foreign criminals, a move the Conservatives claim is a result of their pressure on the Labour government. Official data indicates over 19,000 foreign offenders were awaiting deportation at the end of the previous year. The Home Secretary ordered the publication to provide the public with more information on foreign criminals awaiting deportation, including their nationalities and the crimes they committed. The most common offences for foreign criminals living in the community are believed to be drug production, theft, robbery, and violent assault.</p>

          <p>Around 70 Japanese lawmakers from various parties visited the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo for its spring festival, a site viewed by neighboring countries as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. The shrine honors wartime leaders convicted as war criminals, along with about 2.4 million war dead, creating diplomatic friction with China and South Korea. A former economic security minister also visited the shrine, while Prime Minister Ishiba sent a ritual offering. The cross-party group usually visits the shrine during the spring and autumn festivals, despite criticism from China and South Korea, where resentment of Japanese wartime militarism is strong.</p>

          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is creating a complex situation for central banks worldwide, offering some relief but also posing challenges. While a weaker dollar can ease the debt burden for emerging markets and lower inflation by making imports cheaper, it also complicates export competitiveness. Some central banks may consider currency devaluation to boost exports, but this carries risks such as capital flight and potential retaliation from the U.S. The situation requires a delicate balancing act to avoid currency wars and maintain economic stability.</p>

          <p>Over 100 presidents of U.S. colleges and universities have signed a statement denouncing the Trump administration's actions towards higher education, citing “unprecedented government overreach and political interference.” This unified front follows Harvard University's lawsuit against the government over funding threats and demands for institutional autonomy. The university presidents are calling for “constructive engagement” but oppose undue government intrusion on campuses.

          <p>The Trump administration has been ordered to reinstate the legal statuses of 133 international students after a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other groups, alleges that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) unlawfully terminated records on the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS), making the students deportable. Some students had minor charges dropped, while others had no charges at all. Government lawyers argued that granting relief would affect the executive branch’s control over immigration, but the judge disagreed.</p>

          <p>Dropshipping businesses, which rely on open trade between China and the U.S., are facing significant challenges due to President Trump's tariffs. The current 145% cumulative tariff on Chinese goods is putting pressure on these businesses, with some experiencing revenue decreases of around 33%. The elimination of the de minimis exemption, which previously allowed shipments valued at $800 or less to enter the U.S. duty-free, has further compounded the problem. Industry insiders suggest that having a diverse set of markets to supply from and sell to is crucial for navigating the current trade environment. (not investment advice)</p>
