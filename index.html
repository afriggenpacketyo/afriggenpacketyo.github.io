            <p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink expressed concerns about the U.S. economy, suggesting it might already be in a recession due to weakened growth. Fink cited President Trump's tariffs as a factor contributing to economic uncertainty, leading to a broad slowdown. Despite these concerns, Fink doesn't foresee a financial crisis and anticipates the persistence of "megatrends" like artificial intelligence. His remarks followed BlackRock's first-quarter results, where he noted client anxiety about market and economic prospects. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A U.S. judge has ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate arrested last month, can be deported.

            <p>Lawyers for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealth Group CEO Brian Thompson, are requesting a federal judge to prevent prosecutors from seeking the death penalty. They argue that U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi violated Mangione's due process rights by deviating from standard procedures and prejudicing the grand jury pool. The defense claims Bondi's public statements, linking the death penalty to President Trump's agenda, demonstrate a political motivation.

            <p>An immigration judge has ruled that Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate, is eligible for deportation based on his pro-Palestinian views. The decision supports the Trump administration's argument that a memo from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, citing Khalil's beliefs as contrary to foreign policy interests, is sufficient grounds for removal. Khalil's attorneys unsuccessfully argued against the ruling, raising concerns about free speech and the lack of criminal allegations. Khalil criticized the proceedings as lacking due process and fairness, noting his detention far from his family.</p>

            <p>The State Department is instructing staff to report colleagues for instances of “anti-Christian bias,” as part of President Trump’s efforts to reshape government policy on religious expression. The internal cable establishes a short window for employees to report perceived religious discrimination committed by State Department officials, with emphasis on Christianity. The cable points back to Trump’s February executive order aimed at ending “the anti-Christian weaponization of government” and indicates preferential treatment for Christians. Some employees reacted with shock, saying it created a culture of fear.</p>

            <p>The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has surged to 7.1%, the highest since mid-February, influenced by the impact of President Trump's tariffs on the bond market. Bond yields spiked after the tariffs were announced, and although rates decreased temporarily when Trump lowered the tariffs, they began selling off again. This increase in mortgage rates coincides with the spring housing market, potentially impacting consumer affordability. Consumer sentiment has also declined, with inflation expectations rising to their highest level since 1981. (not investment advice)</p>
