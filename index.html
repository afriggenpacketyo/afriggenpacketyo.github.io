        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $28 million in federal grants for animal testing, shifting focus toward alternative research methods. This move is supported by a coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan politicians who criticize the estimated $20 billion spent annually on animal experiments. However, the decision has sparked a fierce debate, as many scientists and patient advocates argue that animal testing remains crucial for developing life-saving treatments for diseases like cancer and rare genetic disorders. The push for alternatives like AI modeling is growing, but experts caution that the science is not yet mature enough to fully replace animal models.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced that the FDA will advise physicians on a potential association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. supported the move, citing studies suggesting a link, and the administration also approved the drug leucovorin for treating some autism symptoms. The announcement was met with significant resistance from medical experts and Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, who stated that robust scientific evidence does not support a causal relationship. Medical groups emphasized that acetaminophen is the safest pain reliever for pregnant women and that untreated fevers pose their own risks to fetal development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the signing of an executive order to designate Antifa as a "domestic terrorist organization," this article provides context on the movement and the implications of the designation. Antifa, short for anti-fascist, is a decentralized, leaderless movement of far-left activists who oppose far-right and fascist ideologies, sometimes through direct confrontation and violence. Experts question the legality and practicality of labeling a diffuse ideology as a terrorist organization, noting the lack of a formal structure and potential conflicts with First Amendment rights. The move is part of a broader campaign against the "radical left" by the administration, despite studies indicating that far-right extremism has been responsible for more political violence in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Brittany Aldean, wife of musician Jason Aldean, shared her experience attending the memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was recently assassinated. She described the event, attended by nearly 100,000 people, as overwhelmingly "faith-based" and a source of positive inspiration despite the tragedy. Aldean noted that speakers, including former President Trump and Kirk's wife Erika, emphasized his lasting legacy and the idea that his death could spark a spiritual revival. She concluded by stating her intention to "live like Charlie," reflecting a sentiment shared by other conservative figures like Savannah Chrisley, who also spoke about continuing Kirk's work.</p>

          <p>With a government shutdown looming at the end of the month, President Trump is scheduled to meet with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. The meeting comes after competing Republican and Democratic proposals to pass a short-term funding bill failed in the Senate. Democrats have insisted that any spending measure must address their healthcare priorities and have refused to support what they call a "dirty spending bill."

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled 6-3 to allow President Trump to dismiss Federal Trade Commission (FTC) member Rebecca Slaughter, a Democrat, while her legal challenge is ongoing. More significantly, the court has agreed to hear arguments on overturning a nearly century-old precedent, Humphrey's Executor, which protects officials at independent agencies from being fired without cause by the president. This 1935 ruling was intended to insulate agencies like the FTC from political interference. Dissenting justices warned that this move could dismantle the independence and bipartisanship of crucial government institutions, handing full control to the executive branch.</p>

          <p>In a series of recent actions, the Trump administration has intensified its campaign against political adversaries and institutions protected by the First Amendment. These moves include directing the Attorney General to prosecute political rivals, the FCC chairman hinting at punitive measures against media networks, and labeling "antifa" as domestic terrorists. Simultaneously, the administration has shielded allies, such as quashing an FBI bribery investigation into a White House border advisor. Scholars and critics view these actions as a significant erosion of the traditional separation between the White House and the Department of Justice, representing an unprecedented use of governmental power to target dissent.</p>

In a speech, Davey will propose a fellowship scheme to attract researchers, stating, "If Trump won't back this research, we will." The move follows the U.S. government's decision to slash billions from biomedical research grants, a decision that U.S. medical organizations warned would be "devastating" to scientific progress.

This article explores the growing tension between protecting individuals from online hate and threats versus upholding the principle of free expression.

          <h2>New 'Trump Gold Card' Program Offers Wealthy Foreigners a Fast Track to U.S. Residency</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a new immigration pathway, dubbed the "Trump Gold Card," which allows wealthy foreigners to gain permanent residency by making a $1 million "unrestricted gift" to the Department of Commerce. This executive order creates a pay-to-play system for EB-1 and EB-2 visas, which have traditionally been reserved for individuals with "extraordinary" or "exceptional" abilities. Unlike the existing EB-5 investor visa program, which requires investment in American businesses, the funds from the Gold Card will go directly to the government, with the President stating they will generally be used to "pay down debt." Critics argue the policy fundamentally changes the American dream into a transaction, prioritizing wealth over merit. (not investment advice)</p>

The candidates come from diverse backgrounds, including military pilots, a geologist, a biomedical engineer, and a former SpaceX launch director. They will undergo a two-year training program before becoming eligible for flight assignments, joining the agency at a time of budget uncertainty and a renewed international space race.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Health Service (NHS) has launched a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if they present with the same or worsening symptoms on three separate occasions. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid. The guidance encourages doctors to order more tests, seek a second opinion, or refer the patient to a specialist to prevent misdiagnoses and avoidable deaths. The Royal College of General Practitioners supports the rule, acknowledging the challenge of identifying serious illnesses with ambiguous early symptoms, particularly in younger patients.</p>

          <p>China is in the process of drafting its 15th five-year plan, a comprehensive economic and social blueprint that will guide the nation's development from 2026 to 2030. This long-term planning is a cornerstone of Beijing's governance, aimed at achieving ambitious goals such as reaching the per capita GDP of a "moderately developed country" by 2035. As officials prepare to discuss the plan, experts note that it will need to be flexible, likely prioritizing qualitative goals over rigid quantitative targets. This approach is seen as necessary to navigate rising uncertainties, including domestic economic challenges and a complex international landscape, while steering the country toward its long-term strategic objectives.</p>

          <p>Police in Menlo-Atherton, California, successfully prevented a potential school shooting after receiving a tip through the "Say Something" anonymous reporting system. The tip alerted authorities to concerning social media posts made by a former student, leading to a temporary lockdown of two schools while police located the individual and recovered weapons from their home. The "Say Something" tip line was created by Sandy Hook Promise, an organization founded by families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims. This incident marks the 19th credible planned school attack the system has helped to thwart since its inception, highlighting the critical role of community vigilance in preventing gun violence.</p>

In a podcast appearance, the elder Sanders explained that Shedeur was hesitant to join a team where he would be a long-term backup to an established star like Lamar Jackson or Jalen Hurts. Shedeur, once considered a potential first-round pick, was ultimately selected by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round. Deion Sanders defended his son's desire for a viable path to playing time, stating that players don't develop by sitting on the bench in the NFL.</p>
