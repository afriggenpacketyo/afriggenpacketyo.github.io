          <p>Several individuals, disguised as construction workers, broke into the Louvre museum in Paris, stealing at least nine pieces of jewelry, including crowns and necklaces that once belonged to Napoleon and his wife. The brazen heist, described as well-planned, took place just before the museum opened, with thieves using a mobile freight elevator and angle grinders to access display cases. French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to recover the stolen items, emphasizing the attack on national heritage. The museum was subsequently closed for security measures and investigation.</p>

          <p>A fragile ceasefire in Gaza faced a significant challenge after Israel conducted air and artillery strikes, alleging Hamas targeted its forces and killed two IDF soldiers. An Israeli official indicated that aid transfers into Gaza are halted indefinitely. Hamas denied involvement in the clashes, reaffirming its commitment to the ceasefire and stating contact with groups in the disputed Rafah area was cut off. Hospital sources in Gaza reported at least 38 fatalities since Sunday morning, raising concerns about the truce's stability.</p>

          <p>Federal officials, including the Secret Service and FBI, discovered a "suspicious stand" near Palm Beach International Airport, an area frequently used by Air Force One during President Trump's visits to Florida. The Secret Service found "items of interest" during a pre-arrival sweep, sharing a photo of what appeared to be a platform high in a tree. Officials confirmed no impact to presidential movements and no individuals were present. This incident follows an attempted assassination against the president at his nearby golf club last year, highlighting ongoing security concerns.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team secured a semi-final spot in the 2025 World Cup by defeating co-hosts India in a thrilling four-run victory in Indore. This win is considered the most significant of the Charlotte Edwards/Nat Sciver-Brunt era, showcasing the team's improved ability to perform under pressure. Despite initial struggles against India's strong batting partnership, England capitalized on a key dismissal and maintained composure to close out the game. The team's performance, particularly Heather Knight's century, demonstrated a positive shift in their approach, setting them up for upcoming challenges.</p>

          <p>Palestinians in Gaza are living in constant fear that the fragile ceasefire could collapse at any moment, following a wave of Israeli airstrikes in response to alleged Hamas attacks. Many, like Ismail Baba, who had been displaced multiple times, found their brief sense of safety shattered. Residents recall a similar ceasefire collapse in March, with deep disagreements persisting over implementing a permanent truce. Recent incidents, including the killing of 11 family members by Israeli tanks at a withdrawal line, highlight the ongoing dangers and lack of clear demarcation, fueling anxieties despite a desperate hope for lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Disgraced Republican US Representative George Santos has been released from prison after President Donald Trump commuted his seven-year sentence for wire fraud and identity theft. Santos, who served 84 days, told The Washington Post he now intends to dedicate his life to prison reform, describing his own experience as "dehumanizing" and "humbling." He alleged "rotting facilities" and poor conditions during his incarceration. Santos has reportedly spoken with Trump about his new mission and stated he is not interested in running for office again for at least a decade.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer shares ten key takeaways from his recent trip to San Francisco, focusing on AI, tech companies, and broader market trends. He notes Salesforce's AI platform is effectively streamlining businesses without cutting legacy software, leading to raised revenue projections. Cramer expresses concern over OpenAI's shift towards consumer products, but highlights Broadcom CEO Hock Tan's strong belief in their partnership. He advises against zero-sum thinking for AI chipmakers like AMD and Nvidia, and suggests selling nuclear and quantum stocks due to lack of commercial readiness. He also recommends Dell if its stock drops, praises Levi Strauss's growth, and observes San Francisco's nascent recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, expressed optimism that the ongoing government shutdown could conclude this week if Republicans engage in negotiations regarding expiring health insurance tax credits. Conversely, Republican Senator Katie Britt of Alabama urged Democrats to prioritize reopening the government first. The shutdown, now the third-longest in modern history, persists due to a stalemate over Democrats' demand to extend enhanced tax credits before funding the government. Republicans have indicated willingness to discuss healthcare but only after the government is reopened, leading to a continued impasse affecting many Americans.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he would immediately end all US payments and subsidies to Colombia, accusing President Gustavo Petro of being an "illegal drug leader" who encourages massive drug production. Trump claimed Petro's policies were a "rip off of America" and threatened severe action if Colombia didn't "close up these killing fields." This directive follows Petro's accusations that US military strikes on alleged drug boats killed a Colombian fisherman and violated national sovereignty. The move further escalates tensions between the two nations, with Petro pushing back against Trump's "rude and ignorant" allegations.</p>

          <p>Southeast Asia has seen a dramatic per capita decline in smoking prevalence over the past two decades, dropping from 54% to 23%, attributed to strong public health policies like taxation and advertising bans.

Indonesia remains a notable exception, with high male tobacco use and industry influence leading to a scrapped tax hike.

          <p>Bolivians are heading to the polls for a presidential run-off election, poised to usher in a new political era after two decades of leftist rule. The choice is between two conservative capitalists, Jorge Quiroga and Rodrigo Paz, both promising to address the country's severe economic crisis, marked by a US dollar shortage, currency devaluation, and high inflation. Both candidates pledge to fix the exchange rate and attract foreign investment, though their approaches differ on securing IMF loans and phasing out fuel subsidies.

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has hinted that the government is exploring the possibility of cutting the 5% VAT rate on energy bills, a move that could save average households £86 annually. This consideration comes amid a persistent cost-of-living crisis and follows a recent 2% increase in energy regulator Ofgem's price cap. While Miliband emphasized long-term solutions like clean power, he confirmed the government is examining all options ahead of November's Budget.
