          <p>Despite the worsening effects of climate change, there are positive trends indicating progress in slowing it down. The worst-case warming scenarios are becoming less likely as global CO2 emissions grow at a slower rate, and clean energy sources like wind and solar are surpassing coal in electricity production. Battery storage is increasing, making the grid cleaner and more resilient, and the clean-energy economy is experiencing job growth. Climate innovation is also advancing, with companies developing new solutions for carbon removal. </p>

          <p>Republican leaders in Congress face a significant challenge in unifying their party behind President Trump's proposed budget bill, which aims to extend tax cuts, increase border defenses, and reduce government spending. The bill's ambitious goals and potential impact on social safety net programs have created divisions within the GOP, with some lawmakers opposing cuts to programs that benefit their constituents. Experts predict that the bill could lead to a steep increase in the federal deficit, further complicating the negotiations.</p>

          <p>Analysts are raising concerns about the high costs and complexities associated with the Trump administration's proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, designed to counter China's expanding arsenal. Despite reports of SpaceX partnering with other companies to build key components, Elon Musk has denied the claims. The project, involving hundreds of satellites for missile detection and attack, faces technological and financial hurdles, potentially creating a "monster" problem.</p>

The decline is attributed to concerns about safety and antipathy towards the U.S., impacting various industries from hotels to retail.</p>
