            <p>An Alabama woman, Towana Looney, had a pig kidney removed after a record 130 days due to her body beginning to reject it; she had been receiving dialysis since 2016 and was abnormally primed to reject a human kidney. Despite the setback, Looney expressed gratitude for the opportunity to contribute to research on xenotransplantation, which aims to address the shortage of human organs. Doctors are investigating the rejection and removed the kidney to prioritize Looney's safety, but the experience has provided valuable insights for future attempts. The procedure offered her a 4.5-month break from dialysis and contributed to the understanding of xenotransplantation. </p>

            <p>A study suggests the United States has a "rare" opportunity to become a key technology partner for Indonesia, despite the country's strong economic ties with China; this requires a more strategic approach from Washington. Indonesia is seen as a key battleground in the US-China rivalry for digital infrastructure influence. While Indonesia maintains a policy of strategic autonomy, balancing US security interests with Chinese investment, increasing tensions between the two superpowers may make this difficult. China has been actively cultivating Indonesia through investment and positioning itself as a preferred tech partner.</p>

            <p>A former co-worker of Rex Heuermann, the suspected Gilgo Beach serial killer, recounted an incident where he unnerved her by tracking her down on a cruise, saying "I told you I could find you anywhere." The co-worker, Muriel Henriquez, also recalled a sweater he gifted her from Iceland, coinciding with the disappearance of Maureen Brainard-Barnes. Other former employees described Heuermann as pompous and disrespectful, with a fascination for hunting. Heuermann is charged with the murders of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman, and Amber Costello, and is the prime suspect in the death of Maureen Brainard-Barnes.</p>

            <p>Luxury malls in Beijing and Shanghai are reducing rents and altering their tenant mix in response to declining consumer spending on luxury goods. Malls like Parkview Green and K11 are attracting mid-market retailers to appeal to middle-class shoppers and address rising vacancy rates. Parkview Green, struggling with mortgage payments and occupancy, was put up for sale. This shift reflects the challenges facing high-end consumption in China, requiring adjustments to brand structure and tenant mix. </p>

            <p>India faces a growing obesity crisis, with abdominal obesity becoming a significant health concern; a Lancet study projects that 450 million Indians could be overweight or obese by 2050. Abdominal obesity, affecting 40% of women and 12% of men, is linked to insulin resistance and chronic diseases. Studies suggest South Asians tend to have more body fat than Caucasians at the same BMI, with excess fat spilling into vital organs. Doctors have redefined obesity guidelines for Asian Indians to better reflect the relationship between body fat and health risks.</p>

This update came after the Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the US.

President Trump is scheduled to meet with El Salvadorian President Nayib Bukele on Monday.</p>
