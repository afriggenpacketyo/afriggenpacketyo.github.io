          <h2>Missed Diplomatic Opportunities Noted at Beijing's Military Parade</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article from the South China Morning Post argues that both the European Union and China missed a significant opportunity for diplomacy during Beijing's recent military parade. The author suggests that by boycotting the event, European leaders lost a chance to engage directly with China and confront Russian President Vladimir Putin on the war in Ukraine. Conversely, China's choice to feature leaders from Russia and North Korea is framed as a preference for convenient alliances over demonstrating true global leadership. The piece concludes that this mutual miscalculation has only deepened existing geopolitical divisions rather than building bridges.</p>

          <p>On the 24th anniversary of the September 11th terrorist attacks, New York City holds its annual memorial ceremony to honor the 2,977 victims. The article recounts the timeline of the 2001 events, when al Qaeda hijackers crashed planes into the World Trade Center's Twin Towers, the Pentagon, and a field in Pennsylvania. It highlights the six moments of silence observed during the ceremony, marking when each plane hit and when the towers collapsed. The piece serves as a solemn reminder of the deadliest attack on U.S. soil and its lasting impact on the nation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank has decided to keep its key interest rates unchanged, holding the deposit facility rate at 2% for the second consecutive meeting. This decision comes as the Eurozone economy grapples with sluggish growth and lingering uncertainty following the implementation of U.S. tariffs. While inflation is near the bank's 2% target, concerns remain about the potential economic impact of trade disputes, particularly after recent threats from the Trump administration. The ECB stated it will maintain a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach without pre-committing to a future rate path. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Real estate platform Opendoor has announced significant leadership changes, appointing former Shopify executive Kaz Nejatian as its new CEO and naming co-founder Keith Rabois as chairman. The news prompted a 36% surge in the company's stock, continuing a dramatic recovery from a near-delisting earlier in the year. The appointments follow the resignation of the previous CEO after a pressure campaign from investors, including Rabois. This leadership shake-up is seen as a pivotal move to stabilize the company, which has recently gained "meme stock" status due to a surge in retail investor interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ireland's state broadcaster, RTÉ, has announced it will not participate in the 2026 Eurovision Song Contest if Israel is allowed to compete, citing the "appalling loss of lives in Gaza." This move adds to growing pressure on the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which organizes the event. Slovenia has made a similar declaration, and Spain's Culture Minister has indicated his country may also withdraw under the same conditions.

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has dismissed Peter Mandelson from his post as the U.K. Ambassador to the United States. The termination follows the release of newly revealed emails detailing the depth of Mandelson's long-standing relationship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. A government statement noted the emails showed a "materially different" connection than was previously known, particularly highlighting Mandelson's suggestion that Epstein's first conviction was wrongful. The decision was made with immediate effect, mindful of the victims of Epstein's crimes, ending the veteran politician's high-profile diplomatic appointment.</p>

While President Trump offered an ambiguous social media post, European leaders are considering new sanctions.

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University, witnesses are describing a scene with surprisingly minimal security presence. Several attendees noted the lack of measures like bag checks and a smaller police presence than is typical for campus sporting events. One witness, who was managing the microphone, recounted hearing a loud pop before seeing Kirk fall, leading to widespread panic and a stampede.

          <p>Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, is facing pressure to clarify how his partner, Laure Ferrari, funded the £885,000 purchase of his constituency home in Clacton. Farage has denied avoiding stamp duty by putting the property in her name, stating she used her own funds from a wealthy family. However, a BBC investigation into French property and company records found little evidence to support this claim of significant family wealth. The inquiry raises questions of potential hypocrisy, as Farage recently criticized another politician for alleged tax avoidance, and he has now sought specialist legal advice on the matter.</p>

          <p>This analysis from The Atlantic argues that "Trumponomics" is not a coherent economic ideology but rather a formula for President Trump to exert personal control over markets and corporations. The author posits that Trump's strategy relies on three components: declaring emergencies to justify intervention, using threats to force compliance, and demanding tribute in the form of financial concessions or investments. This approach is described as erratic and personalist, resembling Gilded Age corruption more than a structured policy like state capitalism. The article suggests this method prioritizes Trump's personal victories over consistent economic goals for the country. (not investment advice)</p>

Researchers found that the emissions from specific "carbon majors" like ExxonMobil, Chevron, and BP made these extreme weather events substantially more likely and intense. The study concluded that a quarter of the analyzed heat waves would have been "virtually impossible" without the climate pollution from these companies. This research adds to a growing body of evidence used in litigation against corporations for climate-change-related damages.</p>

          <p>China's top economic planning agency has approved a major project to expand the shipping capacity at the Three Gorges Dam, a strategic hub in the Yangtze Economic Belt. The initiative, estimated to cost 76.6 billion yuan (US$10.7 billion), involves building a new double-line, five-stage lock system to ease traffic congestion. Described as the largest integrated project on the Yangtze River since the original dam, it is scheduled to be constructed over more than eight years. This move is part of a broader push by Beijing to drive economic growth through strategic infrastructure investments.</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic explores how a push for West Bank annexation by Israel's far-right politicians could unravel the Abraham Accords, considered a major foreign-policy achievement for Donald Trump. The Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab nations, were brokered on the condition that Israel would suspend its annexation plans. Now, with figures like Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich advocating for annexation, key partners like the UAE have warned it would be a "red line." This places President Trump in a difficult position, forcing him to choose between supporting his Israeli allies and preserving his signature diplomatic legacy.</p>

          <p>A photo essay revisits the historic vaccination campaign against polio in the United States during the 1950s. The article notes that at its peak in 1952, polio paralyzed nearly 21,000 people and caused 3,000 deaths in the U.S. alone. Following the widespread introduction of a vaccine in 1955, cases plummeted to fewer than 100 per year within a decade. The images serve as a powerful reminder of one of the most successful public health initiatives in history, showcasing the collective effort that brought a devastating disease under control and transformed modern medicine.</p>

          <p>The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has issued a warning about a rising trend of students hacking into their own schools' IT systems, often for fun or as part of a dare. The watchdog stated that the majority of "insider" data breaches in educational settings are carried out by pupils, who may not understand the seriousness of their actions. In one case, students used downloaded hacking tools to access a database with personal information for over 1,400 students. The ICO is urging schools to recognize the "insider threat" posed by students and improve their cybersecurity measures.</p>

These couples rely on a combination of antiretroviral drugs, preventative pills (PrEP), and condoms to manage the virus and prevent transmission. However, recent U.S. aid cuts and policy shifts have led to shortages of these critical supplies, with some clinics rationing medications. Health organizations report that funding for programs supporting these couples has been eliminated, leaving them uncertain about their future health and safety.</p>

A recent episode of the animated series featured the character Eric Cartman parodying Kirk's style of campus debates. Despite Kirk himself describing the episode as "hilarious" shortly after it aired, some fans are now claiming the show "fomented the hatred necessary" for the attack. This reaction is part of a broader trend among some conservatives to blame "leftist rhetoric" and the media for the killing, even as the shooter's identity and motive remain unknown.</p>

He states that cutting the budgets of public health agencies will not improve them and will have long-term negative effects, such as the recent measles outbreak in Texas.

This decision reflects the escalating technological and geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and China, particularly in the domain of space exploration.
