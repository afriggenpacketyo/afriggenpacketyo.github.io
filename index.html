          <p>Chime, a financial technology company, has officially filed to go public on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol 'CHYM,' emphasizing its status as a tech company rather than a bank and identifying traditional financial institutions like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase as competitors. The company generates revenue through interchange fees from member transactions using Chime debit and credit cards, sharing these fees with partner banks. Chime reported $12.4 million in net income on $518.7 million in revenue for the March quarter, with revenue growing by 32% and active members reaching 8.6 million. However, the IPO is delayed due to market volatility caused by President Trump's tariff announcements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite repeated vows not to cut Medicaid, President Trump is supporting a House Republican bill that aims to slash hundreds of billions of dollars from the program. The bill proposes imposing work requirements, increasing eligibility checks, and penalizing states offering Medicaid to illegal immigrants. Trump has maintained that his administration is only targeting 'fraud' and 'abuse' within the program, while promising to protect Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security. However, critics argue that the proposed cuts contradict Trump's promises and will leave millions without health coverage, sparking pushback from both Democrats and some Republicans in the Senate.</p>

          <p>Despite public dismissals of extreme food shortage warnings, an internal Israeli analysis concludes that Gaza faces a severe crisis unless aid deliveries are quickly restored. Some Israeli military officials privately acknowledge that Palestinians in Gaza face widespread starvation if the blockade continues, contradicting Israel's stance that the blockade poses no major threat to civilian life. The analysis highlights the urgency of the situation, with bakeries and charity kitchens closing and the UN's World Food Program running out of supplies. This acknowledgement within the Israeli security establishment contrasts with the government's public position and aligns with warnings from aid groups about the dangers posed by the blockade.</p>

          <p>Despite the stock market rebounding to pre-tariff levels and inflation showing signs of slowing, investors remain cautious due to uncertainty surrounding President Trump's trade policies. While the administration has delayed some tariffs and promoted potential trade deals, investors are still trying to assess the impact of existing tariffs on consumer spending and corporate profits. The Federal Reserve is also adopting a 'wait-and-see' approach, delaying interest rate cuts until the inflationary effects of tariffs become clearer. This uncertainty is causing businesses to hold off on investment decisions and consumers to reduce spending, potentially slowing economic growth.</p>

          <p>A federal court held its first hearing on President Trump's tariffs, with judges expressing skepticism about the administration's claim that the judiciary cannot review the legality of the tariffs. The case centers on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which permits the president to regulate transactions involving foreign goods to address 'unusual and extraordinary threat[s].' Judges questioned whether a trade deficit qualifies as such a threat and expressed concern about the lack of limits on the president's power to impose tariffs.

          <p>As the United States unexpectedly advances in the T20 Cricket World Cup, NPR provides a primer for new American fans unfamiliar with the sport. Cricket, similar to baseball, involves a bat and ball, but the bowler aims to hit the wicket behind the batsman. A run is scored by hitting the ball across the boundary line or running between the pitches. The World Cup features shorter, three-hour matches, unlike the classical version which can last up to five days. A super over, similar to a free kick in soccer, is used to break ties.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing a deadline to decide whether to defend or scrap Biden-era regulations aimed at enforcing mental health parity. These regulations require insurers to provide 'meaningful benefits' for mental health conditions and measure how policies work in practice. A trade association representing large employers is suing to block the regulations, claiming they overstep authority and increase costs. Mental health advocates are urging the administration to defend the regulations, arguing they are crucial for ensuring access to affordable mental health care.</p>

Doctors question the rationale for a manual prostate exam at Biden's age, given guidelines against routine screening unless symptoms are present. Further evaluation could include a PSA test, MRI, or biopsy, followed by a decision on whether to treat the cancer, which may involve surgery or radiation.</p>

Analysts suggest that gold prices could continue to grow this year, potentially reaching between $3,500 and $3,800, although short-term volatility is expected.

The song is described as a nervous breakdown set to music, with McDonald drawing on personal experiences and the influence of Black female blues singers to create a raw and emotionally resonant portrayal. The production incorporates elements like Tony Kushner's 'Angels in America' and dissonant musical arrangements to heighten the song's impact.</p>
