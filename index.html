          <h2>UK Government Borrowing Exceeds Expectations in June</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 03:12:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK government borrowing in June exceeded expectations, reaching £20.7bn due to increased public spending and debt interest payments linked to inflation. This marks the second-highest June figure since 1993, excluding the pandemic-affected 2020. Economists suggest the larger-than-forecast borrowing will pressure public finances, potentially necessitating further tax rises or spending cuts in the upcoming Autumn Budget to meet fiscal rules. The economic contraction in April and May also indicates labor market weakness affecting revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch is preparing a significant shadow cabinet reshuffle, with Sir James Cleverly expected to return to a high-profile role. Initially anticipated to be minor, the changes are now a larger shake-up aimed at advancing the party's policy renewal and demonstrating unity under new leadership. This move comes as the Tories face pressure to challenge the Labour government, though Labour critics dismiss it as merely shuffling "the same old faces." The full list of changes is expected later today.</p>

          <p>A 4-year-old child was bitten by a mountain lion in Olympic National Park, Washington, prompting their father to intervene heroically and save the child. The child was airlifted to a trauma center and has since been released in satisfactory condition. Park rangers located and dispatched the cougar, which was fitted with a tracking collar, ensuring public safety. Witnesses described hearing screams and praised the father's quick actions, believing he saved the child's life during the rare attack.</p>

          <p>AstraZeneca plans a $50 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing and research by 2030, driven by U.S. trade tariffs favoring domestic production. This includes a new multi-billion dollar facility in Virginia for its weight management portfolio, marking its largest single global manufacturing investment. The move aligns with other pharma firms responding to President Trump's reshoring demands and impending tariffs. This significant commitment supports AstraZeneca's goal of reaching $80 billion in annual revenue by 2030, with a substantial portion from the U.S.</p>

          <p>Flash floods, triggered by heavy monsoon rains in northern Pakistan, have killed at least three tourists and left 15 others missing. A cloudburst caused landslides and blocked a key highway, stranding over 200 local tourists, who were subsequently evacuated by army helicopters. This incident adds to a grim toll of 225 deaths and over 500 injuries nationwide since June 26 due to above-normal monsoon rains. Authorities had previously warned against travel to northern areas, and experts attribute the increase in extreme weather to climate change.</p>

          <p>The UK government is now the main shareholder in the Sizewell C nuclear plant, acquiring a 44.9% stake in the £38 billion project, which has nearly doubled in cost. This substantial investment, the National Wealth Fund's first in nuclear energy, aims to generate clean power for millions of homes and create thousands of jobs. Critics voice concerns over escalating costs and potential new energy bill taxes. Despite this, the project is deemed vital for the UK's long-term energy security, as existing nuclear plants are set to be decommissioned by the early 2030s.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Ukraine and Russia will hold a new round of peace talks in Istanbul on Wednesday, focusing on a prisoner exchange. This development follows U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of "severe" sanctions on Russia if a ceasefire isn't reached within 50 days, and pledges of new U.S. weapons for Ukraine. The talks, the third round in Istanbul, aim to end the protracted war, occurring amidst intensified Russian attacks, including a recent glide bomb strike that killed a child in Kramatorsk.</p>

          <p>North Korea announced plans to construct a third 5,000-ton navy destroyer by October 2026, following the launch of its first in April and the capsizing of a second in May. This ambition reflects leader Kim Jong Un's directive to rapidly develop naval power to defend maritime sovereignty. The announcement comes as South Korea's new president adopts a more dovish stance towards the North, yet Pyongyang continues to prioritize military expansion.</p>

          <p>WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus reported that the Israeli military stormed WHO warehouses and a staff residence in Gaza's Deir al-Balah, forcing evacuations and detaining staff. He stated that male staff were handcuffed, stripped, and interrogated at gunpoint, with one staffer remaining in detention. The main warehouse was also damaged by an attack, rendering it nonfunctional and exacerbating Gaza's depleted medical supplies. Tedros emphasized that compromising WHO operations cripples the entire health response and reiterated the urgent need for a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced "substantial changes" to the compensation scheme for thousands of victims of the infected blood scandal, aiming to restore trust after a critical inquiry report. The changes, costing an additional £1 billion, include allowing payments to be passed on through estates if family members die before their claims are settled by 2031. While victims' groups cautiously welcome the announcement, they express disappointment that some issues, like compensation levels for hepatitis victims, still require further consultation.</p>
