          <p>Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old founder of the conservative group Turning Point USA, was shot and killed during an event at Utah Valley University. His death was confirmed by former President Donald Trump, who described the shooting as horrific and praised Kirk as a pivotal voice for young conservatives. The incident, which Utah's governor called a "political assassination," has sparked a manhunt for the suspected shooter and has drawn widespread, bipartisan condemnation of political violence from leaders across the country.</p>

          <p>A shooting at Evergreen High School in Colorado resulted in two students being wounded and hospitalized with critical injuries. The juvenile male suspect was also injured by what authorities believe were self-inflicted gunshot wounds and is in custody.

          <p>In excerpts from her upcoming book, former Vice President Kamala Harris describes former President Joe Biden's decision to seek re-election as a reckless choice that should not have been left to an individual's ego. Harris, who became the presumptive Democratic nominee after Biden withdrew, also writes about feeling unsupported by the president's inner circle, who she claims fueled negative narratives about her. The memoir offers a critical inside look at the dynamics of the Biden administration.</p>

          <p>Researchers are studying Australia's peacock spiders to understand their extraordinary diversity, with over 100 known species. They hypothesize that the spider's "dark DNA"—the non-gene portion of the genetic code—may be key to its rapid evolution and adaptation. By linking specific genetic information to the spiders' varied colors, songs, and mating dances, scientists hope to uncover general principles that drive the evolution of new species across the natural world.</p>

          <p>Cross-border e-commerce between China and Kazakhstan is expected to grow following a new cooperation agreement. Freedom Bank, part of Freedom Holding, has partnered with UnionPay Business and a virtual payment provider to simplify payment channels in both yuan and U.S. dollars. This move, part of China's broader Belt and Road Initiative, is designed to strengthen economic ties and facilitate trade between the two nations by creating more interoperable financial platforms.</p>

          <p>Warming relations between China, Russia, North Korea, and India are raising concerns among security experts about the formation of a potential "anti-Western alliance." Recent high-profile meetings, including a military parade in Beijing attended by leaders like Vladimir Putin, suggest a strategic shift toward a new global order. Analysts warn that while not a formal military pact, this functional partnership poses a significant challenge to the current international system.</p>

          <p>In a bipartisan vote, the U.S. House of Representatives moved to repeal the legal authorizations for the use of military force in Iraq from 1991 and 2003. The measure reflects a growing effort in Congress to reclaim its constitutional authority over declaring war. Lawmakers argued that the decades-old authorizations are obsolete and risk being abused by presidents to justify new military actions without seeking fresh approval from the legislative branch.</p>

          <p>For the first time since the pandemic began, COVID-19 is no longer one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States, according to early CDC data for 2024. While still a significant cause of mortality, deaths from the virus have steadily declined from their peak in 2021. Heart disease and cancer remain the top two causes of death, reflecting a return to pre-pandemic patterns dominated by chronic diseases.</p>

          <p>Senator Maria Cantwell has cautioned that a new bill regulating college sports, the SCORE Act, would create a "distorted system" favoring the wealthiest athletic conferences. In a letter, she argued the bill would entrench the financial dominance of the Big Ten and SEC, harming smaller schools, student-athletes, and Olympic sports. The bill, supported by the NCAA, would grant a limited antitrust exemption and prevent athletes from being classified as employees.</p>

          <p>A Democratic attempt to compel the public release of files related to the Jeffrey Epstein investigation was narrowly defeated in the Senate by a 51-49 vote. Democrats tried to attach the measure to the annual defense bill, forcing a vote on the high-profile issue. While the effort failed, it highlights the ongoing political pressure to increase transparency in the case, with two Republican senators, Josh Hawley and Rand Paul, crossing party lines to support the release.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is framed in this article as a horrifying symptom of rising political violence in the United States. The analysis argues that such acts represent a failure of discourse, occurring in a deeply polarized society where partisans view political stakes as existential. It connects the assassination to a broader, dangerous trend of individuals resorting to violence to solve political disagreements in a country with widespread access to firearms.</p>
