          <p>A recent CNBC Fed Survey reveals that 82% of economists, fund managers, and strategists believe President Trump's actions are an effort to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence. A majority of these experts predict this political pressure will lead to negative economic outcomes, including weaker growth, higher inflation, and increased unemployment in the United States. While respondents are nearly certain the Fed will cut interest rates by a quarter point this week, there is significant disagreement on whether this is the correct policy decision. The survey also notes that recession probability has jumped to 40%, with tariffs and administration policy uncertainty cited as the top threats to the expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Luckin Coffee, which has surpassed Starbucks as China's largest coffee chain, is now expanding into the United States with several locations already open in New York City. The company operates with a cashier-less, app-based model that relies heavily on deep discounts and coupons to attract customers and build brand awareness. While this strategy has fueled rapid growth, analysts note that its initial US stores are operating at a loss, a stark contrast to Starbucks's focus on per-store profitability. Luckin is also working to rebuild its reputation after a 2020 accounting fraud scandal led to its delisting from the Nasdaq stock exchange.</p>

          <p>French flanker Axelle Berthoumieu has been suspended for 12 matches after admitting to biting Irish player Aoife Wafer during a Women's Rugby World Cup quarterfinal match. The incident, which was not penalized on the field at the time, was reviewed after the game following a citing by the commissioner. Berthoumieu has appealed the length of the suspension, which would sideline her for the remainder of the tournament and prevent her from playing until March. France's team captain, Manaé Feleu, is also appealing a separate three-game suspension for a dangerous tackle, further challenging the team's prospects in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Sources familiar with negotiations indicate that technology company Oracle is part of a consortium that would allow TikTok to continue its US operations under a new framework deal between the United States and China. While the exact structure remains unclear, the agreement involves multiple companies, though the level of control by TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, is still being determined. This development follows a 2024 law requiring ByteDance to divest from TikTok or face a ban, a measure President Trump has repeatedly delayed. Oracle has previously partnered with TikTok to manage US user data, and its co-founder Larry Ellison is known to be a friend of the president.</p>

          <p>US Vice President JD Vance has publicly endorsed a mass "doxing" campaign aimed at identifying and harassing individuals perceived as insufficiently mournful following the assassination of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. While guest-hosting Kirk's podcast, Vance encouraged listeners to call out people celebrating the murder and even contact their employers, leading to numerous firings across the country. This effort is part of a broader push by Trump allies to link Kirk's killing to a supposed left-wing terror movement, raising fears among civil liberties advocates of a new era of McCarthyism and a crackdown on free speech.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel is set to face a Senate Judiciary Committee oversight hearing amid growing scrutiny of his leadership and his handling of the Charlie Kirk assassination investigation. Criticism has focused on a since-retracted social media post in which Patel prematurely announced a suspect was in custody, as well as a series of recent firings of senior FBI officials. While Democrats on the committee have signaled they will press Patel on these issues, key Senate Republicans have indicated they still have confidence in his leadership. Patel has defended his actions, stating his controversial post was an attempt to be transparent with the public during a fast-moving situation.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that President Trump's credible willingness to let TikTok be banned in the United States was the critical factor that compelled China to agree to a deal framework. Bessent explained that the president made it clear that national security concerns would not be compromised for the sake of a commercial agreement. The commercial terms of the deal between parent company ByteDance and new investors had been largely settled for months but were put on hold by China after a major tariff announcement by Trump. A final agreement is expected to be reached in an upcoming call between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has directed the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to launch a new investigation into how the security service MI5 provided false evidence to three separate courts. The case revolves around MI5's handling of a neo-Nazi informant, known as Agent X, who used his protected status to coerce and attack his girlfriend. The security service had falsely claimed to courts that it had not confirmed the agent's identity to the BBC, a position it maintained until presented with recorded evidence to the contrary. Previous internal inquiries absolved MI5 of deliberate wrongdoing, but senior judges rejected those findings, citing serious procedural deficiencies.</p>

While the US sent a lower-level delegate, representatives from over 100 countries are in attendance.

Her move follows the defection of sitting MP Danny Kruger, signaling growing momentum for the right-wing party. In response, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch asserted that her party has a plan for economic growth, while dismissing Reform as being focused on internal political drama rather than substantive issues affecting the public.</p>

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk has released promising late-stage trial data for its new obesity treatment, Cagrilinitide, which could become a successor to its popular drug Wegovy. The phase 3 trial showed that patients taking the once-weekly injection achieved an average weight loss of 11.8% after 68 weeks, significantly more than the placebo group. Cagrilinitide works differently from existing GLP-1 drugs like Wegovy, acting as a long-acting amylin analogue to increase feelings of fullness. The treatment was also described as well-tolerated, with mainly mild gastrointestinal side effects, a key factor as the company seeks alternatives for patients.</p>

The human remains, found in crouched positions with cuts and burn marks, were likely preserved through a process of smoke-drying over a fire by ancient hunter-gatherer communities. This practice, which predates the famous Egyptian and Chinchorro mummies by thousands of years, is believed to have allowed people to maintain physical and spiritual connections with their deceased ancestors. The findings suggest this funerary tradition may have been widespread across the region, with similar practices still found in some Indigenous communities today.</p>

Dabhoiwala traces the idea's origins to 18th-century English political tracts, noting that societies have always balanced expression with the need to regulate harms like defamation and incitement.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled in a 2-1 decision that President Donald Trump does not have the authority to remove Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook from her position. The ruling is a setback for the president, who had announced his intention to fire Cook, a Biden appointee, on grounds of alleged mortgage fraud, which she denies. The decision allows Cook to participate in this week's pivotal Fed policy meeting where an interest rate cut is expected. This case tests the legal boundaries of presidential power over the historically independent central bank, as the law states governors may only be removed "for cause."</p>

          <p>A group calling itself the "Kingdom of Kubala" has been formally evicted by sheriff officers from privately owned woodland near Jedburgh, Scotland, where they had been living for several weeks. The three members, who claim ancestral rights to the land, complied with the eviction order but immediately set up a new camp just a few meters away on the other side of a fence. The group, led by individuals from Ghana and Zimbabwe, has gained a significant online following while asserting their right to reclaim land they say was stolen from their ancestors. Local officials stated the landowners were left with no choice but to seek court intervention.</p>

          <p>Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old suspect arrested for the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, is expected to face formal charges on Tuesday. Utah County officials will hold a press conference to announce the charges following Robinson's first scheduled court appearance. Robinson was apprehended after his father recognized him in photos released by authorities and convinced him to turn himself in. While a motive has not been officially released, President Trump and other officials have claimed the suspect was radicalized online with "leftist ideology." Investigators are continuing to examine electronic devices and online chats for further evidence in the case.</p>

          <p>The suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, appeared to claim responsibility for the attack in messages on the Discord platform hours before his arrest. A Discord spokesperson confirmed to CBS that an account allegedly belonging to Robinson posted, "It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this," in a group chat. The messages were reportedly sent near the end of the 33-hour manhunt for the killer. Robinson, who is due in court for his first appearance, was arrested on suspicion of aggravated murder and other felonies after his father reportedly persuaded him to surrender.</p>

          <p>Villarreal manager Marcelino has stated that midfielder Thomas Partey is prepared to play in the team's Champions League match against Tottenham. The confirmation comes just one day before Partey is scheduled to appear at Southwark Crown Court for a plea hearing. The 32-year-old Ghanaian international was charged last month with five counts of sexual assault against two women and an additional charge of sexual assault against a third woman. The alleged offenses occurred between 2021 and 2022 while he was playing for Arsenal; Partey denies all charges and was granted conditional bail before signing with the Spanish club.</p>

          <p>New government figures reveal that the number of people receiving winter fuel payments fell from approximately 11 million to just 1.3 million last year after a controversial policy change. The Treasury had decided to means-test the payment, restricting it to pensioners on low-income benefits like pension credit. However, following a significant backlash, Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a U-turn in June. The policy has now been revised so that pensioners with an annual income of £35,000 or less will be eligible, restoring the payment for over three-quarters of pensioners for the upcoming winter to help them cover rising energy bills.</p>

          <p>For the first time, scientists have definitively identified the source of a vibrant turquoise blue color in Jackson Pollock's iconic 1948 painting, "Number 1A, 1948." By analyzing paint scrapings with lasers, researchers created a chemical fingerprint confirming the pigment is manganese blue, a synthetic color once used by artists but phased out by the 1990s due to environmental concerns. This discovery not only provides new insight into the materials used by the abstract expressionist but also showcases how scientific techniques can be used to conserve and authenticate historical artworks. The research helps to understand the methodical process behind Pollock's seemingly chaotic "action painting" style.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK state pension is expected to rise by 4.7% next April, based on the latest average earnings growth data from the Office for National Statistics. Under the government's "triple lock" policy, the pension increases annually by the highest of inflation, average earnings, or 2.5%. This likely increase would raise the new state pension by over £500 a year, bringing it to £12,534.60 annually. However, as the personal tax allowance remains frozen at £12,570, this raise will push more pensioners into paying income tax for the first time, a growing concern for retirees.

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has informed suppliers that its factories will remain shut down until at least September 24 following a major cyber attack, but industry sources fear the disruption could last into November. The hack, which occurred over two weeks ago, paralyzed the company's IT systems and global production, costing an estimated £50 million per week. While a criminal investigation is ongoing, concerns are mounting over the financial stability of JLR's supply chain, with many smaller businesses at risk of bankruptcy due to the extended stoppage.

Chinese companies are also reportedly holding out for another, more powerful downgraded chip, the B30A, hoping it will receive approval from Washington.

          <p>The state of Mississippi has declared a public health emergency due to a surging infant mortality rate, its highest in over a decade. This crisis coincides with the suspension of the state's participation in the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (Prams), a critical CDC data collection program. The halt is attributed to the Trump administration's restructuring of the CDC's Division of Reproductive Health, which has lost most of its staff. Without Prams data, which provides detailed information on maternal and infant health, researchers and policymakers lose a vital tool for designing effective interventions to address the very crisis the state is now facing.</p>

This lack of support for the popular 33-year-old democratic socialist has drawn criticism from figures like Bernie Sanders, who called the party's hesitation "crazy" given Mamdani's ability to energize young and first-time voters. The reluctance is attributed to fears that Mamdani's socialist label could harm Democrats in national elections, as well as his policy positions on taxing the wealthy and his criticism of Israel's actions in Gaza.</p>
