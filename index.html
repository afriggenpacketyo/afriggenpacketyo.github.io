          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, slightly exceeding economists' predictions but decelerating from the previous quarter's growth. The data reflects underlying fragility, with key indicators like retail sales and fixed asset investment showing weakness, while industrial output proved stronger than expected. Despite resilient exports and government stimulus measures aimed at offsetting US trade tensions, economists remain cautious, pointing to insufficient domestic demand and calling for further fiscal support to ensure sustainable growth.

They argue that provisions designed to make it cheaper for leaseholders to extend leases or buy freeholds violate their human rights to private property. While the landowners claim the law could cost them hundreds of millions and impact their charitable work, leasehold campaigners fear the legal battle will stall crucial, long-awaited reforms.</p>

The lightning-sparked Green fire and the Orleans Complex fires have collectively burned nearly 20,000 acres, with containment proving difficult due to inaccessibility and thick smoke that has hampered aerial firefighting efforts.</p>
