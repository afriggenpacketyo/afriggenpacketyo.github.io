          <p>America's oldest-running distillery, Buffalo Trace in Frankfort, Kentucky, has reopened just in time for the Kentucky Derby after being hit by severe flooding. The Kentucky River rose to over 48 feet, inundating the 400-acre campus with several feet of water, damaging every building on the site. Despite the extensive damage and a history of weathering storms, the distillery has no plans to relocate and is committed to remaining in Frankfort. The reopening is a positive step for the community, which depends on the distillery for jobs and economic stability.</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist highlights the benefits and drawbacks of antidepressant medications, noting that while they can be transformative for some, others experience sexual side effects, manic episodes, or severe withdrawal symptoms. The article points out the lack of research into safe tapering methods, leaving patients to rely on online communities for guidance. Despite evidence supporting short-term effectiveness, questions remain about long-term effects and potential harm, especially given that millions take antidepressants for extended periods. The author urges the medical community to address patient concerns with humility and transparency to avoid losing credibility to those who might exploit their suffering.</p>

          <p>European allies are expressing shock and concern over President Trump's actions during his second term, particularly regarding trade and NATO. Trump's tariff war and rhetoric about Europe taking advantage of the U.S. have undermined trade relationships, creating uncertainty for businesses like French winemakers. Furthermore, Trump's insistence on European NATO members increasing defense spending has shaken the alliance, with Europeans fearing potential abandonment by the U.S. despite their increased investment in defense. The article suggests a growing perception in Europe that the U.S. is less committed to the transatlantic relationship than vice versa.</p>

The decision follows a report highlighting the importance of cash for certain groups, such as those with learning disabilities and those budgeting carefully. While the government has no plans to mandate cash acceptance, Uber's expansion demonstrates a recognition of cash's continued relevance in the UK.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the reinstatement of over 1,000 Voice of America (VoA) employees, reversing a lower court ruling that had temporarily stayed Donald Trump's executive order to dismantle the US taxpayer-funded news service. The decision effectively defers to the executive branch on employment matters, likely silencing VoA broadcasts until the case is resolved. While a lower court had previously ruled the executive order was arbitrary and exceeded presidential authority, the appeals court's decision upholds the freeze on funds for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and Middle East Broadcasting Networks.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used to help qualifying students pay for private school tuition. The bill provides most students attending accredited private schools with $10,000 per year, students with disabilities with up to $30,000 per year, and home-schooled students with $2,000 a year. Democrats argue that the legislation will hurt public schools, while supporters claim it empowers parents to choose the best educational option for their children.</p>
