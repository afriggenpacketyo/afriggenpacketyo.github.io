          <p>The Bundesliga is experiencing a significant talent drain, with key players like Florian Wirtz and Thomas Müller moving to other leagues. This exodus, coupled with a struggle to attract global stars, highlights a systemic issue for German football. Financially, the Bundesliga lags behind the Premier League in revenue and TV rights, and even attendance figures have recently fallen. Former Bayern chairman Oliver Kahn and other experts warn that the league is losing prestige and must address its perceived mediocrity to retain top talent and competitiveness.</p>

          <p>Myanmar's military junta has declared the first phase of a general election for late December, marking the first poll since the 2021 coup. The election, intended to legitimize the junta, faces significant challenges due to an ongoing civil war and widespread opposition control in many areas. Critics, including the banned National League for Democracy, view the vote as a sham, with many groups vowing a boycott. This situation raises serious doubts about the election's credibility and the possibility of a peaceful resolution.</p>

          <p>Google and Kairos Power are collaborating with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to deploy an advanced nuclear plant, Hermes 2, by 2030, marking the first U.S. utility power purchase agreement with such a reactor. This initiative aims to provide carbon-free power for Google's data centers, with Kairos and Google bearing the financial risk to avoid consumer cost burdens. The project seeks to standardize reactor design and develop supply infrastructure, potentially ushering in a new era of more affordable and safer nuclear construction in the U.S. The smaller, liquid salt-cooled reactor design offers advantages over traditional large plants.</p>

          <p>Over 500 pages of investigative documents in the University of Idaho student murders reveal new insights into the victims and killer Bryan Kohberger. Victim Kaylee Goncalves had expressed fears of being stalked, including incidents at her home and a grocery store, and even a car break-in where her underwear was stolen. The documents also detail Kohberger's "inappropriate behavior" and condescending attitude towards women at Washington State University, with some peers labeling him a "possible future rapist." Kohberger has since pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder, avoiding the death penalty and receiving life sentences.</p>

New entries include "skibidi," a versatile slang term from a viral YouTube series, and "delulu," a shortened form of delusional. The dictionary also incorporated "tradwife," describing a woman embracing traditional gender roles, and "broligarchy," referring to a powerful group of tech men. These additions, along with terms like "mouse jiggler" for remote work, are selected for their perceived staying power in common usage.</p>

          <p>Newsmax has agreed to pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems, related to false claims aired about the 2020 election being rigged. This settlement follows a similar, larger payout by Fox News to Dominion. The lawsuit accused Newsmax of featuring individuals who spread baseless conspiracy theories about Dominion's equipment and alleged connections. The agreement avoids a trial that was scheduled to begin in October, marking another significant financial consequence for media outlets that promoted unverified election fraud narratives.</p>

          <p>A large-scale experiment in rural Kenya has revealed that unconditional cash transfers significantly reduce infant and child mortality, proving as effective as medical interventions like vaccines. Infants born to families receiving $1,000 were nearly half as likely to die, with a 70% drop in deaths around birth. The cash enabled families to access healthcare facilities and better nutrition, with children 44% less likely to go to bed hungry. This study highlights the profound impact of economic support on health outcomes, especially when healthcare access is financially constrained.</p>

          <p>U.S. documentary filmmakers are facing a severe federal funding shortfall after the Corporation for Public Broadcasting's budget was rescinded, leading to PBS budget cuts and grant cancellations at the National Endowments.

          <p>Raging wildfires across Spain and Portugal have claimed four lives, including two firefighters, prompting Spain to deploy an additional 500 troops to battle the blazes. Tens of thousands of residents have been evacuated in Spain, particularly from Castile and León, where air quality is severely affected. The fires, exacerbated by heatwave conditions linked to climate change, have burned hundreds of thousands of hectares this year. Both nations have activated the European Civil Protection Mechanism for international assistance, as authorities continue to combat the widespread destruction.</p>

          <p>The UK media watchdog Ofcom has opted not to investigate the latest series of Love Island, despite receiving over 14,000 complaints regarding alleged bullying, abusive behavior, and misogyny. While acknowledging emotionally charged scenes, Ofcom stated that negative behavior was not portrayed positively and contestants were shown supporting each other. The watchdog also noted the show's established format and viewer expectations for relationship challenges. ITV maintains that participants receive training on respectful behavior and comprehensive psychological support, refuting allegations of biased editing or racism.</p>

          <p>Hamas negotiators in Cairo have reportedly received a new proposal for a Gaza ceasefire, outlining an initial 60-day truce and a two-batch hostage release. This development comes as international human rights groups accuse Israel of a deliberate starvation policy in Gaza, a claim Israel denies. The conflict, nearing its 23rd month, has resulted in over 62,000 Palestinian deaths. Egyptian, Qatari, and U.S. mediators are intensifying efforts to secure an agreement that would also ensure unrestricted humanitarian aid flow into the besieged territory.</p>

          <p>The opening weekend of the Premier League season highlighted Liverpool's defensive issues, particularly their susceptibility to counter-attacks, a stark contrast to their previous season's record. Despite attacking reinforcements, the team's balance appeared off, with misplaced midfield passes and numerous players committed forward leaving them exposed. While sloppy passing is a factor, the article suggests manager Arne Slot may need to adjust full-back or central midfielder positions for better defensive protection. The analysis also touches on tactical changes for other top clubs like Manchester City and Arsenal.</p>

          <p>While Hurricane Erin poses a direct threat to the U.S. East Coast, its remnants are forecast to bring unsettled, wet, and windy weather to the UK next week. Meteorologists clarify that reports of a "600-mile wall of rain" are physically impossible, as the low-pressure system containing Erin's remnants will be typical in size. The storm, currently over 3,000 miles away, will weaken as it crosses the Atlantic. Despite uncertainties, the UK can expect a shift from settled weather towards more autumnal conditions by mid-week.</p>

Having used them to secure jobs, make connections, and launch ventures, Contois emphasizes that the worst outcome is no response. She advises making requests as easy as possible for the recipient, keeping messages concise, and showing genuine passion. This low-risk, high-reward approach, she argues, can lead to "astronomical" career growth by creating opportunities outside one's existing network.</p>

          <p>The labor market is experiencing a shift from "job-hopping" to "job hugging," where workers are holding onto their current positions due to economic uncertainty and a cooling job market. Consultants describe "job hugging" as clinging to a job "for dear life," a stark contrast to the high quit rates of previous years. This trend is driven by low hiring and layoff rates, making workers nervous about finding new employment. While staying in a job isn't inherently bad, experts warn it could lead to stagnated earnings and skills development if workers become too comfortable.</p>
