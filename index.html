While the yuan already functions well in cross-border settlements, China needs to deepen its financial markets to attract foreign investment in yuan-denominated assets. The economist suggests China should model its existing 'connect' schemes with Hong Kong, which allows foreign investors to buy mainland Chinese bonds and stocks without special licenses.

          <p>A trade reset between the US and China, involving reduced tariffs, could jeopardize India's aspirations to become a global manufacturing hub. While Apple's plans to shift iPhone production to India initially boosted hopes, the US-China agreement might cause manufacturing investment to stall or return to China. Despite the trade reset, some analysts believe that a larger strategic decoupling between China and the US will continue to benefit India in the long run. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis came after Mr. Biden reported urinary symptoms, which led doctors to find a small nodule on his prostate. While this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management. The president and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.</p>

Fury is a collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) that's designed to work in coordination with a manned aircraft. Schrimpf told 60 Minutes that Fury would work in conjunction with a manned aircraft flying behind it, spotting enemies and protecting the manned aircraft. Components, like the landing gear, use common parts that are more readily available in the United States when compared to a typical fighter jet, which could make it easier and cheaper to mass produce.</p>
