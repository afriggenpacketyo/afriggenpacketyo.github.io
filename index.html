          <p>Andrea Kimi Antonelli became the youngest driver to secure a Formula 1 pole position during the sprint race at the Miami Grand Prix, outperforming seasoned drivers like George Russell and Max Verstappen. Antonelli's impressive performance included a significant 0.309-second lead over Russell, despite Russell and Verstappen using two sets of tires. Lewis Hamilton, who previously won a sprint in China, finished seventh, trailing his teammate Charles Leclerc. Alex Albon and Fernando Alonso rounded out the top ten, while Carlos Sainz missed the top ten due to a mistake on his final lap, and Yuki Tsunoda was knocked out in the first session.</p>

          <p>United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights daily from Newark Liberty International Airport, representing about 10% of its Newark schedule, due to ongoing air traffic controller staffing shortages and FAA technology problems. CEO Scott Kirby stated that 20% of Newark's air traffic controllers had recently stopped working after technology failures, exacerbating existing understaffing issues. The FAA acknowledged staffing delays at Newark, prompting United to request flight restrictions similar to those at LaGuardia and Reagan National. Kirby mentioned speaking with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and commended the Trump administration's commitment to upgrading air traffic control infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the BfV, has classified the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party as "extremist," citing the party's ethnically defined concept of the people and anti-migrant stance. The AfD criticized the decision as politically motivated, while U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called it "tyranny in disguise." The classification enables the BfV to closely monitor the AfD, which secured a significant portion of votes in recent elections, and intercept party communications, with conservative leader Friedrich Merz set to become chancellor in a coalition government. The BfV's decision followed a 1,100-page report and a court case loss for the AfD.</p>

          <p>President Trump has renewed his threat to revoke Harvard University's tax-exempt status, claiming the school deserves it, although it remains unclear if the IRS is proceeding with the change. Harvard responded that there is no legal basis for such an action, which would harm its educational mission and financial aid programs. The university rejected government demands to alter admissions and hiring policies, leading to a lawsuit after the administration froze federal funds. Democratic senators have requested an investigation into Trump's targeting of Harvard, while tax experts believe a court would likely side with the school.</p>

The AfD, which came second in federal elections, condemned the decision as politically motivated, while the intelligence agency stated that the party's concept of the people is incompatible with the free democratic order.

          <p>Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was seen using a modified version of the Signal app to communicate with other Trump administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, prior to his ouster. The app appeared to be a version of Signal with modifications from TeleMessage, a company that adds archiving capabilities, raising concerns about the security of the messages. While the White House stated that Signal is an approved app for government use, the altered PIN verification message suggested the use of TeleMessage, which could potentially undermine Signal's end-to-end encryption. The use of Signal by top Trump officials to discuss military strikes earlier in the year had already triggered controversy.</p>

The Liberal Democrats and the Greens also gained seats, highlighting the increasing fragmentation of the British political landscape.

The administration argues that restricting DOGE's access hinders efforts to eliminate waste and fraud in government systems.

          <p>Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, is launching Worldcoin in the U.S., using Orbs that scan a person's retina to verify they are human. The startup aims to create a digital ID to distinguish humans from bots and AI. Worldcoin, which debuted internationally in 2023, has faced privacy concerns, leading to government shutdowns in some countries. The Orb doesn't store biometric data but uses photos stored on the user's device. The rollout in the U.S. is expected to be bolstered by looser crypto regulations under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Durga Chew-Bose's remake of FranÃ§oise Sagan's "Bonjour Tristesse" offers a confident and dreamy retelling of the classic summer tale. While the film captures the allure of the French Riviera and features an attractive cast, it delves deeper into the characters' motivations, sometimes over-intellectualizing the narrative. ChloÃ« Sevigny delivers a standout performance as Anne, embodying emotional susceptibility beneath a veneer of intelligence. The film's hyperaware dialogue occasionally undermines the recklessness and delusion at the story's core.</p>
