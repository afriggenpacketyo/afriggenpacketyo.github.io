          <p>UK featherweight Lerone Murphy has positioned himself as a top contender for the UFC title after a spectacular first-round knockout of Aaron Pico at UFC 319. Taking the fight on just three weeks' notice, Murphy used a spinning back elbow to secure the victory, extending his undefeated record to 17 wins. The performance earned him a $50,000 bonus and praise from UFC President Dana White, with commentators suggesting he is next in line for a championship bout. The event also saw Khamzat Chimaev win the middleweight title in a historically dominant performance.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has legislated an end to the Air Canada flight attendants' strike, forcing both parties into binding arbitration less than 12 hours after the work stoppage began. The strike, which occurred during the peak summer travel season, had already stranded over 100,000 travelers and led to hundreds of flight cancellations. Jobs Minister Patty Hajdu cited economic risks as a reason for the swift intervention, while the union accused the government of violating workers' constitutional right to strike. The airline's operations are expected to take several days to fully resume.</p>

          <p>Phoenix cold case detectives successfully obtained a DNA sample from Bryan Patrick Miller, a suspect in the 1990s "canal murders," during a carefully orchestrated undercover meeting at a Chili's restaurant. Posing as a security consultant offering a job, a detective met Miller for a meal, allowing an undercover team to collect the water glass he used. Although the detective was initially skeptical that the mild-mannered Miller could be the killer, the DNA from the glass provided a direct match to evidence found on victims Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas. Miller was subsequently arrested and convicted.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, the Trump administration will permit Nvidia and AMD to sell certain AI chips to Chinese companies, reversing a previous export ban. The deal includes a novel "revenue-sharing" provision requiring the companies to give 15% of their revenue from these sales to the U.S. government. This arrangement has sparked concerns among trade experts who warn it sets a dangerous precedent of making national security-based export controls appear to be for sale. The legality of what critics call an "export tax" is reportedly still being examined by the Department of Commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

This cultural diplomacy comes as Ukraine's Ministry of Culture has also claimed Repin, known there as Illia Riepin, as part of its national cultural heritage. The exhibition's design in Beijing uses classical architectural elements to evoke his time studying in St. Petersburg.</p>

          <p>Actress Sydney Sweeney has posted on social media for the first time since her controversial "Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans" ad campaign for American Eagle was released. The campaign, which played on the double meaning of "genes" and "jeans," sparked a divided online response, with some critics calling it "tone-deaf" with racial undertones, while others praised it. American Eagle defended the campaign, stating it was always about the jeans. Sweeney, who has not publicly commented on the controversy, shared photos from a night out with friends, seemingly moving on from the debate.</p>

          <p>The investigation into the death of Angela Craig was initiated after a suspicious package containing potassium cyanide was delivered to her husband's dental practice. Dr. James Craig had instructed his staff not to open the package, but an employee did so accidentally, later connecting the substance to Angela's mysterious and severe symptoms. This employee alerted Craig's business partner, who then informed a hospital nurse, prompting a homicide investigation even before Angela was declared dead. This crucial tip led police to uncover evidence that James Craig allegedly purchased poisons to murder his wife.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have created a new method that produces exceptionally clear and accurate three-dimensional images of the brain and other organs. The technique works by preparing tissue to become "ionic glassy," which makes it highly transparent while perfectly preserving its original structure and shape. This process also enhances the brightness of fluorescent dyes used to highlight specific cells, allowing for more vivid visualization of the brain's inner workings. The treated tissues form a stable, glassy solid at low temperatures, enabling long-term storage without degradation.</p>

The article identifies five common triggers: a lifetime of being "good" and repressing personal identity, perfectionism as a response to trauma, having poor boundaries from being parentified as a child, being in an abusive marriage, and reacting to a recent significant loss. These factors can create internal pressure that makes an illicit relationship feel like a form of escape or self-reclamation.</p>

          <p>A small private plane made a successful emergency landing on the I-805 highway in San Diego on Saturday afternoon due to apparent mechanical issues. The aircraft was reportedly flying from Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport to the nearby Marine Corps Air Station Miramar when the incident occurred. The California Highway Patrol responded to the scene in the Sorrento Valley area. Fortunately, no injuries were reported among the plane's occupants or drivers on the highway, though the landing caused a temporary closure of all southbound lanes.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators marched peacefully in Washington D.C. to protest President Trump's recent executive order declaring a "crime emergency" and federalizing aspects of the city's policing. The protest followed an attempt by the administration to install a new "emergency police commissioner" to control the D.C. police force, an effort that was blocked by a lawsuit. Protesters expressed concern over what they see as a federal overreach and a "fascist takeover," challenging the president's narrative of rampant crime in the city. Organizers have indicated that more protests are planned.</p>

          <h2>Chinese E-Commerce Merchants Express Anxiety Over Potential U.S. Tariffs</h2>

          <p>Chinese sellers on major e-commerce platforms like Amazon, Shein, and Temu remain concerned about the potential impact of U.S. tariffs, despite a current truce in the trade war. At a recent trade fair, merchants expressed worry over "policy uncertainties" that could disrupt their access to the large American market. One electronics company noted it had to suspend its U.S. business for nearly two months earlier in the year when bilateral tensions escalated. This ongoing anxiety highlights the vulnerability of these businesses to geopolitical friction between Washington and Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>
