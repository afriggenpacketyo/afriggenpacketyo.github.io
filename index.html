          <p>The decades-long search for Jodi Huisentruit, an Iowa news anchor who disappeared in 1995, continues as a private investigator fights to unseal case records. A judge partially unsealed a 2017 search warrant connected to the case but kept the supporting affidavit sealed to protect the ongoing investigation, a decision challenged by the investigator's legal team. The family of Huisentruit has expressed reservations about unsealing the documents, fearing it could hinder the investigation. Huisentruit's disappearance remains a mystery, with her vehicle and signs of a struggle found at her apartment on the day she went missing.</p>

          <p>Livia Tossici-Bolt, a prominent anti-abortion campaigner, was found guilty of breaching a Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) for holding signs outside an abortion clinic in Bournemouth, UK. Tossici-Bolt argued her actions were merely an invitation to speak and not covered by the safe zone, but the court disagreed, emphasizing the need to protect women seeking medical treatment from harassment. The case has drawn international attention, with support from US anti-abortion groups and even the US State Department, which has been criticized for meddling in UK reproductive rights issues.

          <p>Two Labour MPs, Yuan Yang and Abtisam Mohamed, were denied entry to Israel, sparking criticism from the UK Foreign Office. Israeli authorities claimed the MPs intended to "spread hate speech," a charge the MPs vehemently denied, asserting their aim was to witness the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory firsthand. Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the move unacceptable and counterproductive, emphasizing the importance of parliamentarians being able to scrutinize the conflict. Both MPs have been vocal about the Israel-Hamas conflict and the need to comply with international humanitarian law, which may have influenced the decision to deny them entry.</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese seismologists warns of an increased risk of major earthquakes in China and neighboring regions, linking seismic cycles to fluctuations in the Earth's rotation. Published shortly before a devastating earthquake in Myanmar, the research analyzes 150 years of seismic data to identify periods of heightened earthquake activity. The findings have sparked debate about whether the planet's tectonic stress fields are entering a dangerous new phase. The study's timing and predictions have raised concerns about potential future seismic events in the region.</p>

The Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi voiced their concerns in a letter, emphasizing that lower tariffs would benefit U.S. companies and consumers. This comes as President Trump and Vietnamese leader To Lam agreed to discuss a deal to remove tariffs, following Vietnam's concessions, including cutting duties and pledging to purchase more American goods.

          <p>Sales of Hudson's Bay Company's (HBC) striped merchandise have surged as the company liquidates its department stores nationwide, transforming the iconic stripes into a sought-after symbol of Canadian heritage. The increased demand has allowed HBC to save some stores from liquidation, but many others are still set to close. Founded in 1670, HBC played a significant role in Canada's history, and its striped blankets have become a symbol of national identity. The stripes now appear on a wide range of products, repurposed by designers and cherished by consumers.</p>

          <p>China is facing an escalating obesity crisis, with projections indicating that over 65% of adults could be overweight or obese by 2030. This surge in obesity is raising concerns about the potential strain on the country's healthcare system due to chronic diseases like hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular problems. In response, the Chinese government has launched a three-year plan that includes diet and exercise recommendations, and it is introducing multidisciplinary "weight management clinics" at hospitals across the nation. A study published in The Lancet revealed that the number of overweight or obese adults in China had already surpassed 400 million by 2021.</p>
