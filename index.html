          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo's independent bid to succeed him, following Adams' decision to suspend his own re-election campaign. The endorsement comes as Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani holds a significant lead in recent polls against both Cuomo and Republican candidate Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani criticized the move, framing it as an alliance between two figures representing corruption and big money interests. The endorsement consolidates the moderate opposition to Mamdani, who secured the Democratic nomination after a surprising primary victory.</p>

          <p>The demolition of the White House East Wing is reportedly almost finished to accommodate President Trump's planned 90,000-square-foot ballroom, a project now estimated to cost $300 million. The administration states the project is being privately financed by corporate and individual donors, releasing a list that includes major tech companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google. Initially, President Trump claimed the project would not impact the existing structure, but he later stated that taking down the wing was necessary to complete the construction properly, drawing criticism from preservationists.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that California Democrats are more supportive of Governor Gavin Newsom running for president in 2028 compared to former Vice President Kamala Harris. While Newsom's overall approval rating in the state is positive, California voters are divided on whether he should seek the presidency. The survey also indicates that few Californians believe their state sets a good example for the nation on key issues like housing, tax, or economic policy. Most independents in the state do not think either Newsom or Harris should run for president.</p>

It also notes that acting now might be advantageous, as waiting could lead to increased competition during the traditional spring buying season if rates fall further.

          <p>Following a week of sharp fluctuations, the price of gold has become increasingly volatile, driven by competing factors like Federal Reserve rate cuts and a stronger stock market. The article outlines three potential strategies for investors looking to capitalize on these price swings. These include trading the stocks of gold mining companies, which can offer leveraged exposure, or using more liquid instruments like gold-backed ETFs for short-term plays. For long-term investors, the article suggests strategically buying physical gold during price dips to hedge against broader economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

The Bureau of Labor Statistics is releasing the data, which was held up by the government shutdown, because it is needed to calculate the annual Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA). The expected COLA is around 2.7%, which would increase the average monthly Social Security payment by about $54. The rising inflation is partly attributed to the Trump administration's tariffs, which are being passed on to consumers.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is currently moving very slowly over the warm waters of the central Caribbean and is forecast to intensify into a major hurricane by early next week. The National Hurricane Center warns that the storm will bring days of heavy rainfall, with totals of 6 to 12 inches expected in parts of Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. This rainfall is likely to cause significant and life-threatening flash flooding and landslides across the region. A hurricane watch and a tropical storm warning are already in effect for Jamaica and southwestern Haiti.</p>

          <p>A bill designed to make IRS notices for simple tax return mistakes more understandable for taxpayers has been passed by Congress and is now awaiting the president's signature. The legislation, known as the IRS MATH Act, addresses complaints that the current "math error" notices are often unclear about the nature of the mistake and the steps required for correction. Lawmakers and taxpayer advocates argue that filers should not have to struggle to understand why the IRS has adjusted their tax assessment, especially when they only have 60 days to respond before the changes become final.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global oil prices jumped more than 5% after the Trump administration imposed new sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. The Treasury Department stated the sanctions were a response to Moscow's "lack of serious commitment" to ending the war in Ukraine and are intended to damage the Kremlin's ability to fund its military efforts. The move represents a significant escalation of economic pressure on Russia. The price surge adds to market volatility, which has already been affected by trade tensions and increased OPEC+ production this year.</p>

          <p>A new study in the journal Science has concluded that two of Florida's most important coral species, elkhorn and staghorn, are now "functionally extinct" in the region following a record-breaking marine heatwave in 2023. The extreme ocean temperatures wiped out between 98% and 100% of these "reef-building" corals, which provide the structural foundation for the entire ecosystem. The loss of these species severely diminishes the reef's ability to support marine life and protect Florida's coastlines from hurricane storm surge, representing a devastating and likely permanent ecological tipping point.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart fell 9% despite the company reporting that its U.S. sales had swelled by over 1,200% in the third quarter. The stock decline appears to be driven by growing concerns that the speculative craze for its collectible Labubu dolls is waning. Data from resale platforms shows that some dolls are now selling at or below their retail prices, a sharp reversal from previous sky-high demand. This has led to a split among analysts over whether the trend signals fading consumer interest or simply reflects the company's efforts to increase supply. (not investment advice)</p>

This move from a 'carrot' to a 'stick' approach suggests growing frustration in Washington with the Kremlin's unwillingness to make concessions to end the war in Ukraine. While the sanctions are unlikely to force a major policy change from Moscow, they represent a significant increase in pressure. The Kremlin has condemned the sanctions as an "unfriendly act" and an attempt to negotiate through force.</p>
