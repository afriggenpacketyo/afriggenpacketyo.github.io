          <h2>UK Government Borrowing Increases, Raising Concerns for Autumn Budget</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK government borrowing reached £20.7 billion in June, significantly higher than last year and the second-highest June figure on record. The increase, driven by public service spending and debt interest payments linked to inflation, is intensifying pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves. Analysts suggest this makes tax rises in the upcoming Autumn Budget more likely to meet fiscal targets and fund spending commitments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is now seen as a more influential political figure in Washington than Apple's Tim Cook or Tesla's Elon Musk, particularly within the Trump 2.0 administration. His successful lobbying, which aligned with some White House officials' views, reportedly contributed to the reversal of a ban on exporting H20 AI chips to China. This shift highlights the strategic importance of AI technology and Nvidia's central role in the global tech landscape.</p>

          <p>The European Union Commission has proposed a controversial policy shift that would condition development aid on third countries' cooperation with migration enforcement, such as readmissions and border controls. Humanitarian groups like Oxfam have condemned the move as a coercive "political fix" that distorts development goals. Critics and policy experts in Africa argue the approach is neo-colonial, undermines trust, and ignores the root causes of migration, such as conflict and poverty.</p>

          <p>The World Health Organization has condemned Israel's military for storming its facilities in Deir al Balah, Gaza, on three separate occasions.

          <p>The Venezuelan Attorney General's office has launched an investigation into allegations that over 250 Venezuelan migrants were tortured in El Salvador's CECOT prison. The migrants were deported from the U.S. under a rarely used law targeting alleged gang members and were held in the notorious maximum-security facility before being returned in a prisoner exchange. Attorney General Tarek Saab presented videos of former detainees describing abuses, including beatings, sexual assault, and denial of medical care, and announced an investigation into Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the widespread practice of film censorship, where Hollywood movies are modified to meet the cultural and political standards of different countries. Examples range from India shortening a kiss in "Superman" to Russia removing gay scenes in "Rocketman" and China creating an entirely different, more state-friendly ending for "Minions: The Rise of Gru." The report also notes the trend of studios self-censoring or creating alternate versions to gain access to lucrative markets like China, raising concerns about the compromise of artistic vision and free expression.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released approximately 240,000 pages of FBI surveillance records on the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The release proceeded despite opposition from King's surviving children, who argued the files should be viewed within their full historical context and asked the public to approach them with empathy. Civil rights leaders like Reverend Al Sharpton criticized the timing, suggesting it was a "desperate attempt to distract" from other political issues, while the King Center called the release "unfortunate and ill-timed."</p>
