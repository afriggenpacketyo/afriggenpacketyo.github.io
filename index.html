          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has announced that "the war is over" while traveling to Israel to oversee a hostage release as part of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. Speaking from Air Force One, he expressed confidence that the truce would hold and detailed plans for a "Board of Peace" to supervise the reconstruction of Gaza, which he described as a "demolition site." The deal involves Hamas releasing its remaining living hostages and the remains of others, in exchange for Israel freeing hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Trump is also scheduled to lead an international summit in Egypt aimed at finalizing a document to formally end the conflict and address the region's severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>The Japanese city of Kyoto is introducing a significant increase to its accommodation tax starting in March 2026 to combat the negative effects of overtourism. Under the new system, visitors staying in high-end hotels could face a nightly tax of up to ¥10,000 (about $65), a tenfold increase from current rates, with smaller hikes for budget and mid-range lodging. City officials intend to use the additional revenue, which is expected to more than double, to manage crowds, preserve cultural heritage, and reduce the strain on local infrastructure. The move comes as many residents find the city unlivable during peak seasons due to clogged streets and disruptive tourist behavior in historic districts like Gion.</p>

          <p>U.S. national security officials are raising alarms over the acquisition of American farmland and the operation of cryptocurrency mines by Chinese-affiliated entities near sensitive military installations. A former national security official highlighted that such land ownership could be exploited for intelligence gathering or even to facilitate military attacks, citing the potential for sabotage of the electric grid by power-intensive crypto mines. While Chinese nationals own less than 1% of foreign-held agricultural land, the strategic locations have prompted 29 states to restrict or ban such purchases. In response, the Trump administration has announced plans to increase transparency and penalties related to foreign land ownership to counter threats from adversarial nations.</p>

          <p>A survivor of Syria's notorious Sednaya prison, Mutassim Abdulsatir, has provided a harrowing account of the systematic torture and murder that occurred under the Assad regime. In a 60 Minutes interview, he described being held in a tiny basement cell where he witnessed guards beat fellow prisoners to death daily, a practice he called a prison "policy." Human rights organizations have corroborated such accounts, documenting mass executions, starvation, and denial of medical care at the facility, which was a key tool of state repression. Abdulsatir, who now works with an association for detainees, advocates for turning the prison into a museum and memorial to honor the victims and ensure those responsible for the atrocities face a fair trial.</p>

He is seeking the permanent lifting of international economic sanctions to facilitate recovery and has engaged in diplomacy with the U.S. and Russia. Despite recent sectarian violence raising concerns, al-Sharaa has promised to prosecute perpetrators and plans to hold general elections once the country's infrastructure is rebuilt, aiming for a democratic transition over his five-year interim presidency.</p>

          <p>Financial journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin warns that today's stock market shares concerning similarities with the environment preceding the 1929 crash that led to the Great Depression. He suggests that the current economic boom, largely propped up by massive investment in artificial intelligence, may be an unsustainable "sugar rush" rather than a sign of fundamental strength. Sorkin highlights rampant speculation, heavy borrowing, and the rollback of investor protection regulations as modern echoes of the 1920s. He expresses concern that while a push to "democratize" investing by opening riskier private markets to average people is underway, it removes critical guardrails, making a future crash seem inevitable.

In his first television interview since retiring, Haugh firmly denied the accusation of disloyalty, stating he was always committed to national security and the president's expectations.

The strategy appears to involve gaining dormant access to systems that could be activated to cause widespread disruption during a crisis or conflict with the U.S. Haugh stressed that this represents a national threat that goes against international norms, as it targets basic civilian services as part of an "unrestricted warfare" effort.</p>

          <p>A new report from the University of Exeter's Global Systems Institute has declared the world's coral reefs as the first major environmental system to pass a critical climate "tipping point." Researchers state that with global warming already reaching approximately 1.4 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, the point for widespread, self-accelerating coral die-off has been crossed, leading to an "unprecedented crisis." This collapse threatens not only a quarter of all marine species but also the livelihoods of nearly a billion people who depend on reef ecosystems. The report urges immediate, large-scale action to decarbonize and mitigate further damage to other vulnerable systems like the Amazon rainforest and polar ice sheets.</p>

Eyewitnesses described hearing a loud boom before seeing a large cloud of black smoke rising from the scene. The incident led to the closure of a nearby business route as authorities responded. Hicks Airfield is a privately owned airport, and the investigation into the cause of the fatal crash is ongoing, with no further details immediately available from the Tarrant County Sheriff’s Office.</p>

The shutdown began after Democrats rejected a spending bill that did not include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance, leading to a political standoff. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are already on unpaid leave, and several agencies have begun issuing layoff notices to thousands of staff, though some were later rescinded. While essential workers like air traffic controllers remain on the job without pay, the Department of Defence is using unobligated funds to ensure military personnel are paid.</p>

          <p>Florida's governor has scheduled a November 13 execution for Bryan Fredrick Jennings, a 66-year-old man convicted for the 1979 kidnapping, sexual assault, and murder of a six-year-old girl. This marks the 16th execution warrant signed by the current governor in 2025, setting a record for the most executions in a single year since Florida reinstated the death penalty in 1976. According to court records, Jennings abducted Rebecca Kunash from her home, assaulted her, and then drowned her in a nearby canal. After two previous convictions were overturned, he was ultimately sentenced to death in 1986, and his attorneys are expected to file final appeals before the execution date.</p>

          <p>Actress Diane Keaton, an icon of American cinema who passed away at 79, is being remembered for her unconventional beauty, fierce independence, and distinctive talent. From her Oscar-winning role in "Annie Hall" to her dramatic turn in "The Godfather," Keaton brought a unique vulnerability and charm to the screen, often blurring the line between her characters and her own endearingly awkward persona. Throughout her life, she remained a romantic, a photographer, and a fiercely private individual who chose to raise two children on her own. Her trademark style, including her famous hats and long sleeves, became a reflection of both her originality and her lifelong insecurities, cementing her status as a truly inimitable figure.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has stated that universities must take decisive action to protect Jewish students, citing an "unacceptable increase in antisemitism" on campuses. She announced government funding for training programs to help university staff and students identify and combat harassment and hate, emphasizing that many Jewish students currently do not feel safe. Her comments follow recent pro-Palestinian protests at universities and a report from the Community Security Trust that found a 117% rise in antisemitic incidents on campuses over the last two academic years. The government is also allocating funds to teach students about misinformation and to support Holocaust education in secondary schools.</p>

Midfielder John McGinn described the manager's half-time talk as the "wildest" he's seen, reflecting the frustration that the team was not playing to its potential. Despite taking maximum points from the international break, players and staff acknowledged that a significant improvement is needed for their final crucial games against Greece and Denmark to achieve automatic qualification.</p>

          <p>A Rhode Island police officer and other public employees are discovering they are unable to access or manage funds in their mandatory 401(a) retirement plan, managed by TIAA, under any circumstances, including for loans or rollovers. The plan's strict rules mean that even quitting their jobs may be the only way to gain control over their savings, a situation one officer described as being held "hostage." This issue highlights the lack of flexibility and transparency in some government-mandated retirement plans, which can lock employees into specific investment products without clear disclosure of the terms. TIAA is currently under investigation by regulators in three states over allegations of steering savers into costly, proprietary products. (not investment advice)</p>

President Trump indicated he has nearly made a decision on the matter but wants to understand how Kyiv would use the weapons to avoid escalating the war.
