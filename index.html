            <p>Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa has won re-election, securing a full four-year term after initially assuming office in November 2023 following a snap election. Despite claims of fraud by his challenger, Luisa González, Noboa's victory comes as Ecuador grapples with escalating violence linked to the cocaine trade, which significantly influenced voters. Noboa, the son of a prominent businessman, has adopted a tough stance on crime, declaring a state of emergency and deploying the military. He has also signed a security agreement with Erik Prince and proposed constitutional changes to allow foreign military bases. Optimism regarding this event is moderate, as the re-election provides stability amid a volatile security situation, but concerns remain about the potential for increased militarization and human rights implications.</p>

            <p>Cody Balmer, a 38-year-old man from Harrisburg, has been arrested and charged with attempted murder and terrorism offenses after allegedly setting a fire at the Pennsylvania Governor's Residence while Governor Josh Shapiro and his family were inside. The family evacuated safely, and no injuries were reported, though the fire caused significant damage. Shapiro, who is Jewish, declined to label the incident a hate crime but emphasized that the attack would not deter him from his duties or his faith. State police are investigating the incident, and a security review is underway to determine how Balmer gained access to the property. The event is concerning, but the quick response of law enforcement and the resilience of the Governor contribute to a slightly positive outlook.</p>

The Ministry of Trade and Industry cited the impact of US tariffs and the US-China trade war on the growth outlook.

            <p>New York Helicopter Tours has shut down its operations following a deadly crash on the Hudson River that killed five tourists from Spain and the pilot. The FAA announced an immediate review of the tour operator's license and safety record and will host a helicopter safety panel to discuss risks and mitigation options. Senator Chuck Schumer has called for increased safety inspections for other helicopter tour companies, citing a history of cutting corners. The crash has renewed safety concerns about sightseeing excursions in New York City, which have faced scrutiny for mechanical failures and pilot errors in the past. The closure of the company and the FAA's review are steps towards addressing safety concerns, but the tragic loss of life casts a shadow.</p>

            <p>Washington's decision to exempt some electronic devices from its so-called “reciprocal” tariffs has offered a glimmer of hope for Chinese suppliers serving major US multinationals, but the future remains uncertain for China's broader electronics sector. Many smaller Chinese firms will not be covered by the exemptions, and the Trump administration's warning of new “sectoral tariffs” targeting the industry adds to the confusion. This has left many in China bewildered and frustrated as they navigate the unpredictable policy shifts. The exemptions recognize China's crucial role in the global supply chain, but the ongoing trade tensions create instability (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>In response to market volatility and concerns about bond yields, experts are recommending a bond ladder strategy for investors seeking stable income. This approach involves investing in a range of treasury maturities and holding them to maturity, providing regular income through principal and interest. The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) offers this strategy in an ETF format, investing in treasuries from 30-day issues to 10-year bonds, and distributing a fixed monthly income. This strategy provides investors with a predictable income stream and reduces concerns about short-term market fluctuations (not investment advice).</p>
