          <p>Police have identified Jihad Al-Shamie, a 35-year-old British man of Syrian descent, as the attacker in a deadly incident at a Manchester synagogue. Two Jewish men were killed and three others injured when a car was driven into people, followed by a knife attack. The incident, declared a terrorist act, occurred on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Chief Rabbi Sir Ephraim Mirvis condemned the attack, with calls for increased security at synagogues nationwide.</p>

          <p>The Energy Department has rescinded nearly $8 billion in funding for over 300 clean energy projects across 16 states won by Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. These cancellations, announced during the federal government shutdown, impact efforts to reduce emissions, improve air and water quality, and strengthen electrical grids. Critics, including state officials and environmental advocates, condemn the move as politically motivated, threatening job losses and undermining American manufacturing. The Energy Department, however, cites financial reviews, claiming the projects did not adequately advance national energy needs or provide a positive return on investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A judge in Idaho has prohibited the release of graphic images from the crime scene where Bryan Kohberger murdered four college students. Second District Judge Megan Marshall ruled that pictures containing blood or victims' bodies would constitute an "unwarranted invasion of personal privacy." While some investigatory records can be released, sensitive areas must be redacted. Kohberger pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder and one count of felony burglary, receiving consecutive life sentences without parole, with the death penalty taken off the table.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Evita Solutions to manufacture a generic version of mifepristone, a key drug used in medication abortions. This decision has sparked outrage among anti-abortion advocates, who have actively sought to restrict access to the drug since the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Critics, including Senator Josh Hawley and Kristan Hawkins, expressed "fury" and "lost confidence" in the FDA. Abortion rights supporters, however, lauded the approval as a victory for evidence-backed medicine, citing numerous studies affirming mifepristone's safety and effectiveness.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. government shutdown entered its third day, President Donald Trump announced plans to meet with his budget director to identify and cut "Democrat Agencies," suggesting an opportunity to "clear out dead wood." Republicans and Democrats continued to blame each other for the impasse, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed or working without pay. Trump's administration had already paused or canceled billions in funding for projects in Democratic states, including New York infrastructure, intensifying the political standoff over healthcare insurance subsidies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has informed Congress that the U.S. is engaged in a "non-international armed conflict" with drug cartels, which it has designated as terrorist organizations. This declaration follows a series of U.S. military strikes on alleged drug boats in the southern Caribbean Sea, resulting in fatalities. The administration refers to those killed as "unlawful combatants," drawing parallels to post-9/11 authorizations against terrorist groups. Critics, including former State Department attorneys and some members of Congress, question the legal justification for these actions, citing a lack of evidence for an "armed attack" against the U.S.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly attack at a Latter-day Saints chapel in Michigan that killed four and injured eight, David Butler, a church member, initiated a crowdfunding campaign for the alleged gunman's family. Thomas Jacob Sanford, who was killed by police, left behind a wife and chronically ill son. Butler, motivated by religious teachings to "love our enemies" and care for the bereaved, has raised over $300,000, despite facing criticism. While investigators seek a motive, friends suggest Sanford harbored animosity towards the faith.

          <p>Rangers suffered a disheartening 2-1 Europa League defeat, prompting manager Russell Martin to once again attribute the team's struggles to a "mentality problem." This marks a recurring theme from Martin, who previously made similar comments two months prior.

Newsom's office condemned the compact as a "hostile takeover" of universities, aimed at imposing government-mandated conservative ideology, restricting academic freedom, and erasing diversity. The compact's demands include closing departments deemed hostile to conservatives, capping international student enrollment, and freezing tuition. For institutions like USC, which has a significant international student population, complying would present substantial economic challenges.</p>

          <p>Celtic's European campaign faced another setback with a 2-1 defeat against Sporting Braga, marked by a controversial VAR decision that disallowed a potential equalizer from Kelechi Iheanacho. Despite replays suggesting the ball hit his face, the goal was ruled out for handball, sparking widespread frustration. Manager Brendan Rodgers and players criticized the decision, calling it "awful" and "ridiculous." However, the article also highlights Celtic's own defensive lapses, including a goalkeeping error and a lack of attacking quality, contributing to their fifth game without scoring this season.</p>

          <p>Chinese academics attempting to debunk U.S. claims regarding Xinjiang, such as forced labor and birth control, are encountering significant difficulties in accessing necessary data from regional authorities. Despite generally being viewed favorably by Beijing, researchers face reticence from officials, making it hard to conduct desired studies. Scholars believe Beijing's reluctance stems from concerns about potential distortion by Western researchers and the low cost of making accusations that harm companies. They argue that greater transparency and data disclosure would ultimately benefit the region's long-term development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's claim that Democrats are seeking free healthcare for undocumented immigrants, fueling the government shutdown, has been refuted. Vice President JD Vance and President Trump asserted Democrats want billions for "illegal aliens," a charge Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called a "total, absolute, effing lie." Democrats are pushing to extend Obamacare subsidies and reverse Medicaid cuts, but federal law prohibits undocumented immigrants from these programs, and Democrats have not proposed changing this. Republicans' claim appears to misrepresent Democratic efforts to restore healthcare access for lawfully present immigrants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pfizer has agreed to lower its drug prices in the United States to match rates in other developed countries and participate in the new TrumpRx website, offering discounts. This marks a significant, albeit largely symbolic, victory for President Trump, who has long criticized pharmaceutical companies for high U.S. drug costs. The deal, which includes launching new drugs at parity prices and discounts for Medicaid patients, was secured after the administration threatened 100% tariffs on companies not manufacturing products in the U.S. While the immediate financial impact for most Americans is unclear, it signals a shift in the pharmaceutical industry's stance.

This significant find offers valuable historical insights, with dates and mint marks still visible on some pieces. The director of operations for the salvage company emphasized that the discovery provides not just treasure, but also tangible links to the golden age of the Spanish empire.</p>

          <p>Conservation groups are advising the public to stay away from U.S. national parks during the government shutdown, warning of limited facilities and visitor safety risks due to skeleton staffing. The National Parks Conservation Association highlights that visitors will be "probably on your own," with essential services thinly spread. Past shutdowns, like in 2018, saw significant vandalism, looting, and littering at accessible but unstaffed parks. Conservationists argue that keeping parks partially open with reduced personnel is "reckless," exacerbating existing strains from earlier layoffs and jeopardizing both visitors and natural resources.</p>
