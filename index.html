          <p>Two elementary schools in Allegany County, Maryland, were evacuated due to a flash flood emergency after up to 5 inches of rain fell, causing severe flooding in Westernport, Luke, and Barton. About 200 students and teachers from Westernport Elementary School were safely evacuated by motorized boats to a nearby church, while students at Georges Creek Elementary in Lonaconing were evacuated to a high school. Westmar Middle School students sheltered in place due to road closures, with no injuries reported. The Allegany County Department of Emergency Services urged drivers to avoid flooded roadways, as more than 15 million Americans across the Mid-Atlantic remained on alert for flooding and heavy rain.</p>

          <p>Mariangela Hungria, a microbiologist from Brazil, has been awarded the World Food Prize for her decades-long research on soil bacteria that act as fertilizers, enhancing crop harvests. Her work, initially met with skepticism, has been instrumental in transforming Brazil into an agricultural powerhouse. Hungria identified strains of rhizobia bacteria that fix nitrogen in soybean roots and Azospirillum bacteria that stimulate root growth in crops like corn and wheat. Her research has enabled farmers to reduce their reliance on chemical fertilizers, saving money and lessening environmental impact. Hungria plans to use the prize money to fund an award recognizing women in agriculture and microbiology.</p>

          <p>Judge Hannah C. Dugan of the Milwaukee County Circuit Court has been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction of proceedings. The charges stem from accusations that she helped an undocumented immigrant evade federal agents waiting to arrest him outside her courtroom. The indictment is a routine step in the Justice Department’s case, which the Trump administration defends as upholding the law, while critics denounce it as an assault on the judiciary. Judge Dugan has been temporarily removed from the bench and intends to fight the charges.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is moving to ban prescription fluoride supplements for children, citing concerns about their impact on the gut microbiome. This action contradicts recommendations from the CDC, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and professional medical associations, which advocate for low-dose fluoride supplements for children in areas without fluoridated water and those at high risk of cavities. The FDA claims ingested fluoride alters the gut microbiome, even though research is inconclusive. Critics argue this removes a valuable tool for dentists in preventing tooth decay, while the FDA plans to conduct a safety review and issue alternative dental hygiene practices.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly stated he would not cut Medicaid, but a House Republican bill aims to slash hundreds of billions of dollars from the program. The bill proposes imposing work requirements, more frequent eligibility checks, and penalizing states offering Medicaid to illegal immigrants. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would save $715 billion over the next decade but leave 8.6 million more Americans uninsured. Despite Trump's assurances, critics argue the bill breaks promises to protect Medicaid, while the White House maintains it is targeting fraud, waste, and abuse in the program.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the U.S. will lift sanctions against Syria during his visit to Saudi Arabia, stating it's time for the country to move forward. Speaking in Riyadh, Trump emphasized the strong U.S.-Saudi partnership and highlighted a $142 billion arms deal between the two countries. Trump also lauded the potential for $1 trillion in investments. The visit contrasts with the muted reception former President Joe Biden received, as Trump focuses on striking financial deals to boost the American economy, arguing that commerce and economic development can help transcend violence and division in the Middle East.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% in April on an annual basis, slightly below economists' expectations, yet still above the Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target. Housing and energy costs were major drivers of inflation, while grocery prices slightly decreased. Economists are closely watching the impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices, although the April data is largely unaffected due to exemptions and front-loading of purchases. The tentative trade agreement between China and the U.S. may limit future inflation increases, potentially leading the Fed to cut rates twice in 2025, with the first cut expected in September.

She highlighted the success of Disney's bundling strategy, offering a stand-alone ESPN streaming service and heavily discounting bundles with Disney+ and Hulu.
