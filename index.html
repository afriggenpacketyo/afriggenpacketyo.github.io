          <p>Ahead of a potential U.S.-Russia summit, key European allies including the UK, France, and Germany have issued a joint statement insisting that any peace negotiations must involve Ukraine. The statement emphasizes that international borders cannot be changed by force and supports Ukraine's right to determine its own destiny. This unified European stance comes in response to suggestions that a deal might be brokered without Kyiv's direct participation, a scenario Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has firmly rejected as unacceptable.</p>

According to the Palestinian Football Association, al-Obeid was shot by Israeli forces while awaiting aid distribution.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The founder of Chinese robotics firm Unitree, Wang Xingxing, predicts that the industry is on the verge of its "ChatGPT moment," which could occur within the next two to three years. He defines this breakthrough as a robot's ability to perform a complex task, like cleaning a room, in a completely new environment without prior training for that specific location. While hardware is advancing, Wang believes the key missing element is more sophisticated AI for embodied intelligence, suggesting that current models are not yet sufficient for this leap.</p>

          <p>Officials in Los Angeles are urging residents of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills to cease all non-essential water use, including flushing toilets, amid a prolonged service outage. The issue began Tuesday when a critical water control valve broke, affecting approximately 9,200 households during a heatwave. Although some service has been restored, officials warn that continued consumption is depleting pressure in the system and delaying repairs, which are now further complicated by a blowout in a temporary pipe.</p>

          <p>Northern China is once again grappling with severe weather, as deadly floods hit Beijing for the fifth time since 2012. This year's storms, which arrived during the traditional rainy season of July and August, have been particularly unusual for their concentration in the northern part of the capital. This contrasts with previous major flood events in 2016 and 2023, which primarily impacted the southern areas of the city. The recurring disasters highlight the region's increasing vulnerability to extreme weather patterns.</p>

With global powers viewing nuclear weapons as offensive tools rather than just deterrents, the risk of catastrophic confrontation is alarmingly high.</p>
