          <p>A mother is advocating for pea and lentil proteins to be legally mandated on food labels after her nine-year-old son, Rex, suffered two severe anaphylactic shocks from unexpected ingredients in common foods like hot cross buns and ice cream. Pea is not currently among the 14 allergens required to be listed by law in the UK and EU, leading to a "game of roulette" for affected individuals. Experts and other allergy sufferers, including those with pine nut allergies, support expanding the allergen list to improve safety and ensure allergies are taken seriously by the public and food service staff. This article highlights the growing frustration and anxiety faced by families dealing with less common but severe food allergies.</p>

The incident occurred when the bus veered off the road, struck a hillside, briefly tipped, and hit a utility pole, knocking down live wires. One child remains in critical condition following surgery, though most have been discharged. The community, including Governor Josh Shapiro, has offered support, with practices canceled and a vigil held, emphasizing the collective concern for the affected students and their families.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has reportedly blocked Ukraine from using US-supplied long-range missiles, specifically Atacms, to strike targets deep inside Russia since late spring. This move is part of a Trump administration effort to encourage peace talks with Vladimir Putin, despite previous authorization for Ukraine to use such systems. The restrictions also extend to British Storm Shadow cruise missiles that rely on US targeting data. This article highlights a significant shift in US military aid policy, potentially impacting Ukraine's ability to wage war and raising questions about the administration's broader strategy for ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>North Korean state media, KCNA, reported that leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a test of two new air defense missiles with "superior combat capability" and "unique technology." These launches, which occurred hours after South Korea fired warning shots at North Korean troops crossing the DMZ, are described as suitable for destroying aerial targets like drones and cruise missiles. The test comes amidst large-scale joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States, and Kim's recent condemnation of these drills, reaffirming his vow to expand the country's nuclear arsenal.

          <p>As the UK Parliament's e-petitions system marks its tenth anniversary, this article examines its effectiveness in influencing policy. While some joke petitions have garnered attention, the system has led to tangible legislative change, notably "Finn's Law," which increased protections for service animals after a police dog was stabbed. However, many petitions, even those with millions of signatures like calls to reverse Brexit, do not result in immediate government action, leading to public frustration and questions about the system's true impact. Despite perceived shortcomings, proponents argue it remains a vital "bridge between the public and Parliament" for direct democratic engagement.</p>

          <p>The immigrant population in the United States has decreased by over a million people since Donald Trump took office in January, marking the first decline in more than 50 years. A Pew Research Center study indicates the number dropped from 53.3 million to 51.9 million by June, with 750,000 immigrant workers leaving the labor force. This reduction is attributed to Trump's 181 executive actions targeting immigration, including mass deportations and restrictions on asylum.

          <p>The UK government is planning an overhaul of sentencing rules that could allow courts to impose broader non-custodial penalties, including bans from pubs, concerts, sports matches, and specific geographical areas. These reforms aim to "toughen up community punishments" and deter reoffending, while also addressing prison overcrowding by recommending fewer custodial sentences for less serious crimes. The Justice Secretary emphasizes restricting offenders' freedom in the community as part of a plan to enhance public safety. This article highlights a significant shift in the UK's criminal justice approach, balancing punishment with rehabilitation and prison capacity issues.</p>
