        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's National Health Service has launched a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a diagnosis if a patient's symptoms persist or worsen after three visits. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly misdiagnosed as long Covid. This guidance aims to improve patient safety by encouraging doctors to order more tests, seek second opinions, or refer patients to specialists to prevent avoidable deaths from delayed diagnoses.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials have started drafting the country's 15th five-year plan, which will guide economic and social development from 2026 to 2030. This long-term planning is considered a key strategic tool for achieving ambitious goals, such as reaching the per capita GDP of a "moderately developed country" by 2035. As China navigates domestic challenges and global turbulence, experts suggest the new plan may need to prioritize flexible, qualitative goals over rigid quantitative targets to ensure stability and continued growth.

          <p>The Trump administration announced that the FDA would be notifying physicians about a potential link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy and an increased risk of autism. President Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. advocated for limiting the drug's use, a claim that contradicts the consensus of major medical groups. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, along with Tylenol's manufacturer Kenvue, strongly refuted the announcement, citing a lack of credible scientific evidence and emphasizing that acetaminophen remains the safest pain relief option for pregnant women.</p>

          <p>Disney, ABC's parent company, announced the return of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" nearly a week after suspending the show indefinitely. The suspension followed Kimmel's comments about the political response to the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which the network deemed "ill-timed and thus insensitive." The decision to reinstate the host came after conversations with Kimmel and significant public debate, including criticism of the suspension from free speech advocates and fellow late-night hosts.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys' star wide receiver CeeDee Lamb is expected to miss three to four weeks after sustaining a high ankle sprain during a game against the Chicago Bears. The injury occurred in the first quarter, and an MRI later confirmed the diagnosis. Lamb, a key target for quarterback Dak Prescott, was seen in a walking boot after the game. His absence represents a significant blow to the Cowboys' offense as they prepare for upcoming games, including a highly anticipated matchup against the Green Bay Packers.</p>

The note, found in Anibal Hernandez-Santana's car, also threatened top Trump administration officials, including FBI Director Kash Patel and Attorney General Pam Bondi, stating they were "next." Prosecutors believe the shooting was politically motivated, potentially also linked to ABC's recent suspension of host Jimmy Kimmel, as a book critical of Donald Trump was also found in the suspect's vehicle.</p>

The judge cited the defendant's age and lack of a criminal record in the decision, which was made over the objection of prosecutors from the city attorney's office.</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats are urging treasury watchdogs to investigate allegations that Tom Homan, President Trump's border czar, accepted a $50,000 cash payment from an undercover FBI agent. The alleged bribe was reportedly in exchange for promises of future government contracts related to immigration. A Justice Department investigation into the matter was reportedly shut down, prompting calls for scrutiny into whether Homan illegally failed to report the income and if his private consulting firm was involved. The White House has denied the allegations.</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh, the man on trial for the attempted assassination of President Trump at his Florida golf club, has rested his defense case without taking the stand himself. Routh, who is representing himself, called only three witnesses before concluding his defense. Prosecutors allege Routh spent weeks planning the attack before he was spotted by a Secret Service agent, leading to a confrontation where he fled without firing his weapon. Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday, after which the jury will begin deliberations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications is causing significant confusion and uncertainty, particularly regarding travel for current visa holders. Immigration attorneys are advising clients with H-1B visas not to travel abroad until there is more clarity, fearing they could be unexpectedly charged the fee upon re-entry. While the White House has stated the fee applies only to new applicants, lawyers point to ambiguous language in the proclamation that could potentially affect those renewing or changing their visa status.</p>

The image, posted with the caption "This is the turning point," was quickly compared by online commenters to a historical 1933 photograph of Adolf Hitler addressing Nazi stormtroopers. Critics described the visual parallels as unsettling and a continuation of what they see as the administration's use of authoritarian-style imagery.</p>

The recent departure of a top federal prosecutor in Virginia, who reportedly resisted pressure to charge a Trump critic, has further fueled fears that the rule of law is being eroded.</p>
