          <p>The British government is increasing defense spending by £2 billion, focusing on drones and adapting tactics from the Ukraine war to enhance military readiness, according to The Guardian. Defence Secretary John Healey stated the Army's lethality would significantly increase. The Times highlights that Prime Minister Starmer plans to expand the British Army for the first time in a generation, but experts warn this could lead to substantial tax hikes. The Financial Times reports submarines are central to the review, with plans for 12 nuclear-powered attack submarines. The i Paper notes the review suggests a military "gap year" for over-18s, offering paid military training instead of national service.</p>

Over 450,000 federal student loan borrowers aged 62 and older are in default and likely receiving Social Security benefits (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A Trump-appointed judge in California has blocked the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area. Judge John Holcomb ruled the government hasn't provided adequate due process.

The judge stated it is up to the president, not the court system, to decide whether an invasion or predatory incursion has occurred under the law.</p>

          <p>Mexico's recent judicial election saw a low voter turnout, with nearly 90 percent of voters not casting ballots. This turnout is one of the lowest in any federal election since Mexico transitioned to a democracy. The low participation rate has raised concerns about the legitimacy and representativeness of the election results.</p>

          <p>J.D. Scholten, a Democratic Iowa state representative, has announced his candidacy to challenge Republican Senator Joni Ernst in 2026, prompted by her recent comments about Medicaid cuts. Ernst's statement, "Well, we're all going to die," made at a town hall meeting, sparked controversy and led to Scholten's decision to enter the race. Scholten aims to make the race a referendum on President Trump's trade policy and address concerns about Iowa soybean farmers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has again used law enforcement to target Congress, raising concerns about the separation of powers. Police from the Department of Homeland Security handcuffed an aide to Representative Jerry Nadler, a prominent Trump critic, at a federal building. This incident follows another recent confrontation involving Democrats and DHS officials. The executive branch has pursued a multipronged attack on Congress's independence and powers.</p>
