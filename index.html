          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 10:04:42 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK government borrowing costs, specifically the 30-year bond yield, have surged to their highest level since 1998, indicating increased expense for the government to borrow money. This rise is attributed to factors like geopolitical tensions and US trade policies, but also reflects investor concerns about the stability of public finances. Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces growing pressure to potentially increase taxes in the upcoming Budget to meet fiscal rules. The situation presents "highly difficult choices" for the government, with economists predicting significant tax raises might be necessary to avoid breaking fiscal commitments.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal court in California ruled that the Trump administration violated the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act by deploying National Guard and U.S. Marines for domestic law enforcement in Los Angeles. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer blocked the administration from using military troops for civilian law enforcement in the state, citing a "serious violation" of federal law. The ruling came after California Governor Gavin Newsom sued over the deployment, which Breyer stated created a "national police force with the President as its chief." This decision restricts military involvement in arrests, searches, and crowd control, emphasizing the separation of military and domestic law enforcement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields, including the 30-year bond yield, jumped after a federal appeals court ruled most of the Trump administration's global tariffs illegal. This decision raises the possibility of the government having to refund billions in collected tariff money, potentially straining the U.S. fiscal situation. While the tariffs remain in place pending an appeal to the Supreme Court, the ruling highlights concerns about the national deficit. Bond investors, who had previously appreciated tariff revenues, are now anticipating potential increased Treasury issuance and higher yields, impacting the stock market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk stated that Optimus humanoid robots, which are not yet commercially available, will eventually comprise approximately 80% of Tesla's total value. This projection comes as Tesla faces a multi-quarter sales slump due to increased competition and an aging vehicle lineup. Musk is attempting to redirect investor focus towards the company's long-term vision in AI-powered robotaxis and humanoid robotics, despite Tesla lagging behind competitors in these emerging markets. The company aims to produce 5,000 Optimus robots this year, with wider deployment planned for its factories in 2025.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article from the South Side of Chicago argues that the city's high crime rates, including hundreds of homicides and thousands of shootings, necessitate the deployment of the National Guard. The author, a local non-profit leader, supports President Trump's suggestion for federal intervention, criticizing the current Democratic leadership for prioritizing "virtue-signaling" over real solutions. While viewing the Guard as a temporary "shock-and-awe" measure, the article emphasizes that long-term solutions lie in community-based initiatives like Project H.O.O.D., which focuses on job training and mentoring. The author contends that existing police efforts are hampered by "defund the police" leadership, making federal assistance crucial for immediate safety.</p>

          <p>China's YJ-19 anti-ship missile showcases cutting-edge aerospace technology, marking its first hypersonic cruise missile. This article details the complex science behind achieving reliable hypersonic flight, which involves overcoming extreme technical challenges. The YJ-19 is believed to utilize a scramjet engine, enabling sustained propulsion by taking in air at high speeds and mixing it with fuel to generate thrust. This method allows the missile to maintain both speed and mobility throughout its flight, distinguishing it from other hypersonic approaches that may have less predictable trajectories.</p>

          <p>A new survey indicates that the majority of Chinese citizens desire their nation to play an active global role and perceive China as moderately strong internationally, yet remain divided on whether the US or China holds greater power. This finding contrasts with the US's growing isolationist stance under President Trump's "America First" agenda. The survey highlights a Chinese public largely aligned with President Xi Jinping's assertive foreign policy. Analysts suggest that the US withdrawal from global engagement could inadvertently enhance Beijing's international influence.</p>

          <p>Marc Rowan, CEO of Apollo Global, argues that the traditional investing model is "broken" and foresees a significant shift from public stocks to alternative investments. He contends that passive investing and mega-tech dominance in public markets limit diversification, making private markets essential for unique insights. Rowan highlights the rapid growth of private credit, now exceeding $450 billion, as post-financial crisis regulations curbed bank lending, creating new opportunities. He suggests that the distinction between "risky private" and "safe public" is outdated, with liquidity being the primary differentiator. (not investment advice)</p>

This rise is attributed to a pan-European trend influenced by global issues, along with domestic concerns about UK inflation and interest rates. Demand for long-term government debt from pension funds has also decreased. The increased borrowing costs will impact the Chancellor's upcoming Budget, but shorter-term rates, which affect most mortgages, remain stable for now.

          <p>The death toll from a major earthquake in eastern Afghanistan has tragically surpassed 1,400, with over 3,100 injured and thousands of homes destroyed. Rescue operations in hard-hit provinces like Kunar and Nangarhar are severely hampered by rough terrain, making it difficult to reach survivors and deliver aid. Victims are being carried for hours on makeshift stretchers to receive basic medical help, and international assistance is urgently called for. The United Nations emphasized the critical need for air support, as communities face multiple crises and dwindling resilience.</p>

          <p>Sainsbury's, the UK's second-largest supermarket, is initiating an eight-week trial of facial recognition technology in two stores to identify and potentially ban shoplifters. The move is part of a broader effort to combat a sharp increase in retail crime, abuse, and threatening behavior. While the company states the technology is not for monitoring staff or customers, privacy campaigners have condemned the plans as "deeply disproportionate and chilling," urging Sainsbury's to reconsider. The Home Office is also working with businesses to tackle retail crime, considering new laws to protect retail workers.</p>

          <p>Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, the longest-serving New Yorker in the House, announced he will not seek re-election in 2026, advocating for "generational change" within the party. The 78-year-old stated his decision was influenced by former President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 election, believing a younger successor could better address challenges like "Trump and his incipient fascism." Nadler, who chaired the House Judiciary Committee and managed Trump's first impeachment, expressed his commitment to defending democracy for the remainder of his term. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries praised Nadler as a "relentless fighter for justice."</p>

The retrospective traces his artistic development from the late 1970s, showcasing films, prints, sculptures, and installations that dissect the apartheid regime and broader human rights issues.

          <p>Over 85 international climate experts have published a scathing 434-page review, asserting that the Trump administration's Energy Department report on greenhouse gases "makes a mockery of science." The experts argue the DOE document, authored by five hand-picked researchers, is biased, riddled with errors, and employs selective citation and cherry-picked data to downplay climate change risks. Critics contend the report serves as a political tool to justify the administration's rollback of climate regulations, rather than a credible scientific inquiry. The review highlights concerns about the politicization of science and the lack of transparency in its production.</p>

With higher standard deductions and a temporary $6,000 deduction for older Americans, more investors may qualify for this bracket.
