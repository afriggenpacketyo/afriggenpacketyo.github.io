          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce a proposal for a compulsory, UK-wide digital ID system aimed at curbing illegal employment and modernizing state services. The plan, which will be subject to a public consultation, has drawn significant criticism from opposition parties and civil liberties groups over concerns about privacy and government overreach. Proponents argue the system would streamline identity verification, referencing successful implementations in countries like Estonia, while critics fear it will infringe upon the freedoms of law-abiding citizens without effectively stopping illegal immigration.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has formally requested the U.S. Supreme Court to reject President Trump's effort to remove her from the board. Her legal team argues that allowing the president to fire her would undermine the central bank's crucial political independence and could destabilize financial markets. The case centers on the legal definition of "for cause" removal, as Trump cites alleged mortgage fraud from before her tenure, a claim Cook denies and characterizes as a pretext for her monetary policy positions.</p>

          <p>Europe's primary soccer governing body, UEFA, is reportedly preparing to hold a vote on whether to suspend Israeli national and club teams from international competitions due to the ongoing war in Gaza. This potential action follows a proposal from the Palestinian Football Association and pressure from U.N. human rights experts. While the Israel Football Federation stated it has no indication of such a vote, Israeli officials are reportedly working diplomatically to prevent the suspension, which would bar its teams from major tournaments.</p>

          <p>KION-TV, a news station serving California's central coast for over 50 years, has suddenly closed its news division, resulting in the layoffs of more than a dozen employees. The station's owner, News-Press & Gazette, announced a new partnership with a San Francisco affiliate to provide coverage, a move that also shuttered the area's only Spanish-language news show. Staff members expressed their shock and heartbreak, describing the closure as a significant blow to local journalism in the Monterey, Salinas, and Santa Cruz communities.</p>

          <p>A new analysis indicates that U.S. health-care providers could lose over $32 billion in revenue if the enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits are allowed to expire. These subsidies are a major point of contention in the current government funding debate, with Democrats insisting on their extension. The report from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and Urban Institute warns that their expiration would also lead to a rise in uncompensated care, burdening hospitals and other medical services.

          <p>Authorities in Oregon have launched a manhunt for a murder suspect, Ty Anthony Sage, who was mistakenly released from a Multnomah County jail on bail. The 26-year-old was facing charges for second-degree murder and robbery, and court records show he should have been denied bail. The county sheriff called the error "unacceptable" and has initiated a full review of the incident, while law enforcement agencies across the state are now working to locate and reapprehend the suspect.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the average rate for a home equity line of credit (HELOC) has fallen, making it a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners. A calculation shows that a $40,000 HELOC with a 15-year repayment term now costs approximately $379 per month, down from over $404 a year ago. With further rate cuts anticipated, HELOCs are positioned to become even cheaper, as their variable rates adjust automatically without the need for refinancing. (not investment advice)</p>
