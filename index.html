          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole. The brothers claimed they acted in self-defense after years of alleged abuse. The resentencing hearing included testimony from family members who believe the brothers have been rehabilitated and would advocate for victims of abuse if released. The prosecution argued that the brothers have not taken full responsibility for their crimes, while the defense argued that the hearing is about redemption and not relitigating the facts of the crime. This case will now go to the California Board of Parole Hearings, and then potentially to the governor's office.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers are proposing the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act (IODA) to criminalize the transmission of obscene content across state lines. Sen. Mike Lee and Rep. Mary Miller argue that current legal definitions of obscenity are vague and allow criminals to evade prosecution. The IODA aims to clarify the definition by focusing on content that appeals to prurient interests and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. The bill seeks to equip law enforcement with the tools to remove obscene material from the internet, which they believe is harmful to families and outside the bounds of protected free speech.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, potentially impacting over 8,000 individuals. The Department of Homeland Security stated that Afghanistan's improved security situation and stabilizing economy no longer prevent their return. This decision reverses the Biden administration's extension of TPS, which cited a humanitarian crisis following the Taliban's takeover in 2021. Critics argue this decision is unconscionable, while the administration maintains it is returning TPS to its original temporary intent.</p>

Rose agreed to a permanent ban in 1989 for betting on baseball, while Jackson was implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. The Hall of Fame's board will now consider their eligibility under existing rules, which also take into account a player's character and integrity.</p>

          <p>Family doctors in England are deeply divided over the issue of assisted dying, according to BBC research. The research shows personal beliefs and experiences shape doctors' views on the proposed new law. Some GPs against legalizing assisted dying worry terminally ill patients would consider it due to feeling like a burden, while others supporting it believe it could allow patients a dignified death. The Royal College of Psychiatrists remains neutral on the principle of assisted dying but cannot support the bill due to concerns about unmet patient needs and a shortage of psychiatrists to process requests.</p>

          <p>José Mujica, the former president of Uruguay known as the world's "poorest president" for his modest lifestyle, has died at the age of 89.

As a member of the Tupamaro urban guerrilla movement in the late 1960s, he spent over a decade in prison.

          <p>New research suggests the universe is decaying much faster than previously thought, with a revised expiration date of 10 to the power of 78 years. Researchers at Radboud University based their calculations on a reinterpretation of Stephen Hawking's theorem on black hole radiation. The study focused on the decay of white dwarf stars to set an upper limit for the lifetime of matter in the universe. While the end is sooner than expected, it is still trillions of years in the future.</p>

          <p>Jillian Shriner, wife of Weezer bassist Scott Shriner, pleaded not guilty to charges of discharge of a firearm with gross negligence and assault with a semiautomatic firearm.

The package includes changes to Medicaid and food stamps to help pay for tax cuts, but major divisions remain among Republicans. Democrats are criticizing the proposed cuts to Medicaid, asserting that millions of Americans will lose health care coverage. House leaders have a self-imposed deadline of sending the package to the Senate by Memorial Day.</p>

The book chronicles how Mr. Biden’s advisers stomped out discussion of his age-related limitations, including internal concerns of aides, external worries of Democratic allies and scrutiny by journalists. The book relies heavily on anonymous sources, reflecting the enduring chill within the Democratic Party about publicly addressing Mr. Biden's fitness for office.

Despite personal income tax and corporate tax receipts in the state coming in $6.8 billion above projections through April, the Newsom administration is predicting that overall revenue will be lower than they could have been from January 2025 through June 2026 because of the economic impact of Trump’s tariffs.
