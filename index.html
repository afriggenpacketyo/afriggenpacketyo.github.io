          <p>A 15-year-old boy from Gaza, who suffered a shattered jaw from an Israeli tank shell, has become the first child to be brought to the United Kingdom for treatment of war-related injuries. His arrival is part of an initiative called Project Pure Hope, a privately funded group of volunteer medical professionals working to provide UK-based care for critically injured Gazan children. The boy will undergo complex reconstructive surgery at Great Ormond Street children's hospital. This development follows months of advocacy and comes shortly after the UK Prime Minister promised to evacuate more injured children from the conflict zone.</p>

          <p>President Trump has issued letters to 17 major pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Eli Lilly, demanding they take action to reduce prescription drug prices in the United States within the next 60 days. The move follows a May executive order reviving the 'most favored nation' policy, which aims to align U.S. drug costs with lower international prices. Trump stated that previous proposals from the industry were insufficient, merely shifting blame, and threatened to use every available tool to combat what he termed 'abusive drug pricing practices' if the companies fail to comply.

          <p>Shares of chip designer Arm Holdings experienced a significant drop of over 13% after the company provided a subdued profit forecast for the upcoming quarter. Arm projected adjusted earnings between 29 and 37 cents per share, with the lower end falling below Wall Street's expectations. Investor concern was further heightened by CEO Rene Haas's comments that the company is exploring the possibility of designing its own processors, a strategic shift that analysts believe could substantially alter its cost structure and create uncertainty about its future business model.

          <p>The Trump administration clarified its stance on new 'Trump newborn accounts,' with the White House press secretary stating they are intended to supplement, not replace, Social Security for future generations. This came after the Treasury Secretary suggested they could be a 'back door' to privatization. Additionally, the administration detailed a humanitarian mission to Gaza led by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Ambassador Mike Huckabee. The envoys met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and are scheduled to enter Gaza to assess the dire humanitarian situation and formulate a plan for aid distribution.

          <p>Dr. Vinay Prasad, a prominent medical regulator, has abruptly resigned from his high-level positions at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) following reported pressure from the White House. This article suggests his departure was triggered by his stringent, evidence-based approach to drug approval, which clashed with both industry interests and the administration's deregulatory agenda. Prasad's attempts to limit COVID vaccine use and suspend a costly Duchenne gene therapy over safety concerns drew significant backlash. His exit signals a potential victory for pro-business factions over cautious regulatory oversight within the administration's health policy apparatus.</p>

          <p>Despite reporting quarterly earnings that surpassed expectations and raising its full-year guidance, Bristol Myers Squibb saw its stock drop by 4%. The decline reflects investor uncertainty regarding the growth potential of its schizophrenia drug, Cobenfy, which is a central part of the company's strategy. This hesitation follows a previous failed trial and now hinges on upcoming data for the drug's use in Alzheimer's psychosis patients. Analysts have lowered the company's price target, viewing the stock as a potential value trap until the crucial trial results are released later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

The new species, named Acrophylla alta, measures 40 centimeters long and weighs 44 grams, comparable to a golf ball. It was discovered in the high-altitude canopies of the Wet Tropics region in Far North Queensland. Researchers suggest its large body mass may be an evolutionary adaptation to survive the colder conditions of its high-altitude habitat, which has also kept it hidden from discovery until now.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: UK's Potential Recognition of Palestinian State Reflects Domestic and International Pressures</h2>

          <p>The United Kingdom's recent policy shift, threatening to recognize a Palestinian state, is analyzed as a response to multiple pressures. The move follows a meeting between Prime Minister Keir Starmer and U.S. President Donald Trump and appears to be a tool to push for a two-state solution. This article suggests the change is driven by strong pro-Palestinian sentiment among Labour Party supporters and the broader public, as well as an effort to align with other European nations like France. This marks a significant departure from Britain's long-held position of linking recognition to a final peace deal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court intensely questioned the Trump administration's legal authority to impose broad tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners using an emergency powers law. Judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit probed whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which has never before been used for this purpose, grants the president such authority. The case, brought by states and small businesses, challenges the centerpiece of Trump's economic agenda, with judges expressing concern that the administration's interpretation could grant 'unbounded authority' to the executive branch.
