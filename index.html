          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 00:15:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to lift an injunction blocking the deportation of nearly 200 Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas, asserting they are dangerous members of the Tren de Aragua gang. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that these individuals pose a security risk in detention and have received adequate notice and opportunity to pursue habeas petitions. ICE officials claim some migrants threatened violence against facility staff and officers, necessitating their relocation to a different detention center due to security concerns. The administration contends that most of these migrants are eligible for prompt removal under Title 8 authorities, regardless of the Alien Enemies Act. </p>

          <p>Karen Read's defense team is proposing that a "jealous" Brian Higgins may have confronted John O'Keefe before his death, citing flirty text messages between Read and Higgins in the weeks leading up to O'Keefe's death. The defense argued that Higgins, an ATF agent, might have been motivated by jealousy after seeing Read with O'Keefe at a bar. However, a state police sergeant testified that he did not see Higgins as a suspect, relying on the "totality of the investigation" that led to charges against Read, who is accused of sexual assault and killing O'Keefe with her car. The trial has also revealed controversial text messages from a former state trooper involved in the initial investigation. </p>

          <p>A China-led international research team has analyzed seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, revealing potential evidence of liquid water locked in rock just a few kilometers beneath the Martian surface. The analysis of marsquakes and meteorite impacts recorded between 2018 and 2022 indicates a water-saturated rock layer between 5.4km and 8km deep. If confirmed, this underground layer could contain a significant amount of water, potentially matching what scientists believe to be Mars' missing water. This discovery could reshape our understanding of Mars' water cycle and the potential for habitable environments on the planet. </p>

          <p>This New York Times article examines how German companies are reassessing their investment strategies in the United States due to trade tensions and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Despite historically investing more in the U.S. than American companies do in Germany, recent surveys indicate a pullback in German manufacturing investments in the U.S. Many companies are opting to keep investments at home, spurred by a new German government focused on reducing bureaucracy and energy prices, along with infrastructure investment plans. The automotive sector, heavily impacted by tariffs, is a key area of concern, though some companies like Stihl are mitigating effects through existing U.S. factories. </p>

While companies like DeepSeek and Huawei showcase China's innovative capabilities, the nation grapples with sluggish consumer spending, rising unemployment, and a housing crisis. Experts suggest that technological advancements alone may not be sufficient to overcome these structural imbalances, as evidenced by the struggles of numerous electric vehicle startups. The article emphasizes that understanding China requires acknowledging the coexistence of these hopeful and gloomy aspects, particularly as the U.S. navigates its trade relationship with the country. </p>

          <p>President Trump's offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute between India and Pakistan has put India in a difficult position, as it contradicts India's long-standing policy against third-party mediation.

The offer follows a recent flare-up in tensions and a ceasefire brokered by the U.S. The situation is further complicated by India's 2019 decision to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, leading to widespread protests. </p>

While a Mondrian painting fetched $47.6 million, it did not spark a bidding war, and a Warhol painting was withdrawn.

Critics have raised legal and ethical concerns, citing the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which restricts gifts from foreign governments. Despite criticism from both sides of the political spectrum, the White House maintains that any gift will be accepted in full compliance with applicable laws. </p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is pushing cities to implement bans against homeless encampments, releasing a model ordinance and announcing new funding for treatment and housing. Newsom emphasized the need for cities to address encampments and provide alternatives, citing the state's provision of resources. The model ordinance includes principles such as prioritizing shelter and services, and not criminalizing sleeping outside when there is nowhere else to go. The effort is supported by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding. </p>

Republicans argue that these changes will improve the program's efficiency and accountability.
