          <p>President Trump deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles following violent clashes between law enforcement and protesters over immigration enforcement operations. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the deployment as inflammatory and requested the troops be withdrawn.

The situation has drawn criticism from local officials and former Vice President Kamala Harris, who condemned the deployment as a dangerous escalation.

          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the ban on destructive bottom trawling in English waters, increasing the protected area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the need for urgent action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans. The proposal, which is subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to protect rare marine animals and the seabed they rely upon. This initiative aligns with the UN Ocean Conference in France and follows warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the damaging effects of bottom trawling.</p>

The dispute highlights the ongoing tensions between the federal government and California over immigration policy and law enforcement.

          <p>The Freedom Flotilla Coalition confirmed that Israeli forces intercepted the Madleen, a ship carrying humanitarian aid bound for Gaza. The group stated that the vessel was attacked and forcibly intercepted in international waters. Israel has no legal authority to detain the volunteers aboard the Madleen, according to human rights attorney Huwaida Arraf, who added that the seizure violates international law and goes against the ICJ's orders requiring unimpeded humanitarian access to Gaza. The coalition demands the immediate end to the arbitrary and unlawful detention of the volunteers.</p>

          <p>Energy firms in Britain are being paid substantial sums to not provide power due to grid limitations and an overreliance on gas. Wind farms are often forced to reduce output, receiving compensation payments, while gas-fired power stations are paid to provide more electricity. This system is costing the country hundreds of millions, potentially billions, and raising energy bills. The government is considering a radical solution involving regional markets to make the system more efficient, but the proposal has sparked bitter debate and uncertainty.</p>
