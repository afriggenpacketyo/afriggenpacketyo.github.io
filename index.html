          <p>President Donald Trump has described the current high tariffs on Chinese goods as "not sustainable," even while defending the policy as a necessary response to Beijing's actions. His comments come as US and Chinese officials are set to hold a new round of trade negotiations to de-escalate the economic conflict between the two nations. The upcoming talks, confirmed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, aim to find a resolution before a tariff truce agreement expires in November.

          <h2>New Galleri Blood Test Shows Promise for Early Detection of Over 50 Cancer Types</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-18 03:13:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new blood test called Galleri has demonstrated the ability to detect more than 50 different types of cancer, many of which currently lack screening programs. In a North American trial involving 25,000 adults, the test successfully identified cancer in many cases at an early, more treatable stage. While researchers are optimistic that this could revolutionize cancer screening, further evidence is needed from ongoing trials, including a large-scale NHS study in England, to confirm if it reduces cancer mortality rates.</p>

          <p>Republican governors in states like Texas and Virginia have activated National Guard troops in anticipation of nationwide "No Kings" protests scheduled to oppose President Donald Trump's administration. Organizers expect large turnouts for the demonstrations, which they frame as a challenge to what they call the president's "authoritarianism." The mobilization has drawn criticism from Democrats, who argue that deploying soldiers against peaceful protests is an overreach of power.</p>

Santos, who had served less than three months for wire fraud and identity theft, had written a letter to Trump pleading for clemency.

          <p>Confrontations between protesters and Illinois state police outside the Broadview ICE detention center near Chicago resulted in at least 15 arrests. Tensions escalated when demonstrators moved out of designated protest zones and officers equipped with batons moved in to clear a roadway. The clash is the latest in a series of volatile demonstrations at the facility, which recently led a court to order federal agents in the state to wear body cameras during immigration operations.</p>
