          <p>President Trump commuted the sentence of Larry Hoover, the co-founder of the Chicago gang Gangster Disciples, who was serving multiple life sentences for murder and federal charges. Hoover, 74, was convicted in 1997 on federal charges related to leading a criminal enterprise from prison, adding to his existing 200-year sentence for a 1973 murder. Hoover's attorneys expressed their gratitude, citing his rehabilitation efforts and decades in solitary confinement. The lead prosecutor in Hoover's federal trial voiced disappointment, emphasizing the severity of Hoover's crimes and his continued operation of a large-scale drug enterprise from prison.</p>

          <p>Israeli warplanes bombed Yemen's main international airport in Sana for the second time this month in retaliation for missile attacks by the Houthi militia. The airstrike destroyed the last remaining aircraft used by the Houthi government, according to Israeli officials and the airport's director. The Sana airport is a vital link for over 20 million Yemenis in Houthi-held areas, providing access to medical treatment and aid. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blamed Iran for supporting the Houthi actions, as tensions remain high in the region amid threats of a possible Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>South Korea's central bank lowered its policy interest rate by 25 basis points to 2.5%, marking its fourth cut in the last six meetings, as the country faces political uncertainty and trade tensions with the United States. The rate cut comes after a botched attempt by the former leader to impose martial law and amid ongoing negotiations with the U.S. to avoid reciprocal tariffs. The central bank cited expectations of declining economic growth and stable inflation as reasons for the decision, also slashing its full-year GDP forecast for 2025. The country's Kospi stock index jumped following the announcement, while the South Korean won weakened. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles faces significant challenges in preparing for the 2028 Summer Olympics, including recovering from recent fires, a projected budget deficit, and potential federal funding cuts.

          <p>Tariffs and global supply chain constraints are expected to significantly slow the growth of China's civil aviation passenger capacity, according to analysts. Despite recent tariff cuts, remaining duties on imports from the U.S. could force Chinese buyers of Boeing jets to pay millions of dollars more per plane. Analysts at China International Capital Corporation (CICC) predict capacity will grow by an average of 3.1% annually until 2028, a sharp decline from the 15.4% average annual growth in the decade leading up to 2019. Some Chinese airlines have reportedly refused to accept deliveries of Boeing planes amid the trade upheaval.</p>

          <p>A federal court ruled that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority with his reciprocal tariffs, dealing a blow to a major tenet of the president's economic agenda. The U.S. Court of International Trade determined that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the power to unilaterally implement sweeping duties. The court ordered a permanent halt to the tariffs and barred future modifications, prompting the Trump administration to swiftly appeal the ruling. Dow futures jumped on the news, while Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield hailed the ruling as a victory for working families and small businesses.</p>

Ishiba has pledged to support the U.S. in reviving its shipbuilding industry, amid China's increasing dominance, and is hoping to schedule a summit with President Trump on the sidelines of the G7 summit in June.

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, delivering a significant blow to a key part of his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that an emergency law invoked by the White House does not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court emphasized that the US Constitution grants Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations. The Trump administration has immediately appealed the ruling, which also blocked levies imposed on China, Mexico, and Canada in response to illegal immigration and drug flow.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has stated that the government is taking steps to comply with a court order to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man, known as O.C.G., who had been deported to Mexico and then Guatemala. O.C.G. had informed U.S. authorities that he had experienced violence in Mexico and was afraid to return. The government's agreement to take steps to return O.C.G. represents a substantial de-escalation in a case that is shaping up to be one of the key courtroom battles over President Trump‚Äôs attempts to conduct mass deportations.</p>
