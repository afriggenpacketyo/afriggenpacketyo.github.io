          <p>An attack at a food distribution site in southern Gaza injured two American aid workers. The US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, along with US and Israeli officials, blamed Hamas for the grenade attack, though no evidence was provided. The incident occurred as Israeli airstrikes killed 14 people in the Gaza Strip, and separate events saw other Palestinians killed while seeking food. These events unfold against a backdrop of renewed ceasefire negotiations, with Hamas giving a "positive" response to a recent US-led proposal for a 60-day truce.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has reportedly paused a significant military aid shipment to Ukraine, citing unsubstantiated concerns about low US weapon stockpiles. This marks the third time Hegseth has halted supplies, a decision that has surprised Congress and European allies. Democrats, like House armed services committee member Adam Smith, argue there is no evidence of a weapons shortage and that the move is unjustified. The delayed aid includes crucial air defense systems, like Patriot missiles, which are vital for defending against escalating Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities.</p>

          <p>Bryan Braman, a former NFL linebacker who won a Super Bowl with the Philadelphia Eagles, is battling a "very rare" and aggressive form of cancer. A GoFundMe campaign was established to support his extensive treatment program, which has raised over $70,000. According to his agent, Braman is "in the fight of his life." A recent update indicated that after an initial treatment showed promise, the cancer has unfortunately grown exponentially and is now near his vital organs, highlighting the severity of his health crisis.</p>

          <p>Following a public dispute with President Donald Trump and a poll on his social media platform X, Elon Musk has announced the creation of his own political party. He declared the formation of the "America Party," stating it aims to restore freedom and address what he describes as a "one-party system" of wasteful spending. The announcement came after a poll he conducted showed a two-to-one majority of his followers favored a new party. This move signals a deeper entry into the political arena for the influential tech billionaire.</p>

          <p>A severe humanitarian crisis is unfolding in Poland's Bialowieza National Park, Europe's last primeval forest, on the border with Belarus. Human rights activists are providing essential aid to migrants who are often injured, some seriously, from climbing the five-meter steel border fence. These individuals, from countries like Syria and Afghanistan, are frequently pushed back into Belarus by Polish guards, despite seeking asylum. Local aid organizations like Grupa Granica face criminalization from the Polish government, yet continue their work to assist those stranded and in desperate need of medical care, food, and water.</p>

Traveling incognito, Twain revisited his past as a steamboat pilot, a profession he cherished for its independence and freedom.

The unconventional, non-linear narrative contains sharp critiques of figures like President Theodore Roosevelt and raw emotion about his family's tragedies.

The top teams—Red Bull, McLaren, and Ferrari—have opted for different car setups, balancing straight-line speed against cornering performance.

          <p>An article exploring the fairness of the U.S. tax system highlights a key distinction between how work and wealth are taxed. While the wealthiest Americans pay an average federal income tax rate of 16%, comparable to some middle-class brackets, their wealth grows primarily through investments, which are taxed differently and at lower rates than wages. The ultra-wealthy utilize strategies like "buy-borrow-die," where they borrow against their assets to live tax-free and pass on wealth with minimal tax impact. This system effectively allows wealth to accumulate with a much lower tax burden. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recovery effort in Texas has turned grim as rescuers search for dozens of missing people, including 24 girls from a Christian summer camp, after deadly flash floods killed at least 27. The Guadalupe River rose eight meters in 45 minutes, overwhelming the area. The article notes that such extreme downpours are becoming more common due to the climate crisis. Officials stated they were caught by surprise by the storm's intensity, renewing questions about forecasting capabilities amid recent budget cuts to the National Weather Service.</p>

          <h2>Social Security Administration Criticized for 'Misleading' Email Praising Trump's Tax Bill</h2>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is facing accusations of spreading "blatant misinformation" after sending an email claiming a new bill signed by President Trump eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for most recipients. Critics and former SSA officials point out that the bill does not eliminate the tax but instead provides a temporary deduction that phases out for higher earners. They argue the email's partisan tone is inappropriate for a typically apolitical agency and misleads seniors about the actual, more modest, impact of the legislation on their finances.

          <p>One year after Labour's 2024 election victory, a focus group of their voters in Kent expressed a general sense of disappointment with the party's performance in government. Participants felt that promises, particularly on immigration, have not been met and were concerned by the government's frequent policy U-turns, which they saw as a lack of clear direction. While some felt the government needed more time, others felt "lied to." The discussion also revealed that the rising popularity of Reform UK is being noticed, with some former Labour voters considering supporting Nigel Farage's party.</p>

          <p>James McMurdock, the Reform UK Member of Parliament for South Basildon and East Thurrock, has given up the party whip following allegations about COVID-19 business loans. A newspaper report questioned the eligibility of two of his companies for £70,000 in Bounce Back loans taken out before he entered Parliament. McMurdock has denied any wrongdoing but stated he requested the whip be suspended as a "precautionary measure" while the party conducts an internal investigation. He will now sit as an independent, reducing Reform UK's number of sitting MPs to four.</p>

          <p>An article from The Guardian examines President Trump's recent and escalating threats of retribution against his political opponents, questioning the impact on American democracy. In the past week alone, the president has suggested deporting Elon Musk, arresting a prospective NYC mayoral candidate, and investigating Joe Biden's former homeland security secretary. Pro-democracy advocates warn that even if these threats are not legally carried out, they create a chilling effect on free speech. They argue that when the president makes it clear that criticizing him could result in state-sponsored retaliation, citizens are no longer truly free.</p>

          <p>The Madre Fire in central California has grown to become the state's largest wildfire of the year, scorching nearly 80,000 acres in rural San Luis Obispo County. The blaze, which is only 10% contained, started on Wednesday and has been fueled by heat and wind, threatening around 50 structures. Over 600 firefighters, supported by air tankers, are battling the fire, which is primarily threatening the Carrizo Plain National Monument. The fire serves as a stark reminder of the state's wildfire dangers, especially as a new heat wave is forecast for the upcoming week.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has deported eight men with serious criminal convictions to South Sudan, a conflict-ridden country with which they have no ties. The men, originally from countries in Asia and Latin America, were the subject of a prolonged legal battle, with advocates arguing the deportation was unconstitutional and could expose them to torture or death. The move followed a Supreme Court order that cleared the way for the administration's unprecedented policy of deporting non-citizens to third-party countries. Human rights groups have condemned the action as punitive and dangerous.</p>
