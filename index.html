          <p>President Vladimir Putin hosted Russia's Victory Day parade in Moscow, commemorating the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany, with China's Xi Jinping among the attendees. Putin used the occasion to link the war to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, asserting Russia's commitment to fighting Nazism and Russophobia. A unilateral ceasefire announced by Russia was rejected by Ukraine, who called it a theatrical show. The parade featured military hardware and personnel, including contingents from China, Vietnam, and Mongolia, highlighting Russia's efforts to project global influence despite Western isolation.</p>

          <p>New York Times article: Chinese exports experienced a significant surge in April, driven by increased trade with Southeast Asian countries, even as shipments to the United States sharply declined due to President Trump's tariffs. Exports to Southeast Asia jumped by 21 percent, while shipments to the U.S. plunged by 21 percent. The shift indicates a redirection of trade as Chinese factories prioritize exports to ASEAN countries, where they have established factories in anticipation of the trade war. This data provides a temporary respite for Beijing amid concerns about the trade war's impact on China's economic outlook, but economists warn of potential unemployment spikes if factory orders decline.</p>

In a speech, Putin briefly mentioned the war in Ukraine, linking past victories with current conflicts and emphasizing Russia's righteous fight. Despite the display of military might, Russia's military has not achieved a decisive victory in Ukraine, and the economy is slowing due to falling oil prices and high interest rates.</p>

          <p>Shares of Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), China's largest contract chip maker, fell nearly 7% after its first-quarter earnings missed estimates. The company reported revenue of $2.24 billion and a net profit of $188 million, both below analysts' expectations. The earnings miss was attributed to production fluctuations that led to falling average selling prices, with the impact expected to extend into the second quarter. Despite the earnings miss, SMIC saw a 15% increase in wafer shipments from the previous quarter and a capacity utilization rate of 89.6%.</p>

          <p>Some of Asia's wealthiest families are reducing their exposure to U.S. assets, citing President Trump's tariffs and policy shifts as reasons for increased uncertainty. Several family offices and advisors to the ultra-rich are either reducing or freezing investments, primarily in U.S. equities and Treasuries. Hong Kong and mainland China are among the markets benefiting from this pull-out. This shift marks a rapid change from earlier in the year when many in Asia's business elite welcomed Trump's election.</p>

          <p>Despite sweeping tariffs on imported aluminum imposed by the U.S., the domestic aluminum production sector isn't reviving due to high electricity costs. Rising electricity prices in the U.S. are leading to smelter closures rather than restarts, undermining the primary goal of the tariffs. While benchmark aluminum prices provide a global reference, the actual cost of acquiring the metal involves regional delivery premiums, which now largely reflect the tariff cost itself. Downstream users are likely to bear the brunt of these costs, leading to higher prices for U.S. consumers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has hinted that US tariffs on goods from China may be reduced as trade officials from both countries prepare for talks. Trump indicated that the tariffs, currently at 145%, would likely decrease, signaling a potential de-escalation in the trade war. The meeting in Switzerland is seen as a positive step towards easing tensions, though analysts caution that lengthy negotiations are expected. Despite the positive signals, official figures show a significant drop in China's exports to the US in April, while overall exports rose.</p>
