          <p>The Israeli military has initiated extensive ground operations in northern and southern Gaza, aiming to pressure Hamas to release hostages and ultimately destroy the group or force its surrender. Israeli warplanes have been conducting strikes in Gaza to prepare for the ground operations, targeting what the military claims are Hamas terror targets. While the military reports killing dozens of Hamas operatives and destroying infrastructure, Palestinian officials report many civilian casualties. These operations occur amidst indirect ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas in Doha, with international efforts ongoing to broker an end to the conflict, which has resulted in over 53,000 Gazan deaths according to local health officials.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson is optimistic that the budget bill, which faced committee setbacks, will reach the House floor before Memorial Day. Johnson emphasized the importance of this "historic" bill, citing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's July 4 deadline, and is working to ensure its swift passage through both the House and the Senate. The bill faced resistance from some Republicans concerned about Medicaid requirements and spending, but Johnson largely blamed potential delays in enforcing new eligibility requirements on states' abilities to implement changes in their systems. Johnson has been in regular contact with Senate Majority Leader John Thune to avoid surprises and ensure smooth passage.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio disputes the intelligence community's assessment that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is not a proxy force of NicolÃ¡s Maduro's government. Rubio cites an FBI assessment that Tren de Aragua is exported by the Venezuelan regime and was contracted to murder an opposition member in Chile. This disagreement centers on the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport suspected gang members. The Supreme Court has blocked the administration from deporting Venezuelan men detained in Texas under this act while they challenge their removals.</p>

However, the future of lei making is threatened by suburban sprawl, climate change, and the fact that 90% of flowers used are imported.

          <p>Ukraine reports that Russia has launched its biggest drone attack since the full-scale invasion began, targeting several regions including Kyiv, where one woman died. Russia had launched 273 drones by 08:00 Sunday targeting the central Kyiv region and Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions in the east, Ukraine's air force said. The barrage has come just a day before a scheduled call between Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. The US President has been urging a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>Severe storms and tornadoes have swept across the midwestern US, resulting in at least 27 deaths in Missouri and Kentucky. Kentuckyâ€™s governor, Andy Beshear, reported at least 18 deaths in his state after a tornado caused a mass casualty event in Laurel county. The storms were part of a weather system that spawned more than two dozen tornadoes in Missouri, Kentucky, Illinois, and Indiana, leaving several hundred thousand customers without power and bringing a heatwave to Texas. The storms hit after staffing cuts at National Weather Service offices, raising concerns about the impact on warnings.</p>

The captain, who was maneuvering the ship, lost power and mechanical function, and the current "caused the ship to go right into the pillar of the bridge, hitting the mass of the ship where there was a couple of sailors," NYPD Chief Wilson Aramboles said during a press briefing.</p>

Zelenskyy spoke with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the U.S. ambassador's residence, while German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he had spoken both to Zelenskyy and to Rubio on the sidelines of the new pope's inauguration. The intensified diplomacy came as Russia launched its largest drone barrage against Ukraine since the start of the full-scale invasion in 2022, after the first direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv in years failed to yield a ceasefire.</p>

However, the Met Office has warned that there is a "medium" risk of a summer drought.</p>
