          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested more than 440 individuals during a protest supporting the proscribed group Palestine Action. The demonstration proceeded despite calls for postponement following a recent synagogue attack in Manchester, with organizers arguing that cancelling would be letting terror win. The arrests, primarily for supporting a banned organization, required a significant police presence of 1,500 officers as many protestors had to be physically carried away. Human rights groups have criticized the police actions as a breach of international human rights obligations, highlighting the intense social and political tensions surrounding the event.</p>

          <p>A recent NIH-funded study indicates that manual acupuncture can provide significant relief for adults suffering from chronic low back pain, positioning it as a viable alternative to opioid medications. The trial, involving 800 older adults, found that participants receiving acupuncture reported greater reductions in pain-related disability and intensity compared to those receiving usual medical care. The use of acupuncture in the U.S. has more than doubled over the past two decades, with many patients turning to the traditional technique for its strong safety profile and benefits in improving physical function and reducing anxiety.</p>

          <p>Rite Aid has confirmed it is closing all of its locations, ending decades of operation for the U.S. pharmacy chain. This announcement follows the company's second bankruptcy filing in two years, which was part of a restructuring plan to reduce debt and resolve litigation claims. Since October 2023, over 520 pharmacies have been shut down, with the company facing challenges from declining sales and lawsuits related to the opioid crisis. The company's website now directs former customers to services for finding a new pharmacy and requesting their records, marking the end of an era.</p>

Red Bull's Max Verstappen expressed his dislike for the system and opposes plans to make it mandatory, citing design flaws and lack of space in the cockpit. In contrast, Mercedes driver George Russell plans to use the vest, noting his team has made other improvements to mitigate cockpit temperatures that have previously exceeded 60°C. The debate highlights the physical challenges drivers face and the ongoing efforts to enhance safety.</p>

          <p>Police in Tbilisi, Georgia, deployed water cannons and pepper spray against tens of thousands of demonstrators who attempted to storm the presidential palace. The protests occurred during a municipal election boycotted by major opposition groups, who accuse the ruling Georgian Dream party of steering the country toward Russia's influence. Demonstrators, carrying Georgian and EU flags, expressed their desire for closer ties with Europe and protested a government crackdown on dissent, media, and rights groups. The opposition had called for a "peaceful revolution" to counter what they describe as repressive policies and rigged elections.</p>

          <p>Populist billionaire Andrej Babiš has won the Czech parliamentary election, marking a significant political comeback for his ANO movement. With nearly all votes counted, ANO secured 35% of the vote, defeating the pro-Western coalition led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala. This result signals a potential shift in the country's foreign policy, aligning it more closely with the pro-Russian stances of neighboring Hungary and Slovakia and away from its previous support for Ukraine. Babiš may form a majority government by partnering with anti-migrant and right-wing parties that also gained seats in parliament.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is considering a draft design for a $1 coin to commemorate America's 250th anniversary, featuring Donald Trump with a clenched fist and the words "fight, fight, fight." The phrase is a direct reference to his response after surviving an assassination attempt during his 2024 presidential campaign. U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach confirmed the authenticity of the draft designs, which are authorized under bipartisan legislation signed by Trump in 2020. A Treasury spokesperson noted the design is not final but reflects the country's "enduring spirit" in the face of obstacles.</p>

          <p>Israel has reportedly paused its offensive military activities in Gaza to allow Hamas to organize the release of hostages, according to a senior Israeli official. This move is not an official ceasefire but a tactical adjustment intended to advance a peace deal brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump. U.S. envoys are traveling to Egypt to finalize the deal's technical details, with indirect talks between Israel and Hamas expected to begin Sunday. In response, President Trump issued a warning to Hamas, urging them to move quickly on the hostage release or risk all negotiations being called off.</p>

His election is seen as a significant step for a church that is over 95% white but has been working to support multicultural ministries.

Democratic leaders emphasize that federal law already prohibits undocumented immigrants from accessing programs like Medicaid, Medicare, and the ACA. Their funding resolution aims to reverse cuts that would affect lawfully present noncitizens, such as refugees and asylum seekers, who are set to lose coverage under a new Republican-backed law. The debate highlights the parties' conflicting strategies, with Republicans focusing on immigration and Democrats highlighting the potential loss of health insurance for legal residents.</p>

However, there is some awareness within his administration of potential political blowback if the shutdown leads to widespread layoffs of government workers.

          <p>Great Western Railway (GWR) has been fined £1 million for health and safety breaches that led to the death of a passenger in 2018. Bethan Roper, 28, was killed when her head struck a tree branch after she leaned out of a droplight window on a moving train near Bath. The Office of Rail and Road prosecuted GWR, finding that the company was aware of the risks posed by such windows and had failed to implement safety measures identified in a risk assessment. The incident echoed a similar death in 2016, after which safety recommendations were issued.</p>

          <p>A senior White House official, Anthony Salisbury, accidentally revealed plans to deploy the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division to Portland, Oregon, while using a messaging app in a public space. The messages showed discussions with a senior adviser to the defense secretary about sending the elite unit to the city. The conversation indicated that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wanted direct orders from President Trump for "top cover" due to the likely controversy of using a top-tier military unit for domestic crowd control. The White House confirmed the official's identity but dismissed the leaked information as not classified.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market continued its rally, with the S&P 500 reaching its 29th record high of the year despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. The healthcare sector saw a significant surge after a deal was announced to exempt Pfizer from certain tariffs, boosting stocks like Danaher and Eli Lilly. The technology sector also performed strongly, driven by the continued investor interest in artificial intelligence, which also lifted utility stocks due to the high power demands of AI data centers. The market's resilience suggests investors have largely dismissed the shutdown as a non-event for the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel has deported 137 activists to Turkey after its navy intercepted the Global Sumud Flotilla, which was attempting to deliver humanitarian aid to Gaza in defiance of an 18-year maritime blockade. The flotilla, which included nearly 50 vessels and 500 activists, was intercepted in international waters, an action condemned by Turkey and other world leaders. The deportations occurred as large pro-Palestinian demonstrations took place in several major European cities to protest Israel's actions. Israel's foreign ministry described the activists as "provocateurs" and accused some of having links to Hamas, a claim flotilla members denied.</p>

          <p>The increasing prevalence of digital money, including cryptocurrencies and stablecoins, presents significant regulatory challenges for major financial centers. While proponents tout benefits like lower transaction costs, regulators are concerned about financial instability, consumer tracking, and systemic crises. The U.S. is pursuing a more privatized, lightly regulated model under the Trump administration, which some experts warn could lead to a "wild west" environment and an inevitable crash. In contrast, the UK and EU are attempting to balance innovation with robust regulation to prevent risky behavior from threatening the broader financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite U.S. stock markets trading near record highs, some financial experts suggest that American investors should consider increasing their exposure to international markets. Dave Nadig of ETF.com noted that "home bias is about as bad as it's ever been," with the average investor having too much capital concentrated in the United States. Analysts point to potential value abroad, particularly in emerging markets like China and India, which are experiencing rapid growth driven by large populations and expanding consumer classes. This perspective encourages diversification as a strategy to mitigate risk and capture growth opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair has been named in U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan as a potential key figure in the post-war governance of Gaza. Under the proposal, Gaza would be run by a technocratic government overseen by a "Board of Peace," chaired by Trump, with Blair playing a leading role. The suggestion has drawn sharp criticism due to Blair's controversial legacy in the Middle East, particularly his role in the 2003 Iraq invasion and his subsequent tenure as a Middle East envoy. Critics, including Palestinian officials, have expressed strong opposition to his involvement.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the prosecution of Kilmar Ábrego García, a Salvadoran national, on human-smuggling charges may be an act of illegal retaliation by the Department of Justice. The ruling allows Ábrego's lawyers to seek evidence to prove the case is vindictive, following his successful lawsuit against the Trump administration for his wrongful deportation. Judge Waverly Crenshaw cited "remarkable statements" by a deputy attorney general that seemed to link the charges to Ábrego's legal victory.

          <p>Researchers from the Chinese military have conducted a laboratory experiment simulating the effects of striking a single target with three consecutive nuclear missiles. The study, published in a Chinese science journal, found that the rapid succession of blasts creates a significantly larger crater and causes far more destruction than a single detonation. While the scientists claim the research is the first to accurately model such an attack, the findings could also be used to develop more resilient bunkers capable of withstanding advanced nuclear threats.

These students often pay full tuition and support local businesses, especially during academic breaks when domestic students leave. The falloff is attributed to stricter visa vetting, fears of deportation, and a perception of a less welcoming environment in the U.S.</p>
