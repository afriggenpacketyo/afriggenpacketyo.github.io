          <p>Christian Brückner, the prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann disappearance case, has been released from a German prison after serving time for raping an elderly woman in Portugal in 2005, and will be fitted with an ankle tag. Despite being a convicted sex offender with a history of sexual abuse, Brückner has never been charged in connection with McCann's disappearance and denies any involvement. German prosecutors maintain he was in the area when Madeleine vanished in 2007, but lack sufficient evidence to press charges. The case remains a high-profile missing person investigation, with ongoing searches and significant funding allocated to the investigation, while the British police continue to treat her disappearance as a missing persons case. </p>

          <p>A deal between Fortescue and E.On to supply green hydrogen to Europe has collapsed, signaling a broader retreat from large-scale green hydrogen infrastructure investment. The EU's ambitious hydrogen production and import targets are unlikely to be met, with only a small fraction of planned projects expected to materialize by 2030. BP also canceled its investment in a renewable energy and green hydrogen project in Western Australia, citing a strategic shift towards oil and gas. Green hydrogen production remains expensive due to the high cost of renewable energy, and faces competition from cheaper alternatives like natural gas, with the scaling of green hydrogen presenting real challenges. </p>

          <p>A proposed deal to eliminate tariffs on UK steel exports to the US has been indefinitely put on hold, despite earlier optimism. Currently, UK steel exports to the US face a 25% tariff, although this is still comparatively better than the 50% tariffs faced by other countries. Industry sources express disappointment but acknowledge the UK's relative advantage and the certainty provided amidst a global surplus of cheap steel. The UK government says it is still working closely with the US and that it is still the only country to benefit from a 25% tariff on steel exports to the US. </p>

          <p>The sun's 11-year solar cycle is peaking in 2025, raising concerns about the potential disruption of power grids, satellites, and internet communication. A University of California-Irvine study suggests that a strong solar storm could paralyze the internet long term due to the vulnerability of undersea cable repeaters and unprotected satellites. The strongest solar storm measured on Earth was the Carrington Event in 1859, which caused failures in telegraph networks, while a 2012 storm narrowly missed Earth. Suggestions for a more robust internet include shifting infrastructure southward, using shorter connections, and implementing overhead cables. </p>

          <p>China is introducing 19 measures to stimulate service consumption by easing market access and increasing supply in sectors like culture, sports, and healthcare. These measures include opening up the culture industry, introducing more international sports events, and attracting foreign investment in medical care. To boost demand, authorities plan to expand visa-free access for foreign visitors and explore adjustments to school holiday schedules. Authorities will also encourage financial institutions to increase lending to businesses in these sectors. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a $15 billion lawsuit against the New York Times, alleging defamation and libel based on its campaign coverage. The lawsuit does not cite specific inaccuracies but criticizes the paper's coverage as biased and part of persistent election interference. Trump claims the Times has engaged in a decades-long method of lying about him, his family, and his political movement. Legal experts say the suit is unlikely to succeed, as Trump would need to prove malice or reckless disregard for the truth, while filing a suit is often the point to force even the biggest companies to spend a fortune on legal fees. </p>

          <p>Great Britain is competing in the Billie Jean King Cup Finals, aiming to improve on last year's semi-final run and win their first title. The team includes Katie Boulter, Sonay Kartal, Jodie Burrage, and Fran Jones, with Boulter bringing experience and Kartal showing potential after her rise in the rankings. The team is without Emma Raducanu, who pulled out earlier this month, but remains determined to make a strong showing. Britain have made the final four times, but have never lifted the title. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shohei Ohtani was removed after five no-hit innings due to workload management, a decision that led to the Dodgers' bullpen collapsing and losing to the Phillies. Despite Ohtani's dominance, the team decided to stick to their plan of limiting him to five innings, given his recent Tommy John surgery. The bullpen then gave up nine runs over the next four innings, wasting Ohtani's performance, however Ohtani helped the Dodgers get back in the game with his bat and the Dodgers tied the score in the eighth. The Dodgers' bullpen did what it does best once more in the ninth, coming unglued at the worst possible moment. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Labour deputy leadership contender Lucy Powell has criticized "unforced errors" by the government over welfare, saying attempts to cut disability benefits and winter fuel payments have left voters questioning "whose side we are on". She urged the party's leaders to be clearer about their desire to scrap the two-child benefit cap, and move out of a "defensive crouch" on the issue. She also dismissed claims her deputy leadership bid was a "proxy" for a leadership bid by Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham or Energy Secretary Ed Miliband. Powell said she may have been sacked as Commons leader in Sir Keir's reshuffle for telling the Labour leadership things "they didn't want to hear" such as how deeply MPs opposed welfare cuts. </p>

          <p>The UK is offering President Trump a state visit filled with royalty, military bands, and a banquet after a challenging week for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The visit aims to showcase the economic wins of the UK-US relationship, though disagreements on issues like Palestinian state recognition and the war in Ukraine remain. The visit comes almost exactly a year after Starmer and Trump first met, and while the relationship is considered a triumph, its unpredictability is acknowledged. The prime minister will likely face uncertainty during the press conference due to the president's unpredictable nature. </p>

          <p>Microsoft says its new $30 billion investment in the UK's AI sector should significantly boost Britain's economy in the next few years. The package forms a major part of a £31bn agreement dubbed the "Tech Prosperity Deal", signed between the UK government and several US tech giants as part of Donald Trump's second state visit to the UK. The deal will see Google, Nvidia and others invest in British-based infrastructure to support AI tech, largely in the form of data centres. Microsoft will also now be involved in the creation of a powerful new supercomputer in Essex. </p>

The judge added that neither of the pieces was "particularly strong" and did not add to the "allegations of abuse that the jury already considered." The brothers are still waiting for a decision on their clemency petitions sent to Gov. Gavin Newsom. </p>
