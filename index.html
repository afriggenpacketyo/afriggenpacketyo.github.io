        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year. The agencies aim to work with food companies to voluntarily remove the dyes, including Green No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, and Yellow No. 6, from products like cereal, ice cream, and snacks. The FDA is also taking steps to authorize four new natural color additives, and former President Joe Biden's administration had already started the process to ban Red No. 3 due to cancer concerns in rats. However, the International Association of Color Manufacturers has questioned the proposed timeline, citing the complexity of food production.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government measures will grant police chiefs the power to automatically dismiss officers who fail background checks, aiming to restore public confidence in policing following Sarah Everard's murder by a police officer. The reforms, making background checks a legal requirement, come after reports revealed instances of officers remaining on full pay despite failing vetting. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper emphasized that only officers of the highest standards should wear the uniform, and the National Police Chiefs' Council supports the changes to ensure unfit individuals are removed from service. The new rules also address concerns raised by a High Court ruling that previously hindered the dismissal of officers accused of misconduct.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated he has no intention of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite previously criticizing him for not cutting interest rates more aggressively. This announcement comes after speculation that Trump was exploring options to remove Powell, which had unsettled financial markets. Trump expressed optimism about improving trade relations with China, indicating a willingness to negotiate and reduce tariffs. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently downgraded its forecast for US economic growth due to uncertainty caused by trade tariffs, highlighting the impact of trade tensions on the global economy.</p>

          <p>Tesla is carefully considering entering the Indian market, according to CFO Vaibhav Taneja, who cited tariff concerns as a significant obstacle.

While India has expressed interest in Tesla establishing a manufacturing base in the country, the company is evaluating the right time to enter the market due to these trade barriers. This announcement follows discussions between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding potential collaboration on technology and innovation.</p>

Liberal leader Mark Carney has positioned his party as the best option to navigate the trade challenges posed by Trump's tariffs, which have already impacted Canada's auto sector.

          <p>Chinese energy firms may need to renegotiate long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) contracts with US providers due to escalating trade war tariffs, according to S&P Global Commodity Insights. Trade flows of US LNG to China have ceased since tariffs were imposed, and Chinese buyers now hold significant contracted US LNG volumes. While the US only supplied a small percentage of China's total LNG imports, volumes were expected to grow rapidly.
