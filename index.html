            <p>An expansive prison in Tocorón, Venezuela, once featuring amenities like a nightclub and swimming pools, served as the birthplace of the Tren de Aragua gang. This gang rose to international prominence, engaging in activities like kidnappings and extortion, even before being highlighted in anti-immigration rhetoric. The gang's influence expanded beyond Venezuela, with members implicated in crimes across South America and the United States. Despite a military raid aimed at regaining control of the prison, the Tren de Aragua's reach continues to pose challenges for multiple countries.</p>

            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a temporary Easter truce in Ukraine, lasting from Saturday evening to Sunday midnight, citing humanitarian grounds. However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized the announcement, pointing to continued Russian drone strikes and questioning the sincerity of the ceasefire. This announcement follows Secretary of State Marco Rubio expressing frustration with the progress of peace talks. Despite the ceasefire announcement, fighting continued in certain regions, and Ukraine has agreed to a prior proposal from the US for a 30-day ceasefire which Russia had rejected.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily halted the deportations of Venezuelans detained in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, pending further review. This decision followed an appeal from the ACLU, which argued that the individuals were not given the opportunity to argue their cases in court. The White House maintains that the detainees are "foreign terrorists" and is confident they will ultimately prevail. The ACLU's lawsuit cited the deportation of Venezuelans to a mega-prison in El Salvador, highlighting the potential harm to those deported.</p>

            <p>Property owners affected by recent wildfires are suing major California insurance companies, including State Farm, alleging antitrust violations and unfair competition. The lawsuit claims insurers conspired to push homeowners into the California FAIR Plan, a state-backed insurance option for high-risk areas. This action follows previous legal challenges related to insurers' handling of wildfire aftermath, with plaintiffs arguing the FAIR Plan offers insufficient coverage at high premiums. The suit seeks damages and aims to address what plaintiffs describe as cartel-like behavior within the insurance industry.</p>

            <p>With trade tensions lingering between the US and China, the upcoming ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur presents an opportunity for dialogue. ASEAN could leverage its convening power to invite key officials from both countries to discuss trade issues. This approach could provide a face-saving way for both sides to engage in negotiations and potentially resolve the tariff impasse. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations is uniquely positioned to bridge the divide between these two major economic powers.</p>

            <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reported continued Russian attacks despite Vladimir Putin's announcement of an Easter truce. Zelensky affirmed that Kyiv would adhere to the truce but accused Moscow of breaking it. He referenced a previous US proposal for a 30-day ceasefire, to which Ukraine had already agreed. The UK's Foreign Office expressed skepticism, urging Putin to demonstrate a genuine commitment to peace by ending the invasion and committing to a full ceasefire.</p>

Fighting reportedly continued in Russia's Kursk and Belgorod regions, and Russian drones were still in use.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelans detained under the Alien Enemies Act.

The White House defended the administration's actions, asserting confidence in their lawfulness. The Alien Enemies Act, last invoked during World War II, has raised concerns about due process and historical parallels to internment camps.</p>

            <p>The US Supreme Court has ordered the Trump administration to pause the deportation of a group of alleged Venezuelan gang members. This follows the invocation of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, which grants the president power to detain and deport citizens of "enemy" nations. The ACLU sued to stop the removal of the men, arguing they had not been able to contest their cases in court. The White House maintains confidence in the lawfulness of their actions, calling the legal challenges "meritless litigation".</p>
