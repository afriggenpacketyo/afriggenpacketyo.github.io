        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Intense storms on Monday triggered flash flood warnings across the New York City region, causing significant disruptions. Heavy rainfall led to submerged roads in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut, with Governor Phil Murphy declaring a state of emergency in New Jersey. The flooding severely impacted transportation, suspending subway services and delaying Metro-North trains, while numerous drivers were stranded in high water. Local businesses and homes also reported damage from the rapidly rising floodwaters, prompting multiple rescue operations for those trapped in their vehicles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy expanded by 5.2% in the second quarter, slightly surpassing economists' forecasts despite facing challenges like trade tensions and a property downturn. While this growth decelerated from the previous quarter, industrial output showed strong performance. However, slowing retail sales and cautious investment figures point to underlying economic fragility, prompting calls for further government stimulus to support growth. The data reflects a mixed economic picture, with resilient exports to new markets offsetting a decline in U.S.-bound shipments. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A consortium of major freeholders, including wealthy landowners and charitable organizations, has initiated a High Court judicial review against the UK government's 2024 Leasehold and Freehold Reform Act. They argue that the law, which aims to make it cheaper and easier for leaseholders to extend leases or buy freeholds, infringes upon their property rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. The claimants contend the reforms could cause them significant financial losses, while leaseholder advocates worry the legal battle will stall much-needed changes and leave them trapped in unfair agreements.</p>

          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, resulted in the deaths of nine residents and left another critically injured. Firefighters arrived Sunday night to find heavy flames and smoke, with residents needing rescue from windows. Authorities reported that about 30 residents were hospitalized, and five firefighters sustained minor injuries during the response.

          <p>President Donald Trump has shifted his stance on the Ukraine war, announcing a plan to send "top-of-the-line weapons" to Kyiv through NATO allies, who will foot the bill. The deal involves European nations sending their Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine, with the U.S. providing replacements. Simultaneously, Trump threatened to impose 100% secondary tariffs on countries trading with Russia if a peace deal is not reached within 50 days. This marks a significant change in rhetoric, as Trump expressed frustration with Vladimir Putin for the lack of progress in ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>The BBC's annual report on star salaries, while listing high earners like Gary Lineker and Zoe Ball, omits many of its most prominent talents. This discrepancy arises because the disclosure rules only apply to talent directly paid by the license-fee-funded parts of the BBC. Stars employed by the commercial arm, BBC Studios, or independent production companies that make shows for the BBC, are not included. Consequently, the earnings of hosts and actors from popular shows like "The Traitors," "Strictly Come Dancing," and "Would I Lie To You?" remain unpublished, presenting an incomplete picture of the corporation's talent expenditure.</p>

The stay will remain in effect until at least July 21, pausing a policy that would have removed legal status for many Afghans who arrived after the Taliban's takeover in 2021.

According to the Justice Department, Cruz assisted an undocumented immigrant, Miguel Martinez, in filing over 500 fraudulent tax returns between 2019 and 2023. The scheme involved using stolen identities to create fake businesses and report fictitious wage information to the IRS. While the full amount was not paid, the IRS issued approximately $2.3 million in refunds before the fraud was uncovered. Cruz now faces up to 10 years in prison.</p>

          <p>At least four firefighters have sustained injuries, including blunt force trauma and heat-related illnesses, while fighting multiple wildfires in Northern California. Crews are contending with extreme conditions, including triple-digit temperatures and steep, dry terrain, as they work to contain the blazes. The Green fire in Shasta-Trinity National Forest and the Orleans Complex fires in Del Norte and Siskiyou counties have collectively burned nearly 20,000 acres. Fire officials highlighted the immense challenges, including inaccessibility and thick smoke, which have complicated both ground and air-based firefighting efforts in the remote, forested areas.</p>

          <h2>Port of Los Angeles Experiences Record June Traffic as Shippers Rush to Pre-empt Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Port of Los Angeles handled a record volume of shipping containers in June, an 8% increase over the previous year, as businesses accelerated shipments to get ahead of potential U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Port executives describe this as a "tariff whipsaw effect," where shifting trade policy timelines create volatile cargo flows rather than indicating sustained economic growth. Importers are facing significantly higher costs due to existing tariffs, and analysts predict a sharp decline in cargo volume in the coming months once new tariffs are in place, highlighting the uncertainty roiling global supply chains.

          <p>Paraguay's President Santiago Peña has forcefully declared his country's commitment to its 68-year diplomatic relationship with Taiwan, vowing to defend the alliance "with all its strength." Speaking at a business forum, Peña framed the partnership not merely as an economic one, but as a strategic alliance based on shared democratic values and Paraguay's sovereign foreign policy. This strong statement comes after a recent incident where a Beijing-based envoy was accused of privately lobbying opposition lawmakers to switch allegiance to China. Paraguay remains one of the few countries globally to maintain formal diplomatic relations with Taipei instead of Beijing.</p>

The space, created by the San Francisco-based company Photomatica, features four restored analog photo booths from as early as the 1950s, alongside one digital machine. While retrofitted to accept modern payments, the old machines use original chemical-based film processing, offering an authentic, tangible experience.

          <p>Shares of major fintech companies, including Block and PayPal, rallied on Monday, recovering from a sell-off late last week. The initial decline was triggered by reports that JPMorgan Chase planned to charge data aggregators for access to customer financial information. However, market analysts have since downplayed the risk, with firms like Evercore ISI stating the potential fees would not be a "business model-breaking" cost increase for large fintech platforms. This reassessment, along with broader market momentum, helped restore investor confidence in the sector, suggesting the immediate impact of the proposed fees would be negligible.

While some funds have been released as the company makes progress, a majority of the withheld payments will continue to be released incrementally into next year.

The Home Office stated it now has sufficient information to make robust and well-evidenced decisions on individual cases. This move could put thousands of Syrians in the UK in scope for returns, with ministers hoping the first enforced returns could happen by the end of the year.

          <p>President Trump's recent shift to a more aggressive policy towards Russia, including arming Ukraine and threatening tariffs, is reportedly driven less by a strategic change and more by personal frustration. According to White House insiders cited in this article, Trump feels that Vladimir Putin has repeatedly ignored his pleas to end the war, making him look weak and like a "junior partner." After months of believing he could broker a peace deal, Trump has grown angry that his calls with Putin are followed by escalated attacks on Ukraine. This sense of being personally slighted and defied appears to be a key motivator behind the new, tougher approach.</p>
