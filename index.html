          <p>President Donald Trump has granted a full pardon to Changpeng Zhao, the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Zhao had previously pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering and was sentenced to four months in prison as part of a $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice. The White House framed the pardon as a response to what it called the "Biden Administration's war on cryptocurrency." This action follows Trump's recent commutation of the prison sentence for former New York Representative George Santos.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has updated the official White House website's historical timeline to include scandals from previous Democratic administrations, such as the discovery of cocaine during the Biden presidency and Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. This move is seen as a response to Democratic criticism of President Trump's privately funded construction of a new grand ballroom at the White House. Critics, including Hillary Clinton and Senator Elizabeth Warren, have condemned the construction project, while the administration defends it as a necessary, taxpayer-free modernization.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit has been filed accusing the creators of the $MELANIA cryptocurrency of orchestrating a pump-and-dump scheme. The coin, launched just before Donald Trump's inauguration, saw its price surge dramatically before collapsing to less than 1% of its peak value. Investors allege that executives at the Meteora cryptocurrency exchange, where the coin was initially traded, manipulated the market to profit while causing the price to plummet. First Lady Melania Trump is not named as a defendant in the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>The national inquiry into grooming gangs is facing internal division, with two separate groups of survivors taking opposing stances on the role of Safeguarding Minister Jess Phillips. While four members of the survivors' panel have resigned and demanded Phillips' removal to rejoin, another group of five has written to the Prime Minister stating they will only continue if she remains in her post. The disagreement centers on trust in the minister and whether the inquiry's scope should be expanded beyond grooming gangs to other forms of child sexual exploitation.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Israel, U.S. Vice President JD Vance publicly criticized a preliminary vote in the Israeli parliament to advance a bill on annexing the occupied West Bank. Vance labeled the move an insulting and "very stupid political stunt," reaffirming that the Trump administration's policy is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office also condemned the vote, describing it as a provocation by the opposition intended to cause discord during Vance's visit.</p>

Adams, who recently ended his own reelection campaign, is reportedly making the move to counter Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani, whom he has openly criticized. Cuomo, who lost the Democratic primary to Mamdani, is polling second, and the endorsement could reshape the dynamics of the three-way race that also includes Republican Curtis Sliwa.</p>

This has led to a rise in interest and membership in conservative student publications and debate societies at elite universities like Stanford and Yale.

          <p>The gross national debt of the United States has surpassed the $38 trillion mark for the first time, a milestone reached as the federal government remains shut down. Experts note that shutdowns can exacerbate the national debt by disrupting economic activity and increasing costs associated with pausing and restarting federal programs. The rapid increase in debt, which grew by $1 trillion in just two months, is raising concerns among fiscal policy experts about rising interest costs and potential impacts on investor confidence.

          <p>With certificate of deposit (CD) rates currently attractive but potentially poised to decrease, financial experts suggest a balanced approach for savers. Planners recommend allocating between 10% to 30% of cash savings to CDs, focusing on shorter-term accounts to maintain flexibility as economic conditions change. Before committing funds, individuals should ensure they have a sufficient emergency fund of three to six months' living expenses in a more liquid account. A CD laddering strategy is also recommended to manage reinvestment risk. (not investment advice)</p>

The move follows the ousting of the previous commercial chief earlier in 2024 after a controversial business travel strategy failed to produce expected results.</p>

The book describes factional infighting and a lack of vetting for key positions, painting a picture of a transition process where inexperience was not a barrier to securing a high-level government post.</p>
