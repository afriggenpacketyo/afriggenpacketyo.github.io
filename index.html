          <p>A new study by Chinese military researchers suggests that the Paracel Islands' complex undersea terrain could be used to create a "submarine kill zone." The plan involves deploying intelligent sea mines in "acoustic shadow zones" created by submerged mountains, making them difficult for enemy sonar to detect. This strategy aims to enhance China's maritime defense capabilities and challenge U.S. undersea dominance by leveraging natural topography for covert weapon placement in the contested South China Sea.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A worldwide craze for matcha, fueled by its reputation as a superfood and social media trends, has led to significant supply shortages and price hikes, even in its native Japan. The surge in demand, coupled with a post-pandemic tourism boom, has strained Japan's aging farming communities and labor-intensive production process for tencha, the tea leaves used for matcha. Consequently, retailers are rationing supplies and prices have doubled, prompting the Japanese government to consider subsidies to encourage more farmers to cultivate the lucrative green tea powder.</p>

          <p>As investors return from summer holidays, they face September, which has historically been the worst-performing month of the year for major stock indices like the S&P 500 and Dow Jones. While markets ended August on a high note, with European banking stocks reaching post-2008 crisis levels, analysts are divided on the outlook. Some anticipate a continued bull market supported by a soft landing, while others express caution, citing underlying economic pressures and a potential slowdown in the second half of the year.

          <p>Lucy Guo, recently named Forbes' youngest self-made billionaire, attributes her entrepreneurial drive to a frugal upbringing by immigrant parents that motivated her to seek financial independence from a young age. She began trading Pokémon cards on the playground and later developed coding skills to create and sell bots for online games. This early start eventually led her to drop out of Carnegie Mellon University to accept a Thiel Fellowship, co-found the AI company Scale AI, and later launch the monetization platform Passes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New figures from England's Department for Education reveal a strong correlation between school attendance in the first week of term and persistent absence later in the year. The data from 2024 showed that 57% of pupils who missed some school in the first week went on to be "persistently absent," compared to only 14% of those with full attendance. In response, the Education Secretary is urging schools and parents to prioritize attendance from day one to combat the ongoing post-pandemic challenge of high student absenteeism.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have joined other world leaders in Tianjin, China, for the annual Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit. The gathering, which focuses on regional security, is taking place as both India and Russia face economic pressure from the United States through tariffs and sanctions. The SCO, founded in 2001 by China, Russia, and Central Asian nations, is often viewed as a counterbalance to Western alliances like NATO.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the UK's Reform party is importing Donald Trump's confrontational tactics against the press, citing the recent decision by Nottinghamshire's Reform-led council to ban the Nottingham Post. The author suggests this is part of a broader strategy by hard-right politicians who feel they can bypass traditional media and benefit from portraying journalists as an establishment foil. While noting differences between UK and US political cultures, the piece warns that shutting out local media is an attack on democracy and a test of the party's fitness for governance.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles City Councilmember Ysabel Jurado has publicly opposed a planned Home Depot in Eagle Rock, accusing the retailer of being complicit in federal immigration enforcement operations. Her statement follows a recent raid near a Westlake Home Depot, one of several targeting day laborers in the store's parking lot. Jurado argued that Home Depot's silence on the repeated targeting of its locations amounts to complicity, a claim the company disputes by stating it is not notified of and does not request the operations.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson has signed an executive order aimed at protecting residents' rights in anticipation of a potential deployment of federal agents for immigration enforcement. The largely symbolic order seeks to prevent city police from being deputized, bars federal agents from wearing masks, and directs city departments to monitor federal activity. The move comes amid reports of a possible large-scale federal operation in the city, reflecting growing tensions between local governments and the Trump administration's immigration policies.</p>
