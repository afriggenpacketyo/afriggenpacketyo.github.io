          <p>President Trump has arrived in Alaska for a critical summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, aimed at negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine. The meeting follows overnight missile and drone strikes by Russia across Ukraine, underscoring the conflict's intensity. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated the administration hopes to quickly assess the potential for a peace agreement, emphasizing that a ceasefire is a critical first step for any meaningful dialogue. The summit's outcome is being closely watched by international leaders, with significant implications for global security and the ongoing conflict in Eastern Europe.</p>

          <p>President Trump is evaluating a wide-ranging list of nearly a dozen potential candidates to succeed Jerome Powell as the chair of the Federal Reserve. The contenders include a diverse group of current and former Fed officials, economists, and market strategists, many of whom advocate for lowering the central bank's benchmark interest rate. Prominent figures like former Governor Kevin Warsh have called for significant changes, while others emphasize the need for greater transparency and intellectual diversity within the Federal Open Market Committee.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's bioethanol industry is facing imminent collapse after the government decided against providing a rescue package to its two major producers, Vivergo Fuels and Ensus. The companies warned that their operations became commercially unviable after a recent US-UK trade deal removed tariffs on imported American ethanol, flooding the market. Associated British Foods, Vivergo's owner, expressed deep regret over the decision, stating it discards a key national asset and will shift clean energy jobs overseas. The government defended its choice, arguing that direct funding would not offer value for taxpayers or solve the industry's long-term issues.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The series finale of HBO Max's "And Just Like That" is being described by critics as an unsatisfying conclusion to the "Sex and the City" sequel. This article argues that the show's three seasons have been defined by a sense of humiliation and a squeamishness about aging and physicality, often treating its characters' bodies as punchlines. Unlike the original series, which balanced cynicism with glamour, the sequel struggled with low stakes and out-of-touch characters, making it difficult for audiences to empathize with their predicaments. The finale ultimately rehashes old patterns, leaving a sense that the show was often hostile to its own source material.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Regulatory filings reveal that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway acquired a new stake in the beleaguered health insurer UnitedHealth during the last quarter, purchasing over 5 million shares valued at approximately $1.6 billion. This move is notable given UnitedHealth's recent struggles, including a Justice Department investigation and a significant drop in its stock price throughout 2025. The investment aligns with Buffett's history of value investing in under-pressure companies, and the disclosure caused the insurer's stock to rise in after-hours trading. The filing also showed Berkshire trimming its positions in Apple and Bank of America. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Leaders at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for artificial intelligence, have acknowledged a "challenging" period for staff amid significant organizational changes. This follows a whistleblowing complaint to the Charity Commission from employees who raised concerns about the institute's potential collapse and a toxic internal culture. The turmoil stems from a new government directive to prioritize defense research, a major pivot from the institute's broader mission that has led to redundancies. While leadership has committed to transparency and established a new working group with government officials, whistleblowers remain skeptical, describing the response as performative.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has rescinded local directives in Washington, D.C., that limited cooperation between the city's police and federal immigration agents, effectively ending its 'sanctuary' policies. The move is part of President Trump's broader anti-crime initiative in the capital, which recently placed the Metropolitan Police Department under temporary federal control. Bondi's order allows D.C. police to fully assist agencies like ICE, including honoring administrative warrants and detainers that were previously restricted. City officials, including D.C.'s Attorney General, have pushed back, arguing the federal directive is unlawful and that local police are not obligated to follow it.</p>

          <h2>Historical Context of Federal Control Over Washington D.C. Explored Amidst Trump's Takeover</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's recent federal takeover of the Washington, D.C. police department highlights a long and contentious history of the federal government's control over the nation's capital. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress jurisdiction over D.C., which for most of its history left residents without elected local leadership or congressional representation. While the 1974 Home Rule Act granted some self-governance, Congress retained the power to overrule local laws. This article suggests that resistance to D.C.'s autonomy has often been intertwined with paternalistic and racist arguments, a dynamic that continues to influence the modern debate over statehood and local control.</p>

          <p>The relationship between President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which has shifted significantly over time, is a central focus of their summit in Alaska. After previously praising Putin as a "genius," Trump's tone has grown more critical in recent months, expressing frustration with the Russian leader's actions in Ukraine and calling him "crazy." This meeting marks their first one-on-one discussion of Trump's second term, set against the grim backdrop of the ongoing war. Analysts suggest Trump's expectations are more moderated now, as he attempts to navigate a complex diplomatic situation he once claimed he could resolve instantly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sixth round of UN negotiations aimed at creating a global treaty to end plastic pollution has collapsed without an agreement. The talks in Geneva failed due to a fundamental deadlock between two opposing blocs of nations. Roughly 100 countries, including the EU, advocated for binding limits on plastic production, while a group of oil-producing states and major manufacturers, including Russia and Saudi Arabia, insisted on focusing only on waste management and recycling. This failure marks a significant setback for environmental diplomacy, leaving the path forward for tackling the escalating plastic crisis uncertain.</p>

          <p>A Labour councillor from Dartford, Ricky Jones, has been found not guilty of encouraging violent disorder after he made inflammatory comments at an anti-racism rally. During the protest in Walthamstow last year, Jones was filmed calling far-right demonstrators "disgusting Nazi fascists" and suggesting their throats should be cut, while also making a cutting gesture. Jones, who was suspended by the Labour Party following the incident, told police his remarks were ill-advised but not intended to incite violence. A jury at Snaresbrook Crown Court deliberated for just over 30 minutes before reaching the not guilty verdict.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has formally requested that Prime Minister Keir Starmer appoint members of his party as peers to the House of Lords. In a letter, Farage argued that the current composition of the upper chamber is a "democratic disparity," noting that parties with fewer votes and MPs have representation while Reform UK does not. He highlighted that his party received over 4.1 million votes in the last general election and has since gained significant ground in local elections. Downing Street responded that appointments follow established conventions, and while parties can make nominations, the final decision rests with the prime minister.</p>

          <p>A senior defense lawyer in Australia has apologized to a Supreme Court judge after submitting court documents in a murder trial that contained fabricated quotes and citations for non-existent legal cases. The lawyer admitted that the erroneous information was generated by an artificial intelligence tool and took full responsibility for the blunder, which caused a 24-hour delay in the proceedings. The judge called the situation "unsatisfactory," emphasizing that the court's ability to rely on the accuracy of submissions is fundamental to the justice system.

          <p>Despite their crucial contributions during the 1998/99 Kosovo war, many of the country's 3,600 registered women veterans feel their service is largely unrecognized by the public and government institutions. While they receive official benefits, they report being overlooked in public ceremonies and media coverage compared to their male counterparts. Veterans describe facing institutional neglect and social stigma rooted in Kosovo's patriarchal mentality, which has hindered their post-war lives and economic stability. This lack of recognition has compounded the psychological scars of the conflict, leaving many feeling forgotten and marginalized by the society they fought to protect.</p>

          <p>A recent U.S. Census Bureau paper reveals a significant decline in the share of young adults aged 25 to 34 achieving key life milestones compared to previous generations. Fewer individuals in this age group are getting married, having children, working full-time, or living independently from their parents. Economic factors are a primary driver of this trend, with rising student loan debt and a severe housing affordability crisis making financial stability more difficult to attain. As a result, many millennials and Gen Zers are delaying family formation and homeownership, prioritizing career focus until they feel more economically secure.</p>

          <p>A potential mid-decade redistricting war between Republicans in Texas and Democrats in California is highlighting concerns about the erosion of democratic norms. After Texas Republicans proposed a new map to gain five U.S. House seats, California's governor announced a retaliatory plan to redraw his state's map to add five Democratic seats. This "fighting fire with fire" approach, while politically strategic, could lead to less competitive elections and increase voter cynicism by making partisan map-drawing, rather than voting, the primary determinant of political power. Experts warn that such actions undermine the principle that elections should reflect the will of the people.</p>

This surge in investment in assets like direct lending, private credit, and infrastructure surpasses that of other institutional investors like endowments and wealth management firms. The trend is driven by the growing wealth managed by these offices and their long-term investment horizons, which make them well-suited for illiquid private assets that are less volatile than public markets.

          <p>The Trump administration has approved a deal allowing Nvidia and AMD to export certain advanced AI chips, such as the H20, to China, but with a new 15% tax on the proceeds. This decision reverses a previous block on the H20 chip and has reportedly led some administration officials to consider resigning in protest. Critics argue the move undermines U.S. efforts to maintain a technological edge over China in artificial intelligence and that the export tax itself is unconstitutional. The debate centers on whether providing these powerful, albeit restricted, chips will help Chinese firms catch up to their U.S. counterparts.</p>
