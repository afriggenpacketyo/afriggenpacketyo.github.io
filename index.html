          <p>A grand jury investigation into the Hanceville Police Department in northern Alabama has uncovered a "rampant culture of corruption," leading to the dismissal of 58 felony cases. The investigation revealed mishandling and removal of evidence by four officers and the police chief, prompting a recommendation to abolish the department. An audit showed significant issues with evidence documentation and missing items, including firearms and drugs. Hanceville's mayor has placed the entire department on leave and announced plans to rebuild it from scratch in response to the scandal, which has deeply impacted the small town.</p>

          <p>President Trump has terminated the Librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden, effective immediately, according to an email from the White House. Hayden, who has held the position since 2016, was the first woman and African American to serve as Librarian of Congress. The decision has been met with strong criticism from Democratic leaders, who view it as part of an effort to undermine American history and suppress books. Prior to her role as Librarian of Congress, Hayden served as CEO of the Enoch Pratt Free Library in Baltimore, Maryland, for over two decades.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police have apprehended Erick Escamilla, the suspect in the murder of Menashe Hidra, who was found dead in his Valley Village apartment. Escamilla was allegedly seen stalking the halls of the apartment building on Ring doorbell cameras before breaking into Hidra's unit. The arrest follows a manhunt after neighbors reported hearing a struggle days before the body was discovered. The LAPD has launched an internal investigation into the initial response to the 911 call, as officers did not enter the apartment at the time of the reported disturbance.</p>

          <p>According to a mines developer, industries in developed nations, including the defense sector, are recognizing the necessity to diversify their sources of raw materials after China imposed export restrictions on tungsten. Beijing added tungsten to its export restriction list in February, leading to panic in the industry that has relied on Chinese materials for three decades. The US defense contractors face an additional challenge as they must cease using Chinese tungsten by January 1, 2027. Tungsten is crucial for producing cutting tools, ammunition, and clean energy components.</p>

          <p>China's recent attempts to stimulate economic growth through broad stimulus measures have not resonated with the stock market, as worries about economic decline overshadow policy optimism. Investors are primarily focused on trade negotiations with the U.S. and the potential negative impacts of the ongoing trade war. The stimulus package includes interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, but analysts believe these measures are insufficient to trigger a meaningful market rally. Investors are awaiting more targeted fiscal policies that directly boost consumer sentiment and support the real estate sector.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a new trade agreement with the UK, but its benefits to America appear limited, with most of the sweeping taxes on imports from the UK remaining intact. The agreement mainly involves the US rolling back some import taxes on strategic sectors like cars and steel in exchange for unspecified changes that expand opportunities for American beef, ethanol, and other agricultural products in the UK. Analysts suggest the deal is more of a symbolic political victory for Trump than a substantive economic achievement. American carmakers have expressed concern that the plans could make UK-made cars less expensive to import.</p>

          <p>Chinese academics are proposing a revision of World War II history, suggesting that the start date be moved back to 1931, with Japan's invasion of Manchuria, rather than Germany's invasion of Poland in 1939. This perspective aims to highlight China's role in the war against fascism, which they argue has been diminished by the "Western-centric" view. The proposal comes as countries commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. President Xi Jinping will attend a Victory Day parade in Moscow to mark the surrender of Nazi Germany.</p>

          <p>A federal lawsuit accuses UCLA's medical school of using race as a factor in admissions, violating state law and Supreme Court rulings against affirmative action. The lawsuit, brought by Do No Harm and Students for Fair Admissions, alleges that UCLA officials, including associate dean Jennifer Lucero, intentionally discriminate based on race. It claims that Black applicants with below-average scores are routinely admitted, while white and Asian applicants face higher standards. The lawsuit follows scrutiny by the Trump administration over potential "illegal DEI" in admissions practices at UC campuses.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain aimed at increasing market access for American farm exports. In return, the U.S. will allow Britain to export 100,000 cars annually with a 10% tariff and remove additional tariffs on steel and aluminum. The agreement maintains a 10% baseline tariff on most goods but is seen as setting the tone for reciprocal trade with other partners. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the deal as boosting trade and protecting jobs, while U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick projected a $5 billion opportunity for new exports by American farmers.</p>
