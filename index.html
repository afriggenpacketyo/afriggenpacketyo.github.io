          <p>Unrest and protests unfolded at the Delaney Hall immigration detention center in Newark, New Jersey, as detainees reportedly pushed down a dormitory wall due to complaints about conditions, including food quality. Protesters gathered outside the facility, leading to clashes with law enforcement and ICE agents. There were unconfirmed reports of missing inmates, gas, pepper spray, and a possible fire inside the center. The facility, run by GEO Group under a $60 million contract with the Trump administration, has faced prior controversy over work permits, safety risks, and the arrest of a Democratic representative during an oversight visit, highlighting ongoing tensions surrounding immigration detention practices and oversight. The incident underscores the contentious environment surrounding immigration enforcement and detention policies, particularly under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's request to overturn the $5 million damages awarded to E Jean Carroll for defamation has been denied by a US appeals court in New York City. The court upheld the jury's finding that Trump sexually abused Carroll in the 1990s and defamed her in 2022 by denying the allegations and stating that Carroll was "not his type." Trump argued that the trial judge should not have allowed jurors to review the Access Hollywood video or consider alleged mistreatment of other women. Carroll's attorney stated that Trump remains liable for sexual assault and defamation despite his continued legal maneuvers.</p>

          <p>The article is a satirical reflection on the author's return from parental leave and the state of the nation under Donald Trump's second term as president. The author expresses disbelief at the rapid changes and actions taken by the administration, including the deployment of the National Guard, the closing of FEMA, and the shipment of individuals to a Gulag in El Salvador. The author juxtaposes the helplessness of her five-month-old child with the swiftness with which the government has enacted controversial policies. The piece serves as a commentary on the perceived erosion of democratic norms and the acceleration of divisive policies under the current administration.</p>

          <p>The WNBA and E.W. Scripps have announced a new multi-year media rights agreement to broadcast Friday night WNBA games on Ion, including a weekly studio show dedicated to WNBA coverage. While the financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, reports estimate the original deal's value at $13 million annually, with Ion broadcasting 50 regular-season games this season. The partnership has seen significant growth in viewership, attributed to the league's rising popularity and the emergence of stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. This agreement follows an 11-year media rights deal the WNBA signed with Disney, Amazon, and Comcast-owned NBCUniversal, valued at approximately $200 million per year, reflecting the increasing value and demand for WNBA content.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty to human smuggling charges in Tennessee, following his return from detention in El Salvador. Federal prosecutors accuse him of conspiring to transport undocumented migrants, including children, within the U.S. for thousands of dollars. The case has been marked by legal battles, including Abrego Garcia's prior deportation to El Salvador despite a court order barring it, based on claims of MS-13 gang affiliation, which he denies. Prosecutors argue Abrego Garcia is a flight risk and poses a threat to witnesses, while his attorneys contend the charges lack merit and that he has no history of evading arrest.</p>

          <p>Germany is facing a complex foreign policy challenge as it attempts to balance its historical responsibility to Israel with international law and diplomacy following recent Israeli attacks on Iran. While Germany considers Israel's security a "reason of state," the severity of the humanitarian situation in Gaza has led to increasing criticism of Israeli actions within the German government. Despite concerns, Germany continues to support Israel, citing Iran's nuclear program as a serious threat.

          <p>Consumer sentiment in June improved more than expected, driven by optimism following President Donald Trump's rollback of some tariffs. This resurgence ended six consecutive months of worsening attitudes, with year-ahead inflation expectations dropping from 6.6% to 5.1%. The improvement was reflected across all demographics, and comes after the easing of tariffs led to a trade agreement between the U.S. and China, as well as the pausing of "Liberation Day" tariffs. While warning signs of potential future price increases remain, the current economic data suggests a positive shift in consumer confidence, although the long-term impact of trade policies remains uncertain.</p>

Despite the positive shift, sentiment indexes remain below year-ago levels, reflecting ongoing worries about the potential impact of tariffs and other geopolitical concerns.

Prosecutors allege Read struck John O'Keefe with her car and left him to die in a blizzard, while the defense argues O'Keefe was attacked and left outside. The first trial ended in a mistrial, and Read has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Key points include the absence of the lead investigator from the first trial, motions for a mistrial being denied, and Read not taking the stand in her own defense.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) have found that most Americans are losing spending power and cannot afford a "minimal quality of life." Their analysis, based on a "Minimal Quality of Life Index," considers not only essentials but also the costs of a fulfilling life with upward mobility. The bottom 60% of households fall short of this threshold due to wages failing to keep pace with rising costs, such as medical premiums, travel expenses, and rent. This financial strain may lead to debt or the inability to save for important goals like college or retirement, highlighting the challenges many Americans face in achieving financial stability.</p>
