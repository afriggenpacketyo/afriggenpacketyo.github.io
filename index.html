          <p>A Russian drone strike in the southern Ukrainian port city of Odesa resulted in the deaths of a married couple and injured at least 17 people, including three children. The attack caused significant damage to a residential tower, trapping some residents inside. While Moscow has not commented, Russia's Defense Ministry claimed to have shot down over 40 Ukrainian drones in other areas. The ongoing war, now in its fourth year, has seen both sides increasingly use sophisticated long-range drones, with the UN reporting that such attacks have caused thousands of civilian casualties since the conflict began.</p>

          <p>Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York's mayoral primary has exposed a significant rift within the Democratic party. Moderate Democrats and business leaders are strategizing to oppose him in the general election, with some considering backing an independent spoiler candidate. Conversely, progressive figures like former Mayor Bill de Blasio argue that Mamdani's large victory margin demonstrates his mainstream appeal. Mamdani is actively engaging with all factions, including concerned CEOs, while prominent national Democrats like Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries have shown openness to his candidacy, reflecting the complex and evolving political landscape in the city.</p>

          <p>Across the world, communities have been celebrating Pride Month throughout June with vibrant parades, festivals, and demonstrations. These events commemorate the ongoing struggle for LGBTQ rights and inclusion, tracing their origins back to the 1969 Stonewall Uprising in New York City. That historic clash between police and patrons of the Stonewall Inn is now widely considered the catalyst for the modern LGBTQ rights movement. From Kathmandu to Washington D.C., participants have gathered to honor this legacy. The month of events symbolizes both a celebration of identity and a continued protest for equal rights and recognition for the community.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate is scheduled to hold a crucial procedural vote on President Trump's major tax and spending package, though its passage remains uncertain due to internal Republican disagreements.

Several controversial provisions have already been flagged by the Senate parliamentarian for violating budget rules, forcing revisions. Lingering disputes among Republicans over the state and local tax deduction, Medicaid cuts, and a debt ceiling increase threaten to derail the legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has declared that fixing the nation's "broken" benefits system is a moral imperative, following a significant U-turn on welfare cuts forced by a rebellion within his own party. Speaking at a Labour conference, Starmer assured that the welfare safety net would remain for the vulnerable but emphasized that it should not trap those who are able to work. The government reversed plans for stricter disability payment criteria for existing claimants after facing likely defeat in Parliament. However, divisions remain, with some Labour MPs and the Unite union demanding the entire proposal be scrapped over concerns about a two-tier system.</p>

          <p>College presidents are advocating for the Senate to protect the Pell Grant program from significant cuts proposed in the House version of President Trump's major spending bill. The House plan aims to address a $2.7 billion program shortfall by tightening eligibility, which could remove nearly 10% of recipients and reduce aid for most others. University leaders argue these changes would be an "existential threat," forcing more students to take out loans or forgo higher education entirely. The Senate has proposed a less restrictive alternative, and educators are hopeful the upper chamber's version will prevail to protect access for low- and middle-income students.

Advocates call the timing catastrophic, as Afghanistan faces widespread food shortages and curtailed international aid following the Taliban's seizure of power.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the media's wall-to-wall coverage of military conflicts, such as the recent U.S. strikes on Iran, allows political leaders to dominate the news cycle and distract from other vital domestic issues. The author notes that important stories, like a recent shooting of Minnesota lawmakers, quickly fade from public attention when pitted against a global conflict. While acknowledging the need to cover the president's actions, the piece suggests that the media's tendency to fixate on war benefits politicians seeking to control the narrative. This dynamic ultimately sidelines crucial topics like gun violence, voting rights, and the rule of law.</p>

The measure aims to protect endangered eel populations by increasing oversight and control over the global market, but it creates a point of contention with nations reliant on the trade.</p>

          <p>Japanese and U.S. negotiators have agreed to continue discussions over tariffs as a July deadline approaches, though significant differences reportedly persist. The talks in Washington involved Japan's top negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. Key points of contention include the American treatment of Japan's automotive industry. Despite the disagreements, both sides described the discussions on trade expansion and economic security as fruitful. The negotiations are part of a broader effort to secure a mutually beneficial trade agreement between the two allied nations, with pressure mounting as the deadline nears. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investigation by the nonprofit Earthsight has implicated major designer brands, including Coach, Fendi, and Hugo Boss, in supply chains linked to illegal deforestation in Brazil's Amazon. The report traces leather from cattle raised on illegally deforested land, some within an Indigenous territory, through Brazilian meatpackers and tanneries to prestigious Italian leather suppliers. This practice of "cattle laundering" obscures the origins of the raw materials. Most of the accused luxury brands have denied the allegations or stated that their leather from the named suppliers does not originate in Brazil, highlighting significant gaps in supply chain transparency and certification systems.</p>

          <p>In the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles, Trader Joe's has opened a new grocery store, creating the unusual situation of having two of its locations operating directly across the street from one another. The original plan was to close the older, smaller store, which has been a neighborhood staple since 1973. However, due to tremendous business in the area, the company decided to keep both open. The new store is 40% larger and features more aisles and a spacious underground parking garage, a major improvement over the notoriously cramped lot of its predecessor, attracting both new and loyal customers.</p>

          <p>State and local health departments across the United States are facing a crisis as grant funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is months overdue without explanation. This delay has forced some departments to halt essential services, such as HIV testing and contact tracing, and even lay off staff. According to CDC insiders, the agency has not received its full fiscal year funding and is operating on a precarious month-to-month basis, preventing the distribution of critical grants.

          <p>During the first round of the LIV Golf tournament in Dallas, five-time major champion Brooks Koepka withdrew from the event due to illness after a moment of frustration on the course.

At the time of his withdrawal, Koepka was six over par. LIV Golf officials stated that he had been feeling unwell throughout the week, leading to his decision to pull out.</p>

          <p>In a historic policy shift driven by a new Trump presidency and war in Europe, Germany is planning a massive military expansion to become the continent's strongest armed force. Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced plans to spend 3.5% of GDP on defense, a significant increase from previous levels, funded by a special fund and a temporary suspension of the country's balanced budget rule. This move marks a profound change for a nation that has long maintained a restrained military posture.

This defiance has angered many of Trump's diehard supporters in the state, who feel unrepresented by their own lawmakers.

          <p>A review of Jake Brasch's play "The Reservoir," now at the Geffen Playhouse, finds that the production relies on sitcom-level humor and familiar tropes of family dysfunction, which ultimately undermines its more serious themes. The story follows Josh, a theater student in recovery from alcoholism, who attempts to save his four eccentric grandparents as a way of saving himself. While the performances are energetic, particularly from the actors playing the grandparents, the reviewer argues that the writing often falls into predictable punch-line rhythms and shtick. The play's artificiality and pandering for easy laughs prevent it from delving deeply into its potentially harrowing subject matter.</p>

The case exposed the extent of the FBI's COINTELPRO program aimed at crushing perceived subversive groups.

          <p>Carrie Johnson, wife of former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, was hospitalized for two nights due to severe dehydration and has issued a public warning to other mothers.

Johnson, who recently gave birth to her fourth child, thanked the NHS for their care during what she described as a "brutal" week.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 05:35:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On a recent program, financial commentator Jim Cramer advised investors to steer clear of the payments and data company Deluxe Corporation (DLX). Cramer pointed to the stock's high 8% dividend yield as a major red flag, suggesting that such a high yield often indicates that "something's very wrong" with the underlying company. He noted that while the company has been discussing diversification for a long time, its performance has not been convincing. Cramer expressed his disapproval, effectively recommending against investing in the company that was once a significant growth stock in the 1980s. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a party event, former German chancellor Olaf Scholz delivered a stark warning about Russian President Vladimir Putin's ambitions, stating there should be no illusions about his plans. Scholz asserted that the Kremlin leader intends to hold onto his conquered territories in Ukraine and potentially seize more, emphasizing that Putin must not succeed in shifting borders by force. He defended the actions taken during his term, including strengthening the German military (Bundeswehr) and increasing cooperation within NATO. Scholz also called for high earners to contribute more to national defense rather than seeking tax cuts, stressing a need for new solidarity.</p>

Their departure follows the expiration of a lease agreement, and the two remaining pandas at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo are scheduled to return by next February. The Wakayama zoo, which has had a successful joint breeding program with China since 1994, held a farewell ceremony attended by thousands of visitors sad to see them go.</p>

          <p>A suicide bomber in Pakistan's North Waziristan district has killed at least 16 soldiers and injured 29 other people, including civilians. The attacker reportedly rammed a vehicle laden with explosives into a military convoy in the northwestern region bordering Afghanistan. The blast was powerful enough to cause the roofs of two nearby houses to collapse, injuring six children. A militant group affiliated with the Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for the deadly attack. Violence in the border regions has seen a significant increase since the Taliban regained power in Afghanistan in 2021, posing an ongoing security challenge for Pakistan.</p>
