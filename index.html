The agreement, aimed at resolving national security concerns while allowing the app to continue operating, was reportedly set during trade talks in Madrid. The deal is still subject to final approval from President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who are scheduled to speak to complete the arrangement.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that publicly traded companies should move from reporting earnings every quarter to every six months. In a social media post, he argued the change would save money and encourage corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. The proposal, which would require SEC approval, revives a debate over whether the current reporting frequency creates an unhealthy pressure on companies to the detriment of sustainable growth.</p>

          <p>The Senate is voting on the nomination of Stephen Miran, a top economic adviser to President Trump, to the Federal Reserve Board. The nomination is controversial due to Miran's past writings that advocate for reducing the Fed's independence from the White House. Critics are also alarmed by his plan to take an unpaid leave from his political role rather than resigning, which they fear could politicize the nation's central bank.</p>

          <p>A commentary in The Guardian argues that the reaction to Charlie Kirk's assassination reveals a severe deterioration of American democracy. The author contends that instead of fostering national mourning and unity, as seen after past political assassinations, President Trump and his allies have weaponized the event to sow fear and division. The piece suggests this response further undermines free speech and deepens the country's dangerous political polarization.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that he would "never" have appointed Lord Peter Mandelson as the UK's ambassador to the U.S. if he had been aware of the full extent of his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The admission comes after Starmer fired Mandelson last week following the publication of emails showing the peer sent supportive messages to Epstein after his 2008 conviction.

          <p>A recent survey reveals that Americans' emergency funds have decreased over the past year, with the median amount saved for unexpected expenses falling from $600 to $500. This trend, observed even among higher-income earners, points to increased financial precarity for many households amid rising prices and inflation. The findings are concerning as financial advisors typically recommend having three to six months' worth of essential living expenses saved for a rainy day.</p>
