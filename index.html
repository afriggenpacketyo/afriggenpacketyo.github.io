          <p>President Trump's proposed spending bill, which aims to extend tax cuts and increase spending on immigration enforcement and defense, faces opposition within the Republican party.

The bill's tax cuts disproportionately benefit the wealthy, while millions could lose health insurance due to the expiration of ACA tax credits and new Medicaid work requirements.

          <p>Some law clerks working for federal judges describe a toxic work culture characterized by long hours, pressure to socialize, and fear of retribution. Clerks report instances of bullying, sexual harassment, and discrimination, with little recourse due to the judiciary's exemption from Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The power imbalance between judges and clerks creates a culture where clerks are expected to surrender control over their lives. The federal judiciary acknowledges efforts to improve workplace conduct, but skepticism remains about the effectiveness of internal processes.</p>

          <p>China appears to have offered a reprieve to US and European auto giants amid concerns about a rare earth shortage. China's Ministry of Commerce is willing to establish a "green channel" for export license applications to expedite the approval process for EU firms. Beijing has also granted rare earth licenses to suppliers of US auto giants General Motors, Ford, and Jeep-maker Stellantis. These moves follow industry warnings about increasing production threats and the implementation of export restrictions on rare earth elements and magnets.</p>

The proclamation bans entry for nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. Stricter visa checks and restrictions will apply to people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.</p>

          <h2>China's Consumer Prices Slump Again, Deepening Deflation Worries</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 03:19:46 EDT</div>

          <p>China's consumer prices have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in May, signaling weak domestic demand and deepening deflation concerns. The consumer price index fell 0.1% from a year earlier, while deflation in factory-gate prices deepened. Price wars in the automotive sector and falling property prices are contributing to the downward pressure. Chinese policymakers are urged to implement more forceful stimulus measures to boost consumption, while economists are watching for potential monetary easing from Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>
