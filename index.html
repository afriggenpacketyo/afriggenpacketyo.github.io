          <p>Toyota has announced that the 2026 RAV4 SUV will be offered exclusively as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid model, eliminating the traditional gas engine for the first time, but will still have a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine. This decision reflects the increasing popularity and demand for hybrid vehicles, with electrified vehicles accounting for 43.1% of Toyota's U.S. sales in 2024. The redesigned RAV4 will include interior and exterior design changes, as well as upgrades to performance and technologies, and is set to go on sale later this year. Toyota's decision also comes amidst ongoing tariffs on vehicles imported into the U.S., posing challenges for the automaker.</p>

          <p>A new report by ICF forecasts a dramatic surge in electricity demand, potentially jumping by 78% by 2050, which could strain the reliability and affordability of electricity in the United States. This surge is attributed to rising temperatures, emerging technologies like cryptocurrency mining, data centers, building electrification, semiconductor manufacturing, and electric vehicles. The report also anticipates retail electricity costs could double by 2050, and PJM, a major electric grid operator, has warned of high peak demand this summer. Households are expected to pay an average of $784 for electricity during the summer period, marking a 12-year record.</p>

          <p>An undocumented immigrant in Florida is facing a $1.82 million fine for failing to leave the U.S. after a removal order was issued in 2005, with ICE charging her $500 for each day she remained in the country. The woman's attorney is appealing the fine, arguing that she was never advised of the consequences of failing to depart. The case highlights the enforcement of civil fines under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, which has historically been rarely enforced.

          <p>The UK has stepped up its actions against Israel over its offensive in Gaza, with Foreign Secretary David Lammy calling the military escalation "morally unjustifiable." The UK has suspended talks on a trade deal with Israel, summoned the country's ambassador, and imposed fresh sanctions on West Bank settlers. Lammy accused the Israeli government of "cruel and monstrous extremism" and warned of a "dark new phase in this conflict." The move follows warnings of starvation in Gaza after Israel launched a new military operation.</p>

The country also logged a 115.8 billion yen trade deficit in April. Chinese smartphone exports to the U.S. experienced a 70% drop in April due to the ongoing tariff dispute.

          <p>The NFL's 'Tush Push' play, where the Philadelphia Eagles have found success, is under debate, with proposals to ban it citing player safety and pace of play.

While this 90-day reprieve provides some relief, the complex nature of their economic interdependence suggests that a comprehensive agreement by the August deadline remains challenging. Despite the US scaling back some tariffs, the remaining levies still pose a significant hurdle to bilateral trade. The truce indicates that neither side is prepared to completely sever economic ties, offering a glimmer of hope for future resolutions.</p>

CEO Nikesh Arora noted that the company has reached an inflection point in customer adoption for its next-generation security suite, with annual recurring revenue reaching $5 billion.

These attacks, which began around Easter, have caused empty shelves, suspended online ordering, and the theft of millions of people's private data.
