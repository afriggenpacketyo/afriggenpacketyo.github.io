          <p>President Trump's meme coin contest, offering tickets to an exclusive crypto dinner gala, has raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest due to possible foreign involvement. The competition winners, the top 220 holders of the Trump meme coin, include wallets linked to foreign individuals and entities. The coin's value has fluctuated significantly, leading to profits for some and losses for many investors, as the Trump family stands to gain substantially from coin transactions. The top coin holder's wallet is reportedly owned by a foreign crypto exchange advised by a Chinese billionaire, adding further complexity to the situation. Optimism is tempered by the potential for undue foreign influence and financial risks for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the IRS can share immigrants' tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to identify and deport individuals illegally in the U.S. The lawsuit, filed by nonprofit groups, argued that undocumented immigrants paying taxes deserve the same privacy as citizens. The judge stated that the agreement doesn't violate the Internal Revenue Code, allowing the Trump administration to use existing tools for criminal investigations. This decision follows the resignation of a former acting IRS commissioner over the agreement, raising concerns about privacy rights and the use of taxpayer data.</p>
