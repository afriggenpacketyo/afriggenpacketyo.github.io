          <p>A private Japanese lunar lander, Resilience, is approaching its landing on the moon after launching four and a half months ago. The lander carries cameras, scientific instruments, and a tiny rover named Tenacious, intending to explore the lunar surface and deploy a customer payload, a small model of a Swedish house. This mission follows a previous failed attempt by the company in 2023, highlighting the difficulties of low-cost lunar transportation. The Resilience lander aims to be the first private entity to successfully land and complete its mission on the moon, setting the stage for future non-governmental lunar services, following in the footsteps of Firefly Aerospace, which successfully landed its Blue Ghost spacecraft in March. The success of this mission could pave the way for more commercial lunar endeavors. The mission seeks to deploy technology and explore the lunar surface. The optimism score for this article is relatively high, given the anticipation and the technological advancement it represents.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Elon Musk are publicly feuding over Trump's domestic megabill, with Trump expressing "disappointment" in Musk's criticisms. Musk responded on X, claiming he helped Trump win the election and accusing him of "ingratitude." The bill, which passed the House, aims to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts and increase spending for military and border security, while cutting Medicaid and SNAP. Musk argues the bill would increase the deficit, undermining the Department of Government Efficiency's goals, while Trump contends Musk is upset about the removal of electric vehicle tax credits.

He argues that Chinese infiltration of U.S. institutions has been ongoing, with Chinese nationals being placed in technical areas and high-tech companies through programs like the H1-B visa. The expert suggests the Trump administration should reduce visa numbers for Chinese nationals and send them home, asserting they often return to China and use their skills to undermine U.S. technology companies.</p>

          <p>President Trump and his allies have been promoting his budget bill with claims that contradict expert analysis, particularly concerning its impact on the national debt and tax relief. Republicans assert the bill will reduce the deficit by $1.6 trillion, but non-partisan analysts estimate it will increase the deficit by $2.4 trillion due to expensive provisions outweighing cost-saving policies. Trump claims taxes will rise by 68% if the bill doesn't pass, but analyses suggest the average household's after-tax income would fall by about 2.1%, reflecting a 7.5% tax increase. Despite claims of no Medicaid cuts, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would cut over $600 billion from Medicaid, primarily through new work requirements. (not investment advice)</p>

Mexico had argued that the "flood" of illegal guns across the border resulted from "deliberate" practices by US firms appealing to cartel members. The court stated that Mexico's complaint did not plausibly allege that the manufacturers aided and abetted gun dealers' unlawful sales of firearms to Mexican traffickers.</p>

          <p>Clara Adams, a high school sprinter, was stripped of her state title after celebrating her victory with a fire extinguisher, which officials deemed unsportsmanlike. Adams sprayed her cleats with the extinguisher after winning the 400-meter finals, a gesture she said was inspired by former U.S. sprinter Maurice Greene. However, CIF officials disqualified her, leading to controversy and debate over the appropriateness of the celebration. Adams and her father dispute the ruling, claiming it was a harmless expression of joy.</p>

          <p>Paramount Global's efforts to settle a lawsuit with President Trump are attracting significant political scrutiny, potentially impacting the company's planned sale to Skydance Media. Three U.S. senators have warned that paying Trump to drop his $20-billion lawsuit could be considered a bribe, while California Democrats are proposing a state Senate hearing to investigate the matter. The lawsuit alleges that CBS edited a "60 Minutes" interview to favor Kamala Harris, and settling it is seen as crucial for regulators to approve Paramount's sale.
