          <p>A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded during preparations for an engine test firing at the company's Starbase facility in Texas, resulting in the destruction of the rocket and a potential setback for the Super Heavy-Starship program. The explosion occurred just before the anticipated engine test firing, sending debris across the test site and causing significant damage to infrastructure. SpaceX confirmed the incident, stating that a safety clear area was maintained and all personnel are safe, with investigations underway to assess the impact on the test site. NASA is relying on the Starship for its Human Landing System, making the resolution of this incident crucial for future lunar missions.</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents discovered and disabled a nearly 3,000-foot-long narcotics smuggling tunnel connecting Tijuana and San Diego. The tunnel, found in early April while under construction, ran under part of the Otay Mesa Port of Entry and had a projected exit point near a commercial warehouse in San Diego. The underground passageway was equipped with lighting, electrical wiring, ventilation systems, and a track system for transporting large amounts of contraband. Authorities found the tunnel entrance inside a house in Tijuana, which had been recently covered up with freshly laid tile, and plan to fill the tunnel with concrete to prevent future use. The disruption of narcotics smuggling tunnels is critical to protecting American lives.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a portable neutron gun powered by a hydrogen-lithium nuclear reaction, marking a significant advancement in neutron generation technology. The device uses an electromagnetic technique to achieve controlled nuclear reactions, producing a beam of fast neutrons with high energy levels. This innovation has potential applications in scientific, industrial, and defense sectors, offering a compact alternative to traditional, large-scale accelerators. Neutrons, being electrically neutral, can penetrate materials easily, making this technology useful as an 'atomic flashlight' for various purposes.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick has intensified into an 'extremely dangerous' Category 4 hurricane as it heads towards Mexico's Pacific coast, prompting warnings of devastating wind damage and life-threatening floods. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has urged residents in the storm's path to stay indoors and heed official communications. A hurricane warning is in effect for a 500km stretch of the Pacific coast, from Acapulco to Puerto √Ångel, with around 2,000 shelters set up across the states of Chiapas, Guerrero, and Oaxaca. This is expected to be the first hurricane to make landfall in Mexico this season, which runs from June to November, raising concerns after the devastating impact of Hurricane Otis in 2023. The potential for mudslides in mountainous areas has also been emphasized to residents.</p>

          <p>An Israeli hospital sustained a direct hit from an Iranian missile, causing extensive damage and injuries, while separate Iranian strikes targeted Tel Aviv. The attacks occurred as President Trump considered direct U.S. involvement in Israel's efforts to dismantle Iran's nuclear program. In retaliation, Israel attacked Iran's Arak heavy water reactor, prompting warnings from Israeli officials for the public to flee the area. The ongoing conflict has resulted in numerous casualties on both sides, with international concerns rising over the escalating tensions and potential for further escalation.</p>

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp.'s top executive Eiji Hashimoto expressed confidence that the U.S. government's oversight role in its $14.1 billion acquisition of U.S. Steel will not hinder the U.S. unit's business operations. Hashimoto highlighted the $11 billion investment in U.S. Steel and the golden share issued to the U.S. government as rational conditions that ensure profitability and mutual satisfaction. The acquisition positions Nippon Steel as the world's fourth-largest steelmaker and allows it to expand its global capacity to 86 million tons, approaching its goal of 100 million tons. Nippon Steel aims to capitalize on the growing U.S. demand for high-grade steel, particularly in the electric vehicle sector, while adhering to the national security agreement to maintain U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh.

Discovered in 2021, the frescoes depict musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, providing insights into the affluence of the area, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London." The art suggests the presence of skilled painters who traveled the Roman empire, taking on large commissions during a building boom in the city.

Fresh funding will be reconsidered once the Cook Islands takes steps to repair the relationship and restore trust, according to New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters.

          <p>An opinion piece discusses the complexities and potential pitfalls of regime change in Iran, cautioning against the assumption that it would automatically lead to positive outcomes. While acknowledging the repressive nature of the Iranian regime and its destabilizing actions in the region, the author draws on historical examples, such as Afghanistan and Iraq, to illustrate the enduring troubles and miseries that often follow regime change. The piece argues that even if Israel were to significantly damage Iran's infrastructure, the absence of a viable, unified opposition and the potential for civic instability pose significant challenges. The author suggests that a weakened but still revolutionary Iran is a likely outcome, emphasizing the need for caution.</p>

He argued that the U.S. goods deficit will persist as long as export controls, visa denials, and barriers to Chinese firms remain in place.
