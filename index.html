The temperature inside the vehicle was measured at more than 130 degrees, and the child was transported to a local hospital in stable condition; Qiu is being held without bail, and police emphasized the dangers of leaving children or pets in parked cars during rising temperatures.</p>

Despite the challenges, Pugh, a United Nations Patron of the Oceans, hopes his swim will highlight the need for shark conservation, given that around 274,000 sharks are killed globally each day.</p>

          <p>President Trump is considering redirecting $3 billion in grant money from Harvard University to trade schools across the country, citing concerns about antisemitism at Harvard. This proposal follows previous actions by the administration to freeze or withdraw funding from Harvard and its research partners, and also requests for information on foreign student lists. The move is part of an ongoing battle between the White House and Harvard, with the administration claiming the university tolerates antisemitism and promotes liberal ideology, though trade schools typically do not engage in the type of scientific research that the affected Harvard programs conduct.</p>

The article argues that this is an American problem, where violence aimed at Jews or those seen as aligned with them is dismissed, excused, or rationalized, undermining civic norms and necessitating a firm stance against political violence.</p>

Despite Germany's commitment to Israel's security, its ongoing weapons supply is becoming a contentious issue within the European Union, and the most effective embargo would require the involvement of Israel's primary armorers.</p>

          <p>The wife of musician Billy Joel, Alexis Roderick Joel, has expressed gratitude to fans and loved ones for their support following Joel's recent diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus, a brain condition affecting his hearing, vision, and balance. Joel, 76, has canceled concert dates through July 2026 to undergo physical therapy and focus on his recovery. Normal pressure hydrocephalus is typically treated with a shunt to drain fluid from the brain, and the family is hopeful for his return to the stage in the future.</p>

          <p>England secured a 17-run victory against the West Indies in the third and final T20, completing a dominant series clean sweep, despite Hayley Matthews' exceptional performance. Matthews played a lone hand in West Indies' pursuit of 145, scoring 71 runs from 54 balls, but a rain delay disrupted the chase, leading to a collapse from 109-3 to 127-8. Lauren Bell claimed the game-changing wicket of Matthews, while Heather Knight's unbeaten 66 from 47 balls ensured England had enough runs on the board, though Knight sustained a hamstring problem during her knock.</p>

          <p>George Lucas, creator of the “Star Wars” franchise, has reassumed control of his Museum of Narrative Art in Los Angeles, appointing himself head of “content direction” and naming Jim Gianopulos as interim chief executive.

The museum, slated to be completed next year, aims to explore how narrative art influences societies, but questions remain about its mission, with some cultural leaders saying that art that tells stories is ubiquitous.</p>
