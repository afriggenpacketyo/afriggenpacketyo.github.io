            <p>Despite facing internal economic difficulties such as a real estate crisis and youth unemployment, China is resisting pressure from the Trump administration regarding tariffs. Chinese leaders view the Trump administration as a bully and assert their capacity to withstand the trade war, emphasizing that exports to the U.S. only constitute a small portion of China's GDP. The government has assured its citizens of its strong position to resist U.S. attacks, understanding that its own tariffs will also impact American exporters, ultimately refusing to surrender.</p>

Democrats contend that the Republican budget favors the wealthy at the expense of working families. The campaign highlights the political battle lines drawn ahead of the upcoming midterm elections, with both parties positioning themselves on economic issues.</p>

            <p>China has responded to U.S. President Trump's tariffs by increasing its levies on U.S. goods to 125%, stating that there is no longer a market for American products at current tariff levels. Despite this escalation, China's Commerce Ministry reiterated its willingness to negotiate with the U.S. on equal terms. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent criticized China for its imbalanced economy and said the tariff escalation would ultimately hurt them.

            <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported an unexpected decrease in wholesale prices for March, with the producer price index falling 0.4%. This decline sets a potentially favorable backdrop for inflation as President Trump escalates tariffs against U.S. trading partners. Core PPI, excluding food and energy, also decreased by 0.1%. This unexpected dip in wholesale prices offers a contrasting perspective amid concerns about rising inflation due to the ongoing trade war.</p>

            <p>This opinion piece criticizes President Trump's tariff policies as chaotic, ignorant, and harmful to the global economy. The author argues that Trump's actions, driven by vengeance and a misunderstanding of trade, have caused significant damage to stock markets and international relations. While Trump temporarily suspended some tariffs, his continued imposition of high tariffs on China is expected to increase consumer prices. The author also questions the competence of Trump's advisors and their failure to challenge his economic policies.</p>

            <p>China has clarified the 'place of origin' for integrated circuits (ICs), a move expected to benefit local semiconductor foundries amid the escalating US-China trade war. The rule states that the location of wafer fabrication determines the chip's origin, regardless of packaging or testing location. This change could encourage chip developers to process their products at local foundries, potentially undermining Trump's efforts to bring manufacturing back to America. This change could increase the cost of chips from fabs on American soil, which could persuade fabs to set up facilities outside the US.</p>
