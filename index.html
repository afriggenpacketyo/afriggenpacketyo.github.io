          <p>President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa aimed to reset relations with the United States during a White House visit, but the meeting took an unexpected turn when President Trump focused on claims of white genocide in South Africa. Trump presented footage of controversial chants and waved news clips about white South Africans, prompting Ramaphosa to defend his country's policies and highlight the presence of white individuals in his delegation. Despite the contentious exchange, Ramaphosa claimed the visit was a success, citing discussions on trade and Trump's potential attendance at the G20 summit in Johannesburg. This article examines the dynamics of the meeting and the broader implications for U.S.-South Africa relations.</p>

          <p>Experts are warning of potential tax increases in the UK after government borrowing exceeded expectations, reaching Â£20.2bn in April. This figure is the fourth highest since monthly records began in 1993, raising concerns about Chancellor Rachel Reeves' ability to meet spending and borrowing rules. Analysts suggest that weaker economic growth and increased spending pressures, such as the reinstatement of some winter fuel payments, contribute to the financial strain. The article highlights the dilemma faced by the chancellor in balancing spending needs with low economic growth and high interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>
