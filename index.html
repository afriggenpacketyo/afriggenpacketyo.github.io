          <p>Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, expressed concern over potentially losing access to China's rapidly growing AI market, which is projected to reach $50 billion in the next few years, stating it would be a 'tremendous loss' for the company. Huang emphasized that selling to China would boost revenue in the U.S., contributing to taxes and job creation. These remarks come as Nvidia navigates tightening U.S. export controls, which now include their China-tailored H20 AI chips used by major tech firms like Tencent and ByteDance. Nvidia seeks to maintain its presence in China, which accounted for approximately 14% of its revenue last financial year.</p>

          <p>For the second time in a week, a U.S. Navy F/A-18F Super Hornet went overboard from the USS Harry S. Truman, this time after an arrestment failure during landing in the Red Sea. Both pilots ejected safely and sustained minor injuries; no flight deck personnel were harmed. The warplane was lost into the sea and has not been recovered. This incident follows another F/A-18F Super Hornet loss where the aircraft went overboard while being towed in a hangar bay due to crew losing control. The Harry S.

          <p>Seagate, a data storage firm, is working towards developing a 100-terabyte hard drive by 2030, driven by significant demand from data centers fueled by the rise of artificial intelligence.

The company's largest hard disk drive currently is 36-terabyte. Seagate has increasingly positioned itself as an AI player, capitalizing on the demand created by foundational models developed by companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced sweeping policy measures, including interest rate cuts and reductions in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), in an effort to stimulate economic growth amid ongoing trade tensions. The People's Bank of China will lower the seven-day reverse repurchase rates and reduce the RRR by 50 basis points, injecting liquidity into the market. Additional measures include supporting financing for key sectors like technology and real estate, and establishing a relending tool for consumption and elderly care.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Novo Nordisk reported a higher-than-expected net profit for the first quarter but has lowered its full-year sales growth forecast due to lower-than-anticipated sales of its Wegovy weight loss drug. While the company's net profit exceeded expectations at 29.03 billion Danish kroner, Wegovy sales fell slightly short of analyst predictions, hitting 17.36 billion Danish kroner. Consequently, Novo Nordisk now projects sales growth of 13% to 21% for 2025, down from the previous forecast of 16% to 24%. This adjustment comes amidst increasing competition in the weight loss drug market and follows disappointing trial results for its next-generation obesity drug candidate, CagriSema.</p>

While the dollar's reserve-currency status does play a role in trade deficits, it is just one of many factors. Rogoff suggests that reducing the fiscal deficit would be a more straightforward fix than launching a trade war. He also highlights the strength of the American economy as a key factor attracting investors, even in manufacturing, which has grown as a share of GDP.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that Britain's housing benefit bill may need to double to prevent millions of workers from retiring in poverty. Scottish Widows found that almost a quarter of individuals saving into defined contribution pensions will still be renting or repaying their mortgage when they stop working. If they all need to claim housing benefit, the taxpayer will be forced to foot an extra £32.1bn a year. The report highlights the need to help more people get on the property ladder and ensure an adequate supply of social housing to mitigate rising benefit costs.</p>

          <p>Joe Biden told the BBC that pressure from the Trump administration on Ukraine to give up territory to Russia is 'modern-day appeasement'. Speaking in Delaware, he said Russian President Vladimir Putin believed Ukraine was part of Russia and 'anybody that thinks he's going to stop' if some territory is conceded as part of a peace deal 'is just foolish'. Biden expressed concern about US-Europe relations breaking down under President Donald Trump, which he said 'would change the modern history of the world'. Biden was challenged on whether he gave enough support to Kyiv to ensure they could win the war as opposed to just resist Russia's full-scale invasion.</p>

Pakistan's Information Minister accused India of violating his country's territorial sovereignty and attacking its civilian population.

          <p>Two weeks after a deadly militant attack on tourists in Indian-administered Kashmir, India launched strikes on sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which it says targeted 'terrorist infrastructure'. Pakistan has described the strikes as 'unprovoked', with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif saying the 'heinous act of aggression will not go unpunished'. Pakistan's military says it has shot down five Indian aircraft and a drone, while India has yet to respond to these claims. Pakistani authorities say the strikes have killed eight civilians so far, while India says three civilians were killed by Pakistani shelling in Indian-administered Kashmir.</p>

          <p>As Russia commemorates the 80th anniversary of victory in World War Two, the national narrative emphasizes Russia as both victor and victim. Historical reenactments and events serve to reinforce this idea, while television programming draws parallels between WWII and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The Kremlin portrays the war in Ukraine as a continuation of WWII, framing Russia as fighting against Nazism and fascism. This narrative reinforces the notion of Russia as a nation constantly at war with the West, with the victory in WWII serving as a cornerstone of Russian identity.</p>

Poland has begun confronting a new era, with new anxieties, as President Trump has threatened to abandon the longtime U.S. commitment to European security and is implementing tariffs that imperil the global economy. Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin, wants NATO troops out of Poland and has threatened further aggression beyond the war in Ukraine, Poland’s neighbor to the east. Poland is taking more of a leadership role in the European Union, increasing its already significant military spending and organizing a Swiss-style program of training ordinary citizens in civil defense.</p>

          <p>Despite its economic resilience, Ukraine's wartime success is built on a fundamental dependence on foreign financial assistance. The recent minerals agreement with the United States, creating a joint investment fund to access Ukraine’s mineral wealth, highlights this dependency. While the deal has been seen as a victory for Ukraine, it formalizes the Trump administration’s view of international relations as coercive bullying. Despite potential commercial risks and the possibility of a future Ukrainian government repudiating the framework, the agreement is seen as a symbolic effort to maintain US support for its war of self-defence.</p>
