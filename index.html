          <p>The United States is revoking all visas for South Sudanese passport holders and preventing new issuances, citing the country's failure to accept its nationals being deported from the US. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the transitional government in Juba is "taking advantage of the United States" by not adhering to the principle of accepting the return of its citizens. The decision comes amid growing tensions within South Sudan's political landscape and concerns about a potential renewal of civil war.</p>

          <p>China's economic relationship with Africa is evolving, marked by increased trade and a shift towards public-private partnerships. Despite China's domestic economic slowdown, trade with Africa has grown, supported by initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation. The economic partnership is diversifying, with Africa exporting more non-resource goods to China. This reflects a significant shift in global alliances and economic power dynamics.</p>

          <p>Trinity Rodman scored early in her return from injury, helping the US women's national team defeat Brazil 2-0 in a friendly match. Lindsey Heaps added a penalty goal in the second half, and Phallon Tullis-Joyce recorded a clean sheet in her USWNT debut. The game was a rematch of the 2024 Olympic final, and Rodman's performance was particularly significant after being sidelined with a back injury. The USWNT is currently playing without several key players due to injuries and other reasons.</p>

          <p>A government consultation in England is set to address men's health, as men are more likely to die prematurely than women. Factors contributing to this include higher rates of smoking, alcohol consumption, drug use, and biological differences. Men also face challenges in accessing healthcare services due to a lack of health literacy and societal expectations. Experts advocate for improved access to health checks, workplace interventions, and mental health support tailored to men's needs.</p>

          <p>A family has been awarded damages after NHS cancer screening reporting errors led to the death of a mother from cervical cancer. Louise Gleadell's cervical screening results were misreported as negative in both 2008 and 2012, and an internal review found the samples were not good enough to produce reliable results, but neither Ms Gleadell nor her relatives were told about the "inadequate" samples while she was still alive. The family has been given an undisclosed payout, with the trust apologizing for its mistakes that had "devastating consequences."</p>

Sam, the owner of a house in Margate, discovers the thought-provoking "Valentine's Day Mascara" on her wall, which is expected to sell for over £1 million with proceeds going to a domestic violence charity. Conversely, Gert and Gary, who own a buy-to-let in Lowestoft, face significant challenges in preserving and selling their Banksy, a 30ft-high seagull, incurring substantial costs without a guaranteed sale.

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs is a departure from the foundation of US economic might, potentially leading to messy fallout. The tariffs take the US back a century in terms of protectionism and signal a rejection of the globalization process. Trump's rationale is based on the idea that countries with trade surpluses are "cheating," but this ignores the principles of comparative advantage. The long-term aim is to eliminate the US trade deficit, which could harm global trade and impact American companies and consumers.</p>

          <p>Foreign Secretary David Lammy has condemned Israeli authorities for denying entry to two Labour MPs, Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang, calling the move "unacceptable, counterproductive, and deeply concerning." The Israeli population and immigration authority claimed the MPs were refused entry because they intended to spread "hateful rhetoric" against Israel. Lammy has communicated to his counterparts in the Israeli government that this treatment of British Parliamentarians is unacceptable, and the foreign office is offering support to the affected MPs.</p>
