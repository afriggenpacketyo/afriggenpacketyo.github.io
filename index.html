          <p>An office cleaner at 345 Park Avenue has described her harrowing encounter with the gunman who killed four people in the Manhattan high-rise. Sebije Nelovic, 65, stated that the shooter pointed his AR-15-style rifle at her before she fled and hid in a closet for several hours, praying as the attack continued. The gunman, who authorities believe was targeting the NFL headquarters but went to the wrong floor, later took his own life. In a note, the suspect claimed he suffered from CTE, a brain disease linked to head trauma, and requested his brain be studied.</p>

          <p>In a federal trial, plaintiffs are seeking approximately $345 million in damages from Tesla for a 2019 crash in Florida involving its Autopilot system. The incident resulted in the death of a 22-year-old woman and serious injuries to her boyfriend after a Model S owner, who believed the system would brake automatically, accelerated through an intersection. The lawsuit alleges that Tesla's marketing overstated Autopilot's capabilities, encouraging driver over-reliance and creating dangerous defects. Tesla's defense argues that the driver was responsible for the collision and that its technology is designed to save lives.</p>

The order also formalizes a planned tariff increase on Canadian exports to 35%, excluding goods covered by the USMCA trade pact, with the new rates taking effect within seven days.

          <p>Amid growing international concern over a potential famine, two senior U.S. officials, special envoy Steve Witkoff and Ambassador Mike Huckabee, are scheduled to visit Gaza. Their mission is to inspect food distribution sites and report their findings directly to President Trump, reflecting increased U.S. focus on the humanitarian catastrophe. The visit comes as aid workers describe a "politically manmade famine" and international partners like Germany and Sweden increase pressure on Israel. The U.S. has expressed frustration with aid delivery, which it partially blames on Hamas, a claim not supported by U.S. government analysis.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter results that surpassed revenue and earnings expectations, with sales growing 13% to $167.7 billion. However, the company's stock fell after hours due to mixed third-quarter guidance and concerns that its cloud unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), did not show the same explosive growth as competitors like Microsoft Azure. While AWS revenue grew 17.5%, its operating margin declined, and the company cited supply constraints, particularly access to power for AI infrastructure, as a challenge. Despite the market's reaction, the article's analysis suggests the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, maintaining a positive long-term outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new trend involving teenagers using small, teabag-like caffeine pouches is causing concern among health experts. These pouches, placed between the gum and lip, deliver a rapid and potent dose of caffeine directly into the bloodstream, with some containing the equivalent of two cups of coffee. Promoted by social media influencers for a quick energy boost, experts worry about the risk of overdose, especially for young people who may have a lower tolerance. High levels of caffeine can lead to dangerous side effects like rapid heart rate and seizures, and dentists also warn of potential gum irritation over time.</p>

The most common symptoms of the illness are fever and severe joint pain, which can be debilitating. Headaches, muscle pain, joint swelling, and rashes are also associated with the infection, which is rarely fatal but can cause long-term joint issues.</p>

          <p>Brazilian steel giant Gerdau announced an 8.6% year-on-year decline in its second-quarter adjusted net profit, landing slightly below analyst expectations at 864 million reais. The company attributed the drop primarily to weaker results in its South American operations outside of Brazil. However, its North American division showed improved performance, benefiting from higher U.S. tariffs that have reduced import levels and rebalanced supply in the market. North America accounts for over half of Gerdau's net revenue, positioning the company as a potential beneficiary of current U.S. trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cole's French Dip, a historic Los Angeles restaurant and claimant to the invention of the French dip sandwich, has postponed its planned closure for 45 days. The decision comes after an overwhelming outpouring of community support, with long lines of customers forming daily since the closure was announced. Owner Cedd Moses struck a deal with the landlord to extend service, giving patrons more time to say their goodbyes. While the surge in business is appreciated, Moses stated it is likely not sustainable and that he is actively seeking a new buyer who will respect the landmark's historic value.</p>

          <p>Authorities have revealed new details about the double homicide at Devil's Den State Park in Arkansas, stating that Cristen Brink was killed after trying to save her husband. Police believe Clinton Brink was attacked first, and his wife guided their two young daughters to safety before returning to help him, at which point she was also fatally stabbed. The suspect, a 28-year-old former schoolteacher, has been charged with two counts of capital murder and was reportedly unknown to the family. Police stated the suspect admitted to the killings and that his DNA was a match to evidence found at the scene.</p>

          <p>After an 18-month endeavor to forge a career in American football, Welsh star Louis Rees-Zammit has announced he is leaving the NFL to return to rugby union. The 24-year-old, who had been a rising star in rugby, had brief spells with the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars but never played in a regular-season game. In a social media post, Rees-Zammit called his time in the NFL a "great experience" but stated it was time to "come home" and do what he does best.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the Trump administration's recent trade actions suggests that while a full-blown global trade war has been averted for now, the new tariff landscape carries significant long-term risks. The president has secured numerous trade deals and imposed new duties, which has increased U.S. government revenue but also raised the cost of imports. This could lead to higher prices for American consumers, creating a political threat for the administration. While financial markets have remained relatively calm, the article notes that the new, more protectionist environment may push longtime allies to form new economic alliances that bypass the United States.

Meituan plans to launch 1,200 "Raccoon Restaurants," which are food court-style hubs where various chains operate kitchens solely for takeaway orders to reduce costs. Meanwhile, rival JD.com is investing 1 billion yuan to establish 10,000 of its own 7Fresh kitchens over the next three years.

          <p>Colombia's government has reported a significant setback in its environmental efforts, with deforestation increasing by 43% in 2024 compared to the previous year. The Amazon rainforest region was the most severely impacted, accounting for over 65% of the total 113,608 hectares of forest destroyed. This sharp rise reverses a positive trend from 2023, which had seen the lowest deforestation level in over two decades. Authorities attribute the increase to factors such as land-grabbing for cattle ranching, illegal construction, the expansion of illicit coca crops, and wildfires exacerbated by a severe drought.</p>

The company's Mac and Services divisions also saw robust growth, though iPad and wearables sales declined. Apple also saw a 4% sales increase in the crucial Greater China market, reversing declines from the previous two quarters, a success partially attributed to a government subsidy program.

          <p>The Trump administration is reviving the presidential fitness test, a program for school children that originated under President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956. The test was created out of national security concerns after a study showed American children were significantly less fit than their European counterparts, which Eisenhower viewed as a "menace to our security." The test typically assessed cardiovascular fitness, strength, and flexibility through exercises like a one-mile run, pull-ups, and sit-ups. Despite its long history, there is little evidence the program improved children's health, as data shows U.S. child health metrics have worsened.</p>
