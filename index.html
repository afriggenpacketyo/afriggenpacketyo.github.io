          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 00:46:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Post Office has spent over Â£600 million to continue using the flawed Horizon IT system, despite wanting to replace it for over a decade. A 1999 deal with Fujitsu gave the Post Office no ownership of the system's core code, preventing them from inspecting transaction processes. This reliance on Fujitsu's assurances led to the wrongful prosecution of about 700 sub-postmasters for theft, fraud, and false accounting based on Horizon-reported shortfalls. The Post Office finally obtained some rights to the Horizon software in 2023, but experts believe the Fujitsu contract will need to be extended beyond 2026. </p>

          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected quarterback Cam Ward from Miami with the first overall pick in the NFL Draft, fulfilling weeks of speculation. Ward's impressive college record, including leading in touchdown passes, made him a prime choice for the Titans, who were in need of a franchise quarterback. The Jacksonville Jaguars traded up to select Travis Hunter, a two-way player from Colorado, as the second pick. Shedeur Sanders, Hunter's teammate, surprisingly fell out of the first round after earlier projections placed him high in the draft.</p>

          <p>Survivors and families of the 2005 JR West train derailment gathered to mark the 20th anniversary of the tragedy that claimed 107 lives and injured 562. A memorial ceremony was held at the accident site in Amagasaki, Hyogo Prefecture, where attendees observed a moment of silence at 9:18 a.m., the time of the crash. JR West President Kazuaki Hasegawa pledged to preserve the memory of the accident and enhance safety measures, with a new facility planned to house train cars and belongings of the victims. The accident occurred when the train, traveling at 116 kph, derailed on a curve with a 70 kph speed limit.</p>

          <p>The Tennessee Titans selected Miami quarterback Cam Ward as the No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft, aligning with pre-draft predictions. The Jacksonville Jaguars made a surprising trade to pick two-way Colorado star Travis Hunter at No. 2. In a shift from previous years, the draft emphasized offensive and defensive lines, with seven of the top 12 picks being linemen. Only two quarterbacks, Ward and Jaxson Dart, were selected in the first round, marking a contrast to the quarterback-heavy drafts of recent years.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration commended Paraguay for designating Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization. This move, along with Paraguay's expanded designations of Hezbollah and Hamas, is seen as a significant step against Iranian-backed extremism in the Western Hemisphere. The State Department emphasized the importance of this decision, especially in the Tri-Border Area, a known financial hub for Hezbollah-linked operatives. The U.S. hopes this action will help cut off the Iranian regime's ability to fund terrorism and operate in Latin America.</p>

Coach Sean McVay indicated that trading out of the first round was the likely scenario, and the inclusion of the 2026 first-round pick made the deal even more appealing.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly had an unsecured internet connection in his Pentagon office to bypass security protocols and use the Signal messaging app. This raises concerns about potential hacking or surveillance of sensitive defense information. Hegseth has also been criticized for sharing sensitive operational information about strikes on Houthi rebels in a private Signal group chat.</p>

          <p>President Trump is prepared to walk away from the official U.S. policy regarding Crimea in his effort to negotiate an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine. Trump's plan to negotiate an end to the war would mean walking away from more than a decade of American policy. As a candidate, Trump said he would "take a look" at the matter, even though the Obama administration and Americaâs Western allies had rejected Russiaâs annexation of the strategic territory.</p>
