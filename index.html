          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore appeared on "Face the Nation" to criticize President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops in Washington D.C., citing concerns about sustainability, scalability, constitutionality, and disrespect towards service members. Moore highlighted Maryland's successful efforts in reducing violent crime through state and federal partnerships, contrasting it with what he called the President's "performative" approach. He also addressed federal immigration policies, advocating for due process, and confirmed his administration is considering redistricting options in Maryland to ensure fair representation. The governor emphasized focusing on tangible solutions over political theatrics for the American people.</p>

          <p>Nigerian authorities confirmed the rescue of 76 hostages, many of them children, from a 'bandit' camp in Katsina state following precision airstrikes. This operation is part of a broader strategy to dismantle criminal networks responsible for widespread killings, kidnappings, and extortion in remote areas. The rescued group included individuals taken during a recent mosque assault that killed 50 people, highlighting the ongoing security challenges in the region. The military also conducted an airstrike on a militant camp in northeastern Nigeria, where clashes with insurgents have displaced millions and claimed tens of thousands of lives.</p>

          <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that no meeting between President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is currently planned, directly refuting earlier suggestions from President Donald Trump. Lavrov indicated that Putin is only prepared to meet Zelenskyy when a suitable agenda for a summit is established, which he claims is not yet ready. Trump had previously announced arrangements for such a meeting after separate discussions with both leaders, but Russia's continued missile strikes on Ukraine and Lavrov's comments cast doubt on Trump's ability to broker a peace deal.

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused President Donald Trump of creating a "manufactured crisis" to justify sending federalized National Guard troops into Chicago, overriding local authority. Jeffries supported Illinois Governor JB Pritzker's stance that Trump is abusing his power and distracting from issues affecting American families. The deployment, which has already seen armed troops in Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, is part of a broader federal push to militarize cities, ostensibly to combat crime and immigration. Critics argue that crime statistics do not support the President's claims, and such actions undermine state sovereignty and local policing efforts.</p>

Despite the $1,800 week-long trip cost, a significant sum for Russians, the resort remains largely closed to international tourists, with only Russian groups currently permitted.

This progress contrasts sharply with the costly delays and atrophied supply chains plaguing nuclear expansions in the US and Europe.

This article argues that universities must reclaim academic freedom and adopt institutional neutrality to restore credibility. It critiques administrators for their "feckless" responses to controversies and faculty for a decline in intellectual curiosity, leading to a "sectarian university" model. The piece advocates for an uncompromising commitment to free speech, where the institution itself remains neutral on political issues, allowing individual faculty and students to engage in robust debate without fear of suppression. This approach, rooted in the Kalven report, is presented as the only way for universities to fulfill their core purpose of fostering knowledge and informed citizens.</p>

          <p>Renewable energy executives are warning that President Donald Trump's aggressive stance against solar and wind projects could lead to a severe power supply crunch and increased electricity prices for consumers. Trump's administration has signaled it will block federal permits for new renewable installations, a move criticized by the industry for creating market instability and hindering growth. Executives from top developers like Arevon and Engie North America report rising costs due to metal tariffs and regulatory uncertainty, causing a reduction in planned investments. They argue that choking off renewables will exacerbate a looming energy shortage, particularly as demand surges from AI data centers, potentially undermining the U.S. in its technological race.

With 51,000 cases pending and 32,000 asylum seekers in hotels, the government faces increasing pressure to end hotel use. Critics, including the Refugee Council, argue that reducing mistakes in initial decisions is the fastest way to cut the appeals backlog, as about half of original decisions are overturned.
