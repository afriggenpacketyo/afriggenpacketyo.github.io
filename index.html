          <p>An active shooter incident at the Fort Stewart military base in Georgia has prompted a full lockdown, with officials confirming that casualties have been reported. The situation is described as ongoing, with law enforcement, including the FBI and Georgia State Police, responding to the scene in the 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team area. Georgia's governor stated he is in contact with authorities and has asked for prayers for the victims and their families, as the base remains secured and personnel are instructed to shelter in place.</p>

          <p>A new case before the Supreme Court, NetChoice v. Fitch, examines a Mississippi law requiring parental consent for minors to create social media accounts, raising questions about children's First Amendment rights. This follows a recent ruling that upheld age verification for pornographic sites, suggesting a potential shift from a 2011 precedent that broadly protected minors' access to non-obscene content. The outcome could clarify whether the court is moving toward broader restrictions on speech for young people or if the pornography ruling was an isolated exception, impacting how tech platforms operate nationwide.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, bringing the total rate to 50%, primarily in response to India's continued purchase of Russian oil. This action is part of a broader strategy of imposing "reciprocal tariffs" on various countries to address trade deficits, which the administration deems a threat to national security. The article provides a detailed timeline of recent tariff implementations, affecting major trading partners like the EU and Japan, as well as smaller economies, creating significant uncertainty in global markets.

          <p>The U.S. government's decision to incinerate over $9.7 million worth of contraceptives is projected to deny essential healthcare to 1.4 million women and girls in five African nations. According to the International Planned Parenthood Federation, this action will lead to an estimated 174,000 unintended pregnancies and 56,000 unsafe abortions. The destruction of these supplies, many of which do not expire for years, proceeded despite an offer from the NGO to redistribute them at no cost, highlighting significant consequences for reproductive health and rights in the affected countries.</p>

The pledge comes amid persistent pressure from the Trump administration to move more of its supply chain and production to the United States and away from China. CEO Tim Cook is expected to join the president for the official announcement, as Wall Street reacts positively to the move, seeing it as a necessary step to mitigate tariff-related risks.

          <p>Germany is currently engaged in a legal and political debate over its policy of designating certain nations as "safe countries of origin," which significantly impacts asylum procedures. A recent European Court of Justice ruling stated that such designations must be based on disclosed sources and ensure safety for all populations, including minorities. This has prompted calls from opposition parties to review the current list and has complicated the German government's plans to add more countries, such as Tunisia and Algeria, where same-sex relations are criminalized.</p>

          <p>As a U.S.-imposed Friday deadline approaches, White House envoy Steve Witkoff met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in a high-stakes diplomatic effort. The Trump administration is pressuring the Kremlin to agree to a peace deal in Ukraine or face severe new economic penalties, including secondary tariffs on countries that trade with Russia. The outcome of the three-hour meeting was not immediately clear, but it represents a critical moment in President Trump's strategy to leverage economic pressure to end the conflict.</p>

          <h2>AMD Shares Fall Sharply After Earnings Miss and Concerns Over China AI Chip Sales</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) saw its stock fall over 7% after its quarterly earnings fell short of analyst expectations and it raised concerns about its AI chip business in China. CEO Lisa Su attributed a decline in AI revenue to U.S. export restrictions that have halted sales of its MI308 chip to China. The company's current financial forecast does not account for a restart of those shipments, creating uncertainty for investors despite overall year-over-year revenue growth.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis explores the significant global economic repercussions if India and China were to halt their purchases of Russian oil, likely in response to U.S. secondary sanctions. Such a move could trigger a seismic shock in energy markets, potentially causing oil prices to surge and stoking inflation worldwide as nations scramble for alternative supplies. While China may have the economic leverage to resist U.S. pressure, India faces a more difficult position, with its economy being more vulnerable to the threatened tariffs and financial penalties.

          <h2>Opinion: The Culture of Intensive Parenting Advice Fosters Unnecessary Guilt in Mothers</h2>

          <p>A psychologist argues that modern "therapy culture," characterized by a constant stream of parenting advice on social media and in books, is creating an epidemic of guilt and anxiety among mothers. The article suggests that the promise of psychological perfection through specific parenting techniques is an illusion based on shaky science, as research shows many factors beyond parenting shape a child's future. This inward-looking pressure distracts from the real structural issues—like a lack of affordable childcare and community support—that make parenting difficult.</p>

          <p>The city of San Diego is implementing a new "special event zone" around Petco Park, which will see street parking meter rates quadruple from $2.50 to $10 per hour. The new rate will be in effect for six-hour periods surrounding games and concerts, potentially raising the cost of parking to $60 for an event. This move, part of a city-wide effort to increase revenue, has drawn objections from the San Diego Padres, who were surprised by the action and its potential impact on fans attending games.</p>

          <p>Housing affordability this fall will be heavily influenced by the stability of mortgage rates, inventory levels, and home prices, according to lending experts. While some forecasts predict a slight drop in rates, others expect them to hold steady, which could at least reduce market volatility for buyers and sellers. National housing inventory is rising, which may help ease prices, but experts stress that affordability trends will be highly specific to local markets and price points across the country.

          <p>Brentford forward Yoane Wissa has resumed first-team training after holding constructive talks with the club's head coach, following a two-week period of strained relations. However, the 28-year-old player still wishes to secure a transfer to Newcastle United, which would offer him the chance to play in the Champions League. While Brentford is reportedly open to a sale, the club values Wissa at a significantly higher price than Newcastle's current offer and would need to secure a replacement before the transfer deadline.</p>
