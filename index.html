Suleyman expressed concerns that such applications could lead to "seemingly conscious" AIs, creating a "very dangerous" "sexbot erotica direction." This position contrasts with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's recent statement that his company plans to allow verified adults to use ChatGPT for erotica, asserting OpenAI is "not the elected moral police of the world."

          <p>President Trump announced the cancellation of a planned federal deployment to San Francisco, following a direct conversation with Mayor Daniel Lurie and appeals from prominent tech leaders like Jensen Huang and Marc Benioff. Mayor Lurie confirmed the decision, asserting that San Francisco is experiencing a resurgence, with visitors and businesses returning. He presented recent crime statistics, highlighting a significant nearly 30% citywide reduction, violent crime at its lowest levels since the 1950s, and homicides projected to reach 70-year lows. The mayor also secured assurances from federal officials regarding cooperation in combating the fentanyl crisis, underscoring the effectiveness of local public safety initiatives and community unity.</p>

          <p>President Trump denied a Wall Street Journal report of B-1 bombers flying near Venezuela during a White House roundtable focused on immigration and crime crackdowns. Despite the denial, Trump issued stern threats against drug traffickers, declaring, "I think we're just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country." He also indicated that land-based operations against cartels would commence soon, expressing confidence in congressional approval. This article underscores the administration's increasingly aggressive approach to drug interdiction, following recent lethal kinetic strikes on suspected narco-trafficking vessels that have resulted in multiple fatalities.</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old girl has been charged with misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter without gross negligence, along with two infractions, following a car crash in April that killed four other teenagers. Prosecutors confirmed the charges after the driver allegedly drove 60-65 mph in a 40 mph zone, made an "unsafe turning movement," and collided with a redwood tree. The impact caused the vehicle to catch fire, resulting in fatal injuries for four passengers and serious injuries for the driver and another passenger. The California Highway Patrol report cited unsafe speed and the driver's inexperience as primary causes, with no evidence of impairment.</p>

          <p>This article explores the Anaheim Angels' ongoing struggles and missed opportunities, particularly regarding their failure to sign Vladimir Guerrero Jr. as a teenager. Guerrero Jr., now a star for the Blue Jays and playing in the World Series, revealed he never received an offer from the Angels. The Angels' inability to secure him stemmed from international signing penalties incurred after spending $14 million on infielder Roberto Baldoquin in 2015, which limited their ability to offer significant bonuses to other prospects. This historical decision is highlighted amidst the Angels' current postseason drought and internal facility criticisms, illustrating a pattern of organizational missteps.</p>

This shift, disclosed by Meta's chief privacy and compliance officer, aims to streamline assessments and ensure adherence to global regulations, especially those mandated by a $5 billion FTC settlement. While Meta clarified it uses basic automation rather than advanced generative AI for these decisions, this move is part of broader organizational restructurings and aligns with a trend where major companies like JPMorgan Chase and Salesforce are also utilizing AI to reduce workforce and bolster profitability.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin criticized Donald Trump's new sanctions against major Russian oil firms Rosneft and Lukoil as an "unfriendly act," though he claimed they wouldn't affect Russia's economy. Trump had imposed the sanctions citing Russia's lack of serious commitment to a peace process in Ukraine, leading to a proposed meeting between the leaders being canceled. Separately, Lithuania reported that two Russian military aircraft briefly entered its airspace, prompting Spanish jets to scramble in response, though Russia denied any violation during a "training flight."
