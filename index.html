          <p>British police are interrogating five men, including four Iranian nationals, concerning a suspected terror plot targeting a specific location in the UK. The Metropolitan Police stated that the arrests occurred in various locations, and the targeted site has been notified and is receiving support. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper highlighted the operations as reflecting significant counter-terrorism efforts. Eyewitness accounts describe armed officers making arrests, including one man being escorted from a residence in Rochdale and another being apprehended in Swindon.

          <p>Small business owners express concerns about the impact of President Trump's tariffs on their operations, citing challenges in setting prices to absorb new duties without deterring customers.

          <p>The International Court of Justice dismissed a case brought by Sudan accusing the United Arab Emirates of fueling genocide in the country's civil war. The court stated that it lacked jurisdiction because the UAE opted out of a key clause allowing countries to sue each other. Sudan alleged that the UAE violated the Genocide Convention by supporting the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary group fighting the Sudanese military.
