          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that a recent summit between former President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska fulfilled Putin's objectives. Zelenskyy expressed regret that Ukraine was not involved, suggesting the meeting served primarily as a photo opportunity for the Russian leader to project power on the world stage. He reiterated that ending the war requires increased pressure from the U.S. and European allies, particularly by halting the purchase of Russian energy, which he described as Putin's primary "weapon." The comments were made amid ongoing Russian drone and missile assaults across Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth criticized President Trump's recent social media posts and rhetoric threatening to send troops to Chicago, stating he "essentially just declared war on a major city in his own nation." While acknowledging there are no current indications of a military deployment, Duckworth condemned the statements as unacceptable and asserted that such an order would be illegal. She confirmed that military leadership has only been asked to provide office space for ICE agents at a local naval station, with no preparations for troop housing or detention facilities. Duckworth also noted a lack of coordination from the administration with local law enforcement.</p>

The race was also highlighted by a team orders controversy at McLaren, where Oscar Piastri was instructed to let his teammate Lando Norris pass for second place. The order came after a slow pit stop for Norris, caused by a wheel gun fault, dropped him behind Piastri. While Piastri expressed initial disagreement, he complied with the team's decision, which they justified by citing a similar situation in a previous race.</p>

          <p>Everton's new signing, 20-year-old Ornella Vignola, made a spectacular Women's Super League debut by scoring a hat-trick against rivals Liverpool at Anfield. Her performance led Everton to a 4-1 victory in the Merseyside derby, marking the first derby hat-trick for an Everton player since Dixie Dean in 1931. After Liverpool took an early lead, Vignola's individual brilliance turned the game around, scoring once in the first half and twice in quick succession after the break.

          <p>Millions of mobile phones across the United Kingdom emitted a siren-like sound as part of the second national test of the government's emergency alert system. The alert, which included a message clarifying it was a drill, sounded for approximately 10 seconds and was intended to ensure the system's readiness for genuine national emergencies. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the test an important step in public safety, noting that it successfully reached tens of millions of devices. The system has previously been used for real warnings, including for severe storms and the discovery of a WWII bomb.</p>

The author contends that the majority of small businesses in the U.S. are service-based and do not import goods, thus they will not be directly impacted. The bigger concern, according to the article, is whether consumer income and wealth can continue to absorb the resulting price increases from tariffs. For now, with a relatively strong middle class and market, the economy will likely absorb the changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study analyzing data from nearly 15 million people across Denmark, Taiwan, and the U.S. has found that partners in a couple often share the same psychiatric diagnoses. The research, which looked at data spanning from the 1930s to the 1990s, examined nine disorders including anxiety, depression, and ADHD. The phenomenon, known as "spousal correlation," remained consistent across different cultures and generations. Researchers theorize that individuals with similar mental health challenges may be drawn to each other due to shared understanding, similar environments, or even the stigma that can limit dating prospects.</p>

          <p>The estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, the game's second-largest prize ever, was won by two tickets sold in Missouri and Texas. The winning numbers drawn on Saturday were 11, 23, 44, 61, 62, with a Powerball of 17. The massive prize had been growing for three months without a winner. The jackpot had an estimated cash value of $826.4 million, which the two winners will now split. This win marks the end of a long streak and is one of only six Powerball jackpots to have surpassed the billion-dollar mark in the lottery's history.</p>

          <p>The Colombian port town of Leticia, its only access point to the Amazon River, is at risk of becoming landlocked as the river's course shifts southward into Peru. This natural change, driven by drought and sedimentation, is exacerbating a long-standing border dispute over the island of Santa Rosa. Colombian officials are concerned that losing river access will cripple the town's economy, which relies on trade with Peru and Brazil. Tensions flared recently after Peru upgraded Santa Rosa's administrative status, prompting a protest from Colombia's president and highlighting the need for diplomatic resolution.</p>

          <p>Five humanitarian aid workers, known as the "Hajnowka Five," are on trial in Poland, accused of human trafficking for assisting an Iraqi-Kurdish family near the Belarus border in 2022. The case highlights the conflict between Poland's hardline immigration policy and humanitarian efforts, occurring just as the EU Commission President praised the country's border security. The defendants argue they were providing essential aid to a starving family in freezing conditions, while the prosecution claims they were deliberately undermining state migration policy. The trial is seen as a test case for the criminalization of humanitarian assistance.</p>

          <p>The US Eagles women's rugby team has been eliminated from the World Cup despite a commanding 60-0 victory against Samoa. Their fate was sealed when Australia scored enough points in their loss to England to advance to the quarter-finals on points differential. The US team will reflect on missed opportunities, including five missed conversions in the Samoa match and a crucial draw against Australia in a previous round. Despite the disappointing exit, the performance of young, powerful players like 22-year-old flanker Freda Tafuna, who scored four tries, offers significant hope for the team's future.</p>

          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleep habits, or "sleep hygiene," in infancy is the most critical step parents can take to foster their child's long-term health and success. Good sleep is fundamental for a baby's physical, cognitive, and emotional development, laying the groundwork for learning, concentration, and resilience later in life. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment that mimics the womb, getting non-breastfeeding partners involved in settling, and maintaining a flexible routine. He emphasizes that teaching a baby to sleep well is a foundational skill that benefits them for a lifetime.</p>

          <p>An opinion article makes the case that solar power should be embraced by right-wing preppers, not for environmental reasons, but for its reliability and independence during a societal breakdown. The author contrasts the complexity and failure points of fossil fuel systems with the simplicity of solar panels and batteries, which provide a self-sufficient energy source for decades. The piece suggests that solar energy aligns with conservative ideals of hyper-individualism and self-reliance. It frames solar as a robust technology that makes a home a defensible and sustainable "castle" in any emergency scenario.</p>

          <p>Republican state senators in Arizona have filed an ethics complaint seeking to expel Democratic Senator Analise Ortiz for resharing an Instagram post that warned of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity near an elementary school. Ortiz defends her action as protected First Amendment speech intended to inform her community, while the complaint, spurred by a right-wing account, accuses her of jeopardizing officer safety. The complaint calls for her expulsion or, alternatively, removal from committees and staff.

          <p>An analysis of President Donald Trump's rhetoric highlights his increasing use of phrases like "never seen anything like it" to describe events, policies, and situations. This form of hyperbole is identified as a rhetorical signature that reflects his black-and-white worldview, casting himself as a heroic figure achieving unprecedented successes or facing unparalleled crises. According to a database of presidential remarks, Trump's use of the phrase has surged this year compared to previous years in office. The article suggests this linguistic habit is not just a verbal tic but a key component of his governing style.</p>

The protests come as the Israeli government signals preparations to expand its ground operations in Gaza, despite growing international calls for a ceasefire.

Transport for London (TfL) has offered a 3.4% pay rise but rejected the reduced work week as unaffordable. The strike, the first to close the whole network since March 2023, is also causing increased crowding on other services like the Elizabeth line and Overground.</p>

While China added a record amount of solar capacity, issues like grid capacity and intermittency have led to increased "curtailment," where clean energy is generated but cannot be used. In this context, coal plants act as a reliable backup, ensuring grid stability during peak demand and giving operators the confidence to integrate unprecedented levels of wind and solar power.
