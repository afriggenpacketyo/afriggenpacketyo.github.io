          <h2>German Rents Surge Despite Regulations in Major Cities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 04:21:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Data reveals that rents in Germany's largest cities have significantly increased over the past decade, despite existing rent control laws. Berlin experienced the highest rise in new rental prices, followed by Leipzig and Bremen, while Munich remains the most expensive city overall. The German government has laws to limit rents in regions with tight housing markets, but landlords are not subject to government supervision, requiring tenants to report suspected violations themselves. This article highlights the challenges in enforcing rent control and the increasing financial burden on tenants in major German urban centers. Optimism is tempered by the fact that tenants must self-report violations, indicating a need for stronger enforcement mechanisms.</p>

          <p>A joint operation by ICE and other federal law enforcement agencies at a Louisiana racetrack led to the arrest of over 80 illegal migrants, some with criminal records. The operation followed the lifting of a brief pause on immigration arrests at farms, hotels, and restaurants, and was prompted by intelligence indicating unauthorized workers were employed at the Delta Downs Racetrack stables. Authorities are investigating potential labor exploitation, immigration violations, and other criminal activities uncovered during the raid, such as document and benefit fraud, money laundering, and human trafficking. This operation underscores ICE's focus on worksite enforcement to reduce illegal employment and hold employers accountable.</p>

          <p>A Boeing executive emphasized the need for Europe to decrease its dependence on China for critical minerals, mirroring similar efforts in the United States. The executive noted that the aerospace supply chain is inherently global, requiring international collaboration, and pointed out that U.S. legislation since 1973 mandates the aerospace industry to avoid reliance on countries like China for critical materials. This push reflects broader concerns about sovereignty and supply chain security, encouraging a more diversified approach to sourcing essential resources for defense and aerospace industries.

          <p>Prime Minister Modi informed President Trump that the ceasefire between India and Pakistan was achieved through direct military talks, without U.S. mediation. Modi emphasized India's consistent policy of rejecting third-party intervention in matters concerning Kashmir, clarifying that no trade deal discussions or U.S. mediation occurred between the Pahalgam attack and the ceasefire. Modi conveyed that India now views cross-border terrorism as an act of war and that operations against terrorists are ongoing, and the two leaders agreed to meet in person soon. The conversation aimed to address conflicting narratives and reaffirm India's stance on bilateral relations and counter-terrorism efforts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As tariffs increase, businesses are using "tariff engineering" to reclassify products and lower duty rates by altering materials, dimensions, or compositions. This practice, which predates Trump's second term, involves strategically designing products to fit into different harmonized system codes with lower tariffs. Examples include adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins to classify them as jewelry and modifying footwear to be categorized as slippers; however, heavily regulated sectors face challenges due to extensive validation requirements for even minor changes. While legal, this practice highlights the complexities of navigating international trade policies and the creative ways companies adapt to reduce tariff liabilities.</p>

          <p>A review concluded that police should have arrested Anne Sacoolas, the American diplomat who caused the fatal crash that killed Harry Dunn, as she was driving on the wrong side of the road. The report criticizes Northamptonshire Police's handling of the investigation, citing failures in evidence gathering and prioritizing Sacoolas's welfare over Dunn, who died at the scene. Sacoolas, who left the UK under diplomatic immunity, later pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving, and the report also highlights the former chief constable's erroneous statements and criticism of the Dunn family's spokesperson. The report underscores significant shortcomings in the police response and calls for improvements to prevent similar failures in the future.</p>

          <p>A man charged with killing a Minnesota lawmaker and wounding another could face the death penalty, a rarity in Minnesota but potentially more common under the Trump administration. Minnesota abolished capital punishment in 1911, but federal prosecutors have filed charges that can carry the death penalty against Vance Boelter. The federal intervention has created tension with the county attorney, who intends to pursue state charges for first-degree murder.

The Chartered Trading Standards Institute (CTSI) is calling for urgent action to establish a licensing scheme due to the lack of regulation in the industry, which is putting people's lives at risk. Unsafe fillers and fat-dissolving injections are also being sold online, and officials are concerned about young people getting injections from practitioners who don't check for the minimum age of 18. The government is considering new regulations to protect people from unlicensed practitioners and unsafe procedures.</p>

          <p>Honda has successfully tested an experimental reusable space rocket on Hokkaido, Japan, aiming to achieve suborbital space flight by 2029. The company stated that the test was successful, with the rocket landing after reaching nearly 300 meters in altitude. Honda aims to contribute to satellite launches, potentially leading to services compatible with other Honda businesses, and believes growing expectations for a "data system in outer space" will increase demand for satellite launch rockets. This marks a significant step for Honda in entering the space industry and developing reusable rocket technology.</p>

          <p>The Co-op is offering its members a Â£10 discount on a minimum Â£40 shop following disruption caused by a recent cyber attack where customer data was stolen. While the offer appears generous, one analyst notes that most customers do not spend Â£40 or more per shop, limiting its appeal. The offer is intended to show that the Co-op is "on the front foot" ahead of summer trading and to encourage members who may have started shopping elsewhere to return. The Co-op is nearing a full recovery from the attack, and its stores are returning to usual trading.</p>
