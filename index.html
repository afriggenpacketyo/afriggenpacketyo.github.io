          <p>Jack Teixeira, serving a 15-year sentence for leaking classified U.S. national defense secrets on Discord, spoke from prison, asserting he doesn't believe he betrayed his country and would repeat his actions. Teixeira claims his intent was to educate the public about undisclosed information and that his case was politicized by the Biden administration, leading to a harsher sentence than others who committed similar offenses. He is appealing to Donald Trump for a pardon, believing Trump will see him as a supporter. His mother, Dawn Dufault, also believes the prosecution was malicious and hopes Trump will review the case and grant a pardon.</p>

          <p>The UK government's plan to finalize an agreement ceding the Chagos Islands to Mauritius has been temporarily blocked by a High Court injunction following a legal challenge by two Chagossian women. The women seek to return to the islands, which is prohibited under both the current and proposed arrangements. The agreement would have allowed the UK and US to continue using a military base on the archipelago for 99 years, while the UK would pay billions to Mauritius. The court order prevents the UK from taking conclusive steps to transfer the territory or bind itself to specific terms until further notice.</p>

          <p>The House is set to vote on President Trump's domestic policy bill after an all-night session yielded an updated version aimed at appeasing Republican holdouts. The bill addresses tax, defense, and energy priorities, but faced opposition from various factions within the GOP over Medicaid, state and local tax deductions, and renewable energy credits. A managers amendment was released with changes to win over budget hardliners and blue-state Republicans, including accelerating Medicaid work requirements and modifying tax credits for renewable energy plants. The bill is expected to face resistance in the Senate even if it passes the House.</p>

French contrasts this with Souter's decision to prioritize a life beyond the court, emphasizing the value of humility, kindness, and a focus on family over career success.

Researchers collected DNA samples from cat shows and spay-neuter clinics, identifying a missing piece of DNA near the ARHGAP36 gene responsible for the orange mutation. The Stanford team found that the mutation activates the ARHGAP36 gene, which gets specifically turned on in pigment cells where it is not normally active.

          <p>President Trump's approach to tariffs involves suggesting high numbers and then reducing them, creating a sense of relief despite the rates remaining elevated. Yair Reiner, a kitchenware business owner, described the initial 145% tariffs as crippling, while the reduced 30% tariffs felt like a partial easing of pressure. This strategy, known as the anchor effect, has successfully reframed tariffs for investors, though the uncertainty caused by the shifts creates problems for long-term planning and investment, according to the NPR article.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other experts argue that U.S. chip export controls on China have been a failure, causing more harm to American businesses than to China. The restrictions, aimed at curbing China's military advancement and protecting U.S. dominance in AI, have incentivized China to become self-sufficient in semiconductor technology. The CNBC article highlights the counter-intuitive effects of the curbs, including the acceleration of Chinese innovation and the loss of market share for U.S. companies.</p>

          <p>The House voted to begin debating Republicans' domestic policy bill, after Speaker Mike Johnson made last-minute concessions to appease factions. However, despite Trump's support, passage is uncertain due to divisions over Medicaid, SALT deductions, and clean energy tax credits. Democrats are united in opposition, calling the bill a betrayal of the American people due to its cuts to social programs and tax cuts for the wealthy.

While tax receipts increased, government expenditure also rose due to pay rises, inflation, and increased pension and benefit costs.
