          <p>Donald Trump stated that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein "stole" Virginia Giuffre and other workers from his Mar-a-Lago club's spa in the early 2000s. Trump claimed these incidents were the reason he severed ties with Epstein, asserting he had warned him against recruiting his employees. These comments were made amid ongoing legal battles, including a lawsuit Trump filed against Rupert Murdoch over a Wall Street Journal story about a letter allegedly sent to Epstein. The context also includes Ghislaine Maxwell's legal team seeking conditions for her congressional testimony.</p>

          <p>A gunman killed four people, including an NYPD officer, in a Midtown Manhattan office building before taking his own life. The suspect, identified as Shane Tamura, traveled from Las Vegas and used a high-powered rifle in the attack. Investigators found a note where Tamura appeared to blame the National Football League, which has offices in the building, for a traumatic head injury he believed he sustained. The shooting prompted renewed calls from New York officials for stricter national gun control laws.</p>

          <p>Starbucks announced its sixth consecutive quarter of declining same-store sales, with a global drop of 2%, steeper than analysts expected. Despite the downturn, CEO Brian Niccol expressed confidence that the company's turnaround plan is ahead of schedule, citing progress in U.S. operations and a return to growth in China. The company's revenue of $9.5 billion slightly exceeded expectations, and its shares rose in after-hours trading following the report. Starbucks is planning future initiatives, including new menu items and a revamped rewards program, to regain momentum.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The prospect of new U.S. tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals could affect drugmakers differently based on their global manufacturing footprints. Analysts suggest companies like Novartis and Roche, with significant overseas operations, may be more at risk, while those with larger U.S. manufacturing bases like AbbVie and Eli Lilly could be better positioned. The exact tariff rate remains unclear, but experts warn that levies above 50% could be punitive, potentially leading to R&D cuts and price hikes for consumers. Pharmaceutical companies are exploring mitigation strategies, including shifting manufacturing and sourcing, while some advocate for a full exemption to protect patient access.

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) will pay more than $6.13 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Jewish students and faculty who alleged their civil rights were violated during pro-Palestinian campus protests. The plaintiffs claimed the university allowed an encampment that created a "Jew Exclusion Zone," blocking their access to parts of the campus. As part of the settlement, UCLA is prohibited from facilitating the exclusion of Jewish individuals from campus areas and will direct funds to Jewish community groups and its own antisemitism initiative. The agreement sets an important precedent for university responsibilities during campus protests.</p>

          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has announced that the death toll from Israel's military offensive has exceeded 60,000 people since the conflict began in October 2023. The figures, which do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, include over 18,500 children and nearly 9,800 women. The report came as new strikes were reported across Gaza and UN-backed experts warned that a worst-case famine scenario is currently unfolding. Israel disputes the figures and methodology, while international access to verify claims from either side remains restricted.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has announced a proposal to revoke its 2009 "endangerment finding," the scientific basis that classifies greenhouse gases as a public health threat under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the move as a major deregulatory action intended to save billions by repealing resulting emissions regulations for vehicles and other sources. The 2009 finding, upheld by courts, has underpinned all major federal climate regulations for over a decade. Environmental groups and former EPA officials have condemned the proposal as a denial of science that will be challenged in court.</p>

          <p>Royal Caribbean has raised its full-year earnings guidance, citing robust booking trends and strong consumer demand for experience-based travel. The company now anticipates higher adjusted earnings per share for 2025, noting that travelers are vacationing more frequently and are willing to pay more for last-minute bookings. CEO Jason Liberty attributed this trend partly to a growing number of younger cruisers, with millennials and younger generations now making up about half of their guests. Despite the positive outlook and increased guidance, the company's shares saw a slight decline in trading.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom announced it will recognize a Palestinian state in September if Israel fails to take steps toward a ceasefire, a move that coincides with reports that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considering annexing territories in Gaza. The U.K.'s conditional pledge, similar to a recent one by France, is aimed at reviving the two-state solution. Meanwhile, sources indicate that annexation is one of several options being weighed by Israel following the breakdown of U.S.-mediated ceasefire talks with Hamas.

          <p>This article provides guidance for seniors considering a reverse mortgage as a way to supplement their income amid persistent inflation and high interest rates. It advises using the funds for strategic, necessary purposes rather than as a casual income stream, and carefully choosing a payment structure that fits specific needs. The article also recommends comparing reverse mortgages to other home equity options like HELOCs, which may be more affordable. It cautions that the process, which includes mandatory counseling, can be more time-consuming than other types of loans. (not investment advice)</p>

It acknowledges the challenge of fitting multiple high-profile attackers like Mohamed Salah and Florian Wirtz into a single lineup.
