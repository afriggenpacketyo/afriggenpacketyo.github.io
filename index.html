          <h2>Proposed Medicaid Cuts Spark Fears of Coverage Loss for Vulnerable Americans</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Proposed cuts to Medicaid, a joint federal and state health insurance program for disabled and low-income Americans, are causing widespread concern among those who rely on it. An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that these cuts could leave at least 8.6 million more people without health insurance by 2034. Many Republicans argue that the cuts are aimed at eliminating fraud and abuse, while individuals and families who depend on Medicaid worry about reduced access to healthcare and difficult choices between medical needs and basic necessities. Stories from individuals like Rosa Andresen, a caregiver for her disabled daughter, and Jodie Montplaisir, who overcame opioid use disorder with Medicaid-funded treatment, highlight the critical role Medicaid plays in their lives and the potential impact of these cuts.</p>

          <p>Ten inmates, considered armed and dangerous, escaped from the Orleans Parish Jail in New Orleans early Friday morning, with authorities suspecting inside help. The inmates reportedly removed a sliding jail cell door and breached a wall behind a toilet, then scaled down a wall and ran across the interstate. One inmate, Kendell Myles, was captured in downtown New Orleans using facial recognition technology and is being rebooked with a new charge of simple escape. A multi-agency manhunt is underway, involving local, state, and federal law enforcement, as police notify victims of the escapees, several of whom are facing murder charges. This incident has raised concerns about security lapses and potential staff involvement.</p>

          <p>New Jersey's first statewide transit strike in over 40 years began Friday morning, leaving thousands of commuters stranded due to a breakdown in negotiations between New Jersey Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen. The strike follows months of disputes over wages, with the union demanding pay parity with engineers at other railroads serving New York City. Governor Philip D. Murphy apologized to commuters and blamed union leaders for rejecting a fair offer, while union officials expressed frustration and willingness to return to the table. The strike has forced commuters to seek alternative transportation, with limited bus service provided by NJ Transit.</p>

This decision comes after months of the probation department defying the state's order to close the hall, which has been plagued by staffing shortages and incidents of violence.

The case revolves around a proclamation signed by President Trump invoking the 1798 law to deport Venezuelan nationals allegedly tied to the gang Tren de Aragua, leading to legal battles over the scope and application of the wartime authority.</p>

The seawater safety testing is designed for sewage-related hazards, not fire debris, and there are no clear health guidelines for safe exposure levels to fire-related contaminants.

Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, former interior secretary, opposes the amendment, threatening the budget bill's future. The amendment reflects Interior Secretary Doug Burgum's view of public lands as assets to be exploited, a perspective the author argues is shortsighted and threatens a century of conservation progress. The essay emphasizes the importance of public lands for their beauty, biodiversity, historical significance, and recreational value, and notes that selling them off would not solve the nation's affordable housing crisis.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved Fujirebio's blood test for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease in some patients, marking a significant step toward wider availability of this approach. The test, which measures proteins associated with amyloid plaques in the brain, is intended for adults aged 55 and older presenting with signs and symptoms of cognitive decline. The FDA's approval comes after a study comparing the blood test results with brain scans and spinal fluid tests showed high accuracy. This clearance follows concerns about other blood tests for Alzheimer's being sold without FDA approval, highlighting the agency's push for stricter oversight of diagnostic tests.</p>

          <p>As the US considers lifting sanctions on Syria, Lebanon sees both risks and opportunities. President Joseph Aoun anticipates regional trade, refugee returns, and economic recovery amid shifting alliances. With over 1.5 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Aoun hopes for their repatriation following the ouster of President Bashar Assad. Analysts suggest Lebanon could benefit from economic integration with Syria, potentially opening land corridors to Jordan, Iraq, and the Gulf countries. However, concerns remain about Lebanon being left behind if Syria reconciles with Gulf states first.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is challenging Democratic-led states that provide benefits to undocumented immigrants, threatening to penalize them for these policies. This move has sparked debate among Democrats, with some arguing for continued support for immigrants and others suggesting retrenchment due to budget concerns. Actions by the administration include an executive order targeting in-state tuition for undocumented students and an investigation of a California program for impoverished older and disabled immigrants. The Republican reconciliation bill could also penalize states that use their own funds to provide health care to undocumented immigrants.</p>

          <p>A federal judge expressed frustration with the Trump administration's efforts to withhold details about reversing the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was sent to a prison in El Salvador due to an "administrative error." Judge Paula Xinis accused the administration of failing to adequately comply with her order to "facilitate" Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. and invoked the state secrets privilege to withhold information. The case revolves around the administration's deportation of Abrego Garcia, who had been granted a withholding of removal, to a notorious prison in El Salvador.</p>
