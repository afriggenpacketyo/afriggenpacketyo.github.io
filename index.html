          <p>The United States has confirmed it will proceed with increased tariffs on the European Union, setting a firm deadline of August 1. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated the new 30% baseline tariff is a "hard deadline," though he expressed confidence that a deal could eventually be reached, even after the duties take effect. The EU is preparing potential retaliatory measures but hopes to negotiate a lower rate, similar to the 10% baseline deal secured by the U.K. However, reports suggest the White House is pushing for a harsher stance against Brussels, complicating last-ditch efforts to avoid a significant trade escalation.

          <p>Ukraine has significantly escalated its drone attacks on Moscow, causing disruptions at the city's airports over the weekend, with Russia reporting it downed over 100 drones. In response, Russia continued its own widespread missile and drone assaults across Ukraine, resulting in at least one death and damage to civilian infrastructure in Kyiv. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated the intent is to increase pressure on Russia to engage in negotiations. Meanwhile, international partners in the Ukraine Contact Group are meeting to discuss further military support for Kyiv's defense efforts.</p>

          <p>The Bombay High Court has acquitted all 12 individuals accused in the 2006 Mumbai train bombings, overturning a 2015 special court ruling that had sentenced five to death and seven to life in prison. The two-judge panel concluded that the prosecution had "utterly failed" to prove its case, citing unreliable witness testimony and insufficient evidence linking the accused to the attacks that killed 189 people. The decision means the 11 surviving accused, who have spent nearly two decades in prison, will be released. This case highlights long-standing issues within India's overburdened judicial system.</p>

Known as "Fito," he faces federal charges in New York for importing thousands of pounds of cocaine into the U.S. The extradition occurred after Macías was recaptured in June following a prison escape, where he was serving a 34-year sentence for murder and organized crime. His gang is known for its extreme violence and use of military-grade weapons, and this move marks a significant step in the cooperation between the two nations to combat transnational criminal organizations.</p>

The speculation follows reports that Harry hopes the 2027 Invictus Games in the U.K. could facilitate a family reunion. However, experts claim the primary obstacle remains a profound lack of trust from senior royals, including Prince William, following the couple's public disclosures and Harry's memoir. While the King may desire a relationship with his grandchildren, the family is reportedly concerned about further private matters being made public, creating a complex dynamic for any potential mending of the rift.</p>

This strategy acknowledges that a small number of highly successful investments, like Spotify or Klarna, will generate the vast majority of a fund's profits, outweighing all other losses combined. According to Peter Specht of Creandum, VCs seek founders who can pitch a compelling vision for why their company can become a category-defining leader. This involves demonstrating a unique market solution and showcasing the founder's exceptional drive and ambition for outsized growth. (not investment advice)</p>

Other contributing issues include higher industrial costs and pre-tax net charges, leading to a drop in net revenue and a 6% decline in vehicle shipments.

          <p>A new production of Richard Wagner's opera "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg" at the Bayreuth Festival reignites debate over its interpretation and historical baggage. The article explores why Adolf Hitler was an ardent admirer of the composer, seeing Wagner's concept of a "total work of art" as a model for his own propaganda spectacles and party rallies. The opera's themes of preserving "German art" and its alleged antisemitic undertones, particularly in the character of Beckmesser, made it a tool for the Nazi regime. This historical context continues to challenge modern directors, who must decide whether to emphasize its comedic elements or confront its darker legacy.</p>

Led by Sohei Kamiya, who draws inspiration from Donald Trump, Sanseito has successfully tapped into growing public unease over immigration and economic issues.

The proposals aim to address systemic issues like underinvestment, leaking infrastructure, and sewage spills by enforcing minimum capital levels and blocking unsuitable ownership changes. While these reforms are expected to lead to higher customer bills to fund over £100 billion in necessary upgrades, they are designed to ensure long-term resilience and prevent future crises.</p>

          <p>The family of legendary England batter Graham Thorpe, who took his own life last year at age 55, will hold "A Day for Thorpey" to celebrate his memory during an upcoming Test match at The Oval. The event, held on what would have been his 56th birthday, aims to raise money and awareness for mental health in partnership with the charity Mind. Thorpe's family spoke about his struggle with depression and anxiety, which worsened after his coaching career. They hope that by sharing his story, they can help reduce the stigma surrounding suicide and encourage others to seek help early.</p>

          <p>Armed Bedouin clans have announced their withdrawal from the Druze-majority city of Sweida in southern Syria following a week of deadly clashes and a ceasefire brokered by the United States. The fighting between Druze militias and Sunni Muslim clans killed hundreds and displaced over 128,000 people, threatening to destabilize the region further. The conflict, which also drew Israeli airstrikes against government forces siding with the Bedouins, was sparked by tit-for-tat kidnappings that escalated into sectarian violence. Following the withdrawal, humanitarian aid convoys have begun to enter the battered city, bringing a cautious calm to the area.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two apartment blocks in Kirkby, Merseyside, are set to be closed due to severe fire safety problems, leaving residents homeless and their properties worthless. Leaseholders report spending years and up to £1 million of their own money on repairs and safety measures while the buildings, managed by a series of firms, deteriorated. Local MP Anneliese Midgley blamed a "broken leasehold system" that allowed management companies and landlords to profit while neglecting their responsibilities. The case highlights the vulnerability of leaseholders and the devastating financial and personal consequences when building management and safety oversight fails.</p>

          <p>A 158-year-old Northamptonshire transport company, KNP, was forced to cease operations and lay off 700 employees after a devastating ransomware attack. It is believed that hackers from a group known as Akira gained access to the company's entire network by guessing a single employee's weak password. The attackers then encrypted all of the company's data and locked its systems, rendering the business inoperable. This case serves as a stark warning about the severe consequences of basic cybersecurity failures and is part of a rising wave of ransomware attacks targeting UK businesses.</p>

          <p>Despite years of severe U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese tech giant Huawei has transformed itself into a formidable competitor across the entire artificial intelligence landscape. The company has expanded beyond its telecom roots into advanced semiconductors, data centers, and large language models, positioning itself as China's primary alternative to U.S. chip leader Nvidia. U.S. sanctions ironically pushed Huawei to innovate and become a state-backed national champion, developing its own AI hardware and software ecosystem, like the Ascend chips and CANN software. This strategic pivot has made Huawei a highly competent player in multiple complex technology sectors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is introducing a new, non-waivable "visa integrity fee" of at least $250 for visitors requiring nonimmigrant visas, including tourists, business travelers, and international students. The fee, part of the Trump administration's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is paid upon visa issuance and is in addition to existing application costs. While the provision includes a mechanism for reimbursement if visitors comply with their visa terms, such as not overstaying, details on implementation remain scarce. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office estimates the fee will generate nearly $29 billion in revenue over the next decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Richard Tillman, the 44-year-old brother of the late NFL player and U.S. Army Ranger Pat Tillman, has been arrested in connection with a fire at a San Jose post office. Authorities allege that Richard intentionally reversed a vehicle into the building's lobby early Sunday morning and then set it on fire, causing a total loss of the facility. Federal postal inspectors reported that the phrase "Viva La Me" was spray-painted on the building's exterior, but the motive for the attack remains unclear. Pat Tillman was famously killed in Afghanistan in 2004 by friendly fire, a revelation that followed initial misleading reports from the Army.</p>

          <p>Fierce price wars are sweeping across multiple industries in China, from electric vehicles to food delivery, squeezing corporate profits and contributing to deflationary pressures. While consumers are attracted to deep discounts, the cutthroat competition comes with hidden costs, including potential compromises on product quality and safety. Chinese state media and the government have begun to criticize this "race to the bottom," warning that it ultimately harms companies, wages, and the broader economy. The trend reflects a shift in consumer behavior toward value-seeking since the pandemic, forcing companies to prioritize market share over short-term profitability.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling coalition, led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, has lost its majority in the upper house of parliament following a bruising election. Despite the significant setback, which compounds the loss of a lower house majority last year, Ishiba has stated he has no intention of resigning. The result reflects voter frustration with the Liberal Democratic Party over rising prices, a cost-of-living crisis, and ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S. The election also saw significant gains for the small, right-leaning Sanseito party, which siphoned conservative votes from the ruling coalition, further complicating the political landscape.</p>

          <p>A growing body of evidence suggests that popular GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy could be a game-changing treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder. Women with PCOS often suffer from insulin resistance, and studies indicate that losing as little as 5% of body weight can improve this, in turn helping to regulate hormones and alleviate symptoms like irregular periods and infertility. While not yet approved for this use, many women in trials and anecdotal reports have experienced significant improvements. However, the high cost and lack of insurance coverage for this unapproved use remain major barriers to access.</p>
