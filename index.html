          <h2>Trump Considers Tariff Exemptions for Automakers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 17:00:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering exemptions for automakers from tariffs on auto parts imported from China, as well as levies on steel and aluminum, according to a White House confirmation following a Financial Times report. This potential exemption would be separate from the existing tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts scheduled to take effect in May. The move comes amid concerns about the impact of tariffs on the automotive industry and the broader economy, which has been a key point of contention during Trump's presidency.

          <p>Opening statements have begun in Harvey Weinstein's New York retrial, where he faces accusations of sexual assault from three women. Prosecutors described Weinstein as a "Hollywood gatekeeper" who abused his power, while the defense argued the accusers had "mutually beneficial" relationships with him. Weinstein's previous conviction was overturned, leading to this retrial on new charges. He has also been convicted of sexual assault in California and faces a lengthy prison sentence. The decision by his accusers to come forward, and his subsequent conviction in New York, galvanised the #MeToo movement against sex abuse by powerful men.</p>

The project, initiated by a former Fox News producer, aims to prepare Hegseth for television appearances. Hegseth is doing his own makeup and has been using the press room for TV appearances, including one where he blamed the media for revealing that he shared sensitive military details in a Signal group chat.</p>

          <p>Florida students, including survivors of the Parkland school shooting and the recent shooting at Florida State University, are lobbying lawmakers to maintain existing gun restrictions. These students are advocating against efforts to roll back the 2018 law that raised the minimum age to purchase a gun to 21. They argue that the current laws helped prevent further carnage in the FSU shooting, as the suspect was unable to legally purchase a rifle. The students are urging lawmakers to prioritize gun control policies in the final weeks of the legislative session.</p>
