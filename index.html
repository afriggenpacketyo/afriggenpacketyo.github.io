        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC provides an overview of the Antifa movement following a presidential executive order designating it a domestic terrorist organization. The article explains that Antifa is a loosely organized, leaderless, far-left affiliation of anti-fascist activists with roots in 1930s Germany. Legal experts question the president's authority to make such a designation for a domestic group, citing potential conflicts with First Amendment rights and the lack of a formal organizational structure, which could lead to governmental overreach. The piece also notes that multiple independent studies suggest far-right extremism has been responsible for more political violence in the US than far-left extremism.</p>

          <p>Brittany Aldean, wife of country singer Jason Aldean, shared her experience attending the memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was recently killed. In a social media post, she described the service for the Turning Point founder as overwhelmingly "faith-based" and inspiring, noting the profound impact Kirk had on his followers. Aldean said that despite the sadness, the event felt like a "revival" that was strengthening people's faith and motivating them to continue his legacy. She concluded her reflection by stating she would try to "live like Charlie" on a daily basis.</p>

          <p>The White House plans to host a meeting with Senate and House Democratic leaders to negotiate a funding deal as a potential government shutdown approaches the September 30 deadline. The meeting comes after competing Republican and Democratic short-term funding proposals failed in the Senate, creating an impasse. Democratic leaders have stated they will not support a bill that fails to address their healthcare priorities and have placed the onus on the president to reach an agreement. The president has publicly expressed doubt that a meeting would have any impact, suggesting a shutdown is a very possible outcome.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a 6-3 ruling allowing the president to dismiss a top official at the Federal Trade Commission, siding with the administration in an ongoing legal challenge. Concurrently, the court has agreed to hear arguments on whether to overturn a nearly century-old precedent, Humphrey's Executor, which protects independent agencies from direct presidential interference. The dissenting justices warned that this decision could dismantle the bipartisanship and independence of agencies Congress intended to shield from political partisanship. The ruling has immediate implications for other officials the administration seeks to remove, including a Federal Reserve governor.</p>

          <p>The president has publicly blamed the common pain reliever acetaminophen, known as Tylenol, for contributing to the rise in autism diagnoses, drawing immediate dismay from medical researchers and advocates. During a news conference, he offered a series of inaccurate medical statements, also suggesting changes to childhood vaccine schedules. Experts countered that research into a causal link between acetaminophen and autism has found minimal evidence, and that untreated fever during pregnancy poses known risks to fetal development, including neurodevelopmental disorders.

          <p>In a recent series of actions, the administration has escalated its campaign against perceived political adversaries and constitutional protections for free speech. These moves include replacing a U.S. attorney investigating political foes, publicly directing the Attorney General to prosecute opponents, and having the FCC chairman suggest punitive measures against critical media networks. The administration also designated "antifa" as domestic terrorists and imposed new restrictions on military reporters. This pattern of using governmental power to target Democrats, liberal groups, and established institutions while shielding allies marks a significant departure from long-held political norms.</p>

          <p>India is making a significant $18 billion push to establish a domestic semiconductor industry, aiming to reduce import dependency and capture a larger share of the global electronics market. The "Semiconductor Mission" seeks to build a complete supply chain, from chip design to fabrication and packaging, and has so far approved ten major projects. Despite having a strong pool of engineering talent, the country faces steep competition and challenges, including the need for a robust ecosystem of specialty chemical suppliers and reliable infrastructure. Experts note that while the government's financial incentives are generous, long-term success will depend on addressing these deeper systemic factors. (not investment advice)</p>

The largest and most robust study, covering 2.5 million children in Sweden, found no causal link after comparing siblings.

          <p>The administration's new $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications has created significant confusion and uncertainty, according to immigration attorneys. While the White House clarified the one-time fee applies only to new applicants and not current visa holders, lawyers note that gray areas remain, particularly for current holders who need to travel abroad while applying for extensions or changing employers. This ambiguity has led some attorneys to advise corporate clients that their H-1B employees should avoid international travel for now. The policy is expected to have a "chilling effect" on attracting skilled foreign workers to various U.S. industries.</p>

          <p>Comedian Jimmy Kimmel's late-night talk show is set to return to air after being suspended by Disney-owned ABC for comments made about the killing of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. Disney stated the suspension was due to the comments being "ill-timed and thus insensitive" but decided to reinstate the show after "thoughtful conversations" with the host. The suspension had followed threats from the FCC chairman and decisions by major affiliate station owners to drop the program, sparking a nationwide debate on free speech and potential censorship. The controversy drew widespread criticism from First Amendment advocates, Hollywood figures, and other late-night hosts.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-22 18:09:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The administration has launched a new immigration pathway, the "Trump Gold Card," which offers a fast track to permanent residency for wealthy foreigners. Through an executive order, potential immigrants can receive an employment-based visa in exchange for a $1 million "unrestricted gift to the Department of Commerce," which the president said would generally go toward paying down national debt. This program differs from the existing EB-5 investor visa by not requiring direct investment into American businesses. The policy suggests a shift in immigration values, prioritizing personal wealth as a primary qualification for residency in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA has introduced its 2025 class of ten new astronaut candidates, selected from a pool of over 8,000 applicants. The group is notable for being the first in NASA's history to include more women than men, with six women and four men making up the cohort. The diverse class includes pilots, a geologist, a biomedical engineer, and a former SpaceX launch director. These candidates will now undergo two years of intensive training to become eligible for future missions to the International Space Station, the Moon, and potentially Mars, joining the space agency during a period of budgetary uncertainty and an accelerating international space race.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England is launching a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to "think again" when a patient's condition does not improve after three consultations. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid over five months. The guidance encourages doctors to consider further actions like face-to-face appointments, additional tests, or specialist referrals to prevent avoidable deaths. The Royal College of General Practitioners supports the rule as a best practice for reviewing diagnoses when treatment plans are ineffective.</p>

          <p>China is in the process of drafting its 15th five-year plan, a strategic blueprint that will guide the nation's development from 2026 to 2030. This long-term planning is considered a "unique political advantage" by President Xi Jinping and is crucial for achieving the goal of becoming a "moderately developed country" by 2035. The new plan is being formulated amidst significant challenges, including economic headwinds at home and geopolitical tensions abroad. Experts suggest that to navigate these turbulent times, Beijing may need to prioritize flexible, qualitative goals over the rigid quantitative targets that have characterized past plans.

          <p>Police in Menlo-Atherton, California, believe they prevented a potential school shooting after receiving a tip through the "Say Something" anonymous reporting system. The tip concerned a former high school student who had posted threatening content on Instagram. Authorities quickly locked down the high school and a nearby middle school, located the student, and recovered weapons from their home. The tip line was created by Sandy Hook Promise, an organization founded after the 2012 school shooting, which reports this is the 19th credible planned school attack the system has helped prevent since its 2018 launch.</p>
