          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that U.S. tariffs are already negatively affecting Japanese firms, including automakers, but emphasized that he would not compromise Japan's interests for a hasty agreement with Washington. Speaking after the G7 summit in Canada, Ishiba highlighted the potential for tariff measures to have a serious impact on the global economy. Despite recent talks with President Trump, no tangible progress was made, and Ishiba reiterated the need for continued negotiations to address trade imbalances and economic security concerns. He also noted the importance of monitoring crude oil and gasoline prices amid escalating tensions in the Middle East. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Florida Panthers clinched their second straight Stanley Cup title with a decisive 5-1 victory over the Edmonton Oilers in Game 6, marking the NHLâ€™s first repeat champions since Tampa Bay in 2020 and 2021. Sam Reinhart's remarkable four-goal performance, including a hat-trick, ignited the crowd, while Matthew Tkachuk sealed the win. Goalie Sergei Bobrovsky's stellar performance, stopping 28 of 29 shots, stifled the Oilers' offense, and the Panthers' strong lineup depth proved too much for Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl to overcome. Florida's dominant playoff run showcased their evolution into a modern-day dynasty, and they have won 11 of 12 playoff series since Tkachuk joined the team. </p>

          <p>U.S. officials indicated that the next 24 to 48 hours are critical in determining whether a diplomatic solution with Iran is possible, or if President Trump might resort to military action. Despite heightened rhetoric, U.S. negotiators believe Iran is in a weak position and could be compelled to negotiate, potentially leading to a high-level meeting led by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Vice President JD Vance. The U.S. military is sending assets to the region, including additional aircraft and a second aircraft carrier strike group, moves officials describe as defensive. A major question is whether the U.S. will deploy its B-2 stealth bombers, capable of carrying Massive Ordnance Penetrator bunker-buster bombs, which could target Iran's underground nuclear facility at the Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant.</p>

          <p>China plans to establish an "international operations center" for the digital yuan in Shanghai, aiming to boost the renminbi's global reach, according to Peopleâ€™s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng. This measure is among eight financial policies announced at the Lujiazui Forum in Shanghai, reflecting China's efforts to expand the yuan's overseas adoption amid growing tensions with the United States. Pan emphasized the need for improvements in the traditional cross-border payment system and highlighted China's progress in building a multi-channel renminbi clearing network. The trials will include refinancing schemes using credit-based relending for foreign trade enterprises, cross-border trade refinancing with rediscount support, and an expanded green finance programme.</p>

          <p>The opening of the HS2 high-speed rail line in the UK is expected to be delayed beyond 2033, with Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander set to inform Parliament that the project cannot be delivered on schedule and within budget. Reviews into HS2 point to a "litany of failure" leading to missed deadlines and escalating costs. The original plan for HS2 was to create high-speed rail links between London and major cities in the Midlands and North of England, but the project has faced numerous challenges since its inception in 2012. Mike Brown, the former commissioner of Transport for London, is expected to be appointed as the new chair of HS2 Ltd.</p>

Lander's office stated he was taken into custody while observing court and escorting people out to prevent ICE arrests, while DHS accused him of undermining law enforcement safety.

          <p>The debate over whether the U.S. should join Israel in attacking Iran has exposed a split among President Trump's supporters, with the president reportedly considering helping target Iranian nuclear facilities. This consideration has pitted the isolationist and hawkish wings of his party against each other. Conservative Republican congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky has joined Democrats in introducing a bill to block Trump from engaging U.S. forces in unauthorized hostilities with Iran without congressional approval. Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson has called for the U.S. to stay out of the conflict, provoking a rebuke from Trump, while Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has defended Carlson.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order requiring Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals needing to renew, apply for a new passport, or change their name or sex designation to choose their identified gender, including selecting "X" on the application. The executive order, issued by President Trump, reversed a previous policy under the Biden administration that allowed for self-selection of gender. The ACLU sued the Trump administration over the policy, claiming it was discriminatory, and the judge reaffirmed that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their case.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court heard arguments regarding California's challenge to President Trump's federalization of the state's National Guard troops amid protests over immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. The judges indicated they might have limited power to rule against the president's power to deploy troops. The Trump administration argued that the court should grant a stay of a lower court's order blocking the deployment, asserting Trump's commander-in-chief powers. California argued that the federalization was an unlawful executive action, diverting guardsmen from critical work and defying state sovereignty, and the court did not issue a ruling.</p>

          <p>Companies in China's booming humanoid robotics sector are offering salaries more than three times the urban average to attract top engineers and AI talent, highlighting a deepening talent crunch. The average monthly pay for humanoid robot algorithm engineers is 31,512 yuan (US$4386), with roles requiring more than five years of experience reaching 38,489 yuan. This contrasts with a subdued hiring landscape in other sectors due to slowing economic growth and corporate earnings. Soaring pay in humanoid robotics stands out as a bright spot, even as China's job market faces pressure from a record number of graduates entering the workforce.</p>

          <p>Endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could see a resurgence in UK waters as they adapt to rising ocean temperatures, according to scientists. Researchers mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change in UK seas, with many creatures potentially finding new homes in biodiversity hotspots in the North Sea. However, some species, like the ocean quahog, may struggle to adapt, potentially impacting ecosystems and food chains. The analysis aims to guide the government in ensuring Marine Protected Areas continue to safeguard species as habitats shift due to climate change.</p>

          <p>R. Kelly was hospitalized for an overdose and claims he is the target of a murder plot within the prison where he is serving his sentence, according to his lawyer. The lawyer alleges that prison staff provided Kelly with a potentially lethal amount of medication and later forcibly removed him from a hospital against medical advice. Kelly's legal team is requesting a judge to move him to home detention, citing threats to his life and alleged cover-ups by the Bureau of Prisons. Kelly was convicted of racketeering and sexual assault in New York and child pornography in Chicago.</p>

          <p>California farmers are experiencing confusion and uncertainty as the summer harvest season begins, due to contradictory signals regarding the Trump administration's immigration enforcement policies. The state's agricultural industry, which relies heavily on undocumented labor, is concerned about potential workforce disruptions. Farmers and worker advocates have formed an unusual alliance to protect workers, and employers are seeking guidance on how to respond to immigration agents. Despite the uncertainty, workers have largely continued to show up for work, and most have returned to the fields.</p>
