          <p>Colorado Rockies relief pitcher Jimmy Herget humorously commented on his recent heavy workload by wearing a T-shirt that read, "My Arm Hurts" to a postgame press conference. This came after he was called to pitch for the fourth time in just seven days, a notable increase in frequency for a relief pitcher. Herget assured reporters that he felt fine and that the shirt was just a funny gesture, while his performance this season remains strong with a 2.73 ERA over 44 games. The lighthearted moment provided a glimpse into the physical demands placed on professional baseball players.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, briefly intensified into a powerful Category 5 storm before weakening slightly to a Category 4. The National Hurricane Center reported that the storm is undergoing an "eyewall replacement cycle," a process that can cause temporary fluctuations in intensity but may lead to re-strengthening. While its outer bands are impacting the northern Leeward Islands, the storm's core is forecast to remain at sea, passing north of Puerto Rico and avoiding the U.S. mainland. Tropical storm watches are in effect for several islands, with warnings of heavy rain and potential flooding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers are developing a hypersonic drone carrier that utilizes an innovative "scissor wing" design, a concept once explored by NASA. This design features a single, centrally mounted wing that rotates up to 90 degrees to optimize performance across different speeds. At lower speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, but as the aircraft approaches hypersonic speeds of Mach 5, the wing aligns parallel to the fuselage, turning the entire vehicle into a "waverider." This adaptable configuration aims to solve the classic aerospace challenge of balancing low-speed efficiency with high-speed stability and drag reduction.</p>

          <p>A Colorado jury has found dentist James Craig guilty of first-degree murder in the death of his wife, Angela Craig, sentencing him to life in prison without parole. Prosecutors successfully argued that Craig poisoned his wife by lacing her protein shakes with substances like arsenic and potassium cyanide, which he had researched and purchased online. The investigation began after a business partner grew suspicious of a cyanide delivery to the dental office while Angela was critically ill in the hospital. The motive was believed to be a combination of an extramarital affair and significant financial debts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An executive counselor and couples' therapist outlines five common psychological drivers that lead individuals, even those in seemingly stable relationships, to risk everything for an affair. These reasons include the pressure of always being "good" and following societal expectations, the burnout from perfectionism, a history of poor boundaries developed in childhood, and being in an abusive or emotionally withholding marriage. Additionally, a recent significant loss, such as the death of a parent, can act as a catalyst for re-evaluating life priorities and making boundaries more permeable. The article suggests that understanding these underlying issues is key to preventing such personal crises.</p>

The move comes after the president placed the city's police department under federal control, a decision that has sparked significant political pushback. Washington D.C.'s Mayor Muriel Bowser has criticized the deployment as a test of the city's limited self-governance, while protests have emerged against the increased federal presence.</p>

          <h2>Scientific Factors Behind Hurricane Erin's Rapid Intensification Explained</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Erin's rapid transformation from a tropical storm into a major hurricane is attributed to a combination of ideal atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Meteorologists explain that the storm encountered very warm sea surface temperatures, exceeding 85 degrees Fahrenheit, which provided the necessary fuel for its growth. This was compounded by low wind shear, allowing the storm's structure to remain organized and compact, which is a key ingredient for rapid intensification. The phenomenon, where a storm's wind speeds increase dramatically in a short period, is becoming more common as climate change leads to hotter oceans, fueling stronger and more dangerous hurricanes.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in Washington D.C. to protest the Trump administration's recent deployment of National Guard units and its declaration of a "crime emergency" in the city. The protest began with a rally in DuPont Circle before marching toward the White House, with participants chanting against what they see as a federal overreach and an infringement on the city's home rule. Protesters expressed concern over the legality and ethics of using troops for civil matters and disputed the administration's characterization of the city's crime levels. The demonstration followed a legal challenge by the D.C. Attorney General that successfully blocked the appointment of a federally controlled "emergency police commissioner."</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary truce, Chinese merchants selling on popular e-commerce platforms like Shein, Temu, and Amazon remain anxious about the potential for future U.S. tariffs. Many sellers view the large American market as essential for business growth due to its high traffic and relatively low barriers to entry. However, the ongoing policy uncertainty creates significant risk, as exemplified by one electronics firm that had to suspend its U.S. operations for nearly two months earlier in the year when trade tensions escalated. This persistent worry highlights the vulnerability of cross-border e-commerce to geopolitical shifts and protectionist trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, President Trump is now urging Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to agree to a peace deal with Russia, moving away from his previous focus on securing a ceasefire first. This change follows a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who reportedly presented a peace offer that would require Ukraine to withdraw from the Donbas region. In exchange, Russia would freeze the current front lines in other occupied territories. The new U.S. position has caused concern among European allies and in Kyiv, with Zelenskyy stating that Russia's refusal to agree to a ceasefire complicates any path toward a sustainable peace.</p>

The timing of the surge is particularly concerning as students return to school, coinciding with a recent controversial change in CDC policy that no longer recommends updated COVID shots for healthy children.

Key tactics include meticulously planning meals, batch cooking, and strategically organizing the fridge to use items before they expire. Many parents rely on "yellow sticker" reduced-price foods, especially for meat that can be frozen for later use, and utilize food pantries that provide surplus groceries for a small fee. These methods help families stretch their budgets and minimize food waste amidst the financial pressures of rising living costs and increased childcare expenses during the break.</p>

          <p>Despite a continuing heatwave, parts of the United Kingdom are showing signs of an early autumn, with trees shedding leaves and berries ripening weeks ahead of schedule. Experts explain this phenomenon is not a true seasonal shift but rather a stress response from nature due to the prolonged hot and dry conditions. The lack of water forces trees to conserve resources by dropping leaves, a process known as "summer branch drop," which can create safety hazards. This "false autumn" could have negative downstream effects on wildlife, as the early ripening of fruits like blackberries may disrupt the food supply for birds and other animals preparing for winter.</p>

          <p>Twenty-year-old British heavyweight Moses Itauma delivered a stunning performance, knocking out veteran Dillian Whyte in the first round of their highly anticipated bout. In his first headline fight, Itauma quickly overwhelmed the 37-year-old Whyte with powerful combinations, sending him to the canvas with a decisive right hook just 119 seconds into the match. The referee stopped the fight after Whyte managed to get back to his feet but was deemed unfit to continue. The victory extends Itauma's undefeated professional record to 13-0 and solidifies his reputation as one of boxing's most promising rising stars and a future contender for a world title.</p>

          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding globally, introducing diners to the vast and diverse regional cuisines of China beyond Westernized staples like chow mein. Driven by intense competition at home, brands specializing in fiery Hunan dishes, savory Zhejiang seafood, and other regional specialties are using cities like Singapore as a test kitchen before launching in markets across Asia, North America, and Europe. These restaurants aim to correct outdated stereotypes about Chinese food being low-brow or unhealthy by offering sophisticated, authentic dining experiences, sometimes in immersive, culturally themed settings. This culinary expansion reflects a form of soft power, potentially helping to reshape global perceptions of Chinese culture.</p>

          <p>A new box set titled "Sunset Boulevard" chronicles the final creative burst of Elvis Presley, collecting the music he recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975. This period yielded his last Top 10 hit, "Burning Love," and poignant ballads like "Separate Ways," which reflected the turmoil of his divorce from Priscilla Presley. The collection offers a look at a mature artist who had become a deeply expressive ballad singer, backed by his formidable live TCB Band. The release also sheds light on a pivotal moment of disappointment when Presley lost the co-starring role in "A Star Is Born," a career setback that friends believe contributed to his subsequent decline before his death in 1977.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old Gazan woman, identified as Marah Abu Zuhri, has died in a hospital in Pisa, Italy, less than 48 hours after being medically evacuated for severe malnutrition. She was flown to Italy with her mother as part of a program to treat critically ill patients from the war-torn enclave, but suffered a fatal cardiac arrest. The hospital reported she had experienced severe weight and muscle loss, a condition the UN has warned is becoming widespread in Gaza amid the ongoing conflict and blockade. Her death highlights the dire humanitarian crisis, as aid organizations report that famine conditions are emerging and hunger-related deaths are increasing.</p>

          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share of shipments rising from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly driven by the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold 7, which offer a new form factor compared to the traditional smartphone slab. Samsung's strategy of offering a wide range of devices at various price points, from budget-friendly models to premium foldables costing over $2,000, has also contributed to its success. In response, Apple is expected to release a slimmer iPhone and may launch its own foldable device by 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, a landmark environmental law, is under threat from legislative efforts to weaken it at a time when marine life faces unprecedented challenges. While the act has been successful in preventing extinctions and helping some species like elephant seals recover, many populations remain vulnerable. Threats such as climate change, which disrupts food chains for species like gray whales, and pollution-fueled algal blooms are causing significant mortality among dolphins and sea lions. The author contends that weakening protections to favor energy development and fishing operations is shortsighted, as the health of marine mammals is a key indicator of the overall health of the oceans.</p>
