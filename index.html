          <p>A forthcoming government consultation in England will address men's health, an area where men are more likely to die prematurely than women. Factors contributing to this include higher rates of smoking, alcohol consumption, and drug use, as well as biological factors and a lack of engagement with health services. Experts suggest addressing these disparities through targeted interventions, such as providing paid time off for health checks and tailoring services to better meet men's needs, as well as addressing the impact of deprivation and ethnic differences.</p>

An internal review in 2017 found the samples to be inadequate, but neither Gleadell nor her family were informed while she was alive.

          <p>Sarah Boardman, the artist behind the official portrait of Donald Trump that was publicly criticized by the former president, says her business is now 'in danger of not recovering.' Trump called the portrait 'truly the worst' and claimed it was 'purposefully distorted.' Boardman, who also painted a portrait of Barack Obama, says the criticism has negatively impacted her reputation and business, which has been running for over 41 years.</p>

          <p>The Israeli army has admitted that its soldiers made mistakes in the killing of 15 emergency workers in southern Gaza on March 23, though they claim some had links to Hamas. An IDF official stated that soldiers had fired on a car containing Hamas members and assumed the ambulances responding were a threat, opening fire despite the emergency team being unarmed. The IDF admits its earlier account claiming the vehicles approached without lights was inaccurate, attributing the report to the troops involved.</p>

          <p>DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has unveiled a novel method to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as anticipation builds for the release of its next-generation model. The technique, developed in collaboration with Tsinghua University researchers, combines generative reward modelling (GRM) and self-principled critique tuning. The academic paper comes amid speculation about the release of DeepSeek-R2, the successor to the firm's R1 reasoning model.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on imported goods has sparked a global trade war and drawn criticism for potentially harming the US economy. The move is seen as a rejection of globalization and a return to protectionist policies. Experts warn that the tariffs could lead to higher inflation, job losses, and a recession in the US. The long-term aim of the policy is to reduce the US trade deficit to zero.</p>
