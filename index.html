          <p>Michelle Goldberg writes in The New York Times about a controversy surrounding the Heritage Foundation's Project Esther, which aims to counter the pro-Palestinian movement in the United States. The project's fundraising pitch included an illustration that critics argue employs antisemitic tropes by depicting Jewish billionaires, like George Soros and Governor JB Pritzker, as progressive elites manipulating society. Goldberg questions the logic of Project Esther, which allows ultra-Zionist gentiles to lecture Jews about antisemitism while simultaneously undermining the liberal values that have historically supported American Jews. She also notes that Donald Trump has implemented policies aligned with Project Esther's agenda, raising concerns about the suppression of pro-Palestinian voices.</p>

          <p>According to The New York Times, Moody's recent downgrade of the United States' credit rating, citing congressional gridlock and potential fiscal plans that could increase the federal deficit, has intensified internal divisions among Republicans regarding a proposed tax and spending cut package. Fiscally conservative Republicans are using the downgrade to bolster their demands for deeper cuts to federal programs. These lawmakers are pushing for significant changes to the bill, while moderate Republicans worry that slashing social programs could jeopardize their congressional majority, creating a challenging situation for Speaker Mike Johnson as he seeks to bring the bill to a vote.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer advised investors to manage their market fears following Moody's downgrade of U.S. debt, drawing parallels to previous downgrades in 2011 and 2023. He cautioned against panic selling, suggesting that investors should view the downgrade as an early warning to invest more cautiously, rather than aggressively. Cramer proposed gold and bitcoin as hedges against government borrowing and emphasized that the people who write these downgrade reports are either fools or shrewd short sellers trying to spread fear. He reminded investors that fear must be tamed to be a successful investor. (not investment advice)</p>

Meanwhile, Japanese scientists are building Hyper-K, a larger version of their existing neutrino detector, aiming to make groundbreaking discoveries about the Universe's origin.

          <p>Following former President Joe Biden's announcement of his advanced prostate cancer diagnosis, oncology experts provided insights into the disease's progression and potential screening history. While PSA tests are not typically recommended for men over 70, they are standard during presidential physicals, leading to questions about whether Biden was screened and what the results indicated. Experts suggest several possibilities, including that Biden may have chosen to forgo screening, had normal results that failed to detect the cancer, or that the cancer developed rapidly between screenings. Despite the advanced stage, experts emphasized that recent advances have significantly improved treatment outcomes.</p>
