        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An Argentine court has declared a mistrial in the case against seven health professionals accused of negligence in the death of soccer star Diego Maradona. The decision was prompted by the recusal of one of the judges, Julieta Makintach, due to ethical concerns surrounding her participation in a documentary series about the case. The judges ruled that a new trial would be held, effectively restarting the proceedings from March 11. The case revolves around allegations that Maradona's medical team failed to provide adequate care in the weeks leading up to his death from cardiac arrest in November 2020. The new judges will be selected by lottery by a higher court.</p>

          <p>In 1950, the U.S. government made a significant error by deporting Qian Xuesen, a brilliant Chinese rocket scientist who had contributed significantly to American aerospace and weaponry. Despite helping develop America's first guided ballistic missiles and working on the Manhattan Project, Qian was deported amidst the Red Scare. Returning to China, he played a crucial role in establishing China's modern weapons program, leading to the development of missiles capable of reaching California and Moscow. The deportation is viewed as a cautionary tale about the dangers of xenophobia and its potential to alter the global balance of power.</p>

          <p>China has agreed to begin procedures to resume imports of Japanese seafood, lifting a ban imposed after the release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant. Japanese authorities expect China to issue a public notice easing the ban, which has been in place since August 2023, and to open registration for Japanese facilities processing marine products. Japan will continue to seek the removal of remaining Chinese restrictions on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures imposed after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The agreement, reached after talks in Beijing, covers businesses allowed to export to China before the wastewater discharge and may take months for shipments to begin due to registration and radiation checks.</p>

          <p>Lee Jae-myung, the left-wing presidential frontrunner in South Korea, has proposed amending the constitution to make it more difficult to impose martial law. This proposal aims to prevent political crises similar to the one that occurred after the short-lived martial law declaration by ousted conservative leader Yoon Suk Yeol in December. Lee stated that he would seek to revise the constitution to strengthen martial law requirements, such as requiring parliamentary approval within 24 hours. Early voting turnout has been high, and Lee has also called for a special prosecutor to investigate the December 3 martial law incident.</p>

He notes that sanctioning China within the Swift system could significantly damage the system itself, given China's prominent role in global trade and investment.

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily paused a lower-court ruling that struck down most of President Trump's tariffs, providing some breathing room for the administration. The Trump administration had stated that it would seek "emergency relief" from the Supreme Court if the tariff ruling was not quickly put on pause. The judgment issued by the U.S. Court of International Trade is "temporarily stayed until further notice," giving the administration time to prepare its arguments. Trump officials maintain that they have alternative options for imposing tariffs if they do not prevail in the case.</p>

          <p>A recent court decision striking down President Trump's tariffs initially gave businesses hope, but a subsequent stay of that ruling has left them in a state of uncertainty. Companies had welcomed the initial decision, but the stay has prevented them from breathing easy, as the future of the tariffs remains unclear. This situation highlights the volatility and unpredictability of trade policy under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Optimism in the global business travel sector has significantly declined this year due to tariffs and tightened border policies, according to a report by the Global Business Travel Association. Positive sentiment has dropped from 67% in November 2024 to 31% in April 2025, with many business travel buyers anticipating reductions in employee trips and spending. A third of business travel buyers said their companies have either changed, or are considering changing, policies regarding travel to or from the United States. Concerns about rising costs and visa processing problems are also prevalent, although global airfares have slightly decreased.</p>
