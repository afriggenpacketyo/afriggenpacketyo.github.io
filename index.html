          <p>A new exhibit at the National Museum of Ireland is showcasing 1,300-year-old manuscripts from the Abbey Library of St. Gall, featuring surprising doodles and notes from medieval monks. Scribed in the margins in Old Irish, these personal annotations offer a rare glimpse into the monks' daily lives, including complaints about hangovers, cold weather, and poor-quality ink. The scribbles, found in a 6th-century grammar book, provide a humorous and humanizing perspective on monastic life, with one monk even expressing anxiety about a potential Viking raid.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of State Security has issued a public warning advising citizens to be cautious when accepting souvenirs while traveling abroad, suggesting they could be equipped with hidden surveillance technology. The agency stated that items like key rings or jewelry might contain cameras, listening devices, or trackers, posing a risk of leaking state secrets. According to the ministry, state-sector employees, scholars, and students are considered prime targets for these espionage tactics. The warning aligns with China's amended counter-espionage law, which prohibits the possession of specialized spy equipment.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's new Prime Minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, has indicated she will likely pursue a fresh loan program from the International Monetary Fund, as the country faces significant fiscal needs for its defense against Russia. With an existing IMF loan expiring in 2027, new discussions are expected in August to address a projected $75 billion budget requirement over the next two years, of which only half has been secured from global donors. Separately, Ukraine's Defense Minister stated that the country needs at least $120 billion for defense spending next year, highlighting the immense financial strain of the prolonged conflict.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's government borrowing for June reached £20.7 billion, a significant increase from the previous year and higher than anticipated by economists. The rise is attributed to increased public service spending and soaring debt interest payments, which have been driven up by inflation. This development intensifies the financial pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves, with analysts suggesting that tax hikes or spending cuts may be necessary in the upcoming autumn budget to meet fiscal targets. The data points to a challenging long-term outlook for the UK's public finances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis details the widespread practice of film censorship, where Hollywood movies are altered to comply with cultural and political standards in countries like India, China, Russia, and Turkey. Censors modify content by cutting scenes, muting dialogue, or using digital effects to cover nudity or remove references to topics like homosexuality and drug use. In some cases, studios self-censor or create alternate versions to gain access to lucrative markets, such as China, which has led to criticism of compromising free expression. These modifications often disrupt a filmmaker's original vision and narrative intent.</p>

          <p>China has announced the commencement of a colossal hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, which is set to be the world's largest, with an estimated investment of 1.2 trillion yuan (US$167 billion). The announcement immediately sparked a surge in the stock prices of Chinese infrastructure, construction, and hydropower companies, with some state-owned developers hitting their daily trading limits. The project, featuring five cascade stations, will have a capacity three times that of the Three Gorges Dam, underscoring China's continued focus on massive infrastructure development.

          <p>The premier of South Australia has declared a catastrophic algal bloom a "natural disaster," as it continues to turn coastal waters toxic green and kill masses of marine life. The bloom, which began in March and is now twice the size of the capital territory, has decimated over 400 marine species and severely impacted local industries like fishing. While the state and federal governments have pledged financial assistance, the federal government has refrained from an official natural disaster designation. Experts attribute the bloom's severity to climate change factors, including ocean warming and marine heatwaves.</p>

          <p>The race to develop and commercialize solid-state batteries for electric vehicles is gaining new momentum, with major automakers like Toyota, Nissan, and Volkswagen setting production timelines before the end of the decade. These batteries promise higher energy density, improved safety, and faster charging than current lithium-ion technology. Recent progress, including the launch of semi-solid-state EVs in China, has fueled optimism. However, challenges such as high production costs and technological hurdles remain, and some analysts note that rapid improvements in existing battery technologies are weakening the investment case for the next-generation cells.</p>

          <p>An analysis examines U.S. President Donald Trump's frequent use of tariffs as a primary tool for foreign policy, often blurring the line between trade protection and punitive sanctions. Since returning to office, Trump has used tariff threats to pressure countries on issues ranging from trade deficits with China to non-trade matters like immigration and the prosecution of political allies abroad. This approach provides direct, unilateral control but creates significant uncertainty for global markets and U.S. businesses.

The measure, supported by the mayor, aims to clear sidewalks and address sanitation issues, but critics argue it is a cruel policy that displaces hundreds of residents, including families, who cannot afford the city's high housing costs.

          <p>In an opinion piece, Balkan writer Ana Schnabl critiques the tendency of U.S. and British publishers to favor stories from her region that focus on war, tragedy, and political trauma. She argues that authors from the Balkans are often expected to produce work with an explanatory or self-exoticizing value, reinforcing a narrow and often stereotypical view of the region. Schnabl contends that this unspoken condition limits the scope of translated literature, overlooking diverse stories that don't fit into a preconceived narrative of historical suffering.
