          <p>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff issued an apology for his earlier comments supporting President Trump's suggestion of deploying federal troops to San Francisco. His initial remarks, made to The New York Times, faced significant backlash from local politicians and business leaders, including the resignation of a prominent investor from the Salesforce Foundation board. Benioff clarified his belief that the National Guard is not needed to address safety concerns, emphasizing the importance of local leadership and community partnership.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Regional banks, including Zions and Western Alliance, have disclosed significant losses on loans to non-depository financial institutions (NDFIs), triggering investor concerns about hidden credit risks across the banking sector. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of potential contagion, drawing parallels to the 2023 banking crisis. The surge in NDFI lending, driven by post-2008 regulations shifting riskier activities outside regulated banks, has created an opaque loan category where losses can be sudden and severe. Analysts note that while some losses are small, their near-total wipeouts are alarming investors, prompting a hunt for transparency in these loan portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CBS News has ceased its over 60-year presence at the Pentagon after refusing to sign new press requirements that journalism associations deem a threat to First Amendment rights. The Pentagon's new policy, aimed at preventing leaks, mandates formal authorization to publish even unclassified information, a condition most major news organizations, including CBS, declined. This article emphasizes the historical significance of CBS's presence, highlighting how correspondents built trust and broke stories by being physically present in the halls. The move raises concerns about transparency and access to information regarding military affairs.</p>

          <p>A viral cooking trend suggests that food preparation methods significantly impact health and longevity, with experts highlighting the benefits of water-based cooking. High-heat methods like grilling and frying trigger the Maillard reaction, producing advanced glycation end products (AGEs) linked to inflammation, aging, and chronic diseases. Conversely, steaming, boiling, and poaching can reduce AGE formation by about 50%, while marinating with acids and using antioxidant-rich herbs further mitigates harmful byproducts. This article advises using gentler cooking techniques to lower inflammatory burdens, promoting a healthier approach to meal preparation rather than a "reverse the clock" effect.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn a lower court order blocking the deployment of National Guard members in Illinois. The Justice Department, through Solicitor General D. John Sauer, argued that the district court's decision infringes upon the President's Commander-in-Chief authority. This emergency relief request comes after a U.S. appeals court upheld the deployment block but allowed the Guard to remain under federal service.

          <p>As the government shutdown persists, student loan borrowers face uncertainty regarding their debt management, though most services continue. While monthly payments remain due, actual loan forgiveness approvals are delayed because the Department of Education's staff are furloughed. This article highlights that borrowers can still apply for repayment plans and forgiveness programs through loan servicers, but the final discharge process is on hold. The delay could have tax implications, as a federal tax-free forgiveness provision is set to expire. A lawsuit against the administration concerning forgiveness delays is also paused during the stalemate.</p>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive stance towards Venezuela, including confirming CIA covert operations and military strikes against alleged drug vessels, is drawing comparisons to past US interventions in Latin America. Experts suggest Trump's actions, aimed at quashing drug cartels and potentially ousting Nicolás Maduro, rekindle a long history of US meddling in the region. This article explores the geopolitical implications, noting that while Trump aims to resolve migration and drug issues, his approach stretches international law and raises concerns about human rights.

Nuclear submarines offer superior endurance and speed compared to traditional vessels, capable of remaining submerged for months, limited only by crew supplies. Notable examples include the UK's stealthy Astute-class, Russia's enhanced Borei-A-class ballistic missile subs, and the US's fast Seawolf-class.

          <p>Gold prices surged to a new record, topping $4,300 per troy ounce this week, driven by deepening economic uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. Factors include the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, President Trump's trade wars, and renewed Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. This article explains that gold's appeal as a "safe haven" investment increases during periods of anxiety, with silver also seeing significant gains. While some advocate gold for portfolio diversification and inflation hedging, critics caution against its volatility and the potential for sellers to profit more than investors, also noting environmental concerns from illegal mining.

          <p>Faculty at the University of Texas at Austin are concerned that entire liberal arts departments, particularly ethnic and regional studies, may be eliminated following the quiet appointment of a restructuring committee. These fears are fueled by a new state law granting administrators absolute control over university governance and the provost's manifesto criticizing "identity-studies frameworks" as ideologically imbalanced. This article highlights the lack of transparency, the exclusion of affected faculty from curriculum review taskforces, and the broader conservative efforts in Texas to reshape higher education, creating a "horrible climate" of uncertainty for professors.</p>
