          <p>The U.S. government is terminating approximately $500 million in funding for vaccine development projects utilizing mRNA technology, as announced by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The decision affects 22 projects primarily targeting COVID-19 and the flu, with HHS stating that the technology poses more risks than benefits for these viruses. This move has drawn sharp criticism from leading infectious disease experts and former health officials, who argue it undermines scientific progress and leaves the nation vulnerable to future pandemics. They highlight that mRNA technology was crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic and holds promise for treating other diseases like cancer and HIV.</p>

          <p>Apple has committed to increasing its domestic investments by an additional $100 billion over the next four years, bringing its total pledge to $600 billion. The announcement was celebrated by President Trump, who framed it as a success for his policy of encouraging companies to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. The move is seen as an effort by Apple to mitigate the impact of potential tariffs on its global supply chain, which relies heavily on overseas assembly. While Apple CEO Tim Cook noted that final assembly will remain abroad for now, the new investment will focus on expanding its U.S.-based component suppliers and creating 20,000 domestic jobs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has issued an executive order to impose an additional 25% tariff on Indian imports, raising the total rate to 50% due to India's continued purchase of Russian oil. The White House stated that India's oil imports undermine U.S. efforts to counter Russia's actions in Ukraine and pose a threat to national security. The new tariffs, set to take effect in 21 days, are expected to significantly impact key Indian export sectors like textiles and jewelry. India's foreign ministry has condemned the move as "unfair, unjustified and unreasonable," highlighting a growing divergence in interests between the two nations despite their previously strong diplomatic ties.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new plans to regulate the non-surgical cosmetic industry to protect consumers from unqualified practitioners. Under the proposed crackdown, high-risk procedures like non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs) will be restricted to qualified health professionals only. Additionally, clinics offering treatments such as Botox and dermal fillers will need to obtain a license by meeting strict safety, training, and insurance standards. The move, which follows growing concerns over dangerous practices and a number of high-profile injuries and deaths, has been widely welcomed by industry safety groups as a crucial step to enhance public protection.</p>

The bombings in August 1945 led to Japan's surrender and the end of World War II but caused the deaths of approximately 210,000 people by the end of that year. Today, both cities have been rebuilt into thriving metropolises, with landmarks like the Hiroshima Peace Memorial serving as a testament to the past. At a recent ceremony, Hiroshima's mayor expressed concern over rising global tensions, urging world leaders to learn from the tragedy and work towards peace.</p>

However, a major downward revision of 818,000 jobs occurred in August 2024, two months before the election, not after. Furthermore, the final jobs report before the election, released on November 1, showed a sharp slowdown in hiring, which Trump himself used at the time to criticize his opponent.</p>

Economists note that the 21-day window before the new tariffs take effect could provide an opportunity for negotiation.

This policy marks a significant shift, favoring punitive tariffs to incentivize domestic production over the financial incentives and tax credits offered by previous legislation. The plan is expected to be formally announced next week and would apply to all countries and companies without U.S. production facilities.</p>

          <h2>Archaeologists Find Evidence of People Resettling Pompeii's Ruins After Eruption</h2>

          <p>New archaeological research suggests that survivors of the catastrophic AD 79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius returned to live in the ruins of Pompeii. Evidence indicates that a precarious settlement, likened to a camp or favela, emerged among the debris and continued until the 5th century. It appears that some people who could not afford to relocate, possibly joined by others, reoccupied the site, living without formal city infrastructure. Researchers believe they lived on the upper floors of buried homes and salvaged valuable objects from the ruins, a chapter of the city's history that was previously overlooked by excavations focused on the well-preserved artifacts.</p>

          <p>Brian Robbins has stepped down from his role as co-chief executive of Paramount Global and head of its film studio, just one day before the company's takeover by David Ellison’s Skydance Media is finalized. The move was anticipated, as Skydance had already announced its new leadership team for the studio. Robbins, who has led Paramount Pictures since 2021, was part of a three-person CEO office that steered the company through a tumultuous period of business pressures and sale negotiations. He is credited with reinvigorating major franchises like “Top Gun,” “Mission: Impossible,” and “Sonic the Hedgehog” during his tenure.</p>

          <p>Following a visit to Moscow by a U.S. envoy, President Trump has indicated there is a "good prospect" of a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump described the talks between his envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Putin as "very good talks" and said he had briefed European allies on the progress. The White House confirmed that Russia had expressed a desire for a meeting and that Trump is open to it. This diplomatic development comes just days before a deadline set by Trump for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine or face new sanctions.</p>

          <p>This article explores how China has strategically used its control over the global supply of rare earth minerals as a powerful tool in its technological and economic rivalry with the United States. As the U.S. has imposed restrictions on semiconductor exports to slow Chinese AI development, Beijing has retaliated with export controls on these critical minerals. Rare earths are essential for a vast range of technologies, from consumer electronics to advanced defense systems, and China dominates both their reserves and refining capacity. This strategic advantage allows Beijing to exert significant pressure on global supply chains, mirroring the playbook Washington has used with its chip technology.</p>

The offering raised $868 million and gives the Texas-based company a valuation of approximately $6.3 billion ahead of its Nasdaq debut. The successful pricing reflects rising investor interest in the space technology sector, following other recent public debuts. Firefly, known for its rockets and lunar landers, recently won a $177 million NASA contract and successfully landed its Blue Ghost vehicle on the moon earlier this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) confirmed it altered the water outflow from Ohio's Caesar Creek Lake in early August following a request from the Secret Service. The adjustment was made to "support safe navigation" for Vice President JD Vance's security detail during a family boating excursion on the Little Miami River. While the USACE stated the request met operational criteria, the move has drawn criticism from ethics experts. They argue it creates an appearance of special treatment and misuse of public resources for personal recreation, especially at a time of budget cuts affecting public services like national parks.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that President Trump consistently projects his own actions onto his political opponents, particularly regarding the concept of "rigging." While Trump continues to make unsubstantiated claims that past elections were rigged against him, he is simultaneously pressuring Republican-led states to redraw congressional maps mid-decade to secure a political advantage. The article contends this behavior extends beyond elections, citing the firing of the BLS commissioner over unfavorable jobs numbers and attempts to circumvent judicial rejections of his nominees. The author concludes that Trump's actions across governance demonstrate a pattern of manipulating systems for his own benefit.</p>

          <p>The official death toll of 31 from the Eaton and Palisades fires in Los Angeles may vastly underrepresent the actual loss of life, according to new research. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. estimates that L.A. County experienced 440 more deaths than expected during the period of the fires. Researchers argue this excess mortality likely reflects the broader health impacts of the disaster, such as exposure to toxic smoke and disruptions to healthcare services. The study highlights the difficulty in attributing deaths to wildfires, as official counts often only include direct causes like burns, missing the wider public health consequences.</p>
