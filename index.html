        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing government shutdown is being fueled by a sharp partisan disagreement over health care for immigrants. The White House and Republican lawmakers claim Democrats are obstructing funding to provide free health care to immigrants in the U.S. illegally. However, Democrats deny this, stating their proposed changes to Medicaid eligibility would only restore access for specific classes of lawfully present immigrants, such as refugees and asylees, who were eligible before recent legislative changes. The core of the dispute is whether to revert to longstanding rules that allow noncitizens with some form of legal status or government protection to access Medicaid.</p>

          <p>French automaker Renault is reportedly in discussions with Chinese car manufacturer Chery to produce vehicles together in South America. The proposed partnership would involve Chery utilizing Renault's existing factories in Colombia and Argentina. In exchange, Chery would provide capital and product design, gaining access to the South American market while Renault benefits from investment in its facilities. The plans include producing combustion-engine cars in Colombia, primarily under the Renault brand, and potentially investing in a plug-in hybrid pickup truck line in Argentina. The talks are ongoing and a final agreement has not yet been reached.</p>

          <p>Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a candidate for New Jersey governor, has seen her family's net worth increase significantly since she was elected to Congress, prompting criticism from her Republican rival. Her wealth, estimated between $9.4 million and $14.6 million, is largely attributed to her husband's high-paying job as a banker and investments in exchange-traded funds and real estate, including three homes. While her opponent accuses her of profiting from her position, Sherrill's campaign states she does not own or trade individual stocks and has been transparent with her finances. The debate highlights the financial activities of lawmakers while in office.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will cancel nearly $8 billion in federal funding for clean energy projects located exclusively in states that did not vote for the president in the 2024 election. The Department of Energy confirmed the termination of over 300 financial awards, stating the projects were not economically viable and did not adequately serve national energy needs. Democratic leaders have condemned the move as purely vindictive political retaliation intended to punish political opponents during the government shutdown. The targeted states, including California and New York, have been advancing major solar and wind energy initiatives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's three largest cities have introduced new policies to ease real estate restrictions in an effort to stabilize the slumping property sector and boost the national economy. Analysts believe that stabilizing the industry is crucial for improving consumer sentiment, as real estate directly and indirectly affects numerous other sectors. However, they caution that a rapid market recovery is unlikely, and the measures may only result in short-term rebounds in specific areas.

The lawsuit alleges that agents are conducting unconstitutional workplace raids that target individuals based on their appearance and industry, rather than specific warrants or suspicion. The man, Leo Garcia Venegas, claims he was targeted because he looked Latino and was detained despite presenting a valid, state-issued ID. The suit seeks to end these enforcement tactics, which have led to the detention of multiple U.S. citizens.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's declaration of a 'war on drug cartels,' Ecuador has significantly increased its law enforcement raids and operations targeting drug trafficking networks. Although not a drug-producing country, Ecuador is a key transit point for cartels, prompting the U.S. to provide resources, technology, and military support in exchange for heightened cooperation. Ecuadorian police forces are conducting numerous raids to disrupt the supply chain at lower levels, hoping to gather intelligence that can be passed to U.S. authorities.

The executive order solidifies the security relationship between the two nations, as Qatar hosts the largest U.S. military base in the region.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. federal government initiated a shutdown after Congress failed to pass a funding bill before the fiscal year deadline. The impasse stems from a fundamental disagreement between Republicans and Democrats over health care policy. Democrats have refused to support a funding extension without securing a continuation of expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits that benefit millions of Americans. Republicans argue that these issues should be handled separately from a straightforward funding measure. This stalemate has resulted in the suspension of non-essential government services and the furloughing of approximately 750,000 federal employees without pay.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors that the market's top-performing stocks from the third quarter could offer a roadmap for the remainder of the year. He noted that fund managers often purchase recent winners in the fourth quarter to bolster their portfolios, potentially driving these stocks higher. Companies like AppLovin, Western Digital, and Seagate saw massive gains, largely driven by the AI boom and increased data storage demand. While Cramer believes these winners are a good place to be, he also cautioned that the most substantial gains for the year may have already occurred. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>A Guide to Selecting and Using Different Types of Cooking Oils</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 19:06:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article debunks common myths about cooking oils to help consumers make healthier and more practical choices. Contrary to some claims, common vegetable and sunflower oils are not unhealthy; they are low in saturated fats and high in essential polyunsaturated fats. Modern margarines are also a healthy option, as harmful trans fats have been removed from their formulation. For cooking methods, oils with high smoke points like vegetable or sunflower oil are best for deep frying, while extra virgin olive oil, with its lower smoke point, is better suited for dressings or drizzling over finished dishes.</p>

          <h2>Increased Ukrainian Drone Attacks on Russian Oil Refineries Lead to Fuel Shortages</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ukraine has significantly escalated its drone strikes on Russian oil refineries in recent months, successfully hitting 21 of the country's 38 large facilities since January. This campaign has disrupted production, leading to fuel shortages and price increases in some regions of Russia, with long queues reported at petrol stations. The attacks have targeted both large refineries crucial for civilian supply and those closer to the border used for military logistics. While the full impact on Russia's war funding is unclear, the strikes are evidently affecting the domestic fuel market and hampering Moscow's war effort.</p>

          <p>Cool Patch Pumpkins in Northern California is once again welcoming visitors to its giant corn maze, a former Guinness World Record holder for the largest of its kind. Spread across 40 acres, the maze offers a unique experience of getting lost in an era dominated by navigation technology. The owner emphasizes the excitement of disorientation, as visitors must rely on landmarks like bridges within the maze to find their way. Each year, the maze features an elaborate, hand-cut design visible from above, with this season's theme celebrating farmers. The attraction provides a popular and engaging autumn activity for families.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation has found that a UK government scheme designed to enforce employment tribunal payments is largely failing, with three-quarters of claimants never receiving the money they are owed. The report highlights the case of a woman awarded nearly £65,000 for unfair dismissal who has not seen any of the funds over a year later after her former employer's company went into administration. Data shows that of 7,000 people who used the enforcement scheme, over 5,000 did not get their payment, and not a single non-compliant employer has been publicly named by the government.</p>

          <p>A group of hackers who stole private data and images of thousands of children from the Kido Schools nursery chain have apparently backtracked following public outrage. The criminals, who had been posting profiles of children on the darknet and demanding a ransom, now claim to have deleted all the stolen information. This reversal came after they also made threatening phone calls to parents. It is understood that the nursery did not pay the ransom. While the hackers' claim to have deleted the data cannot be verified, their retreat suggests that the public condemnation of targeting children crossed a moral line.</p>

          <p>YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump over the suspension of his channel following the January 6 Capitol riot. This follows similar multi-million dollar settlements Trump reached with Meta and X over their own post-insurrection account suspensions. By settling, these tech giants are effectively conceding that their content moderation decisions were contestable, creating a precedent that could weaken their ability to enforce their own platform rules in the future. The move is seen by critics as corporate cowardice and a pivot away from the difficult work of content moderation.</p>

          <p>With the U.S. government shutdown showing no signs of ending, the White House has announced that mass layoffs of federal employees will begin within two days. Vice President JD Vance accused Democrats of instigating the shutdown for political gain, while Democrats maintain they are trying to negotiate protections for health care benefits for lower-income Americans. The impasse has left hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed, with essential employees forced to work without pay. The administration has threatened that temporary furloughs could become permanent layoffs if the funding lapse drags on.</p>

          <p>Manchester City striker Erling Haaland expressed frustration after his team conceded a last-minute penalty to draw 2-2 with Monaco in a Champions League match. Despite scoring both of City's goals, Haaland stated the team's performance was 'not good enough' and that they did not deserve to win. The result highlights a concerning trend for the team, which has now dropped points in multiple recent matches due to conceding late goals. The draw was a missed opportunity for City to improve its poor away record in European competition and secure a second consecutive win in the group stage.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren explained that Democrats allowed the government to shut down to fight against Republican-led cuts to health care. She argues that the GOP passed a measure in July that would roll back coverage for 15 million Americans to fund tax breaks for billionaires, and Democrats are now using the government funding bill as leverage to reverse those cuts. Warren dismissed Republican claims that Democrats want to fund health care for undocumented immigrants as a lie. She framed the standoff as a necessary fight to protect vital services for seniors, new mothers, and people with disabilities.</p>
