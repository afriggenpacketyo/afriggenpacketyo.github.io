          <p>Ahead of a high-stakes U.S.-Russia summit, U.S. Vice-President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy hosted a meeting of senior security officials in Kent, England, to discuss the war in Ukraine. The meeting, which took place at the request of the U.S., included representatives from Ukraine and Europe and was intended to align strategies before President Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin. This gathering underscores the effort by Western allies to present a coordinated front amid concerns that a direct U.S.-Russia deal could sideline Ukrainian and European interests.</p>

          <p>Fishermen across the Mediterranean coasts of Libya and Egypt are reporting a catastrophic decline in fish populations, threatening their only source of income. They attribute the crisis to a combination of rampant plastic pollution, which entangles their nets, and aggressive industrial trawlers that deplete fish stocks, including juvenile fish. While national and international bodies are proposing environmental plans and treaties to address the issues, local fishermen express deep skepticism, feeling that their firsthand knowledge is ignored and that promises of protection remain unfulfilled.</p>

          <p>In a peculiar diplomatic gesture, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly presented a posthumous award for the son of a senior CIA official who was killed while fighting for Russia in Ukraine. The award was given to a U.S. envoy to pass along to the family of Michael Gloss, 21, the son of CIA Deputy Director Juliane Gallina. Gloss had expressed pro-Russian views on social media before enlisting with Russian forces, and his family has stated he struggled with mental health issues, adding a tragic and bizarre layer to the ongoing geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested more than 200 demonstrators in Parliament Square for showing support for Palestine Action, a direct-action group recently proscribed under UK terrorism laws. The protest, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw scores of people simultaneously display signs with messages supporting the group, which is a criminal offense. The mass arrests occurred as Palestine Action legally challenges its proscription, arguing the ban infringes on the right to free speech and legitimate protest against companies involved with Israel's arms trade.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market experienced a strong week, with the Nasdaq composite closing at a new record high, significantly driven by a surge in Apple's stock. The tech company's shares rose over 13% after it announced a $100 billion increase to its U.S. investment pledge, a move that successfully secured an exemption from President Trump's newly announced tariffs on semiconductor imports. The article notes this pivotal development occurred amid a complex economic environment that includes new tariff threats against India and the pharmaceutical industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recently filed documents in the New Orleans Roman Catholic archdiocese's bankruptcy case reveal a detailed point system designed to determine compensation for clergy sexual assault survivors. The system assigns specific point values to different types of abuse, with sexual assault ranked highest, to distribute funds from a settlement estimated between $180 million and $235 million. However, with the final monetary value of each point uncertain, some attorneys are urging their nearly 200 clients to reject the plan, raising the possibility of its failure.</p>

          <p>World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency venture co-founded by President Donald Trump and his sons, is reportedly seeking to raise $1.5 billion to create a public company that would hold its proprietary WLFI tokens. According to a Bloomberg News report, the venture has approached major tech and crypto investors to fund the initiative. The move has intensified concerns among economists and Democratic politicians regarding the significant potential for conflicts of interest as the Trump family expands its financial stake in the loosely regulated crypto industry.

          <p>A coalition of Arab and Muslim nations, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia, has issued a joint statement strongly condemning Israel's new plan to seize control of Gaza City, labeling it a "dangerous escalation" and a "flagrant violation of international law." Concurrently, the United Kingdom announced additional aid for Gaza but demanded that Israel allow supplies to enter safely. The widespread international condemnation highlights growing opposition to the Israeli plan, which involves a new military offensive and the forcible displacement of the city's civilian population.</p>

          <p>A 3D-printed robot crab, affectionately named "Wavy Dave," met a violent end during a scientific experiment in Portugal when it was attacked and dismembered by actual fiddler crabs. Researchers were using the Bluetooth-controlled bot to study how male crabs alter their mating displays in the presence of rivals. The experiment took an unexpected turn when, after female crabs seemed to lose interest in the robot, a real male crab aggressively tore off its claw, forcing an early end to the trial but providing valuable data on competitive behavior.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long-standing mystery of the Bermuda Triangle has a simple explanation, according to Australian scientist Karl Kruszelnicki: there is no mystery at all. He argues that the number of planes and ships that have disappeared in the area is not disproportionately high when considering the sheer volume of traffic. This rational viewpoint, which has been echoed for years by organizations like NOAA and Lloyd's of London, attributes the incidents to a combination of challenging navigation, volatile weather, and human fallibility, rather than any supernatural or paranormal forces.</p>

Petunia and her owner were awarded $5,000 for winning the title, which honors dogs whose unconventional looks are a testament to the idea that a pedigree doesn't define a pet.</p>

          <p>Bestselling author Mel Robbins advises that parents must model healthy phone habits if they want to raise successful and well-adjusted children. Speaking from her own experience, she notes that scolding kids for screen time is ineffective if parents are constantly on their own devices. Robbins suggests that parents should make a conscious effort to put their phones away, especially during family time, and instead get curious about what their children are doing online, a shift that can help rebuild connection and foster better habits for everyone.</p>

          <p>The execution of Byron Black in Tennessee has been widely condemned as "botched" and "torture" after witnesses, including his attorney and journalists, reported that he groaned in agony and repeatedly said "It hurts so bad" during the lethal injection. Black, 69, was intellectually disabled, a condition that would normally prohibit execution, but a procedural loophole in state law prevented him from being protected. The horrific account of his final moments has intensified criticism of lethal injection protocols and the use of capital punishment on vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>A recent Charles Schwab survey reveals that Americans believe an average net worth of $2.3 million is needed to be considered wealthy in 2025, a slight decrease from the previous year. This benchmark varies significantly by region, with those in the West setting the bar at $3 million, while those in the South believe $1.8 million is sufficient. The survey also indicates that many people define wealth more broadly, including non-financial aspects like happiness and relationships, and feel financially comfortable with a much lower average net worth of $839,000.

          <p>America's traditional enclosed shopping malls are finding new life by replacing now-vacant anchor stores with a diverse mix of non-traditional tenants like churches, entertainment venues, hotels, and large bookstores. This strategy of subdividing sprawling retail spaces aims to transform malls into multifaceted community hubs, driving foot traffic and encouraging "cross-shopping" between different types of establishments. Recent data suggests the approach is working, with some malls attributing a significant portion of their visits to the draw of tenants like Barnes & Noble.</p>

His case underscores the Trump administration's strict immigration enforcement policies, which have been applied even to the president's own supporters who lack legal status in the country.</p>
