          <p>The families of seven living hostages released by Hamas have shared statements of profound relief and gratitude after their loved ones returned home following over two years in captivity. This emotional reunion is part of a broader Gaza ceasefire agreement that has brought a mix of elation and anguish. Concurrently, the Hostage Families Forum has expressed shock and dismay, accusing Hamas of breaching the deal by returning only a fraction of the deceased hostages' bodies as initially agreed. The group is urging the Israeli government and international mediators to take immediate action to address what they call a "grave injustice."</p>

          <p>As part of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement, the final 20 living hostages held by Hamas were returned to Israel on Monday in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. President Donald Trump addressed the Israeli Knesset before traveling to a peace summit in Egypt, where he formally signed the agreement with regional leaders, declaring that "the war in Gaza is over." While the initial phase of the deal is being implemented, with some released hostages receiving medical evaluations, Israeli officials have noted that the return of deceased hostages is proceeding slower than agreed upon, creating a point of tension.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A reverse mortgage is a financial tool for homeowners aged 62 and older, allowing them to convert a portion of their home equity into cash without needing to sell their home or make monthly mortgage payments. Borrowers can remain in their home for as long as it serves as their primary residence and they meet all loan obligations, which include paying property taxes, maintaining homeowners insurance, and keeping the property in good condition. The loan becomes due when the borrower moves out, sells the home, or passes away, at which point the balance is typically paid back through the sale of the property. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The controversy surrounding Virginia's Democratic attorney general nominee, Jay Jones, and his resurfaced texts envisioning the murder of a political rival, has become a central issue in the state's gubernatorial race. During a debate in Jones's hometown area of Hampton Roads, Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears repeatedly pressed her opponent, Abigail Spanberger, to condemn Jones and call for his withdrawal from the race. Despite the scandal, prominent local Democrats, including Virginia House Speaker Don Scott Jr., have continued to support Jones's candidacy while offering measured criticism of his comments, framing the issue as a political distraction by Republicans.</p>

          <p>Actors Julia Roberts and Ayo Edebiri are starring in the new psychological thriller "After the Hunt," directed by Luca Guadagnino, which explores the complex fallout of a sexual assault accusation within a competitive academic environment. In an interview, the stars described the film as a story about power, loyalty, and blurred truths, designed to provoke conversation and nuanced debate among viewers. Roberts plays a professor whose world is upended when her protégé, played by Edebiri, accuses a close colleague of misconduct. Both actors emphasized that the film intentionally avoids providing a clear answer, leaving the audience to grapple with the characters' competing perspectives.</p>

          <p>Following the release of all living Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, the U.S.-brokered Gaza peace plan is moving into its next, more challenging phases. Key unresolved issues include the postwar governance of Gaza, Israel's demand for Hamas to completely disarm, and the long-term prospect of a Palestinian state, which the current Israeli government opposes. The plan proposes an international body to oversee Gaza's administration and an Arab-led security force, but negotiations on these points are expected to be contentious. The success of these later stages will depend heavily on building trust and navigating deep-seated political disagreements.</p>

State police indicated the pilot may have been attempting to land at the nearby New Bedford Regional Airport.

Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Mark Kelly criticized Republicans for refusing to engage in genuine negotiations, warning that many Americans' healthcare is at risk.

While essential staff will continue to care for the animals at the zoo, public-facing services, including the popular live animal cameras, have been turned off.

The research, which reviewed existing evidence, also recommends drinking mineral water rich in magnesium over tap water and consuming 8-10 prunes daily to help improve symptoms. Dr. Eirini Dimidi, the lead author, stated that these options offer practical and accessible first steps for the one in ten people affected by chronic constipation.

Contrary to popular belief, carrying a balance does not improve your credit score; it only costs you money in interest. Another harmful misconception is that making only the minimum payment is an effective debt management strategy, when in reality it can take decades and thousands of extra dollars to pay off the principal. Furthermore, closing old credit card accounts can actually harm your credit score by increasing your credit utilization ratio and shortening the length of your credit history.

          <p>TikTok influencer Harrison Sullivan, known as HSTikkyTokky, has been arrested after being wanted by Surrey Police for almost a year. The 24-year-old failed to appear in court following a crash in March 2024, where the driver of a McLaren supercar reportedly left the scene. Sullivan, who had been posting social media videos from Qatar while on the run, was arrested on Friday for failing to appear on a dangerous driving charge. He has been remanded in custody and faces additional charges, including failing to stop after an accident and driving without insurance.</p>

          <p>In a historic address to the Israeli Knesset, U.S. President Donald Trump celebrated the newly brokered ceasefire, telling lawmakers that "the long and painful nightmare is finally over" for both Israelis and Palestinians. The speech coincided with the release of the final 20 living hostages held by Hamas. Trump, who received standing ovations, described the deal as a challenging but monumental breakthrough and positioned it as the dawn of a new, more peaceful Middle East. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu introduced Trump as the "greatest friend" Israel has ever had, crediting his re-election for changing the course of the conflict.</p>

          <h2>Reports Indicate Hundreds of CDC Employee Firings Have Been Rescinded Amid Shutdown Chaos</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 11:48:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The firings of hundreds of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), issued as part of the ongoing government shutdown, have reportedly been reversed. The initial layoff notices affected numerous "non-essential" staff, including members of the Epidemic Intelligence Service, known as "disease detectives." A senior administration official attributed the mistaken firings to "incorrect notifications" caused by a "coding error." The reversal comes amid significant turmoil at the agency and criticism from public health experts, who argue the chaotic process has compromised U.S. health security and created an abusive work environment for staff.</p>

          <h2>Scottish First Minister Announces Plan for New Network of Walk-In GP Services</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 11:40:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At the SNP conference, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney announced a new plan to create a network of walk-in GP services across the country, aiming to deliver one million additional appointments. The proposed sites would operate seven days a week from noon to 8 p.m., staffed by GPs and nurses, to alleviate the "08:00 rush for appointments" that currently strains existing surgeries. Swinney stated that the first of these new facilities would be operational within a year. The announcement was a key part of his speech, where he also criticized the Westminster government and reiterated his party's commitment to pursuing Scottish independence.</p>
