          <p>Air quality alerts have been issued across several U.S. states, including Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut, due to smoke from Canadian wildfires. The smoke is expected to spread across the country, with maps showing the forecast movement through Friday morning. Over 200 fires are currently burning in Canada, with more than half considered out of control, leading to the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents across three provinces. While smoke may be visible in other areas, its impact on air quality may be minimal, such as in Maryland, where hazy skies are expected at high altitudes. The situation is being closely monitored as authorities work to manage the effects of the wildfire smoke on public health. </p>

          <p>Daniel Park, from Kent, Washington, was arrested at JFK airport for allegedly sending 180 pounds of ammonium nitrate to Guy Edward Bartkus, who detonated a car bomb outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California. The explosion, which injured four people and killed Bartkus, is being investigated as an act of terrorism due to Bartkus' writings expressing disapproval of childbirth and advocating for human extinction. Authorities stated that Park and Bartkus had conducted experiments together and were part of an anti-natalism movement. Park had traveled to Denmark and Poland after the explosion but was detained by Polish authorities and returned to the U.S., where he was arrested, with the FBI noting the explosive recipe found in his possession was similar to the Oklahoma City bombing. </p>

Education Secretary Linda McMahon said Columbia's leadership acted with indifference toward the harassment of Jewish students after the October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel.

          <p>Elon Musk has strongly criticized President Donald Trump's proposed tax-cut bill, claiming it will lead to "debt slavery" for America. Musk has encouraged citizens to contact their senators and congressmen to oppose the bill, suggesting it would massively increase the deficit and raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion. This criticism follows Musk's recent departure from the Trump administration, where he briefly led the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's opposition is partly due to the bill's elimination of an EV tax credit that benefits Tesla, though he is also citing concerns about the national debt. </p>

Soliman is charged with a federal hate crime and attempted murder for attacking a group demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza, while his family members have not been charged. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem stated that the family was being processed for removal proceedings, prompting the lawsuit by the family's attorneys who argued against punishing individuals for the crimes of their relatives.</p>

The aim is to transform warehouse robots into flexible, multi-talented assistants, which builds on Amazon's previous AI initiatives, including a web browser-based agent and the Alexa+ update with agentic capabilities.

Critics argue this move undermines the separation of powers and could harm democratic rule, while President Claudia Sheinbaum hails the election as a victory of democracy over corruption.

          <p>The Trump administration is developing a plan to impose time limits on federal rental subsidies and add work requirements as a condition of funding, according to an internal document from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This rule would vastly expand the number of local housing authorities able to impose such restrictions, potentially affecting millions of people who receive federal housing assistance. While supporters argue that time limits could spread limited aid among more people, housing policy experts express concerns about the devastating impact on families and the lack of evidence that such policies increase employment or help people move off subsidies.

Police investigation revealed the children were unsupervised at the time, leading to the parents' arrest, while the 76-year-old driver of the Jeep involved has not been charged, as there is no evidence of speeding or wrongdoing.

Apple must end practices designed to circumvent the injunction, including a new 27% fee Apple imposed on app developers when its customers complete an app purchase outside the App Store, and the court also prohibited Apple from restricting where developers place links to make purchases outside of an app. Epic Games argued that Apple was trying to continue evading competition and collecting fees that the judge had barred.</p>

Lawyers from the Attorney General's office defended the CPUC's decision, arguing that the credits given to rooftop panel owners were resulting in a "cost shift" to non-solar owners, raising electric bills.

The call occurred amidst floundering U.S.-brokered peace talks, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pushing Trump to impose sanctions on Moscow. Meanwhile, both Ukrainian and Russian officials provided conflicting accounts of progress in negotiations, with Ukraine accusing Russia of stalling and manipulating the process.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has threatened to pull billions of dollars in federal funding from California's high-speed rail project, citing mismanagement, waste, and escalating costs. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy released a compliance review report stating the project is in default of its federal grant terms and lacks a "viable path" to completion. The state has 30 days to provide documentation demonstrating compliance, while the California high-speed rail authority strongly disagreed with the FRA's conclusions. The project, initially approved by voters in 2008, has faced numerous delays and cost increases, with the current focus on a 171-mile stretch in the Central Valley.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is assessing the implications of Operation Spider's Web, the assault on Russia's strategic aviation, with the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) releasing footage of the attacks. The SBU claims that 41 aircraft were damaged or destroyed, with half beyond repair, and the operation took a year and a half to prepare. The footage reveals details of the drones targeting Russian bombers, transport aircraft, and AWACS, while Russia has remained largely silent on the matter. Experts suggest the loss of A-50 AWACS aircraft could be a strategic problem for Russia, and the operation demonstrates Ukraine's ability to strike deep into Russian territory. </p>

          <p>The EU has called on China to cease restricting the export of rare earth minerals and magnets, citing an "alarming situation" for European industries. This request was made during a meeting between top commerce officials from both sides in Paris, as sectors across Europe raise concerns about a shortage of rare earths used in manufacturing high-tech goods. China, which supplies around 90 percent of the world's rare earth minerals, introduced export controls in April in response to U.S. tariffs, impacting firms globally and prompting calls for a resolution to prevent production halts.</p>

          <p>Despite the war in Ukraine, Russian fertilizer has become increasingly important to European agriculture, with Russia's share of EU fertilizer imports growing from 17% in 2022 to about 30% currently. The EU has largely cut out Russian oil and gas from its import list, but it has ramped up its purchases of the country's fertilizer since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. The European Parliament endorsed the European Commission's proposal to introduce a 6.5% tariff on fertilizers imported from Russia and Belarus, and the plan is to continue ramping up the tariffs to 50% by 2028. While the EU wants to move in the direction of developing fertilizer processed from animal dung and urine, farmers' groups are not happy because they feel the EU has not done enough to develop realistic, affordable alternatives to Russian fertilizer. </p>

          <p>Hundreds of arrests were made across 28 states in a coordinated effort to curb organized retail theft, involving over 100 law enforcement agencies and 30 major retailers. Retailers played a key role by providing critical information on criminal activity, as organized retail crime involves coordinated theft operations that often resell stolen goods for profit. The initiative follows a spike in shoplifting incidents and financial losses reported by retailers, with felony charges being pursued when the value of stolen goods exceeds $300 or when suspects have prior felony shoplifting convictions. Officials say this focused approach aims to deter such conduct through prosecution and serious consequences.</p>

          <p>Sean Penn and Dustin Lance Black have condemned the decision to remove Harvey Milk’s name from a navy ship, calling it a move to fuel culture wars. The order to rename the USNS Harvey Milk, christened in San Diego in 2021 for the prominent gay rights and navy veteran, was part of an internal memo that was leaked on Tuesday. The Pentagon’s chief spokesperson confirmed that the ship’s new name “will be announced after internal reviews are complete”. Black and Penn see the move as a petty and small-minded act, and call on the LGBTQ+ community to unite and take action in response.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has proposed a solution to President Donald Trump's efforts to strip federal civil servants of job protections by neutralizing agencies that implement these safeguards. With the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) unable to operate due to Trump's firings, the court suggests that federal courts should pick up the slack and hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants. The court argues that the exclusive authority of the MSPB over civil service disputes only holds when the statute functions as Congress intended, and if the MSPB cannot fulfill its role, the courts should intervene. This decision aims to close a legal loophole that has left civil servants unprotected and address a problem partly created by the Supreme Court's embrace of the "unitary executive" theory.</p>

A United Nations convoy carrying food to El Fasher was attacked, resulting in the deaths of five UN staff and the destruction of supplies meant for families in need. The conflict has displaced nearly 13 million people, leading to what the UN calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with millions facing acute hunger.

HHS and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) rescinded the guidance, as well as an accompanying letter from former HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, saying they "do not reflect the policy of this Administration."

However, the forecast includes caveats, such as uncertainty about the impact of such large-scale tariffs and the possibility of lower revenues if imports are discouraged more than expected. Forecasters also project that the tariffs will lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, with the CBO still assessing which income groups would be most affected.
