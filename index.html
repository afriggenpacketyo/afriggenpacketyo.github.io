            <p>The Federal Trade Commission is suing Uber, alleging that the ride-hailing company engaged in deceptive billing and cancellation practices related to its Uber One subscription service. The FTC claims Uber misled consumers about the benefits of Uber One, made it difficult to cancel memberships, and charged users without their consent. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson stated the agency is fighting back against unwanted subscriptions on behalf of consumers. Uber One, launched in 2021, offers perks like fee-free delivery and discounts for a monthly or annual fee.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's economic approval rating has fallen to its lowest point, according to a CNBC survey, amid discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending. Economic optimism following Trump's reelection has waned, with more Americans expecting the economy to worsen and pessimism increasing about the stock market. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents are increasingly negative about his economic policies. The survey highlights concerns about tariffs, inflation, and federal spending, while immigration remains a strong point for Trump.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case challenging the authority of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (PSTF), which mandates insurance coverage for preventative care. Republican Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett indicated they might side with the court's Democrats to uphold the PSTF. The case hinges on whether PSTF members are properly classified as "inferior officers" supervised by a Senate-confirmed official. A ruling against the PSTF could allow insurers to deny coverage for treatments like cancer screenings and HIV-prevention drugs.</p>

The tariffs may impact cash generation and deliveries, while China's importance as a key market for aircraft sales underscores the potential long-term damage.</p>

            <p>The US supreme court is hearing arguments today in a case that could threaten Americans’ access to free preventive healthcare services under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.  At issue is the constitutionality of the US preventive services taskforce, which plays a critical role in determining which preventive services health insurers must cover without cost to patients.  If the justices uphold the lower court’s ruling, health associations said in a filing, life-saving tests and treatments that have been cost-free would become subject to co-pays and deductibles, deterring many Americans from obtaining them.</p>
