          <p>Following the shooting of two Israeli Embassy staffers near the Capital Jewish Museum, questions are being raised about the adequacy of security measures at the event. While private security officers were present, no on- or off-duty MPD officers were there. Former officials emphasize the need for heightened security at faith-based communities due to increased threats. Investigators are reviewing writings attributed to the suspect, Elias Rodriguez, which appear to call for violence against Israelis and express support for the Palestinian cause. The incident has prompted increased security measures in the area and nationwide. </p>

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar blamed the attack on incitement from various countries, particularly in Europe, leading to a swift rejection from France.

          <p>This article reflects on the shooting of two Israeli Embassy staffers outside the Capital Jewish Museum in D.C., highlighting the dangerous political climate and the potential for increased violence. It notes that this event follows a pattern of pro-Palestine activists attempting political violence, fueled by extremist rhetoric that normalizes such actions. The article argues that this violence endangers the chances for peace in Gaza by shifting the focus away from Israeli actions and onto the American pro-Palestine movement, making it less likely that the U.S. government will restrain Israel. The author emphasizes the importance of condemning violence and promoting democratic activism. </p>

          <p>Joe Kent, President Trump's nominee to head the National Counterterrorism Center, is facing scrutiny over emails showing he pushed for edits to an intelligence assessment on links between the Venezuelan government and the criminal gang Tren de Aragua (TDA). Kent sought to align the assessment more closely with Trump administration policies and include references critical of Biden-era immigration programs. The final memorandum stated that the Maduro regime likely does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA, a point of contention given the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport suspected gang members. Democrats have raised concerns about Kent's attempt to politicize intelligence. </p>

          <p>President Trump's proposal for a "gold card" offering permanent residency to wealthy individuals in exchange for a US$5 million investment has failed to attract significant interest from wealthy Chinese. Despite the seemingly reasonable investment requirement compared to similar programs in other countries, concerns about the US-China trade war and urban crime levels have deterred potential applicants. China has experienced a significant outflow of millionaires in recent years, but wealthy Chinese are hesitant to invest in the U.S. due to safety and economic concerns. </p>

          <p>Microsoft employees are expressing concern over the company's alleged blocking of Outlook emails containing terms such as "Palestine," "Gaza," and "genocide." Employees report that emails with these terms are not being sent, even when used in HR complaints. Microsoft has stated that emails are not being blocked unless sent to large distribution groups, but employees claim the issue persists even with small, work-related emails. Some suggest manual reviews are occurring before emails are delivered, leading to delays. </p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has signed an agreement to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, while simultaneously securing the future of a strategically important U.S. military base. The deal allows the U.K. to continue leasing Diego Garcia, the largest island, for at least 99 years, maintaining the military facility in British and American hands. The agreement follows a lengthy dispute over the islands, involving questions over Britain's colonial legacy. The move has garnered mixed reactions, with some Chagossians supporting the deal and others criticizing it for not securing their right to return to their homeland. </p>

The Justice Department argues that the agreement has hampered the executive branch from effectively setting immigration policy and incentivized illegal border crossings. Attorneys representing migrant children argue that eliminating the settlement's protections would grant the government unchecked power to imprison children indefinitely in secret facilities.
