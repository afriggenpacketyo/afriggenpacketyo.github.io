        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The shares of dual-listed Chinese companies traded in Hong Kong are now at their smallest discount compared to their mainland counterparts in nearly five years. This convergence is driven by a weaker U.S. dollar, which is encouraging global investors to diversify into the Hong Kong market, and a surge of mainland investors seeking exposure to China's leading tech firms. Analysts remain optimistic about Hong Kong stocks, citing their relatively low valuations and the anticipated benefits from global capital reallocation and future interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve.

          <p>The BRICS group of emerging economies is striving to evolve from a strategic partnership into a significant geopolitical force capable of challenging Western dominance. At its recent summit, the bloc condemned coercive economic tactics and promoted de-dollarization, signaling a move against U.S. unilateralism. However, this article argues that internal contradictions and diverging interests among member nations, such as India's balancing act and Brazil's pragmatic diplomacy, continue to undermine its coherence. The bloc's future depends on its ability to overcome these fractures and become a true alternative to the G7.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 04:20:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Communist Party has issued a directive aimed at enhancing the country's legal system to more effectively challenge foreign sanctions, particularly those imposed by the United States. The new guidance focuses on improving the application of international treaties and establishing a sophisticated system for understanding and engaging with foreign laws. This move is part of a broader strategy to protect China's national interests and judicial sovereignty. The plan seeks to refine the judicial toolkit for responding to trade and technology restrictions placed on Chinese companies by Western nations.</p>

          <p>Reddit is introducing mandatory age verification in the United Kingdom to prevent users under 18 from accessing mature content, ahead of the new Online Safety Act regulations. The social media platform will use a third-party firm, Persona, to verify age through selfies or government-issued IDs. While UK regulator Ofcom supports the move to better protect children online, critics express concerns about data privacy and the potential for circumvention. Civil liberties advocates have described the law as a "tragedy" for user anonymity on the internet.</p>

          <p>In a BBC interview, U.S. President Donald Trump stated he is "disappointed but not done" with Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding the war in Ukraine, announcing plans to send more weapons to Kyiv. Trump expressed frustration that peace talks have repeatedly failed, with Russian escalations following their conversations, and threatened severe tariffs if a ceasefire is not reached. He also reversed his previous skepticism of NATO, endorsing the alliance and its common defense principle. Additionally, the president commented positively on UK relations and his own domestic achievements since his second term began.</p>

          <p>Following a Department of Justice memo confirming Jeffrey Epstein's death as suicide and finding no "client list," Prince Andrew is reportedly free to travel without fear of legal action. However, royal experts assert that he remains a significant embarrassment to the royal family and is unlikely to regain public favor or his former status. Despite his legal freedom, the prince's reputation is considered permanently damaged by his association with Epstein and his widely criticized "Newsnight" interview.

The trend is placing increasing pressure on the national healthcare system, which is already grappling with economic challenges and a decrease in public trust. Overall, China's basic medical insurance coverage saw a net decrease of over 7 million people.</p>

          <p>A senior Russian security official, former President Dmitry Medvedev, has publicly dismissed U.S. President Donald Trump's threat of sanctions as a "theatrical ultimatum" that Russia "didn't care" about. Trump had announced potential 100% secondary tariffs on buyers of Russian exports, like crude oil, if a peace deal in Ukraine is not reached within 50 days. The statement from Medvedev underscores Russia's defiant stance in the face of escalating U.S. pressure.

The move, which has support from some members of Congress, aims to use a powerful economic "sledgehammer" to force Russia to the negotiating table.

          <p>The availability of Ireland wing Mack Hansen for the British and Irish Lions' first Test match against Australia is in doubt due to a foot injury. Conflicting and confusing statements from the Lions' coaching staff have created uncertainty, with one coach admitting anyone who didn't fully train on Tuesday is a "doubt" for the match. This situation has reportedly expedited the call-up of Scotland's Darcy Graham to ensure the squad has adequate cover. The secrecy and mixed messages from the Lions camp are part of a tour focused squarely on winning, adding to the tension ahead of the crucial series opener.</p>

          <p>UK Finance Minister Rachel Reeves is set to deliver a crucial speech where she is expected to address the country's widening budget deficit and outline plans to stimulate economic growth. Investors are looking for signals on how the government will manage public finances, with UK debt currently near 100% of GDP. Reeves is anticipated to announce an overhaul of the pensions system to address rising costs but has committed to maintaining the expensive "triple lock" protection. With limited options for raising revenue, there are fears in the financial sector that the Treasury may increase taxes on banks or wealthy individuals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is introducing a new grant scheme to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs), offering buyers discounts of up to £3,750 on eligible cars costing less than £37,000. The £650 million program aims to make zero-emission cars more affordable as the country moves toward its 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. While the automotive industry has welcomed the move, some argue that the primary barrier to EV adoption is the insufficient number of public charging points, not just the initial purchase price. The government has also recently pledged investment to expand the charging network.</p>

His departure is described as "quite sudden" and is expected to create a significant void within the EU's China policymaking apparatus.

          <p>A major abuse scandal at Muckamore Abbey Hospital in Northern Ireland was exposed when police discovered that a CCTV system, believed to be off, had been recording for six months. The 300,000 hours of footage revealed what police described as 1,500 "crimes" in a single ward, including staff punching, kicking, and neglecting severely disabled adult patients. Despite the discovery almost eight years ago, no cases have yet gone to trial, and families have not been allowed to see the footage. The case is now the UK's largest adult safeguarding investigation, prompting calls for mandatory CCTV in care facilities.</p>

          <p>A BBC news correspondent provides a behind-the-scenes account of the two trials of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon, describing the proceedings as extraordinary and chaotic. The couple, who were fiercely united and openly affectionate in the dock, showed contempt for the court process, causing constant delays by sacking numerous lawyers and refusing to attend sessions. The reporter details their disruptive behavior, which the judge at one point called a "deliberate attempt to sabotage" the trial. This personal reflection highlights the unusual and often "jaw-dropping" nature of a case that concluded with both defendants being found guilty of their baby's manslaughter.</p>

Authorities have paused most rescue crews and lowered the number of unaccounted for people to 101. The disaster, which primarily affected a children's summer camp, has sparked criticism over the county's lack of a flash-flood warning system and has prompted the governor to call a special legislative session to investigate the emergency response.

Despite being the best player from tee to green, Scheffler's performance on the greens was poor until he sought help in late 2023. Kenyon helped him with green reading, his grip, and, most crucially, a switch to a mallet-style putter, which sparked a remarkable turnaround. Within a year, Scheffler won seven PGA Tour events, including his second Masters and an Olympic gold medal, solidifying his position as the world's most dominant player.</p>
