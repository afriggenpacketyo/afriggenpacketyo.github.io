          <p>Esther Ngumbi recounts her upbringing in Kenya, where her mother, Bertha, a teacher, instilled a strong work ethic in her and her siblings to escape poverty. Bertha sacrificed personal pleasures to ensure her children received an education, often going hungry to pay their school fees. Ngumbi, now a professor, appreciates the values her mother instilled, which led to her earning a Ph.D. and becoming the first girl from her community to achieve this milestone. Ngumbi shares a conversation with her mother, exploring the reasons behind her strict parenting and the sacrifices she made for her children's future. The article highlights the lasting impact of a mother's determination and selflessness in shaping her children's lives.</p>

          <p>Despite an agreement between India and Pakistan to halt military actions, overnight fighting has erupted in the disputed Kashmir region. Both sides reported heavy exchanges of fire across the Line of Control, causing trauma and uncertainty among residents. The ceasefire, brokered after escalating tensions and a tourist massacre, aimed to end decades of conflict. While U.S. President Donald Trump initially announced the deal, India has remained silent on U.S. involvement. The two countries' top military officials are scheduled to discuss the situation further, but the recent violence casts doubt on the truce's durability, as the two armies have engaged in daily fighting since Wednesday along the rugged and mountainous Line of Control, each routinely blaming the other for starting the skirmishes while insisting they were only retaliating.</p>

          <p>A recent terrorist attack in Kashmir sparked a rapid escalation between India and Pakistan, leading to unprecedented aerial clashes and strikes deep into each other's territory. The conflict involved new-generation technology, including drones and missiles, raising concerns about noncontact warfare and potential loss of restraint. Despite conflicting reports on casualties and damage, the situation escalated to an air war with few holds barred, alarming the United States and prompting diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire. The New York Times article highlights the dangers of rapid escalation between nuclear powers and the potential for miscalculation in modern warfare, where technology can initially suggest more precision targeting and less human cost but in reality it prompts a cycle of escalation.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has responded diplomatically to Vladimir Putin's offer of direct talks in Istanbul next Thursday, despite the lack of commitment to a 30-day ceasefire. Zelensky called it a "positive sign" that Russia is considering ending the war, but emphasized Ukraine's expectation of a confirmed ceasefire starting on Monday. The article notes that both Putin and Zelensky are mindful of appearing as obstacles to peace in the eyes of U.S. President Donald Trump, whose reaction to the offer was optimistic.

          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant surge on May 10 after President Donald Trump announced a "total reset" in relations with China. Bitcoin briefly neared $105,000, and Ethereum approached $2,600 following Trump's statement on Truth Social, though both retreated somewhat afterward. The high-level trade talks in Geneva, Switzerland, mark the first meeting between officials since tariff hikes in April. Trump's vague announcement spurred market optimism, though details remain scarce, and the impact on trade relations is uncertain.</p>

The breakthrough was achieved using major computational methods that could be applied to other problems in the field. This discovery proves the existence of manifolds of Kervaire invariant one in dimension 126, resolving a long-standing mystery in mathematics. The Kervaire invariant is a function that measures whether a smooth framed manifold can be converted into a sphere through surgery.</p>

          <p>Elissa Strauss argues that motherhood should be viewed as a Hero's Journey, challenging the traditional narrative that prioritizes independence and external adventures. She contends that caring for another person can be an epic undertaking, filled with life-altering trials and triumphs that lead to profound insights. By reframing motherhood in this way, Strauss seeks to elevate the value of caregiving and challenge the simplistic binaries often applied to mothers. She also proposes that recognizing care as a Hero's Journey could encourage greater investment in long-term connections and provide more practical support for parents and caregivers.</p>
