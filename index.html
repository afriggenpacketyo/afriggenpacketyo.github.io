            <p>China's consumer prices declined for the second consecutive month, signaling rising deflationary pressures as the country grapples with an escalating trade war with the U.S. Producer prices also fell for the 29th straight month, reflecting weakening external demand and uncertainties surrounding oil prices. Despite these challenges, Chinese policymakers are prioritizing boosting domestic consumption through subsidies and other initiatives, aiming to achieve an ambitious growth target of around 5%. However, some economists caution that fiscal spending is still largely devoted to expanding the supply side of the economy, which may exacerbate downward pressure on prices.

            <p>Amazon delayed the launch of its first Kuiper internet satellites due to poor weather conditions in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The United Launch Alliance rocket carrying 27 Kuiper satellites was scheduled to lift off, but the launch was postponed due to cumulus clouds and heavy winds. Amazon is competing with SpaceX's Starlink in the market for high-speed, low-latency internet. The company must launch half of its constellation by July 2026 to meet FCC requirements.</p>

            <p>Elon Musk's xAI is facing criticism for allegedly using 35 methane gas-burning turbines to power its supercomputer in Memphis without proper permits. The Southern Environmental Law Center claims the generators are illegal and a major source of air pollution, violating the Clean Air Act. The area surrounding the xAI facility is historically Black and has higher rates of cancer and asthma. The group is calling for an emergency order to cease the use of the generators.</p>

The US claims this is necessary to counter China's unfair trading practices. The US has not sent representatives to the summit since 2023.</p>

            <p>President Trump's trade war has shifted its focus to China, with a 90-day pause on higher tariffs for most countries but a significant increase in tariffs on Chinese goods. This move signals a more targeted approach to challenging China's economic practices. The outcome depends on whether China is willing to negotiate and make major concessions, including overhauling its export-driven economic model. The US's commitment to free trade also remains a key question.</p>
