          <p>International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi emphasized the urgent need for diplomatic solutions and de-escalation in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran during an emergency board meeting. Grossi highlighted the importance of allowing IAEA inspectors access to Iranian nuclear sites to properly assess the damage resulting from recent Israeli and U.S. attacks, particularly at the Fordo facility. He noted that the full extent of underground damage remains unknown, but significant damage to vibration-sensitive centrifuges is expected given the explosive payload used. Calm is crucial to enable the agency to fulfill its monitoring role and ensure transparency in Iran's nuclear activities. The IAEA is committed to verifying Iran's compliance with its nuclear obligations and preventing further escalation. Optimism is relatively low given the gravity of the situation.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting announced a national investigation into maternity care in England following a series of maternity scandals at NHS trusts. The "rapid" inquiry will focus on the worst-performing maternity and neonatal services, aiming to provide truth and accountability to families who have suffered avoidable harm. Streeting apologized on behalf of the NHS for the failures in maternity care and emphasized the need to prevent such incidents from happening again. The inquiry, set to begin this summer and report back by December 2025, will involve victims of maternity scandals to ensure their voices are heard and lasting change is implemented. The focus on accountability and systemic improvement aims to restore confidence in maternity services and ensure safer outcomes for both parents and babies. The establishment of this inquiry demonstrates a commitment to addressing past failings and preventing future harm.</p>

          <p>A Vox report delves into the conflicting research surrounding alcohol consumption, clarifying what constitutes moderate drinking and its potential health impacts. The report highlights the widespread agreement that heavy drinking is detrimental to health, while the safety of small amounts of alcohol remains debated. Experts emphasize that many people underestimate what qualifies as moderate drinking, leading to unintentional overconsumption. The piece underscores that public health officials aim to better educate people about the risks of alcohol, particularly its carcinogenic properties and potential for dependency. The goal is to promote informed decision-making regarding alcohol consumption, advising against starting drinking for health benefits while urging awareness of the risks associated with excessive intake.</p>

          <p>Liu Yuejin, Chinaâ€™s first counterterrorism commissioner, was sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve for accepting bribes exceeding 121 million yuan. The Fuzhou Intermediate Peopleâ€™s Court in Fujian province also ordered the confiscation of Liuâ€™s personal properties and the return of his illegal gains to the state. Liu was found guilty of exploiting his positions from 1992 to 2020 to aid businesses in exchange for illicit payments, causing significant losses to the state and the public. The court granted a lighter punishment due to Liu's admission of guilt, repentance, and active efforts to return the illicit funds. Under Chinese law, a suspended death sentence can be commuted to life imprisonment if no further crimes are committed during the reprieve period, or reduced to 25 years for significant contributions such as crime prevention.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance clarified that the U.S. is not at war with Iran but with "Iran's nuclear program," following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that Iran's "nuclear ambitions have been obliterated" after the strikes on facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi responded that Iran reserves the right to defend itself, raising concerns about regional escalation. Vance emphasized that the U.S. desires peace but insists on preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, stating that the strikes substantially delayed Iran's nuclear weapon development. Despite officials touting the mission's success, the extent of the damage and Iran's remaining nuclear capacity remain uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has proposed a plan to allow non-domiciled residents in the UK to avoid many UK taxes by paying a Â£250,000 annual fee. Under this plan, non-doms would receive a "Britannia Card" exempting them from taxes on wealth, income, and capital gains earned abroad, as well as inheritance tax. Farage argues this policy would attract talented individuals and entrepreneurs to the UK, boosting the economy. Critics, including Labour Chancellor Rachel Reeves, have denounced the proposal as a tax cut for foreign billionaires, arguing it would necessitate raising taxes or cutting public services. Reform UK estimates the policy could generate Â£1.5bn to Â£2.5bn annually, which would be distributed to the lowest-paid 10% of full-time workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amidst escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, President Trump hinted at potential regime change in Iran following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Israel has expanded its targets to include sites linked to the Iranian regime's domestic authority, such as Evin Prison and the headquarters of the Basij paramilitary forces. Iranian missiles struck several locations in Israel, causing disruptions to electricity supply and sending residents to bomb shelters. While Trump claimed that U.S. strikes had "totally obliterated" Iranian nuclear sites, the IAEA suggested Iran may have moved some enriched uranium beforehand. Concerns continue to mount as Iran's foreign minister seeks support from Russia, and the U.S. State Department advises increased caution for Americans traveling abroad.

          <p>The average price of rice in Japan has fallen below 4,000 yen per 5 kilograms, reaching 3,920 yen, the lowest since early March, due to increased distribution of stockpiles. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi attributed the price drop to the government's release of additional rice reserves, indicating that the government's message is proving effective. The market share of blended rice, including reserve rice, has risen to 50 percent. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba aims to reduce the average retail price of 5 kg of rice to the 3,000 yen range by the end of June. While the price has decreased, it remains nearly double that of a year earlier, and core consumer prices in May rose significantly due to surging rice costs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has called for international efforts to de-escalate the conflict between Iran and Israel, warning of potential damage to the global economy. The concern stems from Iran's threat to block the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial shipping route for global oil and gas flows. A blockade could lead to a significant increase in energy prices and trigger a global energy and trade crisis. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun emphasized the strategic importance of the Persian Gulf region for global trade and energy security. The call for de-escalation follows U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and a measure approved by Iran's parliament to close the Strait of Hormuz. The situation is being closely monitored due to its potential to destabilize global markets and international relations.</p>

Her husband, Adrian Clouatre, expressed disbelief and frustration, stating that they were trying to "do the right thing" by pursuing legal channels for her green card application. The detention occurred after a staffer inquired about a deportation order from 2018, leading to her arrest by ICE officers.

          <p>Iran's parliament has approved a measure to potentially close the Strait of Hormuz following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, a move that risks alienating its neighbors and trade partners. Experts suggest that blocking the strait, which is vital for global oil transit, could harm Iran more than benefit it. Vandana Hari of Vanda Insights notes that Iran risks turning neighboring oil-producing countries into enemies and provoking hostilities. Andrew Bishop of Signum Global Advisors adds that disrupting supplies would also antagonize China, a major importer of Iranian oil. The potential closure has raised concerns about higher energy prices and increased geopolitical tensions, prompting calls for de-escalation and diplomatic solutions. The United States has urged China to use its diplomatic leverage to prevent the strait's closure.</p>

          <p>A significant heat wave is expected to bring record-high temperatures across the eastern United States, with the National Weather Service issuing extreme heat alerts for over 150 million Americans. The heat wave is forecast to last through at least Wednesday, with temperatures well into the 90s or even triple digits in some areas. Officials are urging people to stay indoors, use air conditioning, and stay hydrated to avoid heat-related illnesses. The heat index, which combines temperature and humidity, is expected to reach dangerous levels, posing a significant risk to vulnerable populations. This marks one of the most expansive heat alert events ever, with major population centers from the Midwest to the Northeast under serious heat strain.</p>

President Ahmad al-Sharaa is seeking to gain support from minority groups concerned about Islamist rule following the toppling of Bashar Assad's regime. The United States and the European Union have also joined in condemning the attack, denouncing it as a terrorist act.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. has directly engaged in the conflict between Israel and Iran, China's support for its ally, Iran, appears to be growing more restrained. While Beijing has historically maintained close ties with Tehran, its response has become more measured, focusing on brokering dialogue and a ceasefire rather than directly condemning Israel's actions. China's primary economic interest lies in its access to Iranian oil and the Strait of Hormuz, a critical trade route. Some analysts suggest that Beijing may see value in the chaos, as it could distract Washington and potentially benefit China's strategic position. However, China is also wary of antagonizing the U.S. and disrupting regional stability, which could negatively impact its economic interests.</p>

          <p>NPR's "Up First" newsletter analyzes the key takeaways from the U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites and potential responses from Iran. The Trump administration defends the strikes as necessary to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons, while Democrats criticize the lack of congressional approval. Independent experts suggest the strikes did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program. Iran is considering its response, with options ranging from cyber attacks to disrupting oil shipping in the Gulf. The analysis highlights the risks for Iran, which could appear weak if it doesn't respond but could face a larger hit from the U.S. if it does.</p>

          <p>President Trump's use of emergency declarations to pursue policies on immigration, tariffs, and energy is raising concerns about the normalization of governing by crisis. Critics argue that Trump is stretching the definition of "national emergency" to justify harsh measures and bypass Congress. Lawsuits have been filed challenging these declarations, with some courts rejecting Trump's claims. The use of emergency powers is seen as a threat to US civic society and political norms, allowing Trump to govern in an authoritarian style.

The Senate version of the bill would make deeper cuts to Medicaid and Obamacare plans, potentially leaving millions without health insurance.

While it might seem like political violence is increasing, it's challenging to determine the exact extent due to definitional dilemmas and difficulties in gathering comprehensive data. However, some sources suggest that overall levels of political violence have increased in recent years, driven by a volatile political environment and the spread of misinformation online. The nature of political violence has also changed, with a shift towards targeting individuals and mass violence, fueled by conspiracy theories and hate speech.

These controls, partly a response to tariffs, have caused supply chain disruptions and affected industries. While G7 leaders are strategizing to counter China's dominance, the West faces challenges in catching up due to China's integrated supply chain.
