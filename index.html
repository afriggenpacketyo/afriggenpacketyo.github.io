        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A framework agreement has been reached for the social media platform TikTok between the U.S. and China, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The commercial terms are reportedly settled, but the deal requires finalization by President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who are scheduled to meet on Friday. This development comes amid ongoing trade tensions and a looming deadline for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations or face a shutdown. The framework may pave the way for U.S.-controlled ownership of the popular app.</p>

          <p>The suspect arrested in the fatal shooting of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, reportedly had an "obsession" with him, according to the FBI. Investigators are examining Robinson's digital footprint and online chats, which revealed multiple warning signs and discussions about Kirk prior to the event at Utah Valley University. Robinson was apprehended after his father recognized him in released photos and persuaded him to surrender. President Trump has since called for the death penalty in the case.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated he would "never" have appointed Peter Mandelson as his U.S. ambassador had he known the full extent of his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Starmer's comments follow his dismissal of Lord Mandelson after leaked emails revealed supportive messages sent to Epstein in 2008 following his guilty plea. The Prime Minister explained that the emails showed Mandelson questioning the conviction, which contradicts the government's stance on violence against women and girls. The incident has raised questions about Starmer's judgment and added to internal frustrations within the Labour Party.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has intensified his demand for European nations to completely halt energy purchases from Russia before the U.S. considers imposing its own new sanctions on Moscow. Speaking to reporters, Trump criticized NATO allies for not taking sufficient measures to counter Russia, specifically citing their continued importation of Russian oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG). He stated that while he is willing to enact major sanctions, European nations must first toughen their own measures and end their energy reliance on Russia. The demand comes as some European countries, like Hungary and France, continue significant energy trade with Moscow despite the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Bank of America has elevated three key executives, signaling a clear succession plan for when CEO Brian Moynihan eventually steps down. Dean Athanasia, who leads retail and commercial banking, and Jim DeMare, head of global markets, were named co-presidents, while CFO Alastair Borthwick was promoted to senior vice president. This move effectively creates a "horse race" among the three respected leaders to become the next head of the nation's second-largest bank. Moynihan, who has been CEO since 2010, has indicated he plans to stay until the end of the decade.</p>

          <p>American Olympic 1500m champion Cole Hocker was disqualified from his semi-final race at the world championships for "jostling." During the final stretch, Hocker was boxed in and forcefully pushed through a small gap, making physical contact with Germany's Robert Farken, which disrupted Farken's rhythm. Hocker finished second but was later disqualified after officials reviewed the incident and a subsequent appeal from the U.S. team was rejected. The disqualification is a significant setback for the prominent athlete, who was a strong contender for the final.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested that U.S. companies should move from reporting earnings every quarter to a semi-annual basis, a change that would require SEC approval. In a social media post, he argued this would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits, contrasting it with China's long-term business view. While some business leaders like Warren Buffett have previously criticized quarterly guidance, supporters of the current system argue it provides crucial transparency for investors. This proposal aligns more with European reporting standards but faces skepticism from market analysts who value frequent, reliable data (not investment advice).</p>

This gender divergence is amplified by online narratives and a decline in male friendships, placing undue emotional labor on women.

          <p>A psychology and human behavior expert suggests that asking generic questions like "How are you?" can hinder genuine connection and trust-building. Instead, successful people often use more engaging and specific questions to bypass boring social scripts and spark better interactions. The article recommends asking about the "highlight" of someone's week or any "exciting" projects they are working on to encourage more thoughtful responses. It also advises on using open body language and practicing these techniques in low-pressure daily interactions to make them feel natural over time.</p>

          <p>Sushila Karki, a former chief justice, has been appointed as Nepal's first female interim prime minister following widespread, violent protests that led to the resignation of the previous government. The demonstrations, largely driven by Gen Z youth, were fueled by anger over corruption, economic hardship, and a social media ban. Karki, 73, is known for her integrity and anti-corruption stance, and her appointment is seen as a reflection of society's growing trust in female leadership. Her immediate challenges include restoring normalcy, rebuilding public structures, and conducting fresh elections scheduled for March 2026.</p>

          <p>Many federal student loan borrowers are experiencing unexpected changes in their loan servicing companies, causing confusion and potential payment issues. When a loan is transferred, experts advise borrowers to be vigilant, save documentation, and set aside payment funds until the new account is fully active to avoid lost payments. An automatic administrative forbearance is often placed on accounts during the transfer, which should not negatively affect credit scores. Borrowers are encouraged to check their new account details carefully and monitor their credit reports to ensure a smooth transition.</p>

He cited the party's record of "failure," including bigger government and higher taxes, as his reason for leaving.

          <p>The watermelon has become a significant symbol of Palestinian identity and resistance, largely because its colors—red, green, black, and white—mirror those of the Palestinian flag. Its use as a protest symbol dates back to the 1980s, when Israel banned the public display of the Palestinian flag in the occupied territories. Artists and activists adopted the fruit as a subtle way to represent national identity without violating the law. Today, the watermelon emoji is widely used on social media to express solidarity and circumvent online censorship of pro-Palestinian content.</p>

AI-generated applications also tend to look generic, lacking the personal touch that helps candidates stand out.
