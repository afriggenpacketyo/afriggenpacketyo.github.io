          <p>This article discusses the futility of trying to time the stock market based on political announcements, specifically President Trump's trade policies. It notes the S&P 500's volatile journey since the election, highlighting how quickly gains can be erased by policy shifts. The article emphasizes that accurately predicting market highs and lows is nearly impossible, and investors are better served by a disciplined approach rather than attempting sweeping portfolio moves. The author references Jim Cramer's advice that nobody can time the market consistently and that attempting to do so is a fool's errand.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested reducing tariffs on China from 145% to 80% before a meeting between top US and Chinese officials in Switzerland. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese counterparts to discuss trade. The announcement comes amid concerns about the impact of tariffs on US consumer goods. China's trade with the US slumped in April, although its total exports beat forecasts. The UK recently announced a trade deal with the US, reducing tariffs on British cars and lifting them on steel and aluminum.</p>

Coach Steve Kerr acknowledged Green's actions are a habit stemming from his competitive nature.

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested an 80% tariff on Chinese goods, a decrease from the current 145%, ahead of trade talks in Switzerland.

It remains unclear if Trump intends the 80% rate to be long-term or a negotiation tactic.

The case has challenged a culture of shame and silence surrounding sexual violence, particularly in rural communities. Demonstrations culminated in a march to President Ramaphosa's office, demanding that sexual violence be declared a national disaster. The police investigation is ongoing, but Mtshizana remains determined to seek justice for her daughter.</p>

The proposed cuts would disproportionately affect the poor and undermine crucial investments in education, healthcare, and scientific research.
