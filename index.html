          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 08:26:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to a significant outperformance in its trading divisions. The bank's profit increased 22% to $3.72 billion, with equities trading revenue jumping 36% to $4.3 billion, beating estimates by about $650 million. This strong performance reflects a broader Wall Street trend where market volatility, influenced by President Trump's tariff policies, has boosted trading activity across various asset classes. Investment banking fees also saw a robust 26% increase, contributing to the overall positive results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The man accused of killing a Minnesota state lawmaker and her husband in June has been indicted on six federal charges, including stalking and murder. Prosecutors allege that 57-year-old Vance Boelter targeted and assassinated Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, after also shooting and injuring another state senator and his wife. The charges carry a potential sentence of life in prison or the death penalty, with prosecutors describing the event as a planned "night of terror" and an unprecedented act of targeted political violence in the state. Boelter remains in custody and has not yet entered a plea.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang made a high-profile trip to Beijing, signaling a potential thaw in U.S.-China tech relations as the company expects to resume sales of its H20 AI chips to the country. After a three-month halt due to U.S. export controls, Huang indicated the policy shift was part of a broader governmental exchange, not a result of his direct negotiation. During his visit, he met with Chinese officials and tech leaders, praising local AI development and emphasizing the need to adapt to evolving trade policies. The move comes after U.S. restrictions significantly impacted Nvidia's market share in China.</p>

          <p>Operations at Vancouver International Airport were briefly halted after authorities received a report that a Cessna 172 small aircraft had been hijacked. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police stated the report indicated the plane was taken from the Vancouver Island area and was entering the airport's airspace with a single suspect occupant. The aircraft landed safely, and the suspect was arrested without incident, leading to a 39-minute grounding of flights. Nine inbound flights were diverted during the disruption, which officials described as an unusual event that was resolved quickly.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the withdrawal of 2,000 National Guard troops from their federal mission in Los Angeles, which was initiated to address anti-ICE protests and riots. Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell stated the decision was made as "lawlessness in Los Angeles is subsiding." The initial deployment, which included federalizing 4,000 Guard members and sending 700 Marines, had been a point of contention between the Trump administration and California officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass. Bass characterized the withdrawal as a "retreat" resulting from public and legal pressure against the federal deployment.</p>

A spokesman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office described the policy as an "illegal abuse of power" aimed at persecuting mainland spouses. The new rules, implemented under Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te's administration, require mainland spouses who gained residency before 2004 to prove they have renounced their mainland status.

          <p>Concerns are growing over a potential new conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region, still recovering from a devastating two-year civil war that ended in 2022. Reports of troop movements and sporadic clashes are fueling anxiety, with much of the focus on the destabilizing role of neighboring Eritrea, which was not part of the original peace agreement. Analysts suggest Eritrea benefits from a fragmented Ethiopia and may be exploiting internal political divisions within the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).

A key factor was the bank's net interest income (NII), which came in below estimates at $14.82 billion, as lower interest rates offset growth in loans and deposits.

This follows safety concerns and a heated debate over the growing use and responsibilities of PAs in the NHS.

          <p>President Trump has announced a 50-day deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine, threatening further sanctions if it fails to comply, while also promising a "really big" new weapons deal for Kyiv. While Ukrainian leaders expressed cautious optimism, there are significant concerns that this 50-day window could prompt Moscow to intensify its offensive before the deadline. Recent data shows Russian drone and missile attacks have already been escalating in recent months. Russian officials have given a cold response to the ultimatum, calling the demands "unacceptable" and suggesting they will not be moved by the threat.</p>

          <p>Thai police have arrested a woman accused of orchestrating a large-scale blackmail scheme targeting senior Buddhist monks. The suspect, Wilawan Emsawat, allegedly initiated sexual relationships with the monks, a violation of their celibacy vows, and then extorted large sums of money from them to ensure her silence. The scandal has already led to at least nine abbots and senior monks being disrobed and has prompted a national conversation about the transparency of temple finances. Investigators found that the suspect had received millions of dollars over three years, which were largely spent on online gambling websites.</p>

          <p>The 2025 MLB All-Star Game concluded in a dramatic and unprecedented fashion, with the National League securing a victory over the American League in a home run swing-off. After the game ended in a 6-6 tie, Kyle Schwarber of the NL hit three home runs on three swings to clinch the win, earning him the MVP award. This was the first time the new tie-breaking rule, designed to avoid running out of pitchers, has been used. The AL had forced the extra contest after overcoming a six-run deficit, tying the game in the ninth inning before the unique home run derby decided the outcome.</p>

          <p>A police raid off the coast of northern Haiti resulted in the seizure of over 2,300 pounds of cocaine and the deaths of three suspected drug traffickers. The incident occurred near Tortue Island when suspects on a boat opened fire on police who were attempting to approach them. Officers returned fire, leading to the deaths of two suspects at sea and one on shore; a fourth suspect from the Bahamas was arrested. This rare, large-scale drug bust highlights Haiti's role as a transit hub for narcotics and the involvement of powerful figures in the illicit trade, as noted by U.S. officials.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly voted to advance debate on a package of spending cuts requested by President Trump, targeting funds for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and international aid. Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote to move forward with the measure, which aims to rescind $1.1 billion from CPB, affecting local NPR and PBS stations. The move is opposed by all Senate Democrats and three Republicans, who expressed concern over the lack of clarity on how the cuts would be applied. The debate highlights a contentious political battle over the future of public media funding in the country.</p>

          <p>The UK has lifted a five-year ban on Pakistani airlines, allowing them to apply to resume direct flights after Pakistan made significant improvements to its aviation safety standards. The ban was originally imposed in 2020 following a scandal involving fraudulent pilot licenses, which came to light after a fatal Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) crash. This decision follows a similar move by the European Union's aviation safety agency earlier this year. The restoration of these profitable UK routes is expected to boost the value of the struggling state-owned PIA as it moves towards privatization.</p>

          <p>Two senior Democratic senators are introducing legislation to regulate fundraising for presidential libraries, citing concerns over potential conflicts of interest related to President Trump's fundraising efforts while in office. The bill, proposed by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal, would cap individual donations at $10,000 during a president's term and require public disclosure of donors. The move was spurred by large donations to Trump's future library, including proceeds from legal settlements and a Boeing 747 from Qatar, which critics argue create an appearance of impropriety and a lack of transparency.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's anti-vaccine rhetoric, led by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is creating a deep schism between the government and the medical community, complicating conversations in doctors' offices. The article details how physicians are now encountering increased vaccine hesitancy from families who once trusted their advice, with some patients echoing the administration's debunked claims. This divergence is pitting patients' trust in their doctors against their trust in the government. The shift has also created fear among other patients, who are now rushing to get shots, worried that access may soon be restricted.</p>

          <p>The backlash from the MAGA movement over the non-release of Jeffrey Epstein files reveals a fundamental tension in Donald Trump's political identity. The article argues that by dismissing his base's deep-seated belief in an elite conspiracy and demanding loyalty to his administration's decision, Trump is prioritizing personalist authority over his populist image. For many supporters, the Epstein case represented the ultimate battle against a "corrupt elite." Trump's shift to quash the inquiry shows his movement is less about a populist ideology and more about personal loyalty to him, a dynamic that could test his base's faith.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury goods conglomerate Richemont reported a 6% rise in first-quarter sales, slightly ahead of analyst forecasts, though performance was dampened by a notable slowdown in Japan. Sales in Japan fell 15% as a strengthening yen reduced the spending power of tourists, particularly from China, ending a period of currency-fueled growth for the region. The company's overall positive results were driven by its strong Jewellery Maisons division, which includes brands like Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels, and saw an 11% sales increase. This performance makes Richemont an outlier in a broader luxury market downturn. (not investment advice)</p>
