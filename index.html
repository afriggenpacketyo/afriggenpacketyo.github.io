Speaking at a think tank event, Xu condemned the steep tariffs imposed by the US on Indian goods, labeling Washington's actions as bullying and undermining the global free trade system. He called for collaboration between the two most populous nations to uphold the multilateral trading system, a rare display of solidarity amid ongoing geopolitical tensions between China and India.</p>

          <p>Tulsi Gabbard, the Director of National Intelligence, issued a directive ordering U.S. intelligence agencies to cease sharing information regarding Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations with the "Five Eyes" intelligence alliance. This alliance includes the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The memo classifies all related analysis as "NOFORN" (no foreign dissemination), limiting its distribution internally and sparking debate among national security experts. While some former officials warn this could erode trust and hinder collaborative intelligence gathering, others argue it is a standard practice to protect diverging national interests during sensitive negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid record-high national credit card debt exceeding $1.2 trillion and rising delinquency rates, a recent article outlines the primary qualifications for debt forgiveness programs. These programs, often facilitated by debt relief companies, typically require consumers to have substantial unsecured debts, generally over $7,500. Candidates must also be facing verifiable financial hardship, such as job loss or a medical emergency, which makes full repayment unrealistic. Furthermore, individuals who are already significantly behind on payments are more likely to qualify, as creditors become more willing to negotiate a settlement to avoid a total loss.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he has directed officials to begin negotiations for a ceasefire and the release of all remaining hostages in Gaza. However, he stipulated that any deal must be on terms "acceptable to Israel" and has not accepted the current 60-day ceasefire proposal from mediators. Simultaneously, Netanyahu confirmed that his cabinet has approved military plans for a major assault on Gaza City, stating that defeating Hamas and releasing hostages are interconnected goals.

          <p>Tennis icon Serena Williams has publicly shared her experience of losing 31 pounds with the assistance of a GLP-1 medication. The 23-time Grand Slam champion explained that after the birth of her second child, she struggled with health issues related to her weight, including joint pain, despite her active lifestyle as a professional athlete. Williams stated her decision to use the medication was for her overall health and to reach a weight where she felt comfortable, not due to external pressure. By speaking openly, she aims to destigmatize the use of such medications for health-related weight management.</p>

          <p>Shares of Cracker Barrel Old Country Store experienced a significant drop of about 10% following the unveiling of a new, more minimalist logo as part of a broader brand transformation. The redesign, which removes the iconic image of a man in a rocking chair and the phrase "old country store," has drawn considerable criticism on social media. Some conservative commentators have suggested the change is an attempt to distance the brand from its traditional American identity. The negative reaction to the new branding, along with customer complaints about modernizing restaurant interiors, contributed to the sharp decline in the company's stock value.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has terminated a multi-million dollar federal grant for a California sex education program after the state refused to remove references to gender identity, transgender, and nonbinary people from its curriculum. The federal Administration for Children and Families argued that such topics were outside the scope of the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP). California officials countered that the material is medically accurate and legally sound, refusing to alter the curriculum and consequently losing approximately $12 million in funding. This action is seen by advocates as part of a broader effort to restrict comprehensive sex education and LGBTQ+ inclusive content nationwide.</p>

          <p>A South Texas woman, Lizelle Gonzalez, who was arrested and charged with murder in 2022 for using medication to end her pregnancy, has filed a lawsuit against the local district attorney and sheriff. The lawsuit alleges her constitutional rights were violated, as Texas law explicitly exempts a pregnant person from homicide charges for their own abortion. Her attorneys argue that officials pursued the case despite knowing it was unlawful, pointing to evidence that the charges were only dropped after public outcry. This case highlights the legal complexities and potential for criminalization surrounding abortion access in states with strict bans.</p>

          <p>A New York state appeals court has overturned the massive monetary penalty imposed on President Donald Trump and his company in the civil business fraud case brought by Attorney General Letitia James. The court ruled that the fine, which had grown to over $500 million, was an "excessive fine" and therefore violated the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment. However, the ruling upheld the original judge's finding that Trump and other defendants committed fraud by inflating asset values to secure better financial terms. The non-monetary sanctions, designed to curb the company's business practices, were also upheld by the appellate court.</p>

          <p>New research indicates a growing trend of adults ordering from children's menus at restaurants, with 44% of those surveyed admitting to doing so. The primary motivations cited are saving money and preferring smaller portion sizes, as kids' meals are typically less expensive than standard adult entrees. This consumer behavior shift comes as the restaurant industry faces economic pressures, with some major chains reporting slower sales. The findings from Lightspeed Commerce suggest that for many adult diners, the lower prices and simpler options on kids' menus are becoming a practical and appealing choice when eating out.</p>

Rather than isolationism, the U.S. is actively supporting nativist political parties that align with its ideology, such as Germany's AfD party, while criticizing those that do not. This approach, exemplified by officials' comments at security conferences and involvement in foreign elections, is creating a deep rift in the transatlantic relationship.

          <p>Several prominent news organizations, including Wired and Business Insider, have removed articles from their websites after discovering they were written by a fake freelance journalist persona likely generated by artificial intelligence. The articles, published under the name Margaux Blanchard, were taken down after an editor at another publication grew suspicious of a story pitch that seemed AI-generated and contained unverifiable details. This incident has prompted the affected outlets to bolster their verification protocols and highlights growing concerns about the use of AI to create and publish fraudulent content in journalism.</p>

          <p>Erik Menendez, who was convicted along with his brother Lyle for the 1989 murders of their parents, appeared before a California parole board on Thursday seeking his release from prison.

The brothers have long maintained they acted in self-defense after years of abuse, a claim prosecutors contest. The parole board will determine if he poses an unreasonable risk to society, though the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office strongly opposes his release.</p>

          <p>Sales of existing homes in the U.S. saw a 2% increase in July compared to June, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units, according to the National Association of Realtors. This modest rise is attributed to a slight dip in mortgage rates during May and June when these sales contracts were likely signed. Housing inventory also grew by 15.7% year-over-year, reaching its highest level since May 2020 and helping to ease pressure on prices. The median home price was $422,400, up only 0.2% from a year ago, suggesting the market may be approaching an inflection point. (not investment advice)</p>
