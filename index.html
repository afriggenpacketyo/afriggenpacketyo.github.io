Ohtani went 1-for-3 with two walks, showing no signs of injury after being hit by a fastball in the previous game. Manager Dave Roberts served a one-game suspension due to a flare-up in the prior game, while other MLB action saw mixed results for Japanese pitchers, with Tomoyuki Sugano pulled early and Yusei Kikuchi having a no-decision despite a strong outing. The Dodgers continue their series against the Nationals, with Ohtani scheduled to pitch on Sunday; the team hopes to secure another win.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly ambush in Minnesota where a suspect allegedly impersonated a police officer, law enforcement officials are advising the public on how to verify an officer's identity. Police Chief Mark Bruley suggests calling 911 to confirm the officer's status, while Brian Higgins, a former police chief, advises against opening the door to unverified individuals and instead communicating through the door while contacting authorities. The suspect in the Minnesota incident allegedly wore a mask and tactical gear while posing as a police officer before attacking state lawmakers at their homes. Authorities emphasize the importance of awareness and caution when interacting with individuals claiming to be law enforcement.</p>

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen is advocating for the House of Lords to pass the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. The bill has already been approved by MPs, but faces potential opposition in the Lords, where some members fear it could lead to coercion of vulnerable individuals. Rantzen, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, emphasizes the bill's rigorous safeguards, including multiple assessments by doctors and a multidisciplinary panel. Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson plans to introduce amendments to further strengthen the safeguards and prevent coercion.</p>

          <p>A Wall Street analyst predicts that XRP and Bitcoin could experience substantial growth, with XRP potentially overtaking Ethereum by 2028 and Bitcoin reaching $710,000 by 2030. The investment thesis for XRP focuses on its ability to facilitate fast and cheap cross-border transactions and the potential approval of spot XRP ETFs. Bitcoin's investment thesis centers on its status as digital gold and a hedge against inflation, with a limited supply differentiating it from fiat currencies. Investors should be aware of the volatility associated with cryptocurrencies and avoid relying solely on Wall Street's price targets (not investment advice).</p>

This initiative aims to predict and prevent illnesses, enabling personalized healthcare and reducing pressure on NHS services.

The health secretary stated that this technology would transform the NHS from a reactive service to one that proactively prevents ill-health, supporting efforts to build a research database of over 500,000 genomes by 2030.</p>

Goldman Sachs estimates that demand will remain suppressed at under 5 million units per year, a significant drop from the 20 million units in 2017. The country's declining fertility rate, despite efforts to incentivize child-bearing, and an aging population are contributing to this trend. Pronatalist policies are expected to have limited impact due to deep-rooted issues such as high economic costs and changing social values.</p>

The Trump administration is seeking to deport him, alleging he lied on his green card application, which he disputes. Civil rights groups argue that the administration is conflating antisemitism with criticism of Israel to silence dissent. Despite his release, the government is appealing the decision, and an immigration judge has ordered him to be removed.</p>

          <p>The head of Chinaâ€™s United Front Work Department has cautioned religious groups to guard against foreign infiltration and promote the "Sinicisation of religion." This warning follows similar statements by senior figures, including President Xi Jinping, emphasizing the need to manage religious affairs and maintain control. The security official Chen Wenqing also called for the defeat of "separatism" during a visit to Qinghai province. These actions occur ahead of the Dalai Lamaâ€™s 90th birthday, highlighting the government's focus on religious matters.</p>

          <p>Benjamin Netanyahu's long-held ambition to confront Iran has materialized with an attack on Iranian nuclear plants, leading to exchanges of bombs and missiles between the two countries. Despite the ongoing conflict and civilian casualties, the decision to attack Iran has broad support within Israel, with 82% of Jewish respondents supporting the move. Netanyahu views this as an opportunity to rewrite his legacy, marred by the failures in preventing the Hamas attack in 2023. The conflict is seen as a chance to address the perceived existential threat posed by Iran and its regional proxies, although the long-term consequences remain uncertain.</p>

The bill now goes to Democratic Gov. Dan McKee, who supports assault weapons bans. If signed into law, Rhode Island will join 10 other states with similar prohibitions. Critics argue the ban will not curb mass shootings and punishes law-abiding citizens, while gun control advocates call the bill the "weakest assault weapons ban in the country."
