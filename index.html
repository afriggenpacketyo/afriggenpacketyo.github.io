          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the current Health and Human Services Secretary, has publicly denied any ambition to run for president in 2028, labeling such claims as a "flat-out lie." His statement comes in response to accusations from conservative influencer Laura Loomer, who suggested a top aide was laying the groundwork for a future campaign. Kennedy framed the speculation as an attack from the "swamp" intended to create a rift between him and President Trump, reaffirming his complete loyalty to the administration and its agenda.</p>

The union, CUPE, initiated the walkout after last-minute negotiations with the airline and the federal jobs minister did not produce a deal. The shutdown is expected to affect approximately 130,000 travelers daily, causing widespread disruption during the peak summer travel season as both sides remain far apart on key issues like wages and unpaid work.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, actor Denzel Washington forcefully dismissed the concept of "cancel culture," questioning the importance of public support and social media followers. He stated that he does not fear being canceled because his guidance comes from his faith in God, not from popular opinion, asserting that one cannot lead and follow at the same time. Washington emphasized that his focus is on a higher power and that he has little concern for the currency of online approval, a sentiment echoed by director Spike Lee.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was successfully rescued after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, trapping him. After he was reported missing, a search team located him using a drone, and a California Highway Patrol helicopter hoisted him to safety. He was treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump's pivot away from demanding an immediate ceasefire to prioritizing a direct peace agreement has caused significant concern in Kyiv. This new stance aligns more closely with Russia's long-held position, which implies a comprehensive settlement that Ukraine fears would amount to capitulation. European allies and Ukrainian officials worry this approach buys Russia valuable time on the battlefield and undermines their primary demand for an unconditional cessation of hostilities before any broader negotiations.</p>

          <p>Erin has become the first hurricane of the Atlantic season and has rapidly intensified into a Category 4 storm, with forecasts suggesting it may reach Category 5 status. While tropical storm watches are in effect for several Leeward Islands, the hurricane is currently projected to remain hundreds of miles off the U.S. East Coast. However, it is expected to generate large waves and life-threatening rip currents along the coastline from August 20 to 27, posing a significant danger to beachgoers and potentially causing coastal erosion.</p>

          <p>A leading academic from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has urged China to implement a top-down strategy to speed up its development of space-based solar power. This technology involves building orbital stations that convert solar energy to electricity and transmit it to Earth via microwaves, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather. The call to action highlights the need for China to close the technological gap with the United States and establish a stronger position in both the new energy sector and the broader space race.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The concept of a "Lighthouse Parent" is being presented as a healthier alternative to the trend of intensive parenting. This approach encourages parents to act as a steady, reliable guide for their children, providing safety and clarity when needed without controlling every aspect of their journey. Proponents argue that resisting the natural impulse to immediately solve a child's problems fosters greater confidence and resilience in children while being less exhausting for the parents themselves, ultimately benefiting the entire family dynamic.</p>

          <p>This article argues that President Trump entered the Alaska summit with Vladimir Putin holding "no cards" to effectively negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The author contends that the administration's prior actions, such as easing sanctions on Russia and halting military shipments to Ukraine, have undermined U.S. leverage. As a result, Putin can safely ignore Trump's desire to be seen as a peacemaker, making the summit more of a symbolic culmination of a weakened U.S. foreign policy rather than a meaningful step toward peace.</p>

          <p>New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell and her former bodyguard, Jeffrey Vappie, have been federally charged with fraud and corruption. Prosecutors allege the two were involved in a romantic relationship and used public funds to facilitate it, fraudulently billing the city for Vappie's on-duty security services while they were engaged in personal activities. The scheme, which allegedly cost taxpayers over $70,000, included numerous domestic and international trips and the personal use of a city-owned apartment, according to the indictment.</p>

          <h2>Psychologist Outlines Three Steps to Build Emotional Endurance and Tolerate Stress</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To develop emotional endurance, Columbia-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests three powerful steps to better withstand stress and discomfort. First, use a visual aid to understand that frustration is a natural part of the learning process. Second, practice positive self-talk to reframe your internal dialogue from self-criticism to support. Finally, undertake small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which trains your body and mind to tolerate discomfort and builds resilience over time.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has endorsed efforts to redraw the state's congressional district maps mid-decade, a move aimed at strengthening the Republican majority in the U.S. House. Citing a recent favorable ruling from the Florida Supreme Court, DeSantis and state legislative leaders are planning to reconfigure districts, potentially targeting those currently held by prominent South Florida Democrats. Critics are denouncing the plan as a blatant partisan power-play and an attempt to gerrymander the state for political advantage before the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>According to a new Gallup survey, the percentage of American adults who consume alcohol has dropped to 54%, the lowest level recorded since the question was first asked in 1939.

The trend aligns with recent medical guidance from organizations like the WHO, which states that no level of alcohol consumption is entirely safe for one's health.</p>

          <p>Farmers in the U.S. Midwest are grappling with a dual crisis that is severely squeezing their operations and finances. On one front, President Trump's trade tariffs have caused a steep decline in agricultural exports, particularly soybeans to China, leading to low crop prices. On the other, the climate crisis is bringing more extreme and unpredictable weather, from droughts to excessive rainfall, which damages crops and reduces yields. This combination of policy-driven market challenges and environmental volatility has created a perfect storm for the American agricultural sector.</p>
