          <p>Experts predict possible mortgage rate scenarios for the summer, considering factors such as inflation, employment, and consumer spending. While a dramatic swing in mortgage rates is not expected, minor fluctuations are possible, with rates potentially remaining stable in the high 6% range. An optimistic prediction suggests a modest decline, potentially averaging around 6.6% by August. Experts recommend focusing on controllable variables such as rate buydowns and exploring different loan programs, as trying to time the market perfectly can lead to missed opportunities.

          <p>Following an interregnum where American institutions failed to hold him accountable for his crimes and abuses, Trump staged a military parade for his birthday, complete with tanks, missiles, airplanes, and parachutists. The spectacle, paid for by taxpayers and corporate sponsors like Palantir and Coinbase, was intended to celebrate his seizure of power and quash dissent. The parade, however, was described as a disappointing affair with irregular marching, a small turnout, and a generally unenthusiastic crowd, contrasting sharply with large-scale protests occurring simultaneously. The article criticizes Trump's dictatorial ambitions and his desire to play a dictator on TV, viewing the parade as an imitation of authoritarian displays.</p>

          <p>The case of Adriana Smith, a brain-dead Georgia nurse, has sparked a debate between pro-choice and pro-life factions regarding medical decision-making for incapacitated individuals. Smith's family objects to Emory University Hospital's decision to keep her on life support to gestate her unborn child without their consent. The case raises ethical questions about who should make decisions for permanently incapacitated people, and whether Georgia's abortion ban influenced the hospital's decision. The debate centers on the rights of Smith's family to decide her care, and the value of both Smith's life and her unborn child's life.</p>

          <p>Police have announced that no further charges will be filed in the investigation into the Southport knife attacks, in which Axel Rudakubana murdered three young girls and injured ten others. Rudakubana was sentenced to a minimum of 52 years in custody in January, and Merseyside Police investigated whether anyone had assisted him or failed to prevent his crimes. After a comprehensive review, the force determined that no additional charges will be brought at this stage. A public inquiry into the attacks began in April to examine policing, the criminal justice system, and agencies involved with Rudakubana.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin dairy farmer has filed a federal lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging discrimination against white farmers through the continuation of programs favoring minorities. The lawsuit, filed by the Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, claims that the USDA's diversity, equity, and inclusion programs disadvantage white male farmers. The farmer, Adam Faust, argues that he faces discriminatory fees and loan guarantee percentages compared to minority and female farmers. The lawsuit challenges three USDA programs, asserting they violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal treatment.</p>

          <p>Recent trade talks between the US and China in London have generated cautious optimism about de-escalating tensions and spurring broader bilateral dialogue. Negotiators agreed on a framework to implement consensus reached in Geneva and a call between the two leaders. The talks addressed issues such as rare earths, student visas, and jet engine parts. Observers hope this momentum will lead to discussions on challenging issues like military communications, security, climate, and fentanyl cooperation.</p>
