          <p>A Russian drone attack on Kharkiv, Ukraine, injured nearly 50 people, including an 11-year-old child, damaging residential buildings and civilian infrastructure. Kharkiv governor Oleg Synegubov reported that the drones hit four districts of the city, causing fires and significant damage. The attack occurred shortly after another Russian strike on Zaporizhzhia, which injured 29 people, and just before Russia's planned three-day ceasefire for its World War II holiday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the attacks, stating that Russia is targeting homes and not military sites, urging greater international pressure on the Kremlin to end the war. </p>

          <p>Ghana's ambitious plan for a national cathedral, designed by architect David Adjaye, has become a symbol of economic mismanagement and political strife after costing $58 million in public funds with little to show beyond a large hole in the ground. Former President Nana Akufo-Addo initiated the $400 million project as a personal pledge to God, but it faced criticism amid Ghana's severe economic distress. The new government has halted funding, dissolved the managing agency, and launched an anticorruption initiative targeting the project. The unbuilt cathedral is now a major target of the new governmentâ€™s anticorruption initiative, called Operation Recover All Loot.</p>

          <p>Crimean Tatars, the indigenous inhabitants of Crimea, express concerns over President Trump's proposal to recognize the annexed peninsula as Russian territory. They fear legitimizing territorial concessions to Russia would endanger those living in occupied territories, potentially making them political prisoners under Russian legislation. Representatives of the Crimean Tatars emphasize their disappointment in the US potentially shifting from its role as a defender of human rights and democracy, especially after years of relying on American support against Russian aggression. The article highlights the principled stance of the Ukrainian government, which refuses to recognize Crimea as Russian, a symbolic link for the Crimean Tatars with the free territory of Ukraine.</p>

          <p>According to royal experts, Prince William is reportedly unwilling to reconcile with Prince Harry despite Harry's public plea for reconciliation, citing Harry's continuous public criticism of the royal family as the cause of the widening gulf between them. Experts note that William's priority is protecting the monarchy, which he believes is being undermined by commercial endeavors, and that Harry has not taken sufficient steps to express regret for his behavior. The article references Harry's recent BBC interview where he expressed a desire for reconciliation and concern for his father's health, while also noting his ongoing security disputes with the royal household.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent minerals deal with the United States, analysts believe it will take years for Ukraine to rival China as a top source of critical minerals. Most of Ukraine's mineral stores are located in Russian-occupied territories, and the country lacks the processing capacity to extract them quickly. China controls a significant portion of the world's rare earth elements reserves and refining capabilities, making it difficult for Ukraine to compete in the near term. The US Geological Survey considers 50 minerals to be critical, including the 17 rare earth elements.</p>

          <p>A UK government impact assessment estimates that assisted dying could account for over 4,000 deaths in the tenth year after legalization in England and Wales, representing less than 1% of all deaths. The assessment, conducted to inform MPs debating the issue, projects initial savings for the NHS ranging from Â£919,000 to Â£10.3 million in the first six months, but also significant staffing and training costs. Proponents argue that assisted dying provides compassionate end-of-life care, while opponents raise concerns about risks to vulnerable individuals and potential financial incentives for an overburdened NHS. The bill only covers terminally ill adults with less than six months to live and includes strict eligibility criteria and safeguarding measures.</p>

          <p>Singapore held its general election amid concerns over potential trade tariffs imposed by the United States, with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong facing his first major test against a strengthened opposition. The ruling People's Action Party (PAP) has dominated Singaporean politics since 1965, but the opposition is seeking to increase its representation in Parliament. The election outcome is viewed as a gauge of Wong's leadership and the PAP's continued dominance, especially given economic uncertainties stemming from the US-China trade war and rising living costs. The PAP emphasizes its efforts to mitigate rising costs for citizens, while the opposition argues for stronger scrutiny of government policies.</p>

          <p>Europe is exploring ways to reduce its dependence on US credit card firms like Visa and Mastercard due to concerns over economic security and potential vulnerabilities. European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has expressed alarm over the region's reliance on foreign-owned payment infrastructure and advocates for a European alternative. While some experts downplay the extent of US dominance in total European payment traffic, others highlight the increasing use of mobile payment apps dominated by American tech firms like Apple Pay and Google Pay. Potential solutions include adopting a model similar to Russia's, mandating domestic processing of card transactions, and promoting the development of a digital euro.</p>

          <p>President Trump's promise of a 'golden age' for the US economy is off to a chaotic start, with GDP shrinking in the first quarter after a period of robust growth. Trump blamed the 'Biden Overhang' for the dismal numbers, while simultaneously taking credit for positive jobs reports. The article notes that economic activity in the first quarter was significantly challenged by the new administration's plans to overhaul the world economy, with businesses facing confusion and uncertainty due to erratic tariff rollouts. The foundations of a potential Trump recession were not laid in the early months of the year by the tariffs themselves, but by his administrationâ€™s execution of them.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an 'unparalleled' antivenom using antibodies from a US man, Tim Friede, who has deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. Antibodies found in Friede's blood have shown protection against fatal doses from a wide range of venomous snakes in animal tests. Current antivenom therapies require matching the specific snake species, making Friede's mission a significant step towards a universal antivenom. This breakthrough could help save thousands of lives and prevent disabilities caused by snakebites, which kill up to 140,000 people annually.</p>

          <p>Ryan Garcia's year-long inactivity proved costly as he lost to Rolando Romero by unanimous decision in a surprise upset. Garcia, lacking spark and punch volume, fell to Romero, who executed a winning strategy at the Time Square in New York. A rematch between Garcia and Devin Haney was anticipated, but Romero's victory altered those plans. Garcia acknowledged that the year off took a toll on him, both physically and mentally, and that he is contemplating a rematch with Romero or a fight with Haney.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to curb the local currency's rise against the US dollar due to recent capital inflows. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion to maintain the currency's trading band. This action precedes the US Federal Reserve's meeting, where potential interest rate cuts are expected to be discussed. Bankers anticipate similar interventions if the US lowers interest rates, prompting further capital inflow to Hong Kong. The HKMA will continue to monitor the market to ensure orderly operations.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is undergoing an administrative 'revolution' aimed at streamlining bureaucracy, boosting economic growth, and consolidating power within the Communist Party. The reforms, spearheaded by new party chief To Lam, include merging ministries, shuttering state-run media, and eliminating public sector jobs. These changes are expected to address dysfunction caused by the party's anti-corruption campaign and adapt to external pressures such as potential US tariffs. The overhaul also aligns with a broader ideological shift towards centralized governance and tighter party discipline, potentially benefiting To Lam's leadership.</p>

          <p>A 25% import tax on engines, transmissions, and other key car parts has come into force in the US, increasing pressure on the automotive industry. The new tariff, implemented to encourage domestic manufacturing, follows a 25% import tax on cars that went into effect last month. While the Trump administration eased the measure in response to business concerns, analysts predict higher costs for businesses and consumers. Some companies have already reported significant new costs due to the tariffs, while others have withdrawn financial guidance due to the uncertain situation.</p>

          <p>The United States imposed 25 percent tariffs on imported auto parts, potentially increasing prices for new and used vehicles, repairs, and insurance. These tariffs, intended to boost domestic manufacturing, follow previous levies on imported cars.

Experts predict that the tariffs will lead to higher car prices and inflation, with some companies potentially facing financial stress and parts shortages.
