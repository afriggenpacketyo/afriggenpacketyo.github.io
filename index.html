          <p>The second week of Sean "Diddy" Combs' trial commenced with testimony from Dawn Richard, a former member of Danity Kane, who recounted witnessing Combs physically assault Casandra "Cassie" Ventura, his then-girlfriend. Kerry Morgan, Ventura's former best friend, corroborated these accounts, detailing instances of abuse she personally observed. David James, Combs' former assistant, described the demanding work environment and Ventura's warnings about Combs' control over her life. Prosecutors released evidence from Ventura's testimony, including photos of injuries and a knife she used for protection. Lawyers for Combs attempted to cast doubt on the prosecution witnesses, but the prosecution is attempting to establish a criminal enterprise with Combs at its center.</p>

          <p>Richard Grenell, the new president of the Kennedy Center appointed by President Trump, accused the center's previous management of "criminal" financial mismanagement, including "phantom revenue." He stated he would refer the matter to federal prosecutors. This comes as the Kennedy Center announced its upcoming season, which includes both union and nonunion Broadway productions. The inclusion of nonunion casts marks a shift from past practices and has sparked controversy among artists and unions, particularly after Trump purged the previously bipartisan board of members appointed by Democrats.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) initiated "Project Homecoming," a program incentivizing illegal immigrants to self-deport by offering a $1,000 stipend and free flight back to their home country. The first flight transported 64 individuals to Honduras and Columbia. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem encouraged those in the country illegally to use the CBP Home App to arrange their departure, emphasizing the potential for future legal return. The program aims to save taxpayers money, as it is reportedly cheaper than the traditional arrest, detention, and deportation process.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is set to launch research into offshore "blue carbon" initiatives, focusing on capturing carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and storing it in the deep sea. The project aims to accelerate decarbonization efforts, leveraging the high solubility of CO2 in water and the absorption capabilities of marine vegetation like mangroves and kelp. The Environment Ministry will collaborate with the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp. to study the behavior of seaweed at significant depths and assess the environmental impact of these carbon capture projects. Japan hopes to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon.</p>

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest maker of batteries for electric vehicles, saw its shares jump 12.5% in their Hong Kong trading debut. This initial public offering (IPO), the largest globally this year, raised HK$35.7 billion (US$4.6 billion) and propelled Hong Kong to the second spot in global IPO rankings. The gain suggests strong demand for CATL's shares, as it aims to increase its control of the global EV battery market. Retail investors in Hong Kong borrowed more than HK$282 billion in margin financing to bid for CATL, or 105 times the value of shares allocated to them in the offering.</p>
