          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has indicated that a trade agreement with China is likely to be reached before a November deadline for new reciprocal tariffs. Speaking with CNBC, Bessent conveyed growing productivity in talks, suggesting that China now views a deal as a real possibility. The potential agreement aims to address the significant U.S. trade deficit with China, which stood at nearly $300 billion in 2024 but is on pace to decline. U.S. officials anticipate the deficit will narrow by at least 30% this year, moving towards a more balanced and fair trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old student responsible for a school shooting in Evergreen, Colorado, reportedly posted neo-Nazi and white supremacist content on platforms like TikTok before the attack. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) revealed the teen showed interest in past mass shootings, including Columbine, and collected tactical gear adorned with extremist symbols. The FBI had been previously tipped off about the shooter's online activities, highlighting ongoing concerns about the role of online radicalization in fostering ideologically-motivated violence. The shooter took his own life after injuring two classmates.</p>

          <p>Technology firm Oracle is reportedly part of a consortium of companies involved in a framework deal that would allow TikTok to continue its U.S. operations. While the final structure remains unclear, the agreement involves multiple firms and aims to address national security concerns raised by U.S. officials over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. This development follows a 2024 law requiring ByteDance to divest from TikTok or face a ban, a deadline President Trump has repeatedly delayed. Oracle has an existing partnership with TikTok to manage U.S. user data on its servers.</p>

He called for clear leadership and a defined plan for taking the companies private, likening the current lack of an independent board to the governance issues that plagued WeWork.

          <p>An opinion article in the South China Morning Post speculates that the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk could inadvertently lead to calmer U.S.-China relations. The author argues that the event may push the Trump administration to focus more intensely on domestic issues like border security and internal culture wars. This inward focus, combined with existing constraints on American hard power, could result in a more accommodative foreign policy toward China. The piece suggests that as the U.S. grapples with internal division, its ambitions for global containment might be reined in.</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified what may be the world's oldest known mummies, dating back up to 12,000 years, across various sites in Southeast Asia. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that hunter-gatherer communities intentionally smoke-dried the bodies of their dead over fires. This practice, which predates the famous Egyptian and Chinchorro mummies by millennia, was likely performed to preserve a connection with ancestors. The findings indicate that this form of mummification may have been a common and long-standing tradition across a vast region.</p>

The lawsuit, filed in Florida, specifically cites a 2024 book by two Times reporters and three related articles, claiming they were published with "actual malice" during a presidential election to inflict maximum damage.

          <p>A trend known as "job hugging" is emerging as American workers are choosing to stay in their current roles amid a cooling labor market. The voluntary quits rate has fallen to its lowest sustained level since 2016, with fewer people changing jobs compared to previous years. Labor economists attribute this to weakened job growth and a slower hiring pace, making it harder to find new employment. Career experts advise that while staying put can feel safer, employees should avoid complacency and actively seek internal growth opportunities to remain valuable and secure in their positions.</p>

The incident was not penalized on the field but was later reviewed by a citing commissioner. Although Berthoumieu admitted the act was worthy of a red card, she is appealing the length of the suspension. The ban would rule her out for the remainder of the tournament and beyond, a significant blow to France's championship hopes as they prepare to face England in the semi-final.</p>

          <p>U.S. Vice President JD Vance has publicly endorsed a mass "doxing" effort targeting individuals perceived as insufficiently mournful of conservative activist Charlie Kirk's death. While guest-hosting Kirk's podcast, Vance encouraged listeners to "call them out" and even contact their employers. This endorsement comes as numerous people have already been fired for their comments, and an anonymous website is collecting tens of thousands of submissions to identify critics. The campaign has raised fears of a draconian crackdown on free speech and has drawn comparisons to McCarthyism.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has directed the Investigatory Powers Commissioner to launch a new investigation into how the security service MI5 provided false evidence to three separate courts. The case involves MI5's handling of a neo-Nazi informant, known as Agent X, who used his protected status to coerce and attack his girlfriend. MI5 had falsely claimed to courts that it had not confirmed the agent's identity to the BBC, a position it maintained until recordings proved otherwise. Previous internal inquiries were deemed to have "serious procedural deficiencies" by the courts.</p>

          <p>Maria Caulfield, a former Conservative health minister who lost her parliamentary seat in the last general election, has defected to Nigel Farage's Reform UK party. She is the 15th former Tory MP to join the right-wing party, following the recent defection of sitting MP Danny Kruger. Caulfield stated that she joined Reform because the Conservative Party no longer aligns with her beliefs and predicted that those who are "Conservative right-minded" will see their future with Reform. The move represents another challenge to the Conservative Party as it struggles with internal divisions.</p>

          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk has reported promising late-stage trial results for its new obesity treatment, Cagrilinitide. A phase 3 trial showed that patients taking the once-weekly injection lost an average of 11.8% of their body weight after 68 weeks. Cagrilinitide is an amylin analogue, a different class of drug from existing GLP-1 treatments like Wegovy, and appears to be well-tolerated with mainly mild gastrointestinal side effects. The results are a positive step in the company's search for a next-generation blockbuster weight-loss drug amid increasing competition.</p>

Staff describe a climate of fear, with warnings against speaking to the media and plummeting morale.

Remembered as a brutal exploration of human endurance, the fight was the final, decisive chapter in their rivalry.

          <p>Reflecting on a 2022 off-the-record interview, a reporter from The Atlantic shares insights into the mission of the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kirk revealed that he saw his primary goal not as winning elections but as achieving a multi-decade cultural and educational transformation of American youth. He emphasized his focus on instilling Judeo-Christian values to build a "cogent worldview" and combat what he termed "Marxist" and "woke" ideologies. Kirk viewed his greatest accomplishment as establishing thousands of conservative chapters in high schools and colleges to create an "educational monolith."</p>

          <p>In an interview with Vox, Princeton historian Fara Dabhoiwala discusses the history of free speech, arguing that it is not a timeless, absolute ideal but a historically contingent and often weaponized concept. Dabhoiwala explains that speech is a form of action with real-world consequences, and its meaning is always dependent on context and power dynamics. The American tradition's move toward absolutism, particularly during the Cold War, is an exception globally and has struggled to address the power of media amplification. The discussion highlights the need for a more sophisticated public debate, especially in the digital age.</p>
