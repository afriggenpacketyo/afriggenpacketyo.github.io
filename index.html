          <p>Annie Farmer, an accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, is urging the government to release all related case files, stating that if there is "nothing to hide," the information should be public. She expressed frustration with the politicization of the case, feeling that victims are being used while substantive questions remain unanswered. Farmer also conveyed concern over the recent firing of prosecutor Maureen Comey and the suggestion of pardoning Ghislaine Maxwell. Her call for transparency is renewed by the recent death of fellow accuser Virginia Giuffre, reinforcing her desire to understand the justice system's failures.</p>

          <p>The pilot of a SkyWest flight executed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a mid-air collision with a B-52 military bomber near Minot, North Dakota. In an announcement to passengers, the pilot explained that air traffic control, which operates visually without radar, had not warned him about the converging military aircraft. The B-52 was in the area for a pre-approved flyover of the North Dakota State Fair. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, noting that the air traffic control tower is operated by a private company, not FAA employees.</p>

          <p>Harco National Insurance Company has filed a lawsuit against actor Justin Baldoni and his company, Wayfarer Studios, seeking a declaration that it is not obligated to cover the claims from Blake Lively's sexual harassment lawsuit. The insurer argues that its policies were issued after Lively and others had already complained of harassment during the production of the film "It Ends With Us." Harco's suit claims that Wayfarer failed to disclose these existing circumstances when applying for the liability policies, which would exclude any resulting claims from coverage. Lively's lawsuit against Baldoni is scheduled for trial in March 2026.</p>

          <p>A non-profit organization in Connecticut is working to restore the health of the Long Island Sound by returning used oyster shells to the water. The group, Collective Oyster Recycling and Restoration, collects discarded shells from local restaurants, allows them to cure for a year, and then deposits them back into the Sound. These old shells provide an ideal surface for new baby oysters to grow, which in turn helps filter the water, prevent erosion, and create a habitat for hundreds of other marine species. The initiative represents a grassroots effort to rebuild a critical part of the local aquatic ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Scientists have observed that the Earth is spinning faster, causing days to be marginally shorter, with July 10 being the shortest day of the year so far. This acceleration, driven by factors like the moon's gravity and Earth's liquid core, could eventually require timekeepers to subtract a "negative leap second" from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for the first time ever. Such a change, which has never been tested, raises concerns for computer systems and telecommunications that rely on precise timekeeping. Interestingly, climate change's melting ice has slightly counteracted this speed-up by slowing the planet's rotation.</p>

          <p>A 2006 interview from "The Howard Stern Show" has resurfaced amid heightened scrutiny of President Trump's past, particularly his association with Jeffrey Epstein. In the clip, when asked about a minimum sexual "age limit," Trump responded by saying he didn't want to be like a disgraced congressman associated with "12-year-olds." This unearthed conversation is gaining attention following the release of a DOJ memo stating there was no Epstein client list and a report about a "bawdy" note Trump allegedly sent Epstein. The context of these past remarks is now being re-examined by the public.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's border czar, Tom Homan, has announced a plan to "flood the zone" in sanctuary cities with increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. This escalation in the administration's deportation drive follows the shooting of an off-duty officer in New York City, allegedly by an undocumented person. Homan stated that if local jails do not cooperate, ICE will make arrests in the community, detaining anyone present who is in the country illegally.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis from The Atlantic argues that Donald Trump's presidency is animated not by a guiding policy belief, but by a culture of pettiness, anger, and retribution. The article cites examples such as renaming military bases, barring a former intelligence director from a CIA event for a dog named after his late wife, and pressuring the Fed chairman. The author contends that even major policy decisions, like a recent shift on arms to Ukraine, appear driven by personal emotion—in this case, anger at Vladimir Putin for making Trump look weak—rather than a coherent strategy, creating a capricious and unstable administration.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security will begin using military bases in New Jersey and Indiana to detain immigrants, following approval from the Pentagon. The plan also includes increasing detention capacity at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. This move is part of the Trump administration's effort to expand detention space as it ramps up arrests of people in the country illegally. The bases in Indiana and New Jersey will each have space for up to 1,000 people, while Guantanamo's capacity will be doubled to 400, supporting removal operations from various U.S. regions.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Emil Bove, one of President Trump's most controversial judicial nominees, suggesting his nomination signals a new direction for the administration's court-shaping efforts. During his first term, Trump relied heavily on the Federalist Society to select judges with a conservative, originalist philosophy. Bove's nomination, however, is presented as part of a new phase in the machinery of judicial appointments. The piece explores whether he represents a different kind of nominee as the administration restarts its push to fill the federal bench, moving beyond the previous mold.</p>

          <p>According to a new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), President Trump's latest tax bill is projected to add $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The bill makes permanent the 2017 tax cuts and introduces new ones, resulting in $4.5 trillion in lost revenue. This deficit is only partially offset by $1.1 trillion in savings from cuts to Medicaid and food stamp programs, which are estimated to leave 10 million Americans without health insurance. The bill also boosts funding for immigration enforcement, contributing to its overall cost. (not investment advice)</p>
