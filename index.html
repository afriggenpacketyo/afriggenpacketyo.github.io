        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ford CEO Jim Farley anticipates that U.S. sales of electric vehicles could be cut in half, dropping from a market share of around 10% to 5%, following the termination of the $7,500 federal tax incentive. Farley noted that the industry has learned customers find high-priced EVs interesting but too expensive, suggesting that hybrid vehicles represent an easier transition for consumers at present. The policy change requires Ford and other automakers to reassess their battery plant and EV production capacity, creating stress on an industry that had been operating under a more predictable policy environment.</p>

          <p>A group of House Democrats has raised concerns that the Trump administration is seizing the tax refunds of defaulted student loan borrowers without providing the legally required 60-day notice. After a pandemic-era pause, the resumption of these collections has reportedly led to severe financial hardship for families, including evictions. Lawmakers argue that notices issued years ago are insufficient, as borrowers' life circumstances have likely changed, and that the gutting of the Federal Student Aid office exacerbates the problem by leaving profiles outdated.</p>

          <p>Florida state leaders have officially approved the construction of Donald Trump's presidential library on a 2.6-acre plot next to Miami's historic Freedom Tower. The decision came after Miami Dade College's board agreed to transfer the land to the state, a move championed by Governor Ron DeSantis. The plan has drawn sharp criticism and protests from some students and community members, who argue it blemishes the symbolic importance of the Freedom Tower, which once served as a processing center for Cuban refugees fleeing communism.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced an agreement with Pfizer to voluntarily lower U.S. drug prices, with the company committing to sell medications to Medicaid at the lowest price offered in other developed nations. As part of the deal, Pfizer will also invest $70 billion in U.S. manufacturing and be exempt from potential pharmaceutical tariffs for three years. The administration is launching a website, TrumpRx.gov, where consumers can directly purchase popular Pfizer drugs like Eucrisa and Duavee at discounts of up to 85%, a move that follows pressure from Trump's "most favored nation" policy.</p>

          <p>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, in collaboration with the FBI and ICE, conducted a major operation in Minneapolis called "Operation Twin Shield," targeting immigration fraud. The investigation reviewed 1,000 cases and found issues in 275, including instances of sham marriages for citizenship, elder abuse and exploitation, and the use of a fabricated death certificate. This operation is the first of its kind following a new rule expanding USCIS's law enforcement duties, signaling a more aggressive enforcement posture under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>With a midnight deadline approaching, congressional leaders from both parties are engaged in a blame game over a potential government shutdown. Senate Majority Leader John Thune is pushing for a "clean" short-term funding bill passed by the House, accusing Democrats of partisan obstruction. In contrast, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer insists Republicans will own the shutdown for refusing to negotiate on Democratic priorities, such as restoring Medicaid funding and extending Obamacare subsidies.

          <p>Federal prosecutors are seeking a prison sentence of 11 years and three months for Sean “Diddy” Combs, who was convicted this summer on two counts of transporting individuals for prostitution. In their sentencing memo, prosecutors described Combs as "unrepentant" and argued a substantial term is necessary due to the seriousness of his crimes, which involved violence and fear. The recommendation contrasts sharply with the defense's request for a sentence of no more than 14 months, citing Combs's rehabilitation while incarcerated. The sentencing is scheduled for Friday.</p>

          <p>Greek labor unions have called for a general strike to protest a controversial government bill that could allow for a 13-hour workday and a six-day work week in certain sectors. The government claims these measures would be voluntary exceptions to address company needs and would increase flexibility. However, unions and labor experts argue the reforms legalize labor rights violations, will harm productivity, and give employees minimal bargaining power against forced overtime. Despite Greeks already working the most hours in the EU, the proposed changes aim to further liberalize the labor market.</p>

          <p>Spotify announced that its co-founder and CEO, Daniel Ek, will transition to the role of executive chairman, effective January 1, 2026. He will be succeeded by current co-presidents Gustav Söderström and Alex Norström, who will serve as co-CEOs. Ek stated the change formalizes the company's existing operational structure, as he has already delegated much of the day-to-day management to his successors. In his new role, Ek will focus on long-term strategy and supporting the senior leadership team of the streaming giant he has led for nearly two decades.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's market capitalization exceeded $4.5 trillion after its stock reached a new record high, fueled by a series of major AI infrastructure agreements. The chipmaker's value has been bolstered by a deal to take an equity stake of up to $100 billion in OpenAI and build out its data centers, a project expected to cost hundreds of billions. This growth reflects Nvidia's central role in the AI boom, as its GPUs are estimated to comprise about 70% of the spending on new AI data centers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has outlined plans to reopen the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to new applicants in compliance with a federal court order. While the program has been closed to new entrants since 2021, a 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling mandates its partial reopening. Under the plan, new applicants outside of Texas will be eligible for deportation protection and work permits, but Texas-based applicants will only receive deportation deferrals.

          <p>In a speech to top military commanders, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a major cultural overhaul for the U.S. military, declaring an end to what he termed "woke" policies.

Hegseth stated the changes are designed to restore a "warrior ethos" and end a culture of being "overly sensitive," arguing that such policies had caused the military to lose its way.

          <p>Despite facing arrests and the threat of prison, Russia's underground music scene continues to be a powerful form of political resistance against the Kremlin's war and repression. Musicians perform banned anti-war songs in public spaces, echoing the role artists played during the final years of the Soviet Union. The government has designated many popular artists as foreign agents and outlawed their music, but this has often backfired, increasing their popularity. This growing movement offers a rare sign of hope and defiance among young Russians disillusioned with the current regime.</p>

          <p>Booking separate flights to create a "self-transfer" itinerary can offer significant savings but comes with substantial risks, as explained in this travel advice article. While online travel agents may offer attractively priced self-connect options, passengers are not protected if the first flight is delayed, causing them to miss their onward connection. The article advises that travelers must be properly documented for the connecting country, even if they plan to remain airside. To mitigate risk, building in a long buffer, such as an overnight stay, is a much safer strategy than relying on short connection times.</p>

This is the second arrest in the case, following the detention of another Ukrainian in Italy last month. Investigators believe the suspects used a yacht rented in Germany to carry out the sabotage, though no state involvement has been proven.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's new framework for ending the Gaza war has significant momentum, backed by key Arab nations and conditionally accepted by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. However, the plan's primary weakness is its ambiguity and lack of specific details, a common feature of Trump's diplomatic efforts. While it vaguely mentions a pathway to Palestinian statehood, Netanyahu has already publicly stated he would "forcibly resist" such an outcome. This fundamental disagreement highlights how the plan's success hinges on navigating two vastly different interpretations of what it ultimately means for the region.</p>
