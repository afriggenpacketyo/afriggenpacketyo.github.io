          <p>A worker at the North River Wastewater Resource Recovery Facility in Upper Manhattan died after an explosion on a barge transporting raw sewage. The incident occurred when a compartment holding waste exploded, throwing the worker into the water and pinning him between the vessel and the pier. Two other employees were hospitalized but are in stable condition, and the cause of the explosion is under investigation, with preliminary information suggesting it may be linked to construction work on board. The New York City Department of Environmental Protection stated that operations were not affected and there was no environmental damage, and Mayor Eric Adams expressed condolences and committed to a full investigation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ESPN analyst Jay Williams suggests that 'cancel culture' may be a contributing factor to the NBA's recent drought of American MVP winners, with the last American MVP being James Harden in 2018. Williams argues that today's players are overly sensitive and that coaches are hesitant to coach them hard due to fear of backlash. He advocates for coaches to instill accountability and allow players to face adversity, and also states that international players have dominated the MVP race recently, with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Nikola Jokic, and Giannis Antetokounmpo being the top three finalists. Jayson Tatum was the highest American finisher, in fourth place.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its conflict with Harvard University by threatening to block its enrollment of foreign students, citing concerns over left-wing ideologies dominating the university's teaching and research. This action follows the freezing of billions in federal funds and accusations of antisemitism at pro-Palestinian demonstrations. Harvard is resisting these demands, arguing that they violate freedom of speech, and has sued the administration, securing a temporary block on the order. The administration also plans to impose heavy taxes on university endowments, potentially costing Harvard hundreds of millions annually.</p>

          <p>Despite Israel allowing a limited number of aid trucks into Gaza, humanitarian agencies warn of an impending famine due to insufficient supplies and logistical hurdles. While nearly 200 trucks have crossed through the Kerem Shalom crossing, this is a fraction of the 600 trucks needed daily to support the population of two million. Supplies are stuck at distribution points due to security clearance delays, and convoys face obstructions from bombings, looting, and damaged roads.

          <p>Iranian director Jafar Panahi won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for his film "It Was Just an Accident," marking a triumph for the filmmaker who has faced decades of censorship and imprisonment. The film, shot in secret, confronts state violence and repression, telling the story of ex-prisoners seeking revenge on their torturer. Panahi, who was previously banned from filmmaking and international travel, insisted that he is simply doing the only thing he knows how, despite the challenges he faces.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter on May 1, leading to two commercial planes aborting their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred as the helicopter neared the Pentagon, and the cause is believed to be a temporary antenna's location. The FAA also had difficulty tracking the helicopter's location, and the Army has paused all flights into and out of the Pentagon while addressing safety issues, and the NTSB is leading the investigation.</p>
