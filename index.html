          <p>Alphabet's autonomous vehicle unit, Waymo, is expanding its U.S. presence by beginning test drives in Denver and Seattle. Initially, these robotaxis will operate with human safety drivers behind the wheel to manually gather data before the company validates the technology for fully autonomous services. This expansion follows Waymo's commercial operations in cities like Austin, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. The company will deploy up to a dozen vehicles in each new city, utilizing its electric Jaguar I-Pace and Geely Zeekr models for the tests.</p>

          <p>Veteran defense attorney Abbe Lowell is representing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook after President Trump attempted to unilaterally fire her, a move unprecedented in U.S. history. Lowell, who has represented high-profile clients from both political parties, including Hunter Biden and Jared Kushner, is challenging what he calls the Trump administration's repeated overreach of authority. He has filed a lawsuit on Cook's behalf, arguing that the unsubstantiated allegations of mortgage fraud against her do not meet the legal standard of "for cause" removal required by the Federal Reserve Act.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ruled on the penalties for Google's illegal monopoly in the online search market, ordering the company to end exclusive default search engine contracts but stopping short of forcing a sale of its Chrome browser. The ruling, by District Judge Amit Mehta, addresses the company's anticompetitive practices by requiring it to share some search data with rivals to foster competition. This decision concludes the remedies phase of a landmark antitrust case initiated by the Department of Justice in 2020, which found Google had unlawfully maintained its dominance in online search.</p>

In a recent interview, he stated that while he is open to debating policy issues like tax rates, he finds it impossible to engage in conversations with people who hold certain beliefs he considers extreme, such as the idea that men can get pregnant. Teixeira suggested that the political left has shifted dramatically, creating a wide gap that is difficult to bridge and distracting from what he views as the real concerns of everyday Americans.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to send National Guard troops to Chicago to address violent crime, stating, "We're going in." This potential move has drawn immediate criticism from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who called the comments "unhinged" and vowed to fight any such deployment in court. The president did not provide a specific timeline or detail the number of troops but asserted his authority to act even without a request from the governor. The action would follow similar controversial deployments of federal forces in other U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's stock surged 8% in after-hours trading following a federal judge's ruling on its landmark antitrust case. Investors reacted positively as the decision did not require Google to sell its lucrative Chrome browser, a penalty the Department of Justice had sought. While the ruling bars Google from engaging in exclusive contracts to be the default search engine, it allows the company to continue making payments for product placement. The market's relief reflects a sentiment that the penalties are manageable and not as severe as they could have been for the tech giant.</p>

Kohberger, who was a Ph.D. student in criminology at the time, was sentenced to life in prison without parole.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Howard Webb, chief of the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), has acknowledged that the decision to disallow a goal for Fulham in their recent match against Chelsea was an error. The goal, scored by Josh King, was overturned after a lengthy VAR intervention for a perceived foul in the build-up, a decision Fulham's manager called "unbelievable." Webb stated that the call was a "misjudgement" and did not meet the high threshold required for VAR to intervene and overturn an on-field decision. The official involved was subsequently stood down from his next match.</p>

          <p>The rapper Drake has placed a $300,000 bet on world No. 1 Jannik Sinner to win the US Open, a wager that would pay out over half a million dollars. Drake is famously associated with the "Drake Curse," a phenomenon where athletes or teams he supports often suffer unexpected losses. His betting history in tennis includes a losing wager on Taylor Fritz against Sinner in a previous US Open final. Despite his track record, the Canadian artist continues to place high-profile bets on major sporting events, adding a layer of cultural theater to the competitions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With high interest rates making credit card debt increasingly expensive, managing a significant balance like $20,000 requires a clear strategy. Financial experts suggest several methods, including working with a debt relief company for management or settlement programs, which can negotiate lower rates. Another option is a debt consolidation loan, which combines multiple debts into a single payment, often at a lower interest rate. Individuals can also adopt payment strategies like the "debt avalanche" (paying highest interest first) or "debt snowball" (paying smallest balance first) to systematically eliminate their debt.

The men, who had all served criminal sentences in the U.S. and were released, were unexpectedly sent to the southern African nation in July. Lawyers report they are unable to have private conversations with their clients, who are being held in a maximum-security facility. This action is part of a broader Trump administration strategy of deporting certain migrants to third countries, raising significant human rights concerns.</p>

          <p>A former police officer in West Palm Beach, Florida, has been arrested on charges of battery and false imprisonment following allegations of sexual misconduct while on duty. A woman reported that the officer, Justise Feeley-Carim, solicited her for sexual favors after approaching her vehicle in a parking lot.

The police department fired Feeley-Carim, who was still in his probationary period, shortly after the incident was reported, stating that its officers are held to the highest standards and will be held accountable.</p>

For now, the tariffs remain in place under a temporary stay, and logistics professionals report that most shippers are awaiting a final decision before making any changes, adding to the volatility that has defined global trade in 2025.

          <p>President Trump has announced his decision to relocate the headquarters of U.S. Space Command from Colorado to Huntsville, Alabama. This move reverses a Biden administration decision to keep the command in Colorado Springs, which was made over concerns that a move could risk military readiness. Trump, joined by Alabama senators, argued the relocation to "Rocket City" would bring jobs and investment while helping the U.S. dominate space. The decision carries political undertones, moving the headquarters from a state that has become more Democratic to a reliably Republican one.</p>

The loss is England's third consecutive thrashing in the 50-over format and raises questions about player fatigue and preparation amid a packed schedule.
