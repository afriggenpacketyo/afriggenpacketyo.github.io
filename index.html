          <p>A Turkish-born florist was murdered near Nuremberg in 2000, one of ten people of Turkish or Greek origin killed by the far-right extremist National Socialist Underground (NSU). The case raised questions about how the NSU could operate for years without detection. In Munich, Hanna S. faces a nine-year sentence for allegedly attacking neo-Nazis in Budapest in 2023. Prosecutors claim she belongs to a militant left-wing extremist group involved in violence tourism, while the defense argues the event was a neo-Nazi show without clear evidence against S. S. and others are accused of attacking three people and have surrendered to German authorities to avoid extradition to Hungary. The trial began in February, with a verdict expected this month.</p>

          <p>Multinational companies are increasing investment allocations to sectors such as high-end manufacturing, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals in China, according to HSBC co-CEO David Liao Yi-chien. MNCs remain optimistic about consumption-related industries like fast-moving consumer goods. This reorientation reflects China's position as a global market for driving innovation, consumption, and growth. China ranks as the top target market for companies looking to increase their global trade capabilities, with 40% planning to increase manufacturing in China over the next two years. China continues to attract international investment due to its vast market size, comprehensive industrial facilities, dynamic innovation ecosystem, and abundant talent.</p>

          <p>With Ishiba's resignation as Japan's prime minister due to the end of US tariff negotiations, Japan's new leader will have to navigate the complex relationship with China. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian declined to comment on the resignation, calling it an internal matter for Japan. Analysts expect Tokyo to continue viewing Beijing as a strategic competitor. The new leader will need to balance economic interests with security concerns in the region, requiring careful diplomacy and strategic planning.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The populist right, from Washington to Westminster, is attempting to rewrite history to dismantle democracy and erode rights for vulnerable communities. The Trump administration sought to replace "divisive" exhibits with "historical" ones, targeting Black, Latino, and LGBTQ+ experiences. This cultural war is a narrative doorway for laws that terminate DEI initiatives, racial equity programs, and disability rights compliance. Similarly, Reform UK wants a "patriotic" British history that downplays imperialism and the slave trade. This rewriting erases the memory of mid-20th century democratic expansion and seeks to unpick the social contract of the liberal order, requiring cross-communal solidarities to defend the wins of the 20th century.</p>

          <p>Nvidia-backed Mistral AI has achieved a $13.8 billion valuation in a Series C funding round, with Dutch chip equipment maker ASML securing a major stake. ASML invested 1.3 billion euros in Mistral AI's 1.7 billion-euro funding round, gaining an 11% shareholding. This more than doubles Mistral's previous valuation of 5.8 billion euros, reflecting the booming AI industry. Mistral, a European rival to OpenAI, is building large language models for AI applications and requires significant infrastructure investments. Mistral is launching its first reasoning model to compete with OpenAI and China's DeepSeek, marking a significant step in its development.</p>

          <p>Apple is set to unveil its next iPhone lineup amid a global trade war that could lead to higher prices. These iPhones are expected to be manufactured in China and India, despite the Trump administration's insistence on domestic production. While Cook has pledged investments in the U.S., iPhones still face tariffs, potentially raising prices by $50 to $100. The new lineup is expected to have minor updates, including camera and battery improvements, and possibly an ultra-thin “Air” model. Analysts question Apple's innovation in the AI era, noting that the company's stock has been weighed down by trade war concerns and AI delays.</p>

China's President Xi Jinping warned against "Hegemonism, unilateralism, and protectionism," urging BRICS nations to unite. India sees BRICS as an economic initiative, while China and Russia view it as a geopolitical grouping. Jaishankar emphasized the need for expeditious solutions to address trade deficits, highlighting the record high of $99.21 billion with China.

          <p>Thailand's Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra must serve a one-year prison term for previous convictions on graft and abuse of power charges. The court investigated whether officials mishandled his return to Thailand in 2023 and found that his detention in a police hospital did not count as serving prison time. Thaksin's eight-year sentence had been commuted to one year by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, and he was released on parole after six months in the hospital. Thaksin is expected to be sent to the Bangkok Remand Prison following the ruling, marking a significant development in Thai politics.</p>

          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson claims the city received no notice of Homeland Security's "Operation Midway Blitz," a ramped-up immigration enforcement effort. DHS stated the operation targets criminal illegal aliens drawn to Chicago due to sanctuary policies. Gov. JB Pritzker accused the Trump administration of lacking communication and coordination. Johnson opposes militarized immigration enforcement due to ICE's history of abuses. The operation follows President Trump's invocation of "Apocalypse Now" imagery, promising deportations in Chicago. Sen. Dick Durbin criticized the administration for targeting hardworking immigrants, and the announcement is triggering strong reactions from both sides.</p>

          <p>A US congressional panel has released a redacted copy of Jeffrey Epstein's "birthday book" from 2003, along with his will and personal address book. The book contains messages and photos, including a letter purportedly signed by President Trump, which he denies writing. The release also includes entries from Bill Clinton and Lord Peter Mandelson. Chairman James Comer criticized Democratic members for politicizing the information. The book is divided into categories like "friends," "business," and "science," though names under "family" and "girl friends" are redacted. These people are not accused of any legal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein's case.</p>

          <p>A former Meta employee has filed a lawsuit alleging that WhatsApp has "systemic cybersecurity failures" that compromise user privacy. Attaullah Baig, WhatsApp's former head of security, claims Meta retaliated against him after he reported the security issues. Baig alleges that 1,500 WhatsApp engineers had unrestricted access to user data without detection. Meta disputes the allegations, downplaying Baig's role and stating that security is a priority. Baig's attorneys claim he faced retaliation after his cybersecurity disclosures and filed complaints with the SEC and OSHA. The lawsuit raises concerns about user data protection and regulatory compliance.</p>

The contest coincides with a perceived shift to the right within the government, causing unease among some party members. The selection of Rayner's replacement could reveal the party's ideological leanings and its approach to governing, as the Prime Minister must determine the new deputy's role within the party.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch has voiced concerns that the UK may need an IMF bailout similar to the 1976 crisis, unless the government implements a plan for economic growth. She offered to work with Sir Keir Starmer to cut welfare spending, aiming to escape a "doom loop" of rising taxes and precarious public finances. Badenoch cited rising UK borrowing costs and a lack of growth as indicators of a potential crisis. She emphasized the need for a growth plan and offered an "olive branch" to the Prime Minister for collaboration, but a Labour Party source dismissed her advice given the Conservative's track record.</p>

          <p>President Trump's "Chipocalypse Now" meme, referencing the film "Apocalypse Now," has generated outrage and concern. The meme, posted on Trump's Truth Social account, depicted a military operation on Chicago, leading to criticism from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Senator Dick Durbin. The use of memetic warfare tactics, where manufactured content appears harmless, has been criticized as a form of subterfuge. Trump's response to questions about the meme was condescending, and he defended his plans to "clean up" cities. The Department of Homeland Security announced "Operation Midway Blitz," further intensifying the controversy.</p>
