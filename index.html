            <p>The Bank of Korea (BOK) decided to maintain its policy rate at 2.75% to stabilize the won, despite acknowledging that economic growth is likely to fall short of previous projections. This decision aligns with economists' expectations, as the bank aims to carefully evaluate domestic and international conditions, particularly in light of U.S. tariff policies and government stimulus measures. The South Korean government recently approved a 12 trillion won supplementary budget, including increased support for the semiconductor industry. The BOK also expressed concerns about exchange rate volatility and potential household debt increases. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Puerto Rico experienced another island-wide power outage, affecting 1.4 million customers and raising concerns about the fragility of the island's electrical system. LUMA Energy, the private power company responsible for transmission, cited a combination of factors, including a protection system failure and vegetation on a transmission line, as the cause. Restoration efforts are expected to take two to three days, with priority given to critical facilities. The outage has reignited criticism of LUMA and calls for grid reform, as residents face frequent blackouts and high electricity rates. </p>

            <p>Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem has canceled $2.7 million in grants to Harvard University, citing concerns about anti-American and pro-Hamas ideologies on campus. The university has been ordered to submit visa records by April 30, potentially risking its certification to enroll international students. The canceled grants include funding for violence prevention and public health messaging programs deemed ideologically skewed. This action follows President Trump's move to freeze federal funding and request a review of Harvard's tax-exempt status amid broader scrutiny of campus antisemitism.</p>

            <p>The UK's leading business organizations are calling for urgent revisions to the government's Employment Rights Bill, warning that the proposed reforms could hinder economic growth during an uncertain period. The bill aims to enhance workers' rights, including guaranteed hours and protection against unfair dismissal, but businesses fear it could discourage hiring and increase administrative costs. While supporting the government's goals of improving productivity and wages, the groups argue that the bill's current form could damage employment and undermine economic objectives. The government insists the bill will deliver the biggest upgrade to workers' rights in a generation. </p>

            <p>The Los Angeles County District Attorney is seeking a delay in the resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, requesting that the court obtain a risk assessment report from the parole board. This report is part of Governor Newsom's clemency review process for the brothers, who were convicted of murdering their parents. The DA's office, under Nathan Hochman, has expressed opposition to releasing the Menendez brothers and has accused former DA George Gascón of political opportunism in revisiting the case. The resentencing hearing has been delayed multiple times, and the DA's latest move adds another layer of complexity to the proceedings.</p>

            <p>Puerto Rico experienced a complete power outage, leaving the island's 1.4 million customers without electricity as residents prepared for the Easter weekend.

The senator's visit aimed to address the deportation and the Trump administration's refusal to facilitate his return, leading to accusations of a constitutional crisis.

Experts agree that diagnosis rates are increasing and environmental factors may be involved, but also note that the definition of autism has broadened, which contributes to the higher numbers.

            <p>U.S. consumers are reportedly "panic-buying" Korean beauty products in anticipation of potential tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Retailers are seeing increased demand as customers stock up on items like sunscreen and serums, fearing price increases. The tariffs could significantly impact the cosmetics industry, which relies on imports from South Korea and other countries. The Personal Care Products Council has expressed concern about higher prices for consumers, while small business owners worry about the uncertainty and potential disruption to their supply chains.

            <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that President Trump's tariffs could create a "challenging scenario" for the central bank, potentially leading to both higher inflation and slower economic growth. Powell reiterated that the tariffs are larger than anticipated and will likely have significant economic effects. He emphasized the Fed's ability to remain patient and assess the impact of these policies before making changes to interest rates. However, some Fed officials have expressed differing views on the severity and persistence of the inflationary effects of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

The study highlights improved screening and access to autism services, but also suggests a potential underlying increase in cases. Disparities in autism prevalence were observed among different racial and ethnic groups.
