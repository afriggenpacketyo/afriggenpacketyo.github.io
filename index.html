          <p>An explosion near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, has been declared an intentional act of terrorism by the FBI, resulting in one death and multiple injuries. The blast, which occurred on Saturday morning, damaged several buildings and shattered windows across the downtown area. Authorities are investigating the incident, with the FBI leading the probe into what they believe was a targeted attack on the clinic. The clinic itself confirmed that staff and stored materials were unharmed, and they anticipated reopening soon, as the investigation continues to unfold and the community grapples with the aftermath of this violent event. </p>

The U.S. Secret Service interviewed Comey about the post, and the FBI is in communication with the Secret Service regarding the incident. Bongino emphasized the FBI's commitment to supporting federal law enforcement partners in investigating threats against public officials, highlighting ongoing efforts to reform the agency and restore integrity. </p>

          <p>The UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday, placed 19th despite delivering a vocally strong performance. The article suggests the song, "What The Hell Just Happened," a mix of musical styles, was too busy and lacked a clear identity for viewers. While the band's friendship and energy were evident, the staging was deemed less impactful than other competitors. Despite the disappointing result, the article notes that Remember Monday achieved the UK's highest score since 2017 (excluding Sam Ryder's 2022 success), laying a foundation for future entries. </p>

          <p>Israel has launched a major military operation in the Gaza Strip, dubbed "Operation Gideon Chariots," to pressure Hamas to release remaining hostages.

Humanitarian organizations warn of a rapidly worsening crisis in Gaza due to an ongoing blockade, with severe shortages of food, fuel, and medicine. The United States is actively involved in efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement that would release the hostages and end the blockade. </p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Walmart for blaming tariffs for potential price increases, urging the company to absorb the costs instead of passing them on to consumers. Walmart had warned that prices on various goods could rise due to tariffs on imported goods from China. Trump argued that Walmart, having made substantial profits, should "eat the tariffs" to maintain affordability for customers. A Walmart spokesperson responded that the company is committed to keeping prices as low as possible, despite the challenges posed by tariffs. </p>
