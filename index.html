            <p>A US judge has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with the deportation of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate detained for his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests. Khalil, a legal US resident, faces deportation under a Cold War-era law citing his presence as adverse to American foreign policy interests, despite not being charged with any crime. The ACLU has criticized the decision, calling it "pre-written" and alleging Khalil is being targeted solely for his speech. His legal team intends to appeal the ruling, arguing that evidence of antisemitism has not been presented, while the government maintains its efforts are to protect Jewish students.

            <p>The Navy has deployed the USS Stockdale, a guided-missile destroyer with prior experience repelling Houthi attacks, to support US Northern Command's southern border operations. This deployment aligns with President Trump's executive orders related to national security and border integrity. The Stockdale will join other Navy vessels already stationed at the border to curb illegal immigration and drug smuggling, working in conjunction with a U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment. The move is intended to reinforce the Department of Defense's efforts to support critical Department of Homeland Security capabilities gaps.</p>

            <p>A Los Angeles County judge has ruled that the resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez can proceed, despite opposition from the District Attorney's office. The brothers, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, are seeking a reduced sentence that would make them eligible for parole, citing years of abuse. The current DA attempted to withdraw a previous motion in favor of resentencing, arguing the brothers haven't fully taken responsibility. The judge's decision allows the proceedings to move forward, with relatives expressing relief and hope for justice after over 30 years of incarceration.</p>

            <p>President Trump underwent his annual physical exam at Walter Reed Hospital, the first of his second term, with limited details released immediately. The examination included various tests and imaging, and Trump reported taking a cognitive test, claiming he "got every answer right". While the White House promised a medical report soon, past physicals have been selective in the information disclosed. Trump's health has been a topic of discussion, particularly after an assassination attempt last year and his COVID-19 hospitalization in 2020, although his physician has stated his overall health is excellent.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans residing in the U.S., potentially leading to their deportation starting May 20. This decision reverses the Biden administration's previous extensions of TPS due to the ongoing conflict and instability in Afghanistan under Taliban rule. Critics argue that conditions in Afghanistan have worsened, leaving Afghans vulnerable, especially those who aided the U.S. government. The decision is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to overhaul immigration policies.</p>

The US tariff policy could negatively impact African exports, particularly from resource-rich countries like South Africa and those benefiting from the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). While the US has temporarily paused reciprocal tariffs, the escalating trade war with China, including increased tariffs on US exports, poses a significant risk to the continent if China's economy falters.

The crash has caused significant traffic disruptions, including the closure of North Military Trail and temporary closure of the I-95 overpass at Glades Road, as well as suspension of Tri-Rail service in the area.

The execution marks the fifth inmate killed by South Carolina in recent months, ending a 13-year pause on executions in the state.

            <p>Galway Downs, a 242-acre site in Temecula Valley, has been informed that it will no longer host equestrian events for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. The decision came after the Los Angeles City Council approved the site last month and LA28's venue master plan was approved by the International Olympic Committee executive board. Galway Downs owner Ken Smith expressed surprise at the sudden removal, but LA28 stated that it looks forward to sharing more on its updated Olympic venue plan in the near future. The city remains confident that Galway Downs will continue to host elite equestrian events.</p>

            <p>A glitch in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection system, which affected the code used to exempt freight from new Trump administration tariffs, has been resolved after lasting for over 10 hours. The glitch prevented the Automated Commercial Environment from accepting the lower duty rate of 10% for in-transit shipments filed since April 9. Customs has advised users to resubmit applicable entry summaries, and the incident has raised concerns about Customs' ability to handle the new policy and collect tariff revenue effectively. The uncertainty is adding to business anxiety amidst ongoing trade negotiations.</p>

His films explored themes of outsiders and people who don't know what's driving them, and he received a lifetime achievement award from the Directors Guild of Canada in 2011. Kotcheff's versatility allowed him to tap into the despair of post-Vietnam America as well as create unlikely cultural touchstones.</p>

Justice Department lawyers argued that they needed more time to review the order and that foreign affairs cannot operate on judicial timelines.

Burgum praised the use of genetic engineering technology and expressed a desire to reduce the need for the endangered species list altogether. He suggested focusing on innovation rather than regulation to improve species recovery efforts, noting that the current system resembles "Hotel California," where species never leave the list.

            <p>Analysts suggest that the record American tariffs imposed on Beijing could test its ability to withstand Western economic pressure in a potential crisis in the Taiwan Strait. If China weathers the tariffs, it may boost Beijing's confidence in facing potential Western sanctions in a future cross-strait conflict. The US has imposed tariffs of 145 per cent on Chinese imports, bringing the effective tariff rate to about 156 per cent. Washington opposes any unilateral change to the status quo and is committed to supplying arms for the island’s defence. (not investment advice)</p>
