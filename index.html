        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has resigned following days of violent nationwide protests, which resulted in at least 19 deaths. The unrest was initially sparked by a government ban on numerous social media platforms, a move that ignited widespread anger among the country's youth, who cited it as an attack on digital freedom and a distraction from government corruption. Despite the ban being repealed, the protests escalated, with demonstrators setting fire to government buildings and the homes of several politicians. The resignation is seen as an attempt to de-escalate the political crisis gripping the Himalayan nation.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's 'Make America Healthy Again' (MAHA) Commission has announced a new strategy that includes lifting the long-standing restrictions on whole milk in schools. This move is part of a broader plan with over 120 initiatives aimed at combating childhood chronic diseases, which also addresses issues like toxic food dyes and misleading health advertisements. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated the goal is to realign the nation's food and health systems based on scientific evidence rather than special interests. The policy shift would require updates to national dietary guidelines and USDA school nutrition standards.</p>

          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics has issued a significant downward revision, indicating the U.S. economy added 911,000 fewer jobs in the year ending March 2025 than initially reported. This annual benchmark revision, which is larger than economists had anticipated, suggests the labor market was cooling more substantially in the past year than previously understood. The data provides a clearer picture by better accounting for business openings and closures. Economists suggest this sign of a weaker labor market strengthens the case for the Federal Reserve to consider cutting interest rates in its upcoming meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Metro bus system in Akron, Ohio, has been named the national mass transit system of the year after a major overhaul led to a 24% increase in ridership. The transformation, spearheaded by CEO Dawn Distler, focused on directly addressing passenger needs by redesigning routes for better frequency, including 15-minute service on key lines, and expanding to seven-day-a-week operation. This was achieved without a budget increase, partly by hiring drivers based on customer service skills. The success highlights the impact of prioritizing passenger feedback in public transportation planning and operations.</p>

          <p>Recent data from The Nation's Report Card reveals a decline in average scores for eighth and twelfth-grade students in science, math, and reading between 2019 and 2024. The results, released by the National Center for Education Statistics, show that proficiency levels have dropped, with only 31% of eighth graders proficient in science and 22% of twelfth graders proficient in math. This report marks the first major post-pandemic assessment for these subjects and grades, highlighting a widening gap between the highest and lowest-performing students.

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has filed a federal charge against Decarlos Brown Jr. for the fatal stabbing of Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee, on a Charlotte light rail train. Brown is charged with committing an act causing death on a mass transportation system, which carries a maximum penalty of life in prison or death. Zarutska had fled the war in Ukraine and was living in the U.S. The attack has drawn national attention, with the Trump administration citing it as an example of failed "soft-on-crime" policies. The suspect has a long criminal history and was apprehended at the scene.</p>

          <p>A Michigan judge has dismissed all criminal charges against 15 Republicans who signed documents falsely claiming to be the state's official electors in the 2020 presidential election. District Court Judge Kristen D. Simmons ruled that the defendants, who believed Donald Trump's claims of voter fraud, did not act with criminal intent to forge documents but were instead exercising their constitutional rights based on their sincere beliefs. The judge noted they were not "savvy or sophisticated enough" to fully grasp the electoral process. Michigan's Attorney General, Dana Nessel, expressed disappointment and is considering an appeal of the decision.</p>

          <p>The Republican-controlled Missouri House has advanced a new congressional map designed to increase the GOP's advantage in the state's delegation from 6-2 to 7-1. This mid-decade redistricting effort, encouraged by President Trump, aims to shore up the party's narrow majority in the U.S. House by breaking up the Kansas City-based district of Democratic Rep. Emmanuel Cleaver. The move is part of a national trend, following similar partisan redistricting efforts in Texas and California.

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed plans that could remove the £100 cap on contactless card payments, potentially making them unlimited. The change would allow individual banks and card providers to set their own limits, bringing card payments in line with digital wallets on smartphones, which already have no cap. While the move aims to reduce "payment friction" for larger purchases like grocery shopping, it has raised concerns about fraud and theft. The FCA stated that card providers would be responsible for fraud losses and would be expected to implement robust security measures for high-value transactions.</p>

          <p>Apple's newly unveiled, ultra-thin iPhone Air features eSIM technology, completely replacing physical SIM cards, which could complicate its launch in mainland China. The country's regulators have been slow to adopt eSIM standards, and currently, only one of China's three major telecom carriers supports the technology. This regulatory hurdle may lead to a limited or staggered release of the new model in one of Apple's most important markets. Analysts suggest the delay could stem from concerns that eSIMs would make it too easy for users to switch carriers, potentially impacting the revenues of state-owned telecom companies.</p>

İmamoğlu, seen as Erdoğan's strongest potential rival for the presidency, was jailed on corruption charges that his supporters claim are politically motivated. His arrest has sparked the largest anti-government protests in Turkey in over a decade, with critics arguing that Erdoğan is dismantling democratic institutions and using the courts to eliminate political threats. The international response has been muted, which some analysts attribute to Turkey's critical geopolitical role.</p>

          <p>Voters in Northern Virginia's 11th congressional district are participating in a special election to fill the seat of the late Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly. The race pits Democrat James Walkinshaw, a former chief of staff to Connolly, against Republican Stewart Whitson. The district is heavily Democratic, and a victory for Walkinshaw would narrow the Republican majority in the House to 219-213. A key issue in the election has been President Trump's cuts to the federal workforce, as the district has one of the highest concentrations of federal employees in the country.</p>

          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, citing analysis from Goldman Sachs, companies that are aggressively repurchasing their own shares are being rewarded by investors, even as the overall pace of buybacks slows. These companies, dubbed "buyback aristocrats," have consistently reduced their share counts over the past decade and tend to perform well, particularly when the economy is slowing. Cramer highlighted Apple and Wells Fargo as examples where significant buybacks signal management's confidence in their companies' futures. This strategy is seen as a way to reduce the supply of stock and support share prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England delivered a commanding performance in their World Cup qualifier, defeating Serbia 5-0 in a decisive away match in Belgrade. The victory, described as the best of manager Thomas Tuchel's tenure, saw goals from Harry Kane, Noni Madueke, Ezri Konsa, and Marc Guehi. The team displayed strong attacking flair and defensive solidity, silencing the typically hostile home crowd from the start. The win solidifies England's position for World Cup qualification and provides Tuchel with positive selection dilemmas, as several younger players excelled in the absence of established starters like Jude Bellingham and Bukayo Saka.</p>

          <p>Wales head coach Craig Bellamy described the past week as challenging but valuable after his team's 1-0 friendly loss to Canada. Bellamy intentionally chose a strong opponent to expose his younger and less experienced players to a higher level of international competition. The match featured three debuts for Wales, and Bellamy emphasized the need for his squad to adapt to the speed and physicality of top-tier teams. While expressing his disappointment with the loss, he viewed the game as a crucial learning experience that will help develop players for Wales' future, providing a real-world example of top-level football.</p>

          <p>Shares of Oracle soared 27% in after-hours trading after the company projected massive future growth in its cloud infrastructure business, driven by major AI-related contracts. This optimistic forecast overshadowed the company's quarterly earnings and revenue, which narrowly missed analyst expectations. Oracle reported its remaining performance obligations, a measure of future contracted revenue, have skyrocketed to $455 billion, bolstered by deals with companies like OpenAI. The company now anticipates its cloud infrastructure revenue will reach $18 billion in fiscal year 2026, signaling its aggressive push to compete with larger cloud providers.

          <p>The White House is struggling to manage the fallout from newly released documents from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, including a birthday card allegedly signed by Donald Trump. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt has repeatedly denied the signature's authenticity, but the administration's defensive posture and refusal to release all Epstein-related files as promised has fueled speculation. This approach is uncharacteristic for Trump, who typically confronts scandals head-on. Critics and observers suggest the evasiveness and denials are backfiring, creating a perception that the president has something significant to hide regarding his relationship with the convicted sex offender.</p>

          <p>Israel's recent strike targeting Hamas leadership in Doha is being interpreted as a direct challenge to Qatar's long-standing relevance as a key international mediator. For years, the wealthy Gulf state has cultivated its role as an indispensable intermediary, hosting negotiations for opposing factions like the U.S., Iran, and the Taliban. This article argues that the attack on its sovereign territory suggests that Israel, and potentially the U.S., now view Qatar's mediation efforts in the Gaza conflict as a futile exercise. The move undermines Qatar's status as a safe ground for diplomacy and could reshape geopolitical dynamics in the region.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily blocked a lower court order that would have forced the Trump administration to spend nearly $5 billion in foreign aid. President Trump had previously informed Congress he would not spend the appropriated funds, which were designated for UN programs, development assistance, and peacekeeping, calling the spending wasteful. This move, known as a "pocket rescission," was challenged in court by aid groups. Chief Justice John Roberts issued the stay, pausing the spending requirement while the court considers the administration's appeal in this ongoing legal battle over presidential spending power.</p>

          <p>Australian regulators have approved the first-ever vaccine to protect endangered koalas from chlamydia, a disease that has devastated their populations. Developed over a decade by scientists at the University of the Sunshine Coast, the single-dose vaccine has been shown in trials to reduce mortality by at least 65%. Chlamydia is a major killer of koalas, causing blindness, infertility, and death, with infection rates reaching as high as 70% in some colonies. With this approval, researchers hope to secure funding for a large-scale rollout to wildlife hospitals and wild populations, offering new hope for the iconic species' survival.</p>

This move aims to enforce spending discipline and ensure the government adheres to its borrowing rules amid a volatile global economy. The decision comes as Reeves prepares to deliver her budget on November 26, facing pressure to control inflation while finding ways to stimulate economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed a new AI model, SpikingBrain 1.0, that reportedly runs up to 100 times faster on certain tasks than conventional systems. The model mimics the human brain's efficiency by only activating necessary neurons, allowing it to learn from significantly less training data while maintaining high speed. Notably, the system operates entirely on China's domestic MetaX chip platform, rather than relying on dominant Nvidia hardware. This development is strategically important for China's goal of achieving AI self-sufficiency amid U.S. export controls on advanced semiconductor technology.</p>

Explosions were reported in the city, and the Israel Defense Forces confirmed it conducted a "precise strike" against those it holds responsible for the October 7 attacks. Hamas acknowledged that members of its negotiating delegation were targeted but survived, though it reported that six other individuals, including the son of a chief negotiator and a Qatari security official, were killed. The attack occurred in a residential area, escalating tensions in a nation that has been central to ceasefire negotiations.</p>
