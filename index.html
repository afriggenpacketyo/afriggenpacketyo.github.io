          <p>The Trump administration fired Dr. Carla D. Hayden, the Librarian of Congress, sparking immediate backlash from Democrats. Hayden, the first African American and the first woman to hold the position, was notified of her termination via email from the White House Office of Personnel Management, which stated that her position was terminated effective immediately. Democratic leaders, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and House Administration Committee Ranking Member Joe Morelle, condemned the decision as unjust and unprecedented, with Morelle planning to introduce legislation to ensure Congressional appointment of the Librarian of Congress in the future.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese chipmaker SMIC fell nearly 7% after its first-quarter revenue missed estimates, despite a surge in profits. The company cited 'production fluctuations' for the shortfall, expecting the impact to extend into the second quarter. SMIC's capacity utilization reached nearly 90%, reflecting strong domestic demand for semiconductors, driven by government policies and changes in geopolitics. Despite these advancements, SMIC faces limitations in producing advanced chips due to U.S.-led export controls, hindering its ability to access critical chip-making equipment, even though it appears to be making some breakthroughs.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 01:01:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has suggested that the high tariffs imposed on goods from China may be reduced as trade officials from both countries prepare for talks in Switzerland. Trump indicated that tariffs are 'coming down' from the new import taxes of up to 145% imposed on China since his return to the White House. The upcoming meeting signals a potential de-escalation of the trade war, though analysts caution that negotiations are likely to be lengthy and any initial tariff cuts may be minor. Meanwhile, China's exports to the U.S. have fallen, but its overall exports have risen, demonstrating resilience in the face of trade tensions.</p>

          <p>New soil testing by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has revealed elevated lead levels in soil at homesites previously cleared by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers after recent wildfires. The tests found that around 27% of soil samples from scraped areas in the Eaton burn scar exceeded California's residential lead standards, raising concerns about potential health risks for residents rebuilding in the affected areas. County officials are now recommending that property owners conduct soil assessments before rebuilding, as some city and county permits have been issued without soil testing requirements. The county's findings contradict the federal government's decision not to conduct comprehensive soil testing after the fires, a decision that has been criticized by environmental and public health experts.</p>

          <p>Kaja Sokola, an ex-model, testified in Harvey Weinstein's retrial that he sexually assaulted her when she was 16, describing the alleged incident as the 'most horrifying thing' she had ever experienced to that point. She detailed how Weinstein allegedly ordered her to remove her blouse, touched her inappropriately, and warned her to stay silent about the incident. Weinstein denies the allegations and is on retrial after his conviction was overturned last year. The 73-year-old is not charged over the alleged sexual assault because it happened too long ago to bring criminal charges, however, he is facing charges over a later incident of alleged sexual assault.</p>

          <p>China's exports saw a significant increase in April, primarily fueled by a rise in shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which offset a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. due to recently implemented tariffs. Exports grew by 8.1% year-on-year, surpassing expectations, while imports slightly decreased. The surge in exports to ASEAN countries compensated for a 21% drop in shipments to the U.S., highlighting China's ability to adapt to trade pressures. However, analysts expect trade data to weaken in the coming months, pending potential resolutions in trade negotiations with the U.S.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a trade deal aimed at reducing tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The agreement, described as 'historic' by both Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump, seeks to alleviate the burden on British industries, particularly the car industry. While some tariffs will be reduced or eliminated, a 10% levy on most goods will remain, leaving the UK in a worse position than before the trade war. The deal also includes a clause allowing the US to object to Chinese firms investing in Britain, though the government disputes claims of a US 'veto'.</p>

Despite these obstacles, companies like Vestas and Orsted are reporting positive financial results, although their share prices remain below previous levels.

This move follows Trump's executive order prioritizing humanitarian relief for Afrikaners and cutting U.S. aid to South Africa.

          <p>Nearly 60 felony cases in Hanceville, Alabama, will be dismissed due to corruption within the local police department. A grand jury found a 'rampant culture of corruption' after four officers and the police chief were indicted on charges related to mishandling evidence. An audit revealed widespread issues with evidence documentation and missing items, leading to the disbandment and rebuilding of the department from scratch.</p>
