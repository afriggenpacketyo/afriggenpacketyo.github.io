          <p>A battle is brewing in Maids Moreton, England, over a plan to build 153 new homes in a village already struggling with an over-capacity sewage system.

          <p>A leaked recording reveals that a senior police officer had serious concerns about the arrest of Nicola Packer, a woman who took abortion pills when she was about 26 weeks pregnant. Packer was arrested in the hospital after delivering a stillborn baby at home and was later acquitted of illegally taking a substance with the intent to miscarry. The recording captures a 2020 meeting where officers questioned whether the arrest was in Packer's best interest, with one officer saying it's an uncomfortable area for police to be operating in. This case has sparked debate about patient confidentiality and the role of medical professionals in reporting suspected crimes.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese automakers are experiencing a second day of decline due to concerns about a potential price war and increased scrutiny from regulators. BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares fell as much as 4% after announcing price cuts on several models. The China commerce ministry is reportedly meeting with industry bodies and automakers regarding the practice of marking cars as sold to meet targets, with these zero-mileage cars then being sold on the secondhand market. Victor Sun, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, suggests BYD's vehicle margin would be under pressure in the short term due to the need to hit sales targets (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits rose for the second consecutive month in April, with growth improving despite U.S. tariffs and deflationary pressures. Cumulative profits at major industrial firms climbed 3% year-on-year, accelerating from 2.6% in March. This boost is largely attributed to Beijing's efforts to support the private sector, offsetting some negative impacts from the U.S. tariffs. Profits in the high-tech manufacturing industry also saw notable improvement.
