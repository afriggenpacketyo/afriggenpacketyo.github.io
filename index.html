          <p>President Trump commenced his four-day tour of the Gulf states, starting in Saudi Arabia, where he was warmly received by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, signaling the kingdom's high regard for his administration. The trip aims to secure deals worth over $1 trillion, focusing on investments in AI, energy, and arms purchases from U.S. manufacturers. Trump's visit coincides with his family's financial interests in the region, including pending deals with Saudi-owned real estate firms and projects backed by Qatar. The Trump administration is also expected to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 from the Qatari royal family as a donation, potentially for use as Air Force One. </p>

          <p>German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has banned the far-right group "Kingdom of Germany," a faction within the ReichsbÃ¼rger movement, accusing it of attempting to establish a "counter-state" within Germany. Police raids across seven German states led to the arrest of key members, including its self-declared monarch, Peter Fitzek. Dobrindt stated that the group undermines the rule of law and uses antisemitic conspiracy narratives to support its claims. The 'Kingdom of Germany' group, reportedly with around 6,000 members, denies the legitimacy of Germany's post-World War II Federal Republic.</p>

          <p>The UK jobs market is showing signs of cooling, with the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5% in the January to March period, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The number of employees on company payrolls fell in March and April, and job vacancies also decreased. While wage growth has slowed, it remains relatively strong, posing a challenge for the Bank of England's interest rate decisions. The ONS has cautioned that unemployment figures should be treated with caution due to low survey response rates.</p>

The donation is under scrutiny due to constitutional emoluments clause, which bars federal officials from accepting personal gifts from a foreign nation without Congressional approval.</p>

          <p>Addiction experts warn that proposed cuts to addiction funding by Congress will have dire consequences, potentially reversing recent progress in reducing overdose deaths. A letter signed by over 300 physicians, harm reduction workers, and researchers highlights the importance of sustained financial investment in key agencies. The White House budget for 2026 proposes significant cuts to the CDC and SAMHSA, which could impact addiction recovery programs, particularly in rural areas and poor urban neighborhoods.</p>
