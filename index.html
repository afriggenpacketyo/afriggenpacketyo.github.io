          <p>San Bernardino County deputies now believe 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro is dead, arresting his parents, Jake and Rebecca Haro, for murder. Investigators determined the initial kidnapping report from a Yucaipa store parking lot was false, citing inconsistencies in Rebecca Haro's story. The search for Emmanuel continues, with authorities reviewing security footage and having previously removed another child from the home. Jake Haro, with a prior child cruelty conviction, and Rebecca Haro are facing charges in this tragic case.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year and recently released from detention, now faces potential deportation to Uganda. The Trump administration is reportedly exploring this option, following an agreement with Uganda to accept non-citizens. Abrego Garcia's 2019 immigration ruling barred his deportation to El Salvador due to gang persecution fears. His attorneys were given 72 hours' notice of this new development, as he plans to return to his family in Maryland.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Musicians are increasingly finding AI-generated "slop" music released under their names on streaming platforms like Spotify, without their consent. Artists like Emily Portman and Josh Kaufman discovered fake albums or tracks, often uncannily mimicking their style, appearing on their official profiles. This trend, which also targets deceased musicians, raises concerns about copyright, artist control, and the lack of legal safeguards. While platforms are improving detection, the issue highlights the ease with which fraudsters exploit AI to potentially gain royalties and the challenges independent artists face.</p>

          <p>A tour bus returning from Niagara Falls overturned on Interstate 90 in Pembroke, New York, resulting in five fatalities and dozens of injuries. The bus, carrying 54 people aged 1 to 74, lost control, went into the median, and over-corrected, ending up in a ditch. While mechanical failure and operator impairment have been ruled out, authorities believe driver distraction caused the accident. Emergency services, including medical helicopters, responded to the scene, with many passengers sustaining head injuries and fractures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ether, the cryptocurrency underpinning Ethereum, achieved a new record high for the first time since 2021, spurred by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks at Jackson Hole. Powell's comments, suggesting a potential adjustment to policy stance and hinting at September rate cuts, caught traders off guard, leading to significant short liquidations in ETH. This surge reflects a broader market repositioning towards risk-on assets, with momentum returning to the crypto market. Regulatory tailwinds and institutional interest in stablecoins, largely powered by Ethereum, are also contributing to Ether's leadership in the crypto space. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korean cafes, particularly in student-heavy areas like Seoul's Daechi, are grappling with "Cagongjok" – customers who occupy seats for extended periods to study or work. This cultural trend, often involving multiple devices and long unattended breaks, is disrupting other patrons and impacting cafe profitability, especially with high rents. Starbucks Korea recently issued guidelines to address "extreme cases" without asking customers to leave, while some independent cafes have implemented "No Study Zones" or time limits. The phenomenon reflects South Korea's hyper-competitive society and a lack of public study spaces, prompting calls for more inclusive environments.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has released over 300 pages of transcripts and audio from convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell's two-day interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. Maxwell, granted immunity for the conversation but not a cooperation deal, discussed her relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and other high-profile individuals. She denied witnessing any inappropriate behavior from Donald Trump or Bill Clinton and called allegations against Prince Andrew "bullshit." Maxwell also speculated that Epstein's death was not a suicide or external murder, but possibly an "internal situation" within the prison.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced an investigation into imported furniture, setting the stage for new tariffs within 50 days. He stated this move aims to bring the furniture business back to U.S. states. Shares of major furniture and home goods companies like Wayfair tumbled, while La-Z-Boy, with U.S. manufacturing, saw its shares rise. These potential tariffs come at a difficult time for the U.S. furniture industry, facing decreased demand due to a slower housing market and persistent inflation impacting consumer discretionary spending.

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has fired Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), reportedly due to a preliminary assessment of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites that angered President Trump. The DIA's assessment indicated only a few months' setback for Iran's program, contradicting Trump's claims of "completely and fully obliterated." This firing is part of a broader pattern of Trump administration upheavals in military and intelligence leadership, with critics suggesting data and analysis are being dismissed if they conflict with the president's narrative.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, wrongly deported and later returned to face human smuggling charges, has been released from criminal custody in Tennessee. A federal judge's ruling prevents immigration authorities from detaining him, mandating his return to Maryland under supervision. Despite being reunited with his family, his attorneys warn he is "far from safe," as ICE detention or deportation to an "unknown third country" still loom.

          <p>This opinion piece criticizes Donald Trump's assertion that the Smithsonian should not focus on "how bad slavery was," arguing it reflects an attempt to whitewash American history. The author expresses alarm over the administration's alleged micro-management of museum exhibits, aiming to replace historical truth with "unifying and constructive descriptions." This is seen as an insult to Black and Indigenous Americans and a broader effort to deny past injustices, undermining the need for measures like DEI programs. The article warns against the dangers of censoring history and creating a false narrative.</p>

President Trump disavowed knowledge of the raid, calling Bolton a "lowlife," reflecting a widespread disdain for Bolton across the political spectrum. The investigation is likely unrelated to Bolton's prior dispute with Trump over his memoir. Despite Bolton's meticulous nature, his extensive knowledge of secrets could lead to an accidental leak.

          <p>California and Texas are at the forefront of an intense national redistricting battle, poised to significantly impact the balance of power in Washington D.C. Texas Republicans redrew maps to create five new congressional seats favoring their party, prompting California Democrats to retaliate. This political "arms race," with mid-decade changes, is spreading to other states. While gerrymandering is legal unless racially motivated, critics argue it allows politicians to pick voters, raising concerns about diluted minority voting power and partisan manipulation of electoral boundaries.</p>

The labor market has also grown sluggish, prompting the Fed to consider cuts but also highlighting the limits of monetary policy in addressing executive-driven economic destabilization.

Experts like Caleb Luna see her honesty as a "breakthrough" against stereotypes, but also express concern it might overemphasize appearance.
