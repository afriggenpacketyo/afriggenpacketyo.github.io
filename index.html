          <p>More than 300 South Korean nationals detained in a large-scale Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia are being sent back to their country. The workers, who were at an electric vehicle battery facility under construction, were accused of visa violations, making it the largest single-site enforcement action in ICE history. The incident has strained U.S.-South Korea relations, a key economic and political partnership, prompting diplomatic discussions between the two nations about visa policies for highly skilled workers. South Korean officials have expressed deep concern over the treatment of their citizens.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker condemned the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, labeling it an act of political violence that must stop. While expressing sympathy, Pritzker suggested that President Donald Trump's rhetoric often encourages such violence, referencing the January 6th Capitol riot and Trump's subsequent pardons of those involved. The governor's comments drew criticism from Republican figures, who accused him of politicizing the tragedy instead of offering a straightforward condemnation of the act. The discussion highlights the deep partisan divisions in the response to politically charged violent events.</p>

          <p>An opinion article reflects on discussions from the Lindau Nobel Meeting in Economic Sciences, highlighting a growing consensus that financial markets are not immune to the breakdown of global geopolitical order. The author suggests that traditional economic models often fail to account for the increasing fragmentation and conflict in international relations. This shift requires a new understanding of risk, as political decisions and international tensions are becoming primary drivers of market volatility. The piece concludes that investors and economists must adapt to a world where established rules are being rewritten. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Emily Thornberry has pulled out of the race to become the deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party, narrowing the field of candidates to four. Having failed to secure the necessary 80 nominations from fellow Members of Parliament, Thornberry announced her withdrawal, leaving Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson as the clear frontrunner. The contest was triggered by the resignation of Angela Rayner over a tax issue. The outcome will be decided by party members in October, with the race highlighting different factions within the party as it navigates its first year in government.</p>

          <p>US pharmaceutical company Merck, known as MSD in Europe, has canceled its planned £1 billion expansion in the United Kingdom, which included a major research center in London. The company cited a lack of sufficient government investment in the life sciences sector and the "undervaluation of innovative medicines" by successive UK governments as reasons for the decision. This move, which will result in 125 job losses, is seen as a significant blow to the UK's ambitions as a science hub.

          <p>This opinion article analyzes the different reactions among Donald Trump's supporters to various accusations of sexual misconduct against him. The author contrasts the relative indifference to the E. Jean Carroll civil verdict with the intense outrage over Trump's association with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The piece argues that the MAGA movement's focus on traditional values creates a selective outrage, where the defense of abused girls becomes a potent moral issue that even Trump cannot easily dismiss. This dynamic makes the Epstein connection uniquely damaging for Trump, as it clashes with the moral framework his base uses to justify its support.</p>

          <p>Reports indicate that U.S. President Donald Trump has asked the European Union to impose tariffs as high as 100% on China and India for their continued purchases of Russian oil. The proposal is seen as an attempt to further pressure Russia's economy, with the U.S. offering to "mirror" any tariffs the EU applies. However, European officials are reportedly hesitant to adopt this strategy, fearing it would alienate key global partners and escalate trade disputes. Analysts suggest the move is unlikely to succeed, given the EU's own complex trade relationships and general aversion to Trump's aggressive tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old co-founder of Turning Point USA and a prominent conservative activist, was assassinated while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University. He was struck by a single bullet to the neck, which law enforcement believes was fired by a sniper from a nearby building roof. The shooting caused mass panic among the crowd of approximately 3,000 attendees. A major manhunt for the shooter is underway, but no suspect has been publicly identified, sending shockwaves across the U.S. political landscape.</p>

          <p>Stock markets around the world, including the S&P 500 in the U.S. and Japan's Nikkei 225, have been reaching new record highs. This global rally is fueled by growing investor confidence due to easing inflation pressures, resilient corporate earnings, and widespread expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon begin cutting interest rates. A surprisingly soft U.S. producer price index report further bolstered this sentiment. Analysts note that "animal spirits are soaring" as the economic outlook appears more favorable, though some caution that the impact of U.S. tariffs could temper performance in the coming months.

          <p>A review of Thursday's UK newspaper headlines shows two dominant stories: the political pressure on Lord Mandelson and Prince Harry's meeting with his father, King Charles. Multiple papers are calling for the resignation of Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the US, over his past friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. In royal news, the front pages feature photos of Prince Harry arriving at Clarence House for tea with the King, fueling speculation about a potential reconciliation. Other major stories include Merck's decision to scrap a £1 billion research facility and Britain's consideration of sending fighter jets to Poland.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the rupture in the relationship between the United States and Europe is structural and will not be fixed even if Donald Trump is no longer president. The author contends that deep-seated demographic, economic, and security trends in the U.S. point away from the traditional Atlanticist alliance based on shared values. Europe must emotionally accept this new reality and prepare for a more transactional, and potentially hostile, relationship. The article warns European leaders against self-humiliation and urges them to build strategic autonomy to avoid being relegated to a subordinate role in a new world of competing empires.</p>

          <p>China has invested nearly 450 billion yuan (US$63.2 billion) in a five-year mineral exploration program, resulting in significant discoveries of oil, gas, and critical minerals like lithium and copper. Officials reported the discovery of over 500 large and medium-sized deposits since 2021, including 10 large oilfields. This initiative is part of China's broader strategy to enhance its energy security, dominate critical resource supply chains, and reduce its dependence on foreign imports. The breakthroughs are crucial for supporting the country's economic development and its booming high-tech industries amid global geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, for a private tea at Clarence House in London, their first face-to-face meeting in over a year and a half. The 50-minute reunion is being viewed as a small but potentially significant step toward healing the public rift within the royal family. In recent months, Prince Harry has expressed a desire for reconciliation, and the quiet coordination of this meeting suggests a mutual willingness to communicate. While a full family reconciliation, particularly with his brother Prince William, appears distant, this meeting is seen as a positive development.</p>

          <p>Three senior FBI officials who were fired last month have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, claiming their terminations were an illegal act of political retribution. The complaint alleges that FBI Director Kash Patel told one of the agents his own job depended on firing those involved in past investigations of President Trump, stating the president "hasn't forgotten" that the FBI "tried to put him in jail." The lawsuit, brought by decorated veterans of the agency, argues that the purge was directed by the White House to punish law enforcement for doing their jobs and puts national security at risk.</p>

          <p>The owners of Kim Hung Jewelry in San José are contemplating closing their family-run business after a traumatic smash-and-grab robbery. A mob of masked individuals crashed an SUV through the storefront and stormed in with hammers and a gun, assaulting the 88-year-old owner, who later suffered a stroke. The brazen daylight attack, captured on video, has sparked outrage in the local Vietnamese community and led to calls for increased law enforcement to combat organized retail crime.

          <p>A new report from the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) reveals a concerning decline in democratic health worldwide. Analyzing 173 countries, the study found that over half showed a decline in at least one key democratic indicator, such as credible elections or access to justice, between 2019 and 2024. Press freedom saw its most significant drop in 50 years. While European nations still dominate the top of the rankings, the report highlights a global trend of democratic erosion, including in the United States, which has seen its own institutions weakened.</p>

          <h2>Report Suggests San Francisco Housing Costs Have Returned to a 'Normal' Ratio with Incomes</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by real estate company Redfin claims that housing costs in San Francisco have returned to "normal" levels relative to local incomes, reaching an equilibrium last seen in July 2018. This is attributed to slowing home-price growth combined with rapidly rising wages in the tech sector. However, the report clarifies that "normal" for San Francisco does not mean affordable, as the mortgage-to-income ratio remains significantly higher than the national average. The analysis focuses on homebuyers and does not reflect the reality for renters, who are facing spiking costs driven by the local AI boom. (not investment advice)</p>
