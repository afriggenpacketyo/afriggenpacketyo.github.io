          <p>Jane Ragsdale, the well-regarded owner and director of the Heart O' the Hills camp for girls in Kerrville, Texas, was among those killed in the catastrophic July Fourth flooding. While her camp was between sessions, sparing the campers, Ragsdale herself was lost to the Guadalupe River. Friends and community members remember her as a generous and capable leader who embodied the spirit of the community, teaching campers essential life skills and dedicating her off-seasons to humanitarian work in Guatemala. Her death represents a significant loss for a community now facing a monumental rebuilding effort after the devastating natural disaster.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, survivors and family of the deceased are grappling with the aftermath. The attack by gunman Thomas Crooks killed 50-year-old Corey Comperatore and severely injured David Dutch and James Copenhaver. While Comperatore's family still seeks answers regarding security lapses, the injured survivors are focusing on their physical and psychological recovery. Despite life-altering injuries, they express a renewed motivation to embrace life, spend time with family, and not dwell on the past, turning a traumatic event into a call for living more fully.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Examine 'Uneasy Alliance' Between US Tech Sector and MAGA Movement in China Rivalry</h2>

          <p>A growing alignment between American tech titans and the 'Make America Great Again' movement is reshaping the US approach to its rivalry with China. Chinese analysts note that this partnership is pushing for sustained pressure to contain China's technological advancement and promote further decoupling in high-tech industries. The trend includes deepening ties between tech firms and the US defense sector, potentially creating more assertive 'tech hawks.' However, some experts suggest that underlying tensions between the tech elite and the MAGA camp could ultimately undermine this coalition's political influence and its strategic goals concerning China.</p>

          <p>Officials have issued evacuation orders for parts of Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona due to multiple uncontained wildfires. The Dragon Bravo Fire, which has burned 150 acres within the park, prompted the immediate evacuation of all residents on the North Rim. This followed the evacuation of approximately 500 visitors the previous night. A larger blaze, the White Sage Fire, is burning north of the park and has also led to evacuation orders and road closures. Firefighting efforts are being challenged by strong winds, low humidity, and critically dry conditions across the rugged terrain.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order directing the Trump administration to halt immigration raids in several Southern California counties. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong came in response to a lawsuit from the ACLU, which argued that federal agents were violating constitutional rights by engaging in racial profiling and conducting stops without reasonable suspicion. The judge stated that agents cannot rely solely on factors like apparent ethnicity, speaking Spanish, or presence at certain locations to initiate a stop. The decision represents a significant legal check on the administration's intensified immigration enforcement tactics in the region.</p>

Seconds after takeoff, both of the Boeing 787's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position, starving the engines of fuel. The recording captures one pilot asking the other why he cut the fuel, with the other denying he did so. Investigators are analyzing why this action, typically only performed after landing, occurred.

The tragedy highlights the devastating human cost of the conflict and the desperate conditions for civilians facing severe shortages of food and medicine.</p>

          <p>King Charles hosted his first "Harmony Summit" at his Highgrove estate, bringing together Indigenous leaders, environmentalists, and philanthropists to celebrate his philosophy of living in harmony with nature. The event featured a fire ceremony and discussions centered on the interconnectedness of all life and the wisdom of pre-industrial cultures. The King's long-held belief system, which he detailed in a 2010 book, advocates for a spiritual and practical alignment with the natural world, influencing his work on sustainability, organic farming, and interfaith dialogue. The gathering aimed to turn these philosophical ideas into practical inspiration for a more sustainable future.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Perris, California, has issued a public warning urging residents to stay indoors unless necessary due to ongoing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in the region. In a video message, Mayor Michael Vargas advised residents to remain calm and not open their doors to strangers. This guidance comes as intensified federal immigration enforcement has created a climate of fear across Southern California's immigrant communities. The warning from a city official underscores the profound impact the raids are having on daily life, with many people now afraid to go to work or run errands.</p>

          <p>A fierce debate is underway in Prague over the fate of the historic Vysehrad railway bridge, a 123-year-old steel landmark. The national Railway Authority plans to dismantle the bridge, arguing it is corroded and can no longer handle growing rail traffic, and replace it with a new, three-track structure. However, a coalition of architects, engineers, and preservationists, backed by UNESCO and a public petition, insists the bridge can and should be repaired in place. They argue that demolishing the iconic structure is unnecessary and would destroy a crucial part of Prague's historic skyline.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has laid off 1,353 employees as part of a sweeping reorganization plan by the Trump administration to reduce its workforce. The cuts include 1,107 civil service and 246 foreign service staff, with many reductions hitting offices focused on refugees, human rights, and foreign assistance. Critics, including Democratic senators, argue the mass layoffs will undermine U.S. diplomacy and national security by weakening the department's ability to address complex global challenges. The administration contends the cuts are necessary to eliminate redundant offices and streamline the bureaucracy to focus on core missions.</p>

          <p>A new, large-scale beach resort has opened in Wonsan, North Korea, with the first group of Russian tourists arriving this week. The resort, which leader Kim Jong Un has hailed as a world-class destination, was constructed at a rapid pace that has drawn criticism from human rights groups. Reports from the UN and defectors suggest the project relied on forced labor from 'shock brigades,' where workers faced brutal conditions, long hours, and inadequate compensation. While North Korea hopes the resort will boost its economy and strengthen ties with Russia, its development is shadowed by allegations of severe human rights abuses.</p>

          <p>Scientists are expressing grave concern over an intense and prolonged marine heatwave in the western Mediterranean Sea, where surface temperatures have surpassed 30°C, several degrees above normal for this time of year. This extreme ocean heat, driven by climate change, poses a significant threat to marine life, as many species struggle to survive in such warm conditions. Ecologists fear mass mortality events for critical species like seaweeds and seagrasses, which could have cascading effects on fish stocks and the overall health of the marine ecosystem.

          <p>A top Trump administration official has accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of mismanaging an "ostentatious" office renovation, escalating a conflict with the central bank leader. The Office of Management and Budget sent a letter questioning the project's costs, which include features like premium marble, and alleged potential legal violations for altering plans without approval. This criticism comes as President Trump continues to attack Powell for not cutting interest rates. Powell has defended the project, stating that descriptions of its extravagance are inaccurate and that the renovations are necessary for buildings that haven't been updated since the 1930s.</p>

The OBR's chief stated the UK cannot afford its current promises, suggesting that £10bn to £20bn in further tax increases may be necessary to stabilize public finances amid rising spending pressures and global uncertainty.

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final presents a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova. Swiatek, the world number one, has historically struggled on grass but has found her form, adjusting her tactics by playing further behind the baseline to utilize her powerful forehand. Anisimova, an unseeded former prodigy, plays an aggressive, high-risk game and may benefit from having nothing to lose as the underdog. The outcome will likely depend on which player better manages the pressure of the occasion, with Swiatek's experience clashing with Anisimova's free-swinging style.</p>

While affirming the importance of the US alliance and the AUKUS security pact, Albanese's government is signaling a determination to act in its own national interest.

          <p>Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has warned that his country will impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products if President Trump follows through on a threat to implement a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods. Trump's threat is explicitly linked to his opposition to the criminal trial of his political ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Lula stated that if negotiations fail, Brazil will enact its reciprocity law, matching the 50% tariff rate. The escalating dispute risks a trade war and marks a new front where Trump is using tariffs to influence another nation's domestic politics.</p>

This represents a significant escalation in trade tensions with one of America's largest trading partners. The announcement is part of a broader strategy of imposing or increasing tariffs on dozens of countries, a move the administration says is necessary to correct trade imbalances and protect American industry.</p>
