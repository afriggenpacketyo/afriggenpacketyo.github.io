          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has condemned the felling of a memorial tree planted for Ilan Halimi, a Jewish man who was tortured and murdered in an antisemitic attack in 2006. Macron described the act as an "attempt to kill him a second time" and vowed that all efforts would be made to punish those responsible for this act of hatred. This incident follows previous desecrations of memorials dedicated to Halimi, highlighting ongoing concerns about antisemitism in France. An investigation is currently underway to bring the perpetrators to justice.</p>

          <p>This opinion article asserts that Washington, D.C., is plagued by crime due to ineffective local governance and lenient judicial practices. The author supports President Trump's federalization of the D.C. Metropolitan Police as a necessary step to restore order. The piece argues that the 1973 Home Rule Act and the current system for appointing local judges are unconstitutional and have led to the city's decline. The author calls for Congress to repeal these laws to return control of the nation's capital to the federal government, stating it is essential for national image and resident safety.</p>

          <p>Following a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Trump announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. The purpose of the meeting is to discuss a potential peace agreement to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. In a social media post, Trump stated that he, along with European leaders, determined a direct peace agreement is preferable to a ceasefire, which he claims often fails. This development signals a direct diplomatic push by the administration to resolve the long-standing conflict, with the potential for saving millions of lives.</p>

The service, run by trained teenage volunteers, offers a space for youth to discuss issues ranging from relationships to suicidal thoughts. This comes as the Trump administration has cut federal grants for school psychologists and reduced funding for programs supporting mental healthcare access. Teen Line's volunteers are filling a vital role by providing empathetic listening, which they say is often the most important first step for a teen in crisis.</p>

          <p>This opinion column argues that the Trump administration's decision to federalize the Washington D.C. police force is a calculated distraction from the Jeffrey Epstein files. The author suggests the move is not a genuine response to crime, which is at a 30-year low, but an attempt to shift public focus away from revelations that the president's name appears in the documents. The piece criticizes the administration for conflating crime and homelessness to appeal to its base while ignoring the real, systemic issues facing the city. It frames the action as a politically motivated maneuver that undermines democracy for personal gain.</p>

          <p>Recent deployments of federal forces in Los Angeles and Washington D.C. are sparking alarm and criticism from local officials and political analysts. The article details a Border Patrol raid in L.A. that coincided with a Democratic news conference and the federal takeover of D.C. police, actions President Trump justifies by citing crime rates that data often contradicts. Critics argue these moves are an unprecedented use of federal power to intimidate political opponents and push constitutional norms. Local leaders like L.A. Mayor Karen Bass have condemned the actions as creating fear and chaos rather than addressing actual public safety issues.</p>

The bear, tracked by wildlife officials as Yellow 2291, previously gained media attention for crossing major freeways and wandering into urban neighborhoods.

A detailed luncheon menu and seating chart were also included, showing high-level officials from both nations were set to attend the meal, which was ultimately canceled.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research published in PLOS Biology indicates that young chimpanzees acquire their patterns of combining vocal sounds and physical gestures from their mothers, not their fathers. By observing a wild chimpanzee community in Uganda, scientists found that an individual's communication style closely resembled that of its mother and maternal siblings, with no similar correlation on the paternal side. This suggests the behavior is learned through social interaction rather than inherited genetically, as young chimps spend their formative years with their mothers. The findings imply that the capacity for socially learned communication may be an ancient trait shared by humans and chimpanzees.</p>

          <p>Severe monsoon rains have triggered devastating flash floods and landslides in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, resulting in the deaths of at least 307 people. The majority of the fatalities occurred in the mountainous Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which has been declared a disaster zone. Rescue operations are ongoing, though they have been hampered by bad weather, which caused a rescue helicopter to crash, killing its five crew members. With heavy rainfall expected to continue, authorities are struggling to manage the crisis as homes are damaged and communities are left reeling from the destruction.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Putin Emerges as Winner from Alaska Summit, Leaving Trump and Ukraine with Little</h2>

          <p>This analysis piece concludes that Vladimir Putin was the clear victor of the Alaska summit, having gained a global spotlight and a red-carpet welcome without conceding to a ceasefire in Ukraine. The author argues that Donald Trump received nothing tangible in return, failing to secure his stated goal and instead providing Putin with a significant propaganda win. For Ukraine, the outcome is seen as a major loss, as the war continues with no immediate prospect of de-escalation. The summit is interpreted as a signal of diminishing U.S. commitment, reinforcing the need for European allies to increase their support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>China has successfully completed a crucial ground test of the engine system for its Long March-10 rocket, a key component of its plan to send astronauts to the moon by 2030. The test involved the simultaneous ignition of multiple YF-100K engines, confirming they could operate in sync under various power conditions. The superheavy Long March-10 rocket is designed to be powerful enough to launch the Mengzhou crewed spacecraft and the Lanyue lunar lander into a trans-lunar orbit. This achievement marks a significant step forward in China's ambitious crewed lunar exploration program and its space race capabilities.</p>
