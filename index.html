          <p>A jury in Washington state found Raul Benitez-Santana guilty of vehicular assault and homicide for the death of State Trooper Christopher Gadd. Benitez-Santana, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, was driving over 100 mph under the influence of alcohol and marijuana when he crashed into Gadd's patrol vehicle, which was parked on the shoulder of Interstate 5. ICE had previously issued a detainer request for Benitez-Santana following his arrest, as he had prior encounters with immigration agents and convictions for driving on a suspended license and marijuana possession. The incident highlights ongoing concerns about public safety and immigration enforcement. The optimism score reflects the tragic nature of the event and the loss of life.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation blocking foreign students from entering the U.S. to attend Harvard University, citing concerns that the institution is "no longer a trustworthy steward" of international students. The proclamation also directs the Secretary of State to consider revoking the visas of foreign students already in the U.S. to study at Harvard. Trump justified the move by claiming Harvard has refused to provide information about international students, has "extensive entanglements with foreign countries," and has discriminated in their admissions practices. The action follows previous attempts by the Trump administration to restrict Harvard's ability to enroll international students. The optimism score reflects the negative impact on international students and academic institutions.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered an investigation into whether former President Joe Biden's administration used an autopen machine to sign key presidential documents. Trump claims this was part of a "conspiracy" to conceal Biden's cognitive decline, citing executive actions like pardons and federal judge appointments. Biden has refuted these claims, stating he made the decisions during his presidency. Presidents have used autopens for decades, and the Justice Department under George W. Bush deemed it legal to sign bills into law. The optimism score reflects the political tensions and the potential for further division.</p>

          <p>Negotiations between the U.S. and Iran over Iran's nuclear program face uncertainty as both countries clash over the terms of an interim agreement. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rejected the U.S. proposal, stating that Iran would not agree to stop enriching uranium on its own soil. President Trump insisted that any agreement would prohibit uranium enrichment, contradicting statements from U.S. officials that the initial proposal allowed low-level enrichment. The differing stances and mutual mistrust have cast doubt on the possibility of a sixth round of negotiations. The optimism score reflects the uncertainty and potential for conflict.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have found that the first bacteria our bodies encounter after birth can protect against dangerous infections. The study showed that the presence of *Bifidobacterium longum* in newborns halved the risk of hospitalization for lung infections in the first two years of life. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute analyzed stool samples from 1,082 newborns and tracked their health outcomes. The protective bacteria were more common in babies born via vaginal delivery. The optimism score reflects the potential for new therapies to boost beneficial bacteria in infants.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily barred the Trump administration from deporting the wife and five children of Mohamed Soliman, the Egyptian national accused of attacking demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado. Judge Gordon Gallagher cited potential irreparable harm and the urgency of the situation. Lawyers for the family argued that punishing individuals for the crimes of relatives violates democratic justice. Soliman's family is being held in an immigration detention center in Texas.

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested the FDA to review the latest data on mifepristone, the abortion pill. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley said the review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety, but experts say concerns are misguided. The FDA approved mifepristone in 2000 after determining it was safe and effective, and periodic reviews have found no new safety concerns. In 2024, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge targeting the availability of the pill. The optimism score reflects the ongoing debate and uncertainty surrounding abortion access.</p>

          <p>Drug safety experts are advising women using weight-loss jabs to stop if they are trying for a baby, have fallen pregnant, or are breastfeeding. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says it's unknown whether the medicines, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, could harm an unborn baby. The MHRA advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward before trying to become pregnant. There are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely.
