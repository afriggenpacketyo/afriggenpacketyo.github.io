          <p>A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, cautioned that any U.S. military intervention in Iran would be "an extremely dangerous step" with unpredictable consequences, while also addressing Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, particularly those involving Russian specialists. Zakharova urged Israel to immediately cease raids on nuclear sites under IAEA guarantees, expressing particular concern for the safety of the Bushehr nuclear power plant where Russian specialists are working. Russia is prioritizing de-escalation and a ceasefire to facilitate negotiations and is prepared to offer political and diplomatic support towards this goal. The country is ready to contribute to this in every way and is making political and diplomatic efforts in this direction. The situation calls for restraint to prevent further escalation of violence and restore peace. Optimism for a resolution is tempered by the ongoing tensions and potential for miscalculation.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is advocating for further negotiations to de-escalate the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, while Conservative figures like Dame Priti Patel are urging the UK government to support the US if it attacks Iran. Amidst speculation about potential UK involvement in US-led strikes, concerns have been raised by legal advisors regarding the legality of supporting military action without direct threats to UK personnel. Foreign Secretary David Lammy is in Washington to meet with his US counterpart, Marco Rubio, to discuss Iran's nuclear program, while Iran's foreign minister has confirmed plans for talks with counterparts from the UK, France, and Germany. Emily Thornberry, chair of the foreign affairs select committee, stated that it is not "justifiable" for the UK to get involved in the conflict between Israel and Iran, and should "keep away" because "we haven't been attacked ourselves". The UK government is also prepared to evacuate British nationals from Tel Aviv as soon as airspace re-opens for non-military flights.</p>

          <p>International calls for restraint appear to be unheeded as the world anticipates an escalation of the conflict between Iran and Israel, with the U.S. President Donald Trump considering direct military strikes on Iran. The Kremlin has warned that U.S. intervention could trigger a "terrible spiral of escalation," while the U.K. government convened an emergency Cobra meeting to manage the crisis and withdraw families of embassy staff from Tel Aviv. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz commented that Israel was doing the "dirty work" for other countries by attacking Iran's nuclear sites, stirring controversy. Foreign ministers from Germany, France, and the U.K. are scheduled to meet with their Iranian counterpart to discuss the crisis. Despite diplomatic efforts, the continued exchange of deadly attacks between Iran and Israel suggests a bleak outlook.</p>

          <p>Airbus has taken center stage at the Paris Air Show, securing substantial orders and showcasing new models, while Boeing maintains a low profile due to ongoing business challenges. Airbus has accumulated nearly $21 billion in orders, including deals with AviLease, ANA, and LOT, while Boeing has had relatively few announcements. Tony Fernandes of Air Asia mentioned discussions to expand their Airbus XLR order, a model expected to lower fuel costs and offer medium- to long-haul routes at reduced rates. Despite Boeing's subdued presence, industry demand remains strong, with both companies having significant aircraft backlogs; however, the Air India disaster involving a Boeing Dreamliner has further complicated matters for the company.</p>

Despite their personal feelings, Smith asserts that he remains objective in his analysis of James' performance, praising his achievements and critiquing his shortcomings. Smith clarified that his criticism was not directed at Bronny, who split time in the NBA and G-League throughout the 2024-25 season, and that he is open to private discussions with James. He said he would "never speak negatively" about Bronny.</p>

          <p>An Iranian missile struck a hospital in southern Israel, causing injuries and damage, prompting Israeli leaders to vow intensified attacks on Iran, accusing its Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei of war crimes. The attack on Soroka Medical Center left dozens with minor injuries, and another missile hit a high-rise building near Tel Aviv, trapping residents. Israel's Home Front Command reported that Iran used a "dispersal munition" missile, releasing smaller bombs over a wide area. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to exact the full price from Tehran, while Defense Minister Israel Katz instructed the military to increase attacks on strategic targets in Iran. The situation escalates as President Trump considers direct U.S. involvement in the conflict. There is little indication of de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Crude oil futures rose by more than 1% after Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered intensified attacks on Iran, with U.S. crude oil up 1.81% to $76.50 per barrel and global benchmark Brent adding 1.43% to $77.80 per barrel. Prices have risen more than 11% since Israel began targeting Iran's nuclear and missile programs, and the escalation follows an Iranian missile strike on a hospital in Beersheba. JPMorgan warned that regime change in Iran, a major OPEC producer, could significantly impact global oil prices. President Donald Trump is also considering a U.S. strike on Iran's nuclear program, further heightening tensions. The potential for higher oil prices is evident as supply losses due to instability in Iran would be difficult to recover quickly.</p>

Juneteenth, also known as Freedom Day or Emancipation Day, is observed annually on June 19, the date in 1865 when enslaved people in Texas were officially freed. Since becoming a federal holiday in 2021, Juneteenth celebrations have grown to include parades, art shows, educational workshops, and more. The holiday provides an opportunity to reflect on the history of slavery and celebrate the resilience and unity of the Black community. Public festivities include a variety of activities that honor the day.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth, a portmanteau of June and nineteenth, commemorates the end of slavery in the United States, originating on June 19, 1865, when enslaved people in Texas learned of their freedom. Although President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, it was not fully realized in Confederate territory until the end of the Civil War. The 13th Amendment, ratified in December 1865, officially abolished slavery nationwide. Juneteenth celebrations vary, often including parades, parties, concerts, and educational workshops, with the holiday serving as a joyful anniversary of independence and an opportunity to remember the country's foundation on centuries of slavery. The spirit of the holiday focuses on family, community, and connection, with Opal Lee, known as the "Grandmother of Juneteenth," playing a significant role in its federal recognition.</p>

          <p>Honda is recalling 259,033 vehicles in the U.S. due to a potential brake pedal defect where the pivot pin was not properly staked during production. The affected models include 2021-2025 Acura TLX, 2023-2025 Acura MDX, and 2023-2025 Honda Pilot vehicles. The defect could cause the brake pedal to move side to side, potentially preventing motorists from safely stopping their cars, increasing the risk of a crash or injury. Owners of the recalled vehicles will be contacted by mail and instructed to take their vehicles to an authorized dealer for brake pedal replacement, with reimbursement available for those who have already repaired the brakes. The faulty brake pedals were assembled at a U.S. plant that is no longer operational, with production now moved to Mexico where a camera sensor is used to ensure proper staking.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was acquitted of second-degree murder, manslaughter, and leaving the scene of bodily injury in the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, but was convicted on a charge of operating under the influence and sentenced to one year of probation. Legal analyst Rikki Klieman described the verdict as predictable, citing reasonable doubt due to conflicting expert testimonies and a sloppy police investigation led by Michael Proctor. The defense had an advantage due to a previous mistrial, allowing them to refine their case. Read still faces a civil wrongful death lawsuit filed by O'Keefe's family, which will have a lighter burden of proof. She has not been deposed yet in the civil case.</p>

The OfS has issued guidance for universities in England on upholding free speech, following a new law designed to protect it, which comes into force in August. The National Union of Students UK (NUS UK) criticized the guidance as unnecessary, while Universities UK expressed support, stating they will ensure universities comply with the new rules. The guidelines cover various aspects of university life, from protests to teaching, and aim to ensure that all views can be discussed as long as they do not violate the law.

Mourners brought flowers and candles, with Governor Tim Walz consoling attendees as a brass band performed, and Colin Hortman, the couple's son, placed a photograph of his parents on their memorial. The vigil featured a string quartet and a Native American drum circle, with attendees singing Amazing Grace. The suspected killer, Vance Boelter, is also accused of attempting to murder state senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, and authorities believe he had a list of targets including other Democratic lawmakers and abortion rights advocates. The event was non-partisan.</p>

          <p>A Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force destroyer sailed through the Taiwan Strait, following an incident where a Chinese fighter jet flew dangerously close to a Japanese patrol plane over the Pacific. The destroyer Takanami entered the waterway between China and Taiwan from the East China Sea on June 12, heading south. This event occurs amid heightened tensions in the region, with China asserting its claim over Taiwan, a self-ruled democratic island. The move underscores Japan's continued interest in regional security and freedom of navigation.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has maintained interest rates at 4.25% but signaled potential cuts as early as August, citing persistent inflation above the Bank's target rate. Governor Andrew Bailey noted that interest rates remain on a gradual downward path but cautioned about global unpredictability, particularly concerning the Israel-Iran conflict's potential impact on energy costs and overall prices. Deputy Governor Clare Lombardelli attributed the decision to hold rates to the "uncertainty facing the economy," monitoring the Middle East events and their potential effects on UK inflation. The Bank marginally increased its expectations for the UK economy but acknowledged underlying growth remains weak, with signs of softening in the labor market. The future remains uncertain.</p>

Sea level rise has doubled in recent years, and the Earth's energy imbalance has nearly doubled in the last 20 years.

          <p>Elon Musk responded to the explosion of a SpaceX Starship rocket during testing with a humorous "Just a scratch" on X, despite the "major anomaly" that caused the rocket to burst into flames. The incident marks another setback for SpaceX's Starship program, which is crucial for NASA's Artemis program and aims to carry humans to the Moon and Mars. SpaceX stated that the explosion occurred during a static fire test, and that a safety clear area was maintained, with no hazards to residents. This event is not the first time Musk has downplayed such shortcomings.</p>
