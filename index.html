          <p>The FBI is investigating an explosion at a Palm Springs fertility clinic as an act of terrorism, identifying a 25-year-old suspect, Guy Edward Bartkus, who expressed opposition to bringing people into the world against their will. The explosion, caused by a large vehicle-borne improvised explosive device, resulted in one death and four injuries, severely damaging nearby buildings and prompting evacuations. The clinic, American Reproductive Centers, sustained damage but is expected to reopen soon, with staff and embryos reported safe. Authorities are continuing their investigation, with residents urged to report any debris from the blast site, and government leaders have condemned the attack.</p>

          <p>A series of severe storms and tornadoes swept through the midwestern United States, resulting in at least 27 fatalities across Missouri and Kentucky, as well as widespread damage and power outages. Kentucky's governor reported at least 18 deaths in his state, many stemming from a mass casualty event in Laurel County, while Missouri experienced seven deaths and extensive damage to homes in St. Louis. The storms, part of a larger weather system, also brought a heatwave to Texas and raised concerns about staffing levels at National Weather Service offices, although the governor of Kentucky stated that there was no evidence that the staffing shortages affected the alerts to residents during the storms.</p>

          <p>A Mexican Navy sailboat, the Cuauhtemoc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in two deaths and nineteen injuries, four of which were serious. The ship, carrying 277 people, reportedly lost power and mechanical function, causing it to drift into the bridge pillar. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the incident, with preliminary information suggesting a mechanical issue was the cause. The Brooklyn Bridge was temporarily closed but has since reopened after inspections revealed no structural damage, according to Mayor Eric Adams, and the ship was en route to Iceland from Pier 17 when the incident occurred.</p>

          <p>Democratic governors in states that offer health insurance coverage for immigrants without legal status are proposing to roll back coverage due to budget constraints. California's Governor Newsom wants to freeze new enrollments and charge a monthly premium, while Minnesota's Governor Walz is facing opposition for a proposal to strip health insurance coverage for adults without authorization. These efforts come as Congress considers a proposal that would reduce state Medicaid funds if they offer health insurance coverage to immigrants without proper authorization, sparking debates among lawmakers and advocates.</p>
