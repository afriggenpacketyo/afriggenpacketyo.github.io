          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced that he anticipates his June meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump during the G7 summit in Canada to be a crucial moment for bilateral tariff negotiations. Ishiba stated his government's goal is to eliminate the higher U.S. tariffs, dismissing the idea of settling for mere reductions. He also indicated his openness to visiting the United States, contingent on the advancement of ongoing tariff discussions, to meet with his U.S. counterpart. The article notes that the imposition or threat of higher U.S. tariffs on various goods has unsettled global markets and raised concerns about the impact on the global economy.</p>

          <p>Local governments in China will now be required to justify any fines imposed on companies if the total amount increases by more than 20% year-on-year. This directive from Beijing is part of the central government's broader initiative to eliminate illegal investigations and profit-seeking activities targeting private enterprises. The move is also a component of the government's latest economic recovery efforts that began in March. Hu Weilie, China’s vice-minister of justice, emphasized the importance of correcting arbitrary fines and inspections, unlawful enforcement, inconsistent standards, and abuse of power to ensure the campaign's success.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent trip to the Middle East resulted in $2 trillion worth of deals with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, potentially countering China's growing influence in the region. However, Trump's decision to reverse a Biden-era policy banning the sale of AI-capable chips to the UAE and Saudi Arabia has raised concerns that U.S. technology could fall into the hands of Chinese companies. Experts warn that without strict safeguards, there is a risk of leakage of advanced chips and know-how, which could strengthen the actors the U.S. aims to contain.</p>

          <p>President Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for a surge in military recruitment, stating that enlistments are at a 30-year high due to an incredible spirit in the United States. However, military records indicate that enlistments began rebounding from a pandemic slump before Election Day. Experts attribute the increase to Biden-era recruitment reforms, such as the Army's Future Soldier Prep Course, rather than a 'Trump Bump.' Additionally, while enlistments have risen year-over-year, they remain below recent peaks and levels achieved three decades ago.</p>

          <p>According to a contributor in this article, concerns about Joe Biden's fitness as president have become mainstream, especially after his June 2024 debate with Donald Trump. The author argues that Biden's decline was apparent, but his inner circle, the media, and Democratic partisans enabled his presidency due to loyalty, proximity to power, and fear of Trump. The article posits that the media focused more on Trump's drama than Biden's boring persona, and that mistakes made during Biden’s presidency, such as the Afghanistan withdrawal and border crossings, were predictable policy fumbles rather than signs of derangement.</p>

          <p>A House Republicans' reconciliation bill, now heading to the Senate, contains a national school voucher program. This proposal would use the federal tax code to offer vouchers for students to attend private schools, including religious ones, even in states opposing such efforts. The plan would reward charitable donations to Scholarship Granting Organizations (SGOs) with a dollar-for-dollar tax credit, capped at $5 billion annually through 2029. Experts discuss the potential risks and benefits of this plan, including its impact on public schools and the possibility of private schools turning away students with disabilities.</p>
