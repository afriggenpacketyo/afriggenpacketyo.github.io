          <p>An upcoming summit in Alaska between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin is framed by differing objectives regarding the war in Ukraine. Putin seeks international recognition and validation of Russia's territorial claims, using the summit's location and occurrence as a symbolic victory against Western isolation efforts. Conversely, Trump aims to position himself as a global peacemaker, though his fluctuating statements have created uncertainty about his specific goals. The meeting represents a critical diplomatic moment, with both leaders potentially seeing opportunities beyond the immediate conflict.</p>

          <p>Former President Barack Obama held a virtual meeting to support Texas House Democrats who left the state to prevent a Republican-led redistricting plan. He praised their courage in the fight against partisan gerrymandering, emphasizing the national importance of their actions in protecting democracy. The legislators, who met with Obama from an undisclosed location due to what they described as Republican threats, feel their protest is supported at the highest levels of the Democratic party. This development occurs as California Democrats plan a counter-move to Texas's redistricting efforts.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a socialist candidate for New York City mayor, is facing increased scrutiny following an ethics complaint regarding his tenancy in a rent-stabilized apartment. The complaint, filed by an economist, questions how Mamdani, who earns approximately $150,000 annually, secured the affordable housing unit and whether he received improper assistance. Mamdani has defended himself by stating he moved in when his income was much lower and was unaware of the apartment's status. The controversy has been amplified by his political opponent, Andrew Cuomo, who is proposing legislation to prevent high-income individuals from occupying such units.</p>

Her participation highlights the longevity seen in professional tennis, where athletes like Martina Navratilova and her sister Serena Williams have also set records for age and performance.

          <p>A major federal building at 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan, which houses offices for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE, was evacuated following the discovery of envelopes containing a suspicious white powder. The FDNY dispatched a hazmat unit to investigate the substance found on the ninth floor, and officials reported no known injuries. Mayor Eric Adams confirmed he was briefed on the situation and advised the public to avoid the area while awaiting test results. The building has recently been a focal point of protests and legal action concerning the conditions for detained immigrants.</p>

The collaboration aims to inspire young girls to take up rugby through grassroots initiatives and storytelling, though it will initially launch with merchandise like t-shirts rather than player dolls. As part of the deal, Mattel will donate £20,000 to the Rugby Football Union (RFU) to improve girls' access to clubs and coaching. The partnership comes as the brand continues to address past criticisms by promoting more diverse and athletic body types.</p>

          <p>As the Social Security program marks its 90th anniversary, concerns about its long-term financial stability are growing. The program, which supports nearly 70 million Americans, is projected to deplete its trust funds by 2034, which could lead to a 23% reduction in benefits if no legislative action is taken. This financial pressure is compounded by an aging population and a widening gap between the program's income from payroll taxes and its expenditures. While President Trump has vowed not to cut benefits, recent administrative changes and staffing cuts have raised concerns among some lawmakers about the agency's future.</p>

The move, framed as a defense of democracy, would temporarily override the state's independent redistricting commission.

Past encounters, such as the 2018 Helsinki meeting, have been marked by Trump's focus on personal rapport and Putin's meticulously prepared, power-oriented approach rooted in his KGB background. Former officials note that Trump often relies on instinct over detailed briefings, a tendency Putin may exploit. The analysis suggests these past interactions offer clues for what to expect as they meet to discuss the war in Ukraine.</p>

The company plans to release a new electric truck in 2027, priced around $30,000, by fundamentally re-engineering its manufacturing process at its Louisville, Kentucky plant. This new approach, developed by former Tesla and Apple engineers, involves using 20% fewer parts and a more efficient "assembly tree" system.

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin, the fifth named storm of the Atlantic season, formed near the Cabo Verde islands and is forecast to strengthen into the season's first hurricane by Friday. The U.S. National Hurricane Center projects the storm will become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean islands over the weekend, prompting tropical storm watches in the northern Leeward Islands. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, its long-term path remains uncertain. The storm has already caused deadly flooding in Cabo Verde, where at least eight fatalities have been reported.</p>

          <p>A regulatory filing has revealed that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway acquired a new stake in the beleaguered insurer UnitedHealth, purchasing over 5 million shares valued at approximately $1.6 billion. The investment is notable given UnitedHealth's stock has fallen nearly 50% this year amid a Justice Department investigation and public backlash over healthcare costs. However, the move aligns with Buffett's history of value investing in troubled companies. Following the disclosure, UnitedHealth's stock rose 6% in extended trading, demonstrating the market's confidence in Berkshire's investment decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Data analytics firm Palantir has experienced a dramatic 1,700% surge in value since its 2020 public debut, largely fueled by major government contracts and strong interest from retail investors.

Despite having a fraction of the revenue of tech giants like Apple and Microsoft, Palantir's market valuation has soared past $430 billion, with its stock trading at a high forward price-to-earnings ratio, indicating strong investor expectations for future AI-driven growth.

          <p>Wholesale retailer Costco has announced that it will not offer the abortion pill mifepristone at its pharmacy locations. The company stated that its decision was based on a lack of demand for the prescription medication from its members and other patients, who typically receive the drug directly from their medical providers. This move was praised by the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative anti-abortion group that had advocated against Costco selling the pill. The group framed the decision as a sound business choice, suggesting that becoming an abortion dispensary would alienate the company's family-oriented customer base.</p>

          <p>One year after the World Health Organization declared mpox a global health emergency, the virus continues to spread rapidly in Africa, with outbreaks now present in 24 countries. A new, more transmissible strain has emerged in the Democratic Republic of Congo and spread to neighboring nations, leading to an estimated 97,000 suspected cases on the continent this year. Health experts criticize the global response as dangerously inadequate, citing stalled vaccine distribution, underfunding, and a lack of reliable data.

In a joint statement, the clergy, representing numerous congregations, rejected what they called "fear-based governance" and stressed that long-term solutions to crime require community collaboration, not a military presence.
