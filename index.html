        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a stunning turn of events, Friedrich Merz, the conservative leader in Germany, failed to secure a majority in the parliament vote for chancellor, despite his coalition holding sufficient seats. Merz received only 310 votes out of the required 316 in the 630-seat Bundestag, marking an unprecedented failure in modern German history, likely due to dissent from within the Social Democrat SPD. This defeat undermines Merz's hopes of presenting himself as a strong leader capable of addressing the divisions of the previous government, which collapsed last year. The Bundestag has 14 days to hold further votes, but the initial outcome is a significant blow to Merz's chancellorship ambitions.</p>

          <p>Colombian authorities have arrested over 200 suspected members of the Gulf Clan, the country's largest drug cartel, following accusations of murdering two dozen security force members in the past month. President Gustavo Petro has accused the group of systematically murdering security forces, prompting a response that resulted in the arrest of 217 clan members. The cartel is allegedly paying its members up to $3,500 for each slain police officer as part of a "pistol plan." The Gulf Clan engages in various illegal activities, including gold mining, racketeering, and migrant smuggling, with cocaine trafficking being their primary source of income.</p>

          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan has declared her intention to challenge Labour in Westminster when its policies negatively impact Wales. In a recent speech, Morgan asserted she would "call out" the UK government and "not stay silent" if decisions harm Welsh communities. She specifically called for a reconsideration of cuts to winter fuel payments and disability benefits, arguing that the latter is unlikely to improve employment rates. Her statements come after Chancellor Rachel Reeves introduced changes to personal independence payments (PIP) and reductions in health-related universal credit during the Spring Statement.</p>

          <p>More than 25 protesters were arrested after occupying an academic building at the University of Washington, demanding the school sever its ties with Boeing. Students United for Palestinian Equality and Return claimed responsibility for the takeover, alleging that some of those arrested sustained injuries during the arrest. The protesters are calling for the university to end all donations and material ties with Boeing, including prohibiting Boeing executives and employees from influencing the curriculum. Boeing has a long-standing relationship with the University of Washington, including a $10 million donation to aid in the construction of the Interdisciplinary Engineering Building.</p>

          <p>Former Labour MP Mike Amesbury has cited "big political mistakes" related to benefit cuts as a key factor in Labour's recent election losses, including his former seat falling to Reform UK. Amesbury acknowledged his responsibility for triggering the by-election due to his own actions, but argued that Reform was the beneficiary of government missteps on winter fuel payments and disability benefits. His comments reflect growing dissent within Labour regarding the party's benefit cuts, with several voices blaming these policies for the party's poor performance in local elections. Amesbury hopes the prime minister and Chancellor Rachel Reeves will heed the message from voters and adjust their approach.</p>

          <p>Jack Clark, a co-founder of Anthropic, has stated that Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek is approximately "six to eight months behind where US frontier companies are," despite recent hype. Speaking at the Hill and Valley Forum, Clark acknowledged DeepSeek's "clever algorithmic ideas" but suggested it lacked the necessary computing power to be a major competitor. He also noted that, according to internal Anthropic tests, DeepSeek's models do not currently pose a national security risk. Clark's comments come amid speculation about DeepSeek's next generation models, following the open-sourcing of its Prover-V2 model designed for handling maths proofs.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's plan to offer a $5,000 "baby bonus" to encourage Americans to have more children is unlikely to be effective, according to experts. While the US is experiencing declining birthrates, experts argue that a one-time payment would not address the underlying financial challenges that disincentivize families from having more children. Unaffordable healthcare, soaring housing costs, inaccessible childcare, and a lack of federal parental leave mandates create significant hurdles for families. Experts suggest that more substantial policy changes, such as childcare subsidies and affordable healthcare, are needed to make a meaningful impact on birthrates.</p>

          <p>Americans are increasingly experiencing "tip creep," with gratuity requests expanding to self-checkouts, drive-throughs, and other unexpected places. While tipping has long been a practice in the US to supplement service workers' low wages, its recent expansion is prompting a backlash. Some customers are reducing their tip amounts or opting out altogether in the hope that employers will be forced to increase wages. However, some individuals have become more generous with tips in response to tough economic times. The debate over tipping culture continues as politicians propose eliminating taxes on tips, a move that critics argue could further incentivize low wages.</p>

          <p>In this installment of Ask a Book Critic, a reader requests contemporary fiction that evokes the character-driven, beautifully sculpted sentences of Dickens and Dostoevsky, without the tropes of romantasy. The critic suggests Sarah Parry's *The Essex Serpent*, praising its rich, textured writing and its blend of Victorian fantasia with contemporary psychoanalysis. The critic also recommends Elif Batuman's *The Idiot*, which nods to Dostoevsky, and Tara Isabella Burton's *Social Creature*, describing it as *Crime and Punishment* in couture. These recommendations cater to readers seeking contemporary novels with classic literary sensibilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The growing political divide between young men and women is rooted in economic shifts and traditional gender norms, rather than purely cultural issues. The decline of manufacturing jobs, traditionally held by men, has led to lower social trust and more regressive gender norms. Men are struggling to adapt to the cognitive economy, while women have found empowerment in both employment and traditional caretaking roles. Addressing the crisis of masculinity and redefining men's role in an inclusive way is crucial. Studies show that many young men are not inherently misogynistic, but are influenced by perceived societal expectations.</p>

The poll also reveals concerns among both conservatives and liberals that the U.S. courts may not effectively check Trump's power. A majority of voters believe that Trump's actions have exceeded his constitutional authority, and there is a lack of confidence in the judicial system's ability to restrain an overstepping president.

Two vector control districts have released thousands of sterile male Aedes mosquitoes, leading to significant reductions in the invasive mosquito population. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is known for transmitting diseases such as dengue, yellow fever, Zika, and chikungunya. One district reported an 82% reduction in the mosquito population in the release area, while another logged a 44% average decrease.

          <p>Writer Glennon Doyle, known for her podcast “We Can Do Hard Things,” offers guidance on staying hopeful and compassionate in a challenging world. Doyle emphasizes the importance of aligning with those who support basic human rights and protecting vulnerable populations. She advises individuals to prioritize their own well-being, love, and compassion to avoid succumbing to apathy and inhumanity. Doyle suggests that activism and working towards change should be viewed as a means of preserving one's own humanity rather than solely as a means of changing the world.</p>

          <p>As immigration policies intensify, international students, undocumented residents, and legal permanent residents in Southern California are facing increased fear and uncertainty. The federal government is using data from various agencies to target immigrants, while ICE is building infrastructure for mass detentions. Legal residents and citizens are also being affected, raising concerns about the erosion of civil liberties. The article urges public institutions to provide legal support and protective policies, treating all individuals as vital members of the community. The author believes that if immigrants are under attack, we all are, and fighting for their freedom defends our own.</p>

          <p>DEI initiatives have become a battleground, with Republicans often viewing them as a threat to free speech and meritocracy, while Democrats can sometimes engage in virtue-signaling that stifles open discussion. While some conservatives argue that DEI suppresses free speech, thoughtful DEI training can provide insights into how language affects people from different backgrounds, improving communication. Concerns about DEI limiting meritocracy are also debated, with proponents arguing that DEI is necessary to address historical discrimination. Both sides need to foster tolerance for different perspectives to move beyond endless cultural conflict, the article argues.</p>

          <p>A new nationwide poll reveals that over 90% of Americans use federal science information, such as weather forecasts and job market reports, on a weekly basis, yet only 10% are concerned about potential impacts from cuts to federal science support. The poll, conducted by the Association of Science and Technology Centers, highlights a disconnect between people's reliance on federally provided data and their awareness of its source. Americans depend on federal data for weather, economic insights, and food safety, but this connection is often unacknowledged. The poll also indicates bipartisan agreement on the importance of federal investment in STEM education for future economic prosperity.</p>

          <p>The health secretary has admitted that restricting winter fuel payments negatively impacted Labour's support in the recent local elections. Wes Streeting acknowledged that voters were "not happy" with the decision and that it was a recurring issue during campaigning. Despite this, he maintained that the move was necessary to invest in public services amidst inherited crises. While a formal review of the policy is not underway, Labour is reflecting on the voters' message from the elections, where the party lost a significant number of seats.</p>

          <p>The Department of Education has informed Harvard University that it will end billions of dollars in research grants and other aid unless the school complies with demands from the Trump administration, including those from the antisemitism taskforce. The move stems from the university's rejection of demands related to campus protests against Israel's military campaign in Gaza. Harvard contends that the funding cuts would have stark consequences for patients, students, and researchers by ending crucial medical and scientific research. The White House said that these efforts would include deporting alleged "Hamas sympathizers" and revoking student visas.</p>

          <p>The UK government is contemplating restricting visa applications from nationalities with a higher likelihood of overstaying their visas and seeking asylum. The proposed crackdown targets countries like Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka, where individuals often enter the UK legally on work or study visas before claiming asylum. While the Home Office has not published recent statistics on visa overstays, the move aims to address perceived abuse of the asylum system. Labour has also expressed intentions to reduce both illegal and legal migration, including measures to combat small boat crossings and develop training plans to reduce reliance on migrant workers.</p>

          <p>Shares of Hugo Boss experienced a surge on Tuesday following the release of first-quarter sales figures that, while showing a decline, were better than anticipated. Despite macroeconomic and tariff uncertainties, the high-end German retailer reiterated its full-year guidance. Revenues decreased by 2% on a currency adjusted basis, amounting to 999 million euros ($1.13 billion), slightly exceeding analysts' forecasts. The weaker sales were attributed to soft demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China. The group confirmed its 2025 outlook, projecting full-year sales to align with the previous year's figures, ranging from 4.2 billion euros to 4.4 billion euros.</p>
