          <h2>Starbucks Reports Sixth Consecutive Quarter of Declining Same-Store Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 16:06:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starbucks announced its sixth straight quarter of falling same-store sales, with a global decline of 2%, which was steeper than analysts had anticipated. Despite the global downturn, the company's North American market performed slightly better than expected, with a smaller sales drop than projected. The coffee giant's overall net sales saw a modest increase of 4% to $9.5 billion, but earnings per share were impacted by a tax item and a one-time investment in a company event. The results come as Starbucks continues to navigate a challenging consumer environment while implementing its turnaround strategy.</p>

          <p>Shares of cybersecurity firm CyberArk surged by 13% following a report that Palo Alto Networks is in discussions to acquire the company for over $20 billion. This potential acquisition would be the largest yet for Palo Alto Networks, highlighting the growing importance of cloud and identity security in the tech industry. The news pushed CyberArk's stock to a record high, reflecting strong investor confidence in the identity management software maker's value. The deal comes during an active period for major acquisitions in the cybersecurity sector, with companies like Google and Cisco also making multi-billion dollar purchases.</p>

          <p>YouTube is set to roll out a new artificial intelligence tool designed to estimate users' ages and better protect teenagers from inappropriate content. The technology will analyze viewing history and account age to infer if a user is under 18, subsequently disabling personalized ads and limiting exposure to certain content categories. This initiative builds on existing safety features and addresses the platform's popularity among teens, with 90% of them using the service. The tool will be tested with a small group of U.S. users before a wider rollout, with a manual verification option available for those misidentified.</p>

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has agreed to a $6.45 million settlement in a federal lawsuit filed by Jewish students and a professor over alleged antisemitism during pro-Palestinian campus protests in 2024. The plaintiffs claimed the university allowed an encampment to create a "Jew Exclusion Zone," violating their civil rights by blocking access to parts of the campus. As part of the settlement, UCLA is prohibited from facilitating the exclusion of Jewish individuals from campus areas and will donate funds to Jewish community groups and an anti-antisemitism initiative. This is a significant outcome in the wave of lawsuits against universities following the Israel-Hamas war.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that his falling out with Jeffrey Epstein occurred because the financier repeatedly hired employees away from his Mar-a-Lago resort, specifically naming victim Virginia Giuffre as one of those "stolen." Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump confirmed that he banned Epstein from the club after warning him against poaching staff from the spa. Giuffre, who was later subjected to sexual assault by Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, was recruited while working as a locker-room attendant at the club. This new explanation for the end of their friendship contradicts previous statements and comes amid pressure for the administration to release Epstein-related files.</p>

An Israeli-American activist at the scene and the Palestinian education ministry identified an Israeli settler as the shooter. The incident allegedly occurred after a bulldozer from a nearby settlement destroyed Palestinian property, leading to a confrontation. The suspected shooter, who has been previously sanctioned by the UK for violence against Palestinians, claims he fired in self-defense after being attacked. Israeli police are investigating the shooting and have detained the suspect, five Palestinians, and two foreign activists.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has announced it will recognize a Palestinian state at the United Nations in September unless Israel takes significant steps towards a ceasefire in Gaza. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's declaration is a major diplomatic pressure tactic aimed at reviving the two-state solution. The announcement came as sources revealed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considering a plan to annex territories in Gaza if a ceasefire deal with Hamas is not reached. This potential Israeli move and the UK's diplomatic shift create a new, high-stakes dynamic in the ongoing efforts to resolve the conflict.</p>

Two Fed governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, have advocated for a rate cut and may dissent from a decision to hold rates, marking a rare public disagreement. The meeting will also be the first since President Trump's public criticism of the central bank, adding political pressure to the economic deliberations. While arguments for a rate cut exist, the consensus on the committee appears to favor waiting for more data, likely delaying any policy change until September. (not investment advice)</p>

Conversely, firms like Novartis and Roche, which have more extensive overseas operations, could face greater financial risk.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For seniors on fixed incomes facing high inflation and borrowing costs, a reverse mortgage can provide a necessary financial bridge by converting home equity into regular payments. However, it's crucial to approach this option strategically, using it for essential needs like bills or medical expenses rather than as a casual funding source. Homeowners should carefully select the right payment structure—lump sum, monthly payments, or a line of credit—to match their specific needs. It's also wise to compare a reverse mortgage against other home equity options and be prepared for a process that includes mandatory counseling. (not investment advice)</p>

The current 90-day truce on most U.S. "reciprocal" tariffs and China's retaliatory measures is set to expire on August 12.
