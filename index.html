          <p>An Iranian ballistic missile directly hit Soroka Hospital in Beersheba, southern Israel, causing the evacuation of 20 patients, according to Israeli authorities. Dozens of ballistic missiles were launched at Israel, with police reporting projectile impacts at multiple locations in central Israel, including the hospital site. Israeli officials have condemned the attack, stating they will continue to defend their people. Bomb disposal units are on the scene, urging the public to stay clear of impact sites as investigations continue into the extent of the damage and potential casualties.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed remarkable frescoes from 2,000-year-old wall plaster discovered in Central London in 2021, revealing details of a luxurious Roman villa. The frescoes, originating from at least 20 walls, showcase beautifully painted musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, providing insights into the affluence of the area, dubbed the "Beverly Hills of Roman London." One fragment is scored with the Latin word Fecit, meaning "has made this," hinting at the artists' identity, while comparisons to other frescoes across Britain and Europe suggest the work of skilled painters who traveled the Roman empire. The discovery of the plaster, along with a mosaic and Roman cemetery, highlights the city's early expansion and the Romans' commitment to London as a place to settle and invest.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has resumed processing student visa applications, but now requires applicants to unlock their social media accounts for review. Consular officers will scrutinize posts for content deemed hostile to the U.S., its government, culture, or principles. Refusal to grant access may lead to visa rejection, raising concerns about ideological vetting and potential chilling effects on free speech. The State Department has also instructed consulates to prioritize students enrolling in colleges with fewer than 15% foreign students, adding another layer of scrutiny for international students in the U.S.</p>

          <p>New Zealand has halted NZ$18.2 million in funding to the Cook Islands due to concerns over wide-ranging deals struck with China, covering infrastructure, tourism, technology, and deep-sea mineral exploration. Wellington expressed being blindsided by the agreements, emphasizing that funding relies on a high-trust bilateral relationship. The Cook Islands responded by stating its determination to address the issue urgently, valuing New Zealand's development assistance. The deals with China have sparked protests in the Cook Islands and a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Mark Brown, highlighting the complex dynamics between the Cook Islands, New Zealand, and China's growing influence in the Pacific.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that while the idea of regime change in Iran may seem appealing, history suggests it is a near-impossible task fraught with enduring troubles and miseries. The author points to the repressive nature of the Iranian regime, its support for terrorism, and its pursuit of nuclear weapons as reasons for wanting it gone. However, the lessons of Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya serve as cautionary tales, emphasizing that regime destruction does not guarantee successful regime change. The piece concludes by urging caution, highlighting the potential for civic instability and the challenges of replacing a revolutionary regime.</p>

          <p>Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders was cited for driving at 101 mph in a 60 mph zone in suburban Cleveland. The incident occurred just past midnight on Tuesday, and Sanders could pay a $250 fine to waive the fourth-degree misdemeanor case. Sanders, the son of Hall of Fame player Deion Sanders, was drafted in the fifth round of the NFL draft this spring and is competing for the Brownsâ€™ starting quarterback position for the 2025 season.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government will resume issuing international student visas but will require applicants to make their social media accounts public for thorough screening. The move follows a suspension of visa interviews in May for academic, vocational, and cultural exchange students. Prospective students will be vetted for "hostile attitudes" toward the U.S., its culture, government, institutions, or founding principles. The Trump administration has tightened standards for international students, citing alleged acts of anti-Semitism during student protests against Israel.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump questioned the immigration status of workers installing flagpoles at the White House, asking, "Any illegal immigrants?" The remarks, seemingly made in jest, followed a reporter's question about deportation efforts. Trump stated that his administration is removing "murderers, drug dealers, people that are mentally insane" from the country. The comments came after the workers erected two 88-foot-tall flagpoles at Trump's direction, which he described as a gift to the White House.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As tariffs increase, businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to reclassify products and lower duty rates. This legal practice involves altering materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit a different "harmonized system code." While most new tariffs are broad-based, exemptions exist, creating opportunities for companies to benefit through strategic design choices. Examples include manufacturers bundling steel and aluminum, or hoodie makers switching to cotton to save on duty costs. Columbia Sportswear and Converse are also cited for using tariff engineering to reduce costs.</p>
