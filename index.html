          <p>The US Senate confirmed David Perdue, a known critic of China, as the new US ambassador to China. This appointment comes at a time of heightened tensions between the two countries, marked by trade disputes and tariff escalations. Perdue, a former US senator for Georgia, has expressed views of China as a global threat and previously stated that Beijing is waging a new kind of war against the US. China's foreign ministry responded by reiterating its position on US-China ties, emphasizing the need for equality, mutual respect, and reciprocity in any dialogue, as trade brinkmanship continues between the two superpowers.</p>

          <p>This article from The Guardian discusses the UK's relationship with the US under President Trump. The article suggests that despite the UK's efforts to appease Trump, it has not yielded significant benefits, particularly in trade negotiations. It also points out the UK's dilemma in balancing its relationship with the US and its own interests, especially in relation to Europe. The author questions whether the UK's approach of trying to humor Trump is an effective diplomatic strategy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has lifted sanctions on several Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in what is being viewed as a charm offensive aimed at improving relations with the EU. The sanctions were initially imposed in 2021 in response to EU sanctions over human rights abuses in Xinjiang. This move is seen as an attempt by China to woo the EU amid uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump's tariffs and to potentially open the door for trade discussions. However, it is unlikely to lead to a revival of a frozen investment deal between the EU and China.</p>
