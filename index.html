          <p>The Trump administration has invited five African leaders to Washington to discuss strategic priorities, including migration, counter-terrorism, and access to critical resources like minerals and oil. This reflects a shift in U.S. policy towards Africa, moving from aid-based relationships to more transactional, trade-focused partnerships, partly driven by increasing competition from China and Russia. Key topics on the agenda include maritime security in the Gulf of Guinea, illegal immigration routes, and potential U.S. military basing rights in the region.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Israeli military is engaged in the systematic demolition of Gaza, an action some prominent scholars have characterized as genocidal. The author contends this destruction is being facilitated by private contractors, pointing to social media advertisements seeking civilian bulldozer drivers for demolition work in the territory. The article criticizes what it calls insufficient mainstream media coverage and argues that the wholesale destruction of entire neighborhoods is a flagrant violation of international law.</p>

A massive search and rescue operation is underway as officials face intense scrutiny over the adequacy and timeliness of their public warnings and evacuation orders.</p>

          <p>In a podcast interview, conservative legal analyst George Conway argues that the greatest threat to the rule of law in the U.S. is not the failure of the judiciary, but the failure of Congress to uphold its constitutional duties. He contends that while courts have a role, they are structurally limited and cannot, by themselves, save democracy from a president who is determined to ignore legal and constitutional norms. Conway asserts that the proper constitutional remedy for such executive overreach is impeachment and removal, which requires political will from Congress. (not investment advice)</p>

During his stops, he has urged Democrats to be more assertive in challenging President Trump and has attempted to connect with voters by discussing his rural upbringing.</p>
