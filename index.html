          <p>As the Dalai Lama approaches his 90th birthday, he has confirmed that the 600-year-old institution will continue, with a framework for his succession to be discussed. This announcement comes amid celebrations in Dharamsala, India, and addresses long-standing speculation about the future of Tibetan Buddhism's spiritual leadership. The decision carries significant political weight, as China insists it has the sole authority to choose his successor, a claim rejected by the Tibetan government-in-exile and its global supporters. The spiritual leader has previously stated that his reincarnation would be found outside of Chinese-controlled territory.</p>

While Beijing attempts to portray the relationship as stable and problem-free, the EU is focused on achieving a more balanced partnership.

          <p>The jury in Sean "Diddy" Combs' federal trial remains deadlocked on the most serious charge of racketeering after reaching verdicts on four other counts. Legal experts suggest the complexity of the RICO charge, which is difficult for laypeople to understand, is likely the cause of the impasse. The defense's strategy of not calling any witnesses is described as "high stakes poker," as it relies entirely on creating reasonable doubt from the prosecution's case. The judge has instructed the jurors to continue deliberating in an effort to reach a unanimous decision on all counts.</p>

          <p>An expert on authoritarianism has highlighted President Trump's recent rhetoric as "chilling," particularly his threat to deport U.S.-born citizens who commit certain crimes. During a visit to a migrant detention facility, Trump suggested that "homegrowns" who commit violent acts should be removed from the country, echoing similar comments he made in April. This rhetoric raises significant legal and constitutional questions, as stripping nationality from birthright citizens is a complex and historically fraught process. The comments came as the Justice Department reportedly prioritizes revoking the status of some naturalized citizens.</p>

          <p>After two days of deliberations, the jury in the federal trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs announced it had reached a verdict on four of the five counts against him but was unable to agree on the most serious charge of racketeering. The judge has instructed the 12-person panel to continue deliberating in an attempt to reach a unanimous decision. The racketeering charge is particularly complex, requiring prosecutors to prove Combs operated a coordinated criminal enterprise, which legal experts note is a challenging threshold to meet.</p>

          <p>The United States has paused some weapons shipments to Ukraine, a decision the White House attributed to the need to "put America's interests first" after a review of military stockpiles. The halt reportedly affects critical supplies such as air defense missiles and precision munitions, which are vital for Ukraine's defense against intensified Russian attacks. This move comes amid concerns within the Trump administration that extensive aid to Ukraine has depleted U.S. military readiness, representing a significant policy shift in support for Kyiv.</p>

          <p>Intel's new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, is reportedly exploring a significant change to the company's contract manufacturing strategy, potentially abandoning efforts to sell its 18A chipmaking technology to external customers. This move would reverse a key plan from his predecessor and comes as the 18A process faces delays while rival TSMC advances its own technology. Instead, the company may focus its resources on the next-generation 14A process to better compete for major clients like Apple and Nvidia, though the shift could result in a substantial financial write-off.
