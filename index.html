        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Marco Rubio has voiced concerns that a federal court order preventing the deportation of individuals to South Sudan could significantly undermine U.S. foreign policy. The order, issued by a Massachusetts judge, requires the U.S. government to maintain custody of deportees while they challenge their removal orders. Rubio argues that this intervention has already complicated diplomatic relations with Libya, South Sudan, and Djibouti, and poses a threat to the president's authority in conducting foreign policy. The Trump administration has filed court documents seeking reconsideration of the order, citing the detention of dangerous criminals in a sensitive location. The deportees, including those with criminal records, were being held at a U.S. Naval base in Djibouti. </p>

          <p>Jon Worrell was arrested and charged with the murder of his wife, Doris Worrell, who was found fatally shot at their Georgia business in 2006. Initially, authorities believed Doris' death was the result of a robbery or retaliation, but the investigation took a turn after investigators located the family's former live-in nanny in Costa Rica. The nanny, Paola Yarberry, provided information that corroborated existing evidence, leading to Worrell's arrest in Missouri. The investigation revealed marital issues between the Worrells, including an inappropriate relationship between Jon and Paola, who later lived together as a couple in Costa Rica. </p>

          <p>A new food aid system in Gaza, presented as neutral, was conceived and largely developed by Israelis to undermine Hamas. The plan involves foreign contractors distributing food, displacing experienced aid agencies like the United Nations. Israeli officials proposed the plan to circumvent the UN, prevent food from falling into militants' hands, and move distribution to Israeli-controlled zones. U.N. officials warn that the plan could restrict food aid and facilitate an Israeli plan to displace civilians out of northern Gaza. </p>
