          <p>A U.S. airstrike in Yemen has reportedly killed at least 68 people at a migrant detention center in the Saada Governorate, according to the Yemen Civil Defense. The strike also injured 47 people and targeted a center housing around 100 African migrants. The U.S. military's Central Command stated that its campaign since March 15 has struck over 800 targets, killing hundreds of Houthi fighters and leaders in response to Houthi attacks on shipping and strikes on Israel. Central Command said its strikes have degraded the pace and effectiveness of Houthi attacks.</p>

          <p>Katy Perry is scheduled to perform in mainland China in November, marking her first shows there since being reportedly denied a visa in 2017 due to a controversial sunflower dress worn during a 2015 Taiwan concert.

The sunflower dress was seen as a symbol of a student movement opposing a trade pact between Taiwan and mainland China.

          <p>The Children's Commissioner for England is urging the government to ban artificial intelligence (AI) applications that generate sexually explicit images of children. Dame Rachel de Souza emphasized the need for a total ban on "nudification" apps, which use AI to make real photos appear nude. A government spokesperson said that child sexual abuse material is illegal, and that plans are in place for further offences for creating, possessing, or distributing AI tools designed to create such content. The report highlights the disproportionate targeting of girls and young women, causing them to avoid online engagement to reduce the risk.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is increasingly relying on its domestic drone program, called the Line of Drones, as a key strategy in its conflict with Russia, especially given uncertainty surrounding continued U.S. military aid. The program involves assembling small, exploding drones within Ukraine, often in basement shelters near the front lines. This initiative aims to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities amid fluctuating signals from the Trump administration regarding future support and peace talks. The expanded drone program becomes particularly vital if peace talks fail or the United States reduces arms shipments.</p>

          <p>Indian authorities are investigating last week's killings of 26 people in Kashmir and have demolished the houses of at least 10 alleged militants. Security forces have detained more people for questioning. India accuses Pakistan of supporting the militants behind the attack, but Islamabad denies the allegations. The attack was the deadliest on civilians in the disputed territory in two decades, and troops from both sides have traded fire across the border.</p>
