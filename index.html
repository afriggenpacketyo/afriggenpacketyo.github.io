          <p>A New York Times article reports that Newark Liberty International Airport faced major flight delays, some lasting up to seven hours, due to critical staffing shortages among air traffic controllers. The FAA acknowledged having at least three controllers scheduled per hour, but sources indicated the number of fully certified controllers was sometimes as low as one or two, far below the target of 14. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed the Biden administration for a mishandled relocation of air traffic control, while United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby reassured customers about flight safety amidst the disruptions. The FAA is planning infrastructure upgrades and considering flight reductions to mitigate future delays, acknowledging the antiquated equipment currently in use. </p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is launching an emergency task force comprised of experts from the FAA, Verizon, and L3Harris to ensure safety and efficiency at Newark Liberty International Airport.

The FAA is considering temporary flight reductions at Newark and is working to replace copper lines with fiber lines to improve reliability. This article reports that the FAA will meet with airlines to discuss potential flight cuts and is asking the Office of Inspector General to investigate decisions made by the prior administration. </p>

          <p>A Democratic National Committee panel has recommended redoing the elections for vice chair positions held by David Hogg and Malcolm Kenyatta, citing violations of party charter during the initial February vote. This decision follows a challenge from Kalyn Free, who lost to Hogg and alleges that the DNC improperly combined questions, giving male candidates an advantage. The article notes that this comes amid separate controversy surrounding Hogg's efforts to primary sitting Democrats, which has ignited debate within the party.

          <p>A CBS News article highlights concerns that proposed funding cuts by the Trump administration could jeopardize NOAA's long-standing CO2 data collection program, which began in the 1960s. Professor Ralph Keeling, son of the scientist who first documented the buildup of CO2 in the atmosphere, warns that these cuts would eliminate funding for the program and end decades of unbroken data collection. The Keeling Curve, a graph plotting the rise of carbon dioxide, closely matches the rise in global average temperatures. Keeling states that halting the program would be like ‚Äúturning off the headlights on a dark street at night.‚Äù </p>
