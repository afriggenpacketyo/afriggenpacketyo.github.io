            <p>The UK economy grew by 0.5% in February, exceeding expectations, with a notable increase in exports to the US as businesses rushed to beat impending tariffs. The services sector, particularly computer programming and car dealerships, experienced a strong month, contributing to the surprise rise. While Chancellor Reeves hailed the figures as encouraging, she acknowledged the need for further action to stimulate economic growth. Concerns remain about the impact of US tariffs and domestic tax increases on future growth, with some economists predicting a short-lived boost.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is considering referring Maine to the Justice Department over the state's policy allowing transgender athletes to participate in girls' sports, citing violations of Title IX. The Education Department claims Maine's Department of Education is indifferent to female athletes, potentially threatening their safety and equal opportunities. Maine Republicans have criticized Governor Mills for creating a 'hostage situation' that jeopardizes federal funding, while LGBTQ+ rights groups defend the state's approach. Federal authorities are also investigating claims that Maine schools withhold information about students' gender transitioning from parents.</p>

            <p>President Trump briefly imposed high tariffs, causing global economic havoc before suspending them hours later due to plunging stock markets and widespread panic. The reversal highlights the volatility and unpredictability of Trump's second term, characterized by impulsive decisions and policy flip-flops. While Trump claims the tariffs were intended to bring back manufacturing jobs and reduce trade deficits, critics argue they are driven by vengeance and ignorance of global economics. The tariffs, even briefly, triggered significant market losses and damaged international relations.</p>

            <p>China has redefined the 'place of origin' for integrated circuits (ICs) to favor local semiconductor manufacturers amidst escalating US-China trade tensions. The new rule determines origin based on wafer fabrication location, potentially boosting domestic foundries like SMIC and undermining Trump's efforts to bring manufacturing back to the US. Analysts suggest the change could lead to chip developers processing products locally and discourage US-based chip fabrication. The announcement comes as China retaliates with increased tariffs on US products.</p>

Bank of America suggests a 25% increase, potentially pricing the iPhone 16 Pro at $1,500, while Wedbush estimates $3,500, requiring a $30 billion investment over three years to move just 10% of the supply chain to the U.S. Experts cite a lack of skilled labor and the need to import components as major hurdles, making the prospect unlikely.

While a Capital One Shopping Research report found that approximately one-third of all clothing and apparel purchased in the U.S. over the past year was secondhand, the same tariffs driving consumers to resale may also limit the supply of secondhand clothing and, in turn, drive prices up. Experts encourage consumers to do their homework, whether that's revisiting the size of their clothing budget, shopping in their own closets or monitoring price fluctuations for things they really need.</p>

            <p>U.S. stock futures initially showed slightly higher openings despite China's announcement of increased tariffs on U.S. imports, but were headed lower again. Global shares wobbled following Beijing's move, reflecting market uncertainty. Investors are viewing Mr. Trump's decision to delay higher tariffs for most countries for 90 days as a ploy, not a pivot. Wall Street swooned on Thursday. The S&P 500 tumbled 3.5%, slicing into Wednesday's surge of 9.5% following Mr. Trump's decision to pause many of his tariffs worldwide. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The US President Donald Trump has signed another executive order targeting China’s dominant shipyards, in a move that adds fresh uncertainty to a global shipping sector that is already reeling from the disruptions caused by Washington’s tariff war. The order instructed the Office of the US Trade Representative to consider proposing tariffs on ship-to-shore cranes and other cargo-handling equipment with links to China. If implemented, the tariffs would affect most US ports.</p>

            <p>An investigation is underway into a helicopter crash in the Hudson River that killed six people, including a family of Spanish tourists. The chopper, operated by New York Helicopter Tours, crashed shortly after departing from the Wall St. Heliport. Video shows the helicopter plunging into the water without a tail rotor or a main rotor blade. The Jersey City Mayor expressed concerns about air traffic over the Hudson and hopes this incident brings more attention to safety.</p>

            <p>Beijing retaliated against U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods by slapping 125% tariffs on U.S. goods. Even though President Trump rolled back some of his new tariffs, most countries in the world are still seeing the highest import taxes in over a century, NPR's Scott Horsley tells Up First. Investors are worried that China's triple-digit tariff on the U.S. could drag economic growth. Tariffs could more than double the price of goods the U.S. buys from China, such as clothing, furniture and electronics.</p>

            <p>Academic freedom advocates are bracing for the next phase of the government's effort to reshape higher education: an overhaul of the system accrediting institutions of higher learning. Trump has made no secret of such plans. Dismantling the accreditation system would be a powerful tool to further erode the separation between the government’s political ideology and what US students are taught. The move is seen as part the right’s broader strategy to undermine higher education as a whole.</p>

            <p>Major League Baseball is increasingly drawing private equity investors as the league faces major shifts in player salaries and media rights. MLB does not have a salary cap for its players — unlike the National Football League, National Basketball Association and National Hockey League — which has led to some of the biggest contracts in sports and major pay disparities. These factors present risk, but also a lot of opportunity, said Michelle McKenna, a senior advisor in Evercore's strategic advisory practice, who has a focus on technology, entertainment and sports.

The FTC claims Meta shouldn't have been allowed to buy Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion in 2014, and the agency is calling for those units to be sliced off from the Menlo Park, California, company.</p>

Over the last 80 years, the poultry industry has significantly altered chickens’ genetics, breeding them to grow as big as possible in as little time as possible, all in an effort to quickly and efficiently pump out more and more chicken. This rapid growth takes an enormous toll on the chickens’ bodies, with many in pain due to lameness, or difficulty walking.</p>
