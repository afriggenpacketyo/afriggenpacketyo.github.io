          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its reusable X-37B rocket plane, an unpiloted mini space shuttle, on a classified mission for the U.S. Space Force from Kennedy Space Center. This marks the eighth flight for the program, with the Falcon 9 rocket achieving its 66th booster landing in Florida. The mission's publicly disclosed objectives include testing high-speed, tightly-targeted laser communications between the X-37B and data relay satellites, alongside a sophisticated quantum navigation sensor. These technologies are designed to enhance the resilience, reliability, and data transport speeds of space-based communication systems, while also enabling robust navigation in GPS-denied or cislunar environments, contributing significantly to diversified and redundant space architectures for the Space Force.</p>

          <p>Millions of travelers across the UK are bracing for significant traffic and train disruptions this bank holiday weekend, primarily due to a strike by the RMT union over pay, safety, and staffing. The industrial action will severely impact the Cross Country train network, with no services on Saturday and limited schedules on Sunday and Monday. The RAC has also issued warnings about heavy road congestion, especially on the M5 between Bristol and Devon, as three million getaway journeys are planned. Network Rail strongly advises all passengers to check their routes before traveling, emphasizing potential alterations and cancellations across various lines, including LNER services. Weather forecasts indicate a largely dry and warm weekend for much of the country, with central and southern England experiencing the highest temperatures.</p>

          <p>Erik Menendez, convicted alongside his brother Lyle for the 1989 murders of their parents, was denied parole by California officials after a nearly 10-hour hearing. The parole panel cited Menendez's "behavior in prison," including multiple policy violations since 2013, as the primary reason for their decision, despite family support for his release. Menendez appeared virtually, arguing he no longer poses a threat and takes full responsibility, reiterating claims of self-defense due to alleged sexual and physical abuse. However, the Los Angeles County District Attorney maintains the self-defense claim is false. The panel acknowledged the tragic nature of the case but found he still poses an unreasonable risk, scheduling his next hearing in three years.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, halting further expansion and ordering the winding down of Florida's "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center, located in the sensitive Everglades. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ruled the facility violates environmental laws and causes irreparable harm to the ecosystem, demanding a reduction in detainee population within 60 days and the removal of temporary infrastructure. Florida officials, including Governor Ron DeSantis, have strongly criticized the decision, filing an immediate appeal and asserting that the state's operation of the facility exempts it from federal environmental oversight. This legal battle highlights the ongoing conflict between the Trump administration's immigration policies and environmental protection, with advocates celebrating the ruling as a victory for the Everglades.</p>

This not-guilty verdict significantly eases a serious legal threat to his family's powerful political movement, particularly as his daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, currently serves as prime minister. The outcome is crucial for the Shinawatras, whose political star has recently shown signs of waning in public opinion polls, highlighting the complex interplay of legal and political dynamics in Thailand.</p>

          <p>An international study has uncovered how corn plants communicate with their neighbors by releasing a gas called linalool, which prompts nearby plants to alter their soil. Published in the peer-reviewed journal Science, this research offers new insights into plant interactions and their environmental responses. The scientists conducted surveys in maize fields in Hainan, China, observing that densely planted corn in inner rows suffered less herbivore damage than those at the edges, but also exhibited reduced growth. Optimizing the release of linalool could potentially be leveraged to combat agricultural pests and enhance crop yields, showcasing a fascinating aspect of plant biology and offering clues for future agricultural strategies.</p>

Earlier, a drone attack against a police helicopter in a rural area outside Medellin killed at least 12 officers who were on a mission to eradicate coca leaf crops.

Musk, who launched xAI in 2023 to directly compete with OpenAI, reportedly sought to form an investor consortium for the acquisition, though neither Zuckerberg nor Meta signed the letter of intent.

Rice inflation notably eased to 90.7% after two months of surging prices, offering some relief from a recent shortage.

          <h2>Governor Newsom Accuses Trump of Election Rigging Amid California Redistricting Campaign</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has launched a partisan redistricting campaign, accusing President Trump of attempting to "rig the election" and undermine American democracy. Newsom argues that California's proposed ballot measure, Proposition 50, which favors Democrats by potentially removing five Republican congressional seats, is a necessary counterweight to Trump's authoritarian policies, including his stance on vote-by-mail and deployment of federal agents. The governor framed the effort as a response to similar Republican actions in states like Texas, aiming to neutralize such moves and ensure a "fair chance" for the American people. This political maneuvering highlights the escalating national battle over electoral maps and the future control of Congress.</p>

          <p>Authorities have dismantled a 13-acre illegal marijuana cultivation site in Sequoia National Park, removing nearly 2,400 plants and 2,000 pounds of trash. The site was found to be spewing hazardous chemicals, including the banned insecticide methamidophos, which poses severe risks to the environment, wildlife, and human health through water contamination. Farm operators had extensively damaged the hillside by cutting terraces, diverting creeks, and clearing natural vegetation to irrigate the thirsty marijuana plants. This bust marks a significant win in the National Park Service's decades-long battle against well-organized drug-trafficking organizations that exploit the park's vast, untraveled expanses for large-scale marijuana production, highlighting ongoing environmental degradation in protected areas.</p>

          <p>An eyewitness, identified as "Mike," alleges that American subcontractors hired to secure Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) aid sites have fired indiscriminately at Palestinians seeking food. Mike, who drove aid trucks for an American logistics company, secretly recorded videos with gunfire and described seeing both IDF and American security personnel shooting at aid-seekers, not combatants. He reported witnessing intense desperation among crowds and was tasked with cleaning up human and animal remains near one site. GHF denies these "categorically false" allegations, stating their contractors do not fire on civilians and no one has been killed by gunfire at their sites. The IDF also denies deliberately targeting civilians but is investigating recent reports of harm.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Alina Habba, a former personal lawyer for President Donald Trump, was not lawfully appointed as the acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey. Judge Matthew Brann disqualified Habba from participating in ongoing criminal cases, stating her appointment by the Trump administration through a "novel series of legal and personnel moves" was invalid since July 1, 2025. Attorney General Pam Bondi immediately announced an appeal, defending Habba's "incredible work" and vowing to protect her position from "activist judicial attacks." The decision was stayed pending appeal, but it challenges the legality of the administration's method for installing its preferred prosecutors, stemming from a prior rejection by New Jersey federal judges.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department announced it will continuously vet over 55 million U.S. visa holders, including tourists and students, for violations of state and federal law, with potential visa revocation and deportation for indicators of ineligibility. This marks a significant expansion of the Trump administration's crackdown, adding "anti-American" views and antisemitism to screening criteria. Concurrently, the U.S. will immediately stop issuing worker visas for commercial truck drivers, citing concerns for American lives and livelihoods, and national security. Secretary of State Marco Rubio highlighted safety issues, including a fatal crash involving a foreign driver who reportedly doesn't speak English, despite the American Trucking Association's denial of a "foreign labor dumping" narrative.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court issued a complex and confusing order regarding the Trump administration's cancellation of numerous public health grants, which Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson described as "Calvinball jurisprudence." The decision, with a 5-4 split on jurisdictional issues, allows the administration to slash hundreds of millions in NIH funding related to DEI, gender identity, and COVID-19, reversing a lower court's order. The ruling forces plaintiffs, including states and public health groups, to potentially split their lawsuit between different courts, delaying relief for research into critical areas like suicide prevention and Alzheimer's. Critics argue this outcome makes challenging government actions exceedingly difficult and risks the loss of vital research and the "euthanization of animal subjects," ultimately benefiting the administration.</p>
