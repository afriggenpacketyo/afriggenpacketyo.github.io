          <p>Mohamed Soliman, the suspect in the Boulder, Colorado attack on a pro-Israel demonstration, has been charged with a federal hate crime. Soliman allegedly told investigators he planned the attack for a year and wanted to kill all Zionist people, using Molotov cocktails and a makeshift flamethrower while yelling "Free Palestine." Eight victims were hospitalized with burns, and police recovered multiple unlit Molotov cocktails at the scene. Soliman, who is in the U.S. illegally after his B2 visa expired, is being held on a $10,000,000 bond, and the FBI is investigating the incident as an act of terror.</p>

The State Department is reportedly planning to "aggressively" revoke visas of Chinese students with connections to the Communist Party and in critical fields.

          <p>Shares of online sports betting companies fell after Illinois lawmakers approved a budget that increases taxes on sports wagers. The budget includes a tax of 25 cents per wager on the first 20 million online sports bets, rising to 50 cents per bet after that threshold. Analysts predict that DraftKings and Flutter's FanDuel will likely face the higher tax rate on a portion of their bets, while smaller competitors will experience a more modest impact. The move has raised concerns among investors that other states may follow Illinois' lead to address budget deficits by increasing taxes on online sports gambling.</p>

          <p>Rep. Byron Donalds, a Republican from Florida, introduced the "Strengthening American Nuclear Energy Act" to codify several of President Donald Trump's executive actions aimed at boosting nuclear energy production and use in the United States. The bill seeks to make permanent orders related to deploying advanced nuclear reactor technologies, managing spent nuclear fuel, reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and reforming the Department of Energy's nuclear reactor testing. While supporters argue this will assert U.S. dominance in the nuclear space, critics like Ernest Moniz, an Obama-era energy secretary, warn that expediting safety regulations could be problematic.</p>

Maryland has seen a decline in gun violence since enacting laws aimed at curbing access to dangerous weapons.

Pervasive anti-Semitism enables attackers to believe they are striking back at Israel by harming any Jew, assigning responsibility for Israeli policies to Jewish people worldwide.

          <p>A federal jury convicted Deputy Trevor Kirk of using excessive force, but a new U.S. Attorney, Bill Essayli, requested a review and ultimately offered Kirk a misdemeanor plea deal. This decision led to the resignation of several federal prosecutors and raised concerns about the independence of the Justice Department. The judge sentenced Kirk to four months in prison after granting the government's request to dismiss the felony charge. The case has sparked controversy and debate over the handling of law enforcement cases.</p>

          <p>A recent study in Germany reveals that over 20% of women aged 18-59 experienced sexual assault before the age of 18, highlighting an alarmingly high prevalence of such offenses.

The effects of such abuse can be devastating, potentially destroying lives, and often occur in environments where children should feel safe. More than a third of respondents had never previously disclosed the abuse, while only 7% had filed charges against their perpetrators.</p>
