          <p>A 65-year-old woman from Jacksonville, Florida, was arrested and charged with multiple offenses, including driving under the influence and drug possession. Putnam County Sheriff's deputies initiated a traffic stop after observing her vehicle driving erratically. During the stop, authorities found substances that tested positive for fentanyl and methamphetamine. The encounter with fentanyl led to a deputy being hospitalized as a precaution, though she has since made a full recovery. The woman was subsequently booked into the Putnam County Jail.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the terrifying "Son of Sam" killing spree through the eyes of two survivors, Robert Violante and Carl Denaro. Violante was on his first date with Stacy Moskowitz when they were both shot, leaving him blind and taking her life. Denaro was shot in the head months earlier but survived, with doctors inserting a metal plate in his skull. Both men reflect on how the attacks irrevocably changed their lives, derailing their futures but also revealing their own profound resilience. They expressed relief upon the arrest of David Berkowitz, glad that his reign of terror had ended.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the case against Bryan Kohberger for the University of Idaho murders, the prosecutor has suggested a second weapon might have been involved. This theory stems from injuries on one victim, Kaylee Goncalves, that appeared different from the primary knife wounds. Additionally, the prosecutor speculated that Kohberger may have spared a surviving roommate because he panicked after spending more time and killing more people than planned. The article also reiterates the critical role that DNA evidence found on a knife sheath played in identifying Kohberger as the suspect in the quadruple homicide.</p>

          <p>Fifteen people were arrested across England following protests and counter-protests outside hotels used for housing asylum seekers. Clashes occurred in London and Newcastle, while a large march took place in Manchester, with groups like Britain First and Stand Up To Racism involved. The demonstrations highlight ongoing tensions regarding the UK's asylum policies. In response to the situation, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced plans to fast-track the asylum appeals process to reduce the overall number of people housed in hotels, a system the government aims to phase out by 2029.</p>

She describes their connection as a way of being with her late father, as the story was his primary legacy to her, and she seeks a deeper psychological understanding of the man who terrorized her family.</p>

          <p>Following a 1-1 draw against Motherwell in their opening league match, Rangers head coach Russell Martin harshly criticized his players' performance. He stated the team was "lucky to get a point" and accused some players of having mentality problems, letting their egos interfere, and reverting to self-preservation when things go wrong. Martin lambasted the team for being outfought and less aggressive than their opponents, suggesting this has been a recurring issue for the club. He warned that players who are not fully committed will be left behind, signaling a significant shift in tone just days after praising the team's effort in a Champions League qualifier.</p>

Despite the 4-0 loss, Snell's outing was seen as promising, as he effectively filled the strike zone and generated numerous swings and misses.

          <p>The cost of nursing home care in Germany has surged to an average of €3,248 per month, a sum that is crippling for many retirees whose average pension is around €1,100. This dramatic increase is driven by rising wages for care staff and an aging population, with nearly one in three residents now relying on welfare payments. Health Minister Nina Warken has called for urgent reform of the long-term care insurance system, which is on the verge of collapse.

          <p>Denzel Perryman, a linebacker for the Los Angeles Chargers, was arrested on Friday night on weapons violation charges and is being held without bail. The L.A. County Sheriff's Department stated that deputies found five firearms, including two assault-style rifles, inside his vehicle during a traffic stop. Perryman, a respected 32-year-old veteran and team captain, was reportedly cooperative during the arrest. The Chargers organization and Perryman's agent have both stated they are aware of the situation and are currently gathering more information about the incident.</p>

          <p>Cat Eccles, the Member of Parliament for Stourbridge, is being investigated by the parliamentary standards commissioner for failing to declare a sponsored trip within the required timeframe. The investigation concerns a trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories, valued at £2,600 and sponsored by Labour Friends of Israel, which took place in May. According to parliamentary rules, MPs must register such interests within 28 days. A spokesperson for the MP attributed the late filing, which occurred in July, to an administrative error and stated there was no attempt to conceal the trip.</p>

          <p>The Tea app, designed as a safe space for women to anonymously share information about men in their dating pool, has suffered a major data breach. Hackers leaked sensitive user data, including driver's licenses and direct messages, exposing subscribers to potential harassment and threatening their safety. The incident highlights the inherent risks of digital "whisper networks," which gained prominence in the Me Too era as a way to warn others about potential abusers. Experts note that while well-intentioned, these anonymous online platforms can lack the nuance of real-world communication and can sometimes fuel harmful online mob behavior.</p>

The halfway leader, Miyu Yamashita of Japan, saw her advantage shrink to just one stroke after a challenging round of 74. With South Korea's A Lim Kim in second place and several other players close behind, a fascinating and competitive conclusion is expected, especially with wind and rain forecast for Sunday's final round.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults are turning to TikTok as a primary source for news, consuming information through "newsfluencers," skits, and meme-style videos rather than traditional outlets. According to a Pew poll, 39% of adults under 30 regularly get news from the app, drawn to its convenience and simplified explanations. Creators like Aaron Parnas have amassed millions of followers by delivering rapid-fire updates on current events, catering to shorter attention spans. This trend raises questions about misinformation, as users often rely on crowdsourced comments for fact-checking in a fast-paced, algorithm-driven environment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has placed significant limits on the Trump administration's sweeping asylum ban at the U.S.-Mexico border. The D.C. Circuit panel ruled that while the administration can deny access to the asylum system, it cannot ignore U.S. laws that prohibit deporting migrants to places where they would likely face persecution or torture. This decision upholds protections known as "withholding of removal" and relief under the U.N. Convention Against Torture, which have a higher legal threshold than asylum but are mandatory. The ruling is a partial victory for advocacy groups challenging the president's border crackdown.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a ruling that restricts immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, agreeing that sweeps by the Trump administration appeared to have unconstitutionally targeted people based on race or for speaking Spanish. The Ninth Circuit panel affirmed a lower court's order requiring federal agents to have reasonable suspicion before detaining someone. The ruling stems from a lawsuit over "roving patrols" conducted by ICE and CBP agents that sparked widespread fear and protests. The decision is a significant victory for immigrant advocates who argued the raids violated the 4th Amendment.</p>

          <p>Seven-time Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton delivered a harsh self-assessment after a disappointing qualifying session for the Hungarian Grand Prix left him in 12th place. While his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc secured a surprise pole position, Hamilton struggled for pace and failed to advance to the final qualifying segment, bluntly stating, "I drove terribly" and calling himself "useless." This result continues a pattern of qualifying struggles for Hamilton in 2025. Despite his personal frustration, he congratulated Leclerc and the team on achieving pole, acknowledging the car's capability.</p>

          <p>Wall Street experienced a turbulent week, culminating in a four-day losing streak for the S&P 500 after it hit a record high on Monday. The downturn was fueled by a surprisingly weak July jobs report, which showed far fewer positions created than expected and significant downward revisions for prior months. This data intensified pressure on the Federal Reserve, which had just held interest rates steady, and prompted President Trump to publicly criticize both the Fed and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The week was also marked by new tariff announcements and a flurry of major corporate earnings reports. (not investment advice)</p>
