        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A total lunar eclipse, creating a "Blood Moon" effect, will be visible across much of the United Kingdom this evening. The phenomenon occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and Moon, casting a shadow that gives the Moon a reddish hue. While the full eclipse lasts for over an hour, visibility in the UK will be limited to the period after moonrise, with eastern regions getting the best view. This event offers a chance to observe celestial mechanics in real-time, with the next comparable eclipse in the UK not occurring until 2026.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has confirmed that Russia conducted its largest drone and missile attack of the war, targeting multiple regions and striking the cabinet building in Kyiv. The barrage involved over 820 munitions, killing at least two people and damaging the roof and upper floors of the key government building. Ukrainian officials, including Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, condemned the attack as a deliberate act of terror and urged the international community to provide more military assistance. The attack prompted NATO fighter jets in Poland to scramble as a precautionary measure.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, is set to be canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Acutis, known as "God's influencer," used his computer programming skills to create a website cataloging eucharistic miracles, harnessing modern technology for religious purposes. His rapid path to sainthood, supported by two Vatican-recognized miracles, has inspired a global following, with many devotees visiting his tomb in Assisi. The canonization reflects the Church's effort to connect with younger generations in the digital age.</p>

          <p>Anutin Charnvirakul has officially become Thailand's new prime minister following a royal endorsement from King Maha Vajiralongkorn. The conservative politician secured the position after the previous prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, was dismissed by a court order, ending the Shinawatra dynasty's recent hold on power. Anutin gained the necessary support from the opposition People's Party by agreeing to dissolve parliament and call for new elections within four months. Known for championing cannabis decriminalization, his term begins amid a significant shift in the country's political landscape.</p>

Now playing for the Pittsburgh Steelers, the 41-year-old will face his former team in a highly anticipated season opener. The article reflects on the immense hype and subsequent heartbreak of Rodgers' brief tenure with the Jets, a period that promised to end the franchise's long championship drought. The game represents a chance for closure for Rodgers, the Jets, and the fans after the unfulfilled expectations of their partnership.</p>

          <p>The US Open has evolved from a traditional tennis tournament into a major cultural event, prioritizing spectacle and consumption in a manner similar to festivals like Coachella. The article argues that the experience is now defined by high-priced concessions, celebrity appearances, and influencer marketing as much as by the on-court action. This "Coachella-fication" involves expanding the event's duration and footprint to maximize attention and revenue, turning attendance into a form of personal branding for many fans. While this shift may alienate purists, it has proven immensely popular, with record attendance suggesting the festival-like atmosphere is here to stay.</p>

          <p>London Underground staff have begun a five-day strike, causing significant disruption to the city's transport network. Members of the RMT union are taking rolling action to demand a pay increase and a reduction of the work week from 35 to 32 hours, citing fatigue management concerns. Transport for London (TfL) has offered a 3.4% pay rise but stated that a shorter work week is not affordable or practical. The strike is expected to result in little to no service on the Tube network until Friday morning, marking the first network-wide closure since March 2023.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected double bomber who was on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list, is facing an extradition hearing in London after being a fugitive for 21 years. He is the prime suspect in two 2003 bombings in California linked to an animal rights extremist group. After a high-speed chase in 2003, he vanished, with former FBI agents admitting there were "missed opportunities" to arrest him sooner. San Diego was discovered living under an alias in a cottage in north Wales last year, and the hearing will determine if he is sent back to the U.S. to face trial.</p>

ECB President Christine Lagarde is anticipated to maintain a cautious stance and will likely face questions about the market turmoil stemming from French politics. (not investment advice)</p>

The author contends that Trump's relationships are personal and fickle, not based on stable strategic interests, leading to broken promises and humiliation. The piece strongly criticizes UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's approach ahead of Trump's state visit, suggesting it positions Britain as a subservient state at a high reputational cost.

The technique, known as cavitation, involves using a laser to rapidly heat a light-absorbing material on a wet surface, causing water to boil and form bubbles. When these bubbles violently collapse, they release a powerful force capable of launching the small jumpers up to 1.5 meters into the air. This breakthrough could provide a new, efficient launching mechanism for micro-robotics and other small-scale applications.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers experienced a devastating 4-3 walk-off loss to the Baltimore Orioles after pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto was just one out away from a no-hitter. Yamamoto's historic bid was broken up by a solo home run with two outs in the ninth inning. Despite still holding a 3-1 lead, the Dodgers' bullpen completely imploded, with reliever Blake Treinen unable to record the final out, allowing two runners on before another reliever gave up the game-winning single. The shocking defeat marks a new low for the struggling Dodgers, wasting a spectacular performance.</p>
