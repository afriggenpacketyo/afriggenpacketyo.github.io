          <p>A shooting at Featherly Regional Park in Yorba Linda, California, resulted in three victims being hospitalized. The incident occurred after an altercation led to a man returning to the park and attempting to run over another individual with his car. The driver then shot two people before shooting himself. All three victims, including the suspect, were transported to the hospital, while the person hit by the car sustained minor injuries and did not require hospitalization, and officials confirmed that all parties involved knew each other.</p>

          <p>President Trump declared a 100% tariff on movies made outside the United States, citing the American film industry's decline and competition from other nations offering incentives to attract American filmmakers. He framed this as a national security threat, alleging messaging and propaganda concerns. Trump authorized government agencies to impose the tariff, aiming to bring movie production back to America. This move follows China's recent decision to reduce the number of US films it imports, intensifying trade tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun calling up tens of thousands of reservists to intensify its operations in Gaza, aiming to secure the release of hostages and defeat Hamas militants. Critics argue that the recent offensive has failed to free captives and question Prime Minister Netanyahu's objectives. The military plans to operate in new areas, destroying infrastructure above and below ground. This expansion raises concerns about the pressure on reservists and the families of hostages, with aid agencies reporting severe shortages of food, water, and medicine, accusing Israel of a policy of starvation.</p>

A report detailed the lab's alleged history of conducting deadly experiments on beagles, prompting investigations and condemnation.

The move follows other Trump administration initiatives to phase out animal testing, including actions by the FDA and EPA. The company that bred the beagles for research pleaded guilty to neglecting thousands of dogs at its breeding facility.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called for the reopening of the notorious Alcatraz prison to house America's most ruthless and violent offenders. Trump stated that the move would serve as a symbol of law, order, and justice, noting that the United States has been plagued by repeat criminal offenders. The reopening of the San Francisco prison, which closed in 1963 due to high costs, would involve substantial enlargement and rebuilding efforts, and a spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons said it would comply with all presidential orders.</p>

          <p>An exhibit honoring victims of gun violence has been removed from the headquarters of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Department of Justice has confirmed. The exhibit featured portraits of 120 people killed by gun violence and included a digital kiosk with biographies. A DOJ spokesperson stated that the ATF will continue to honor victims of violent crime while preserving the rights of law-abiding Americans. The removal of the exhibit has been criticized as a political move by the Trump administration to roll back firearms regulations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's policies and influence are shaping global politics, with recent elections in Canada and Australia showing a backlash against right-wing parties that borrowed from the MAGA playbook. In Canada, Prime Minister Mark Carney campaigned on an explicitly anti-Trump message, while Australia's leader, Anthony Albanese, also benefited from an anti-Trump sentiment. Trump's policies, including tariffs and strained alliances, have rippled into domestic political battles around the world, influencing voters' decisions and leading to a flight to stability in some countries.</p>

Aetna, however, is not a major player in the ACA marketplace compared with other health insurance plans, and CVS will still offer other options.

Vardit Ravitsky of the Hastings Center highlights the financial and medical risks, emphasizing that it's a gamble, not a guarantee, for future motherhood. She points to the emphasis on profits within the fertility industry, which may incentivize clinics to pressure women into undergoing more cycles. A better solution, Ravitsky argues, would be to create supportive workplace policies that enable women to have children at a younger age.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is a medical procedure in which a woman's eggs are harvested, frozen, and stored until she is ready to have children. The procedure does not ensure success, and is extremely expensive, especially for women who do not have insurance coverage from their employer. The average cost of a single cycle, from egg retrieval to freezing to storage, is around $12,000 to $13,000. Doctors sometimes recommend that a woman undergo multiple cycles of egg freezing to increase the number of eggs available for fertilization and implantation.</p>
