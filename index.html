          <p>A Federal Reserve report indicates that businesses are attempting to pass the costs of President Trump's tariffs onto consumers. Companies have received notices from suppliers about rising costs and are looking for ways to avoid absorbing the increases, although uncertainty remains about their ability to do so. The report characterizes economic growth as "little changed" but notes pervasive uncertainty surrounding international trade policy across the Fed's districts. Firms are adding tariff surcharges or shortening pricing horizons, with many expecting to pass additional costs to customers, though margin compression is reported in some sectors.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's call for automakers to move vehicle production to the U.S. is more complex than it appears, as automotive executives and experts point out that relocating production lines takes years of planning and construction. An additional 25% auto parts tariff scheduled to take effect would raise vehicle costs even if assembled in the U.S. The construction of new assembly plants, requiring significant land and infrastructure, can take several years and billions of dollars. The industry is lobbying against the upcoming tariffs on auto parts, advocating for the use of existing facilities as a faster way to increase U.S. production.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent surge in the stock market is attributed to a "short squeeze," where short sellers are forced to buy back borrowed stocks to limit losses. Increased bearish wagers by hedge funds, following market volatility triggered by President Trump's tariff rollout, created an environment prone to dramatic upswings. When securities suddenly rally, short sellers must rapidly cover their positions, driving prices even higher. Analysts suggest that the market's relief rally is due to many hedge funds being caught on the wrong side of their bets.</p>

          <p>The Jones Road Wildfire in Ocean County, New Jersey, has burned through 12,000 acres and is approximately 35% contained, thanks to the efforts of the New Jersey Forest Fire Service. Mandatory and voluntary evacuations for 5,000 residents were lifted, and major roads have reopened. While one business was destroyed, no homes were damaged, and no injuries were reported. Fire officials expect the acreage to grow as they work toward full containment, and a state of emergency remains in effect for Ocean County.</p>

The U.S. has long sought increased exports of agricultural products and cars, which have been sticking points in trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump accused Volodymyr Zelensky of harming peace negotiations with Russia through "inflammatory statements" regarding Crimea. This criticism followed Vice-President JD Vance's warning that the U.S. might withdraw from negotiations if an agreement isn't reached. Trump's remarks underscore tensions between the leaders and highlight differing approaches to resolving the conflict. The U.S. proposal reportedly involves recognizing Crimea as Russian territory, a stance Zelenskyy has rejected as unconstitutional.</p>
