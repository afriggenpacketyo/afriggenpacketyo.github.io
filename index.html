          <p>The Papal conclave has begun in the Vatican to elect a new Pope. The voting process involves each conclave member writing their choice on a paper ballot slip and depositing it into a special urn. Three scrutineers then count the votes, and the first candidate to secure two-thirds of the votes is elected as the next pope. The voting process is shrouded in secrecy, and conclave members are instructed to write their votes in handwriting that cannot be identified to ensure anonymity.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is facing challenges after failing to secure the necessary support in the Bundestag during the initial vote. Only 40% of respondents in a recent survey are optimistic about the coalition between conservatives and social democrats.

          <p>A 61-year-old woman was killed by an alligator while canoeing with her husband on Lake Kissimmee in Florida. The alligator thrashed and tipped over the canoe, causing both individuals to fall into the water. The husband tried unsuccessfully to rescue his wife after she was bitten. Nuisance alligator trappers recovered two alligators from the scene, one matching the description of the alligator involved in the incident. Serious injuries from alligators are rare, and the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission advises keeping a safe distance from alligators and avoiding swimming in designated areas at dusk and dawn.</p>

          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson has dropped aggressive options to cut Medicaid costs, bowing to pressure from Republicans and underscoring party divisions. The House budget plan calls for $880 billion in cuts from the committee that oversees the program, a target that would be difficult to achieve without substantial changes. Cutting federal payments for states that expanded Medicaid under Obamacare would save an estimated $710 billion over a decade, but would cause millions to lose coverage. The speaker suggested he was leaning against changing the way the federal government pays states to a flat fee per person.</p>

          <h2>Alphabet Shares Decline After Apple Executive Suggests AI Will Replace Search Engines</h2>

          <p>Alphabet and Apple shares experienced declines after Apple's services chief, Eddy Cue, suggested that AI search engines could eventually replace standard search engines like Google. Cue indicated that Apple expects to add artificial intelligence services from OpenAI, Perplexity, and Anthropic as search options in Apple's Safari browser in the future. Cue's comments cast doubt on the long-term stability of the relationship between Apple and Google, where Google pays the iPhone maker billions of dollars per year to be the default search engine on iPhones.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ordered the Trump administration to transfer Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University doctoral student, from Louisiana to Vermont to continue her immigration detention in that state. Öztürk has been detained at a federal facility in Louisiana after being arrested on the street in Sommerville, Massachusetts. The Department of Homeland Security later accused her of engaging "in activities in support of Hamas." Her attorneys say she's being held in violation of her free speech and due process rights and that the government has not shown any evidence she supports terrorism.</p>

          <p>Tensions are high between India and Pakistan following missile strikes by India on multiple locations in Pakistan and Pakistani-administered Kashmir. India stated that it targeted 'terrorist infrastructure' across the border in response to a deadly attack on tourists in Pahalgam town. Pakistan has vowed to retaliate, calling India's move an 'act of war,' leading to fears of escalation between the two nuclear-armed neighbors. India is holding security exercises to prepare security forces, first responders, and civilians for the eventuality of a Pakistani counterattack.</p>

Reports of planned deportations to Libya come as the Trump administration is expanding its efforts to negotiate the deportations of US migrants to third-party countries, including Angola, Benin, Eswatini, Moldova and Rwanda.</p>

          <p>India's military attack on Pakistan, named 'Operation Sindoor,' invokes a woman who became a symbol of grief after a terrorist attack. The name signals the government's intention to avenge widowed women, as sindoor is a traditional marker of marital status for Hindu women. While some feminists have criticized the use of the word sindoor, the name also signals to right-wing Hindu groups that the government is listening to their demands for vengeance.</p>

Union Aslef said it would open up opportunities for school or college leavers.
