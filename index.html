          <p>An emergency court hearing concluded without a decision on Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook's request to block President Trump from removing her from her position. Cook's lawyers argued the firing is unlawful, while the Justice Department claimed Trump has "sufficient reason" based on allegations of false statements on mortgage applications. The case raises significant questions about the independence of the U.S. central bank and could set a precedent for presidential authority over its governors.</p>

          <p>Amid a high-interest-rate environment, seniors have several methods to tap into their home equity without refinancing their existing low-rate mortgages. The article outlines three primary options: reverse mortgages, which are exclusive to homeowners 62 and older and do not require monthly repayments; home equity loans, which offer a lump sum at a fixed rate; and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which provide a flexible credit line. Each option presents distinct advantages and considerations for homeowners looking to leverage their property's value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of "buy now, pay later" company Affirm surged 12% after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The company posted earnings of 20 cents per share on $876 million in revenue, a 33% increase from the previous year, and offered optimistic guidance for the upcoming fiscal year. CEO Max Levchin highlighted continued consumer strength and strong growth in transaction volume, driven by key partnerships with Shopify and Amazon, which offset the recent loss of Walmart as a client.

This development marks a significant breakthrough in the long-running conflict between gig economy companies and organized labor over worker classification and rights in the state.</p>

          <p>This editorial uses President Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook as a moment to critique the concept of central bank independence. While condemning Trump's actions as authoritarian, the article argues that defending the Fed's independence as inherently democratic is a mistake, as the institution is often unaccountable to the public and influenced by business elites. The piece suggests that the real challenge is not just to protect the Fed from a demagogue, but to reimagine what a more democratic and accountable central bank would look like.</p>

          <p>This analysis argues that the deployment of the National Guard in Washington D.C., raids on political opponents, and the weaponization of government agencies are not isolated events but part of a steady march toward authoritarianism under President Trump. The author suggests that observers are often slow to recognize the severity of the situation because it is happening in the U.S. and because Trump's actions are so brazen. The piece draws parallels to autocratic regimes, concluding that the U.S. is in a state of "unconsolidated authoritarianism" that threatens its democratic foundations.</p>
