          <p>Cambodia continues to struggle with the deadly legacy of landmines, a consequence of decades of conflict stemming from the Vietnam War. Millions of mines and unexploded ordnance still contaminate the countryside, hindering development and causing casualties. Organizations like Cambodia Self Help DeMining are working to clear these dangerous areas, but the process is slow and perilous. Despite efforts to achieve a mine-free Cambodia by 2025, vast areas remain to be cleared, and new minefields are constantly being discovered, highlighting the ongoing threat to the population.

          <p>Santa Cruz implemented a "soda tax" despite a statewide ban, adding a 2-cents-per-ounce tax on sweetened beverages. Voters approved the tax, framing it as a battle against the American Beverage Association. The tax excludes certain beverages, such as those for medical use and 100% natural juices. Proponents argue it will combat the dangers of sugary drinks, while opponents claim it unfairly burdens working families. The American Beverage Association has launched a campaign against soda taxes, citing concerns about price increases affecting lower-income communities.
