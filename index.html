        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced his intention to label the anti-fascist movement antifa as a terrorist organization, a move legal experts say faces significant constitutional hurdles. The designation is complicated by antifa's decentralized nature, lacking a formal leadership or structure, and the president's limited authority to designate domestic groups. While the administration could prioritize antifa for law enforcement investigations, experts argue that prosecuting an ideology would infringe on First and Fourth Amendment rights, as U.S. law does not have a chargeable offense for domestic terrorism itself.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>False claims circulating on Chinese social media that Poland sent troops to Ukraine have been debunked. The misinformation appears to stem from a misinterpretation of Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's comments about Poland sending military representatives for drone defense training, which Poland's Ministry of Defense clarified would occur on Polish territory. The article traces how these inaccurate reports were amplified by Chinese content farms, which often use sensationalist headlines to create "informational chaos" that aligns with Chinese and Russian narratives portraying NATO as an aggressor.</p>

          <p>Commentator Don Lemon has weighed in on the controversial Olympic boxing match where Italian boxer Angela Carini withdrew after facing Algeria's Imane Khelif. Lemon suggested that a competitor entering the ring should expect to be hit hard, regardless of the opponent, questioning who was at fault for the outcome. The incident has fueled a significant debate over gender eligibility in sports, with Khelif having previously been disqualified from other competitions for failing eligibility tests, a situation that has prompted new policies from governing bodies like World Boxing.</p>

          <p>Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have signed a significant mutual defense pact, declaring that an act of aggression against one nation will be considered an attack on both. The agreement, signed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, aims to enhance defense cooperation and joint deterrence. Notably, Pakistan's defense minister stated that the country's nuclear capabilities would be made available to Saudi Arabia under the pact, a move seen as strengthening regional security ties, potentially as a hedge against Iran and a signal of diversifying alliances beyond the United States.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced a "high-powered demography mission" aimed at what his government calls the "conspiracy" of irregular migration, particularly from neighboring Bangladesh. The ruling BJP party has framed this migration as a national security threat, claiming it leads to demographic shifts and harms local communities. Critics argue the mission is a politically motivated effort to target and disenfranchise Muslim populations and other minority groups, creating a climate of fear and engineering the electorate under the guise of nationalistic policy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping held a call to finalize a deal aimed at preventing a U.S. ban on the social media platform TikTok. The call follows an agreement on a "framework" to address U.S. national security concerns over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. A federal law had mandated ByteDance to divest its American operations or face a shutdown, but President Trump, who has expressed his fondness for the app, has repeatedly extended the deadline. The successful negotiation aims to preserve TikTok's operations in the United States while satisfying regulatory requirements.</p>

He believes the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs will be a temporary, "one-time effect," leaving room for the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy further. Kashkari's more dovish stance is influenced by a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations, despite current inflation running above the Fed's 2% target.

          <p>Retail companies are increasingly using a "B2B2C" (business-to-business-to-consumer) model to reduce the impact of trade war tariffs on consumer prices. In this system, a third-party intermediary acts as the merchant of record, purchasing products from the retailer at a wholesale price and then handling the shipping and tariff payments. Because tariffs are paid on the lower wholesale price rather than the final retail price, the overall cost is significantly reduced. This strategy, sometimes called "tariff hacking," allows brands to maintain consistent pricing across markets and avoid passing on tariff-related increases to their customers.

          <p>Yevgeny Savin, a former Russian professional footballer turned popular YouTuber, has successfully rebuilt his football club in Cyprus after fleeing Russia for condemning the invasion of Ukraine. Originally founded in Russia, his club, Krasava, was re-established in Ypsonas and has now achieved promotion to Cyprus's top division. The club has become a unifying force for the Russian-speaking immigrant community, bringing together people from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus. Savin, who was sentenced in absentia in Russia for "discrediting" the army, continues to invest his own money and dreams of qualifying for European competitions.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, dozens of individuals across various sectors—including government, media, and academia—have faced termination or disciplinary action for social media posts deemed inappropriate. Following calls from members of the Trump administration to "call out" anyone appearing to celebrate the killing, pressure campaigns have led to numerous firings, from a Secret Service employee to airline pilots and university staff. Civil liberties advocates have warned that this wave of punitive actions risks chilling free speech and could infringe on First Amendment protections.</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 series went on sale worldwide, drawing crowds in major cities from Beijing to London. The global launch is a critical test for the company as it faces intensified competition in key markets like China from rivals such as Huawei and Xiaomi. While initial preorder data appears positive, Apple is also under pressure to deliver on its artificial intelligence promises after a previously underwhelming rollout. The new lineup, which includes the iPhone 17 Pro and a new thin iPhone Air, aims to reinvigorate sales and maintain customer loyalty in a challenging smartphone market.</p>

          <p>A group of 34 students from Gaza, who hold fully funded scholarships to British universities, have been successfully evacuated from the conflict zone. This marks the first time students have been officially assisted in leaving the Strip to pursue their studies in the UK since the conflict began. The evacuation, supported by the UK government, follows months of campaigning by advocates on behalf of over 100 Palestinian students with offers from UK institutions. While this is a positive development for the evacuated group, it remains uncertain when other eligible students will be able to leave.</p>

          <p>A drone strike attributed to Sudan's Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has killed dozens of people at a mosque in a displaced persons' camp in North Darfur. The attack on the Abu Shouk camp outside El-Fasher comes as the RSF continues its push against the Sudanese army in the region. This event highlights the escalating violence in Sudan's "forgotten war," with a recent UN report indicating a sharp increase in civilian deaths, ethnic violence, and war crimes in 2025. The conflict has created one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, with millions displaced and tens of thousands killed.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers are attempting to roll back several health protections related to toxic PFAS "forever chemical" pollution from U.S. military bases. Amendments included in the proposed National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) would delay a ban on PFAS-laden firefighting foam, cut cleanup funding, and lift a moratorium on incinerating the foam. The proposed changes would reverse progress made in recent years to address the widespread contamination of drinking water near hundreds of military installations. Critics argue the repeals prioritize military readiness over the health and safety of service members and their communities.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's political base, which was crucial to his 2024 election victory, may be showing signs of fraying less than a year into his second term. The author points to rising unemployment among young people and minority groups, along with underwater approval ratings among Latino and Black voters, as evidence of potential "buyers' remorse." While the Democratic party is portrayed as being in disarray, the article suggests that economic dissatisfaction could create an opening for them in the upcoming midterm elections if they can effectively capitalize on the incumbent's perceived failures.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Alibaba Group Holding is intensifying its rivalry with Meituan by entering the in-store dining voucher market. The new initiative, launching through Alibaba's instant commerce units, will offer consumers discounted meals at various restaurants, replicating a business model successfully established by Meituan and later adopted by ByteDance's Douyin. This strategic move expands the competition between the two conglomerates from online delivery and instant commerce into the physical, bricks-and-mortar dining sector. The program is set to roll out in several major cities ahead of China's "golden week" holiday.</p>
