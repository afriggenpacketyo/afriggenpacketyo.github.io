          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new tariffs on India, but New Delhi has not rushed to negotiate a deal, citing the need to protect its large agricultural sector from foreign competition. Experts suggest India's position is strengthened by its relatively limited goods exports to the U.S. and the political sensitivity of its farming bloc. The article notes that while the duties will have an impact, India is leveraging its strategic importance as a counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific and its role within BRICS. This geopolitical context provides India with flexibility and a stronger bargaining position in trade discussions with Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

Clinton and Cristen Brink were fatally attacked while hiking with their two young daughters, who were unharmed in the incident. Authorities, who had previously released a composite sketch of a person of interest, apprehended McGann and charged him with two counts of capital murder. Officials praised the multi-agency collaboration that led to the arrest, while the victims' family described them as heroes who died protecting their children.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has announced a trade deal with South Korea, establishing a 15% tariff on most imports, a reduction from the threatened 25%. As part of the agreement, South Korea will facilitate a $350 billion investment fund for its companies entering the U.S. market and purchase $100 billion in American energy products. However, there appear to be differing interpretations between Washington and Seoul regarding the control and distribution of profits from the investment fund. The deal successfully protected South Korea's sensitive agricultural sectors but did not secure concessions on steel or semiconductor tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

Her lawyer argued that testifying without such protections would compromise her constitutional rights and pending legal appeals, and she would otherwise invoke her Fifth Amendment rights.

          <p>Samsung Electronics reported a significant drop in its second-quarter operating profit, falling short of market expectations due to a staggering 93.8% decline in its chip division's profit. The tech giant's Device Solutions division was heavily impacted by inventory value adjustments and the effects of export restrictions related to China. Despite the poor results, the company expressed cautious optimism for a gradual recovery in the second half of the year, driven by increasing demand in AI and robotics. Samsung's mobile division, however, saw an increase in sales and profit, buoyed by its Galaxy smartphone series. (not investment advice)</p>

NATS apologized for the disruption, stating it resolved the problem within 20 minutes by switching to a backup system. However, airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet expressed frustration, with one executive calling for the NATS CEO to resign, citing a similar major outage in 2023. The incident has renewed calls for greater resilience in the UK's critical travel infrastructure to prevent future passenger chaos.</p>

          <p>Shares of Arm Holdings fell after the company reported underwhelming royalty revenue from the smartphone sector and announced it is considering a strategic shift into designing its own chips. While its first-quarter earnings per share met expectations, revenue slightly missed forecasts, and the company's guidance was merely in line with projections. The potential move to produce its own chiplets or full semiconductors could create competition with its current major customers, such as Apple and Qualcomm. This strategic pivot introduces new execution risks but is framed by the CEO as a response to customer demand for more complete solutions. (not investment advice)</p>

The Trump administration boycotted a French-Saudi-led conference on the matter, labeling it an anti-Israel "publicity stunt" and reaffirming its support for Israel.

The average U.S. tariff rate has soared to its highest level since 1934, tripling monthly government revenue from import taxes. However, the policy has not achieved its stated goal of reducing the trade deficit; instead, the deficit has widened, partly due to companies stockpiling imports to avoid the taxes. While U.S. imports from China have decreased, Chinese exports to other nations have grown, suggesting a shift in global trade flows rather than a reduction in Chinese production.

          <p>Meta Platforms delivered a blowout second quarter, with revenue and earnings per share far exceeding analyst expectations. The social media giant's revenue climbed 22% year-over-year, driven by strong user engagement and a 9% increase in the average price per ad. The company's guidance for the third quarter also surpassed forecasts, and while it raised its outlook for full-year expenses to fund AI initiatives, the increase was within a range investors found acceptable. The article notes that these impressive results and the successful integration of AI into its platforms demonstrate the company's continued dominance and growth potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Three-time NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas has been arrested and charged with operating an illegal gambling business out of his Los Angeles-area home. Federal prosecutors allege that Arenas and five co-defendants, including a suspected organized crime figure, ran high-stakes poker games where they collected a fee from the pot. The operation allegedly involved hiring women to provide companionship to players, as well as chefs and armed security. Arenas, who pleaded not guilty and was released on a $50,000 bond, faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted on all charges.</p>

          <p>Following the major earthquake off Russia's coast, this article explains the science behind tsunamis. Generated primarily by strong, shallow, underwater earthquakes that cause vertical shifts in the seafloor, tsunamis can travel across deep oceans at speeds comparable to a jet airplane. As they approach shallower coastal waters, their speed decreases but their wave height and power increase dramatically, making them incredibly destructive. While forecasting remains challenging, scientists use tide gauges and deep-ocean pressure sensors to predict their arrival and potential impact, emphasizing the importance of heeding evacuation warnings immediately.</p>

          <p>A scientific expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered surprisingly abundant and thriving communities of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. Researchers captured images of vast fields of tube worms, beds of clams, and bacterial mats, challenging previous assumptions about the scarcity of life in such extreme, high-pressure environments. These ecosystems are fueled not by sunlight but by chemicals like methane and hydrogen sulfide seeping from the ocean floor. The findings suggest these chemosynthetic communities are more widespread than previously thought, opening new avenues for studying adaptation to extreme conditions.</p>

          <p>A Colorado dentist, James Craig, has been convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole for killing his wife, Angela Craig. Prosecutors successfully argued that Craig poisoned his wife's protein shakes with arsenic over several days before administering a fatal dose of cyanide while she was in the hospital. The investigation began after Craig's dental partner reported he had ordered potassium cyanide for non-work-related purposes. The motive was reportedly to escape his marriage and pursue extramarital affairs without a costly divorce, driven by what prosecutors called "greed and cowardice."</p>

          <p>The long-held belief that screen time is inherently harmful to children's brains is being challenged by a group of scientists who argue that concrete evidence is lacking. This article explores the complex debate, noting that much of the research relies on flawed self-reporting and often fails to distinguish between different types of screen use. While some experts, like psychologist Jean Twenge, maintain a strong correlation between rising smartphone use and teen depression, others, like Professor Pete Etchells, argue that the data does not support claims of consistent, negative changes to the brain. The lack of consensus leaves parents without clear guidance.</p>

The scans revealed crisp, sophisticated designs of mythical creatures and animals that were previously difficult to see, showcasing the advanced artistry of this ancient nomadic people. The woman, who was about 50 years old, had decorations of leopards, a stag, and a griffin, which were likely stenciled and applied with a multi-pointed tool.

          <p>Entering his ninth NFL season, 30-year-old cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon has become a veteran leader, or "Yoda," in the Los Angeles Rams' young secondary. After playing for the 49ers and Steelers, Witherspoon joined the Rams last season and proved to be a key starter, earning a new one-year contract. The team's decision not to add new cornerbacks or safeties in the offseason is seen as a vote of confidence in the current group's potential. Witherspoon is embracing his role as a mentor, focusing on communication and aggression to help elevate a defense that he believes has special potential.</p>

The airline claims the group was removed for disruptive behavior and mishandling safety equipment, an account disputed by the group and other passengers.
