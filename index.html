          <p>A federal grand jury in California indicted Thomas Eugene Streavel for allegedly making threats against then-President-elect Donald Trump on Facebook. The indictment includes posts where Streavel expressed a desire to "blow his brains out" and stated his willingness to "put a bullet right between the ears" of Trump. Streavel has pleaded not guilty to the charges and faces a maximum of five years in prison for each count if convicted. The U.S. Attorney emphasized the seriousness of such threats, noting their similarity to rhetoric preceding past attempts on the President's life. Optimism surrounding the situation is low, given the severity of the alleged threats and the potential consequences. </p>

The memo suggests the renaming aligns with the Trump administration's priorities of "reestablishing the warrior culture."

He argues that Trump's tariffs and approach to global relations lead investors to short stocks, anticipating market declines. Cramer notes that this strategy doesn't always succeed, as businesses can still perform well despite the White House's actions. He believes that Trump has inadvertently revived the short selling business, but that short sellers can face significant losses when businesses thrive (not investment advice).</p>
