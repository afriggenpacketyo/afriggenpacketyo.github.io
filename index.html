          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 02:35:00 EDT</div>

          <p>For the first time since 1923, Paris has officially reopened sections of the Seine River for public swimming, a legacy of the Paris 2024 Olympics. The move follows a massive €1.4 billion cleanup effort, which included building a large underground reservoir to prevent sewage overflow into the famous waterway. Three supervised swimming zones have been established with lifeguards, changing rooms, and showers, offering a free recreational space for residents and tourists. Authorities will continuously monitor water quality to ensure safety, marking a major milestone in the city's efforts to enhance urban quality of life.</p>

          <p>Former Wolves captain Conor Coady paid a heartfelt tribute to Liverpool forward Diogo Jota, who died in a car crash at age 28, calling him a fantastic human being and friend. Coady described Jota as the "heart and soul of the dressing room" and a dream to work with during their time together at Wolverhampton. He recalled Jota's tenacity, quiet leadership, and bravery in joining the club when it was in the Championship league. Coady emphasized that beyond being a remarkable footballer, Jota was an even better person, friend, and family man whose loss is deeply felt.</p>

          <p>An investigation by BBC Wales has uncovered allegations of a "binge drinking culture" and serious safeguarding failures at Bangor Cathedral. Former choristers and staff described events like a "seven last shots of Christ" drinking game on Good Friday and pressure to consume alcohol. The report follows the immediate retirement of the Archbishop of Wales, Andrew John, after critical reviews highlighted these issues and a culture where "sexual boundaries seemed blurred." One woman reported being assaulted by a person training to be a priest at a cathedral event, prompting calls for significant changes in leadership and governance.</p>

          <p>A major search operation is underway in Texas after flash floods killed at least 24 people, with a focus on a Christian summer camp where many girls are still missing. The Guadalupe River surged unexpectedly, sweeping away cabins and vehicles during the July 4th holiday weekend, an event President Trump called "shocking." Officials noted the area lacks a dedicated flood warning system, which left campers with little time to react to the rapidly rising waters. Rescue crews are tirelessly searching for up to 25 children, while the camp itself struggles with no power or water and washed-out roads.</p>

          <p>The 90-day pause on President Trump's sweeping "liberation day" tariffs is nearing its end, creating significant uncertainty for global markets and US businesses that could face steep new import duties. The administration has not secured the dozens of trade agreements it had promised would materialize during the pause, raising the possibility of rates as high as 47% on some countries. Business leaders and economists, including the Federal Reserve chair, express deep concern over the potential for increased inflation and billions in additional costs for American companies. The article notes that even without the new duties, existing tariffs are already leaving a hefty bill for businesses and consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

Before the walkout, fans displayed a large banner reading "Fight Ignorance, Not Immigrants" and organized fundraisers for pro-immigrant organizations.

          <p>Scientists in China have made a significant breakthrough in regenerative medicine by successfully restoring damaged ear tissue in mice. The researchers discovered they could reactivate a dormant "evolutionarily disabled genetic switch" to stimulate the production of retinoic acid, a key compound in tissue development. This led to the complete regeneration of lost cartilage and other tissues in the mice's ears. The study, published in the journal Science, offers hope that this mechanism for regeneration might exist in other organs and could one day be applied to humans.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that the intense media and political focus on the band Bob Vylan's "Death to the IDF" chant at Glastonbury serves as a diversion from the ongoing crisis in Gaza. The author critiques the characterization of the chant as inherently antisemitic, suggesting it misrepresents a specific critique of the Israeli military as a broader attack on Jewish people. The piece contrasts the widespread front-page coverage of the band with the lack of similar attention given to the high civilian death toll in Gaza. It concludes that this framing of the discourse alienates those who see a disconnect between the official narrative and observable reality.</p>

The Kuomintang (KMT) government retreated to Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War, continuing to use the ROC title. However, Lai's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) continues to emphasize Taiwan's distinct identity, creating tension over how to interpret the shared, pre-1949 history.</p>

          <p>Several beaches in Queens, New York, were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple sharks were spotted swimming very close to the shore. The sightings, which occurred near Far Rockaway, were monitored by the city's drone unit to ensure public safety, and the beach was reopened after about an hour. Officials confirmed the closures were brief and that they would continue to monitor the waters. The incident comes as New York state authorities have been increasing shark surveillance capabilities along Long Island beaches to protect swimmers during the busy summer holiday season.</p>

          <p>As the United States targets China's dominant shipbuilding industry, competitors South Korea and Japan are positioning themselves to step up and capture more market share. South Korea's new president, Lee Jae-myung, has declared the industry to be in a "major crisis" and pledged government support to restore its status as a global leader. The new administration's policy guide focuses on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through improved technology and personnel training. The move signals a potential shift in the global shipbuilding landscape driven by geopolitical and economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has denied a last-minute request to halt the deportation of eight immigrants, clearing the path for their removal to South Sudan. The men, who have all been convicted of serious crimes, were scheduled to be flown out despite arguments from their lawyers that they could face perilous conditions in the war-torn country. This decision marks the latest development in a legal battle over the Trump administration's policy of deporting individuals to countries where their safety is at risk. The case had been considered by multiple courts, including on an emergency basis during the Independence Day holiday.</p>

          <p>A protest in Mexico City against the impacts of mass tourism and gentrification turned violent, with some demonstrators smashing storefronts and harassing tourists. The march, which began peacefully in neighborhoods like Condesa and Roma, was organized by locals who are being priced out of their homes due to soaring rents driven by an influx of "digital nomads" and tourists. Protesters carried signs reading "get out of Mexico" and demanded stricter housing regulations. The unrest highlights growing tensions in the capital over the economic and social consequences of its increasing popularity with foreigners.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed his administration's major tax and spending legislation into law during a Fourth of July event at the White House. The bill introduces significant tax cuts, increases defense spending, and provides more aggressive funding for immigration enforcement. The president promoted the legislation as a catalyst for economic growth that will benefit the country. However, Democrats have strongly criticized the bill, warning that it will primarily benefit the wealthy while negatively impacting lower-income individuals and families, describing its passage as a "dark day" for the nation.</p>

          <h2>Critics Decry Predatory Connecticut Law Allowing Towed Cars to Be Sold in 15 Days</h2>

          <p>A controversial law in Connecticut is drawing criticism for allowing towing companies to sell impounded vehicles just 15 days after they are towed. Opponents, including residents who have lost their cars, label the practice as predatory and claim that tow operators are specifically targeting working-class and low-income neighborhoods. One company was reportedly responsible for towing 1,000 cars from a single apartment complex in two years. The company's owner defended the practice as enforcing parking rules, but residents argue it exploits people who cannot quickly afford the high fees to retrieve their property.</p>
