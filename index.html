          <p>Amazon has agreed to a landmark $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission to resolve allegations that it misled customers into signing up for its Prime membership and intentionally complicated the cancellation process. The agreement includes a $1 billion civil penalty, the largest in FTC history, and allocates $1.5 billion for customer refunds. As part of the settlement, Amazon must also revise its enrollment and cancellation procedures to be more transparent and straightforward for consumers. This concludes a two-year case brought by the agency against the e-commerce giant's subscription practices.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors in Virginia concluded a two-month investigation into former FBI Director James Comey, determining there was insufficient evidence to press criminal charges for allegedly lying to Congress. Despite this recommendation, which was detailed in a declination memo, the newly appointed U.S. attorney, Lindsey Halligan, reportedly plans to seek an indictment from a grand jury. This move is seen as part of a broader push by the Trump administration to prosecute political adversaries, raising ethical concerns among career prosecutors.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC's Executive Complaints Unit has partially upheld complaints against the broadcast of punk duo Bob Vylan's Glastonbury performance, ruling it breached guidelines on harm and offence. The decision cited the band's chants of "death to the IDF" and other derogatory comments as unduly offensive and intimidating. However, the unit cleared the performance of breaching rules on impartiality or inciting crime, noting that slogans like "Free Palestine" can be seen as political expression and that the chant targeted an institution, not individuals.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has suspended certain cloud-based storage and artificial intelligence services to the Israeli Ministry of Defense's Unit 8200. The decision followed an investigation prompted by a Guardian report alleging the unit had developed a system for tracking Palestinians' phone calls. In a message to employees, Microsoft's president stated that the company's review found evidence supporting the report's claims. This action comes amid pressure from some Microsoft employees protesting the use of the company's technology in the Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>This opinion article contends that unlike centralized groups of the past, modern left-wing extremism, particularly Antifa, poses a diffuse and widespread threat due to online radicalization. It cites recent violent acts as evidence and calls for bipartisan recognition of the issue. The author suggests this decentralized nature, where individuals can be radicalized anywhere online, makes the threat more insidious and harder for law enforcement to combat compared to previous eras of political violence.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to approve a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. under a new structure involving American company Oracle. The agreement aims to address national security concerns by having Oracle host U.S. user data and review the app's code. The deal creates a new U.S.-based joint venture to comply with a law requiring divestment from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, though some lawmakers remain concerned about the algorithm's potential for foreign influence.</p>

          <p>In an unusual move, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has summoned numerous high-ranking generals and admirals from around the world for an urgent in-person meeting at Quantico, Virginia. While the Pentagon confirmed the meeting is scheduled for early next week, no details about its purpose have been provided. The large scale of the gathering and its short notice are considered rare, if not unprecedented, for the Department of Defense, sparking speculation about its significance.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, is receiving criticism from many Labour MPs after suggesting he could challenge Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for the party leadership. While Burnham claims some MPs have urged him to stand, a majority contacted by the BBC expressed opposition, arguing a leadership challenge would be self-indulgent and damaging so soon after an election. Critics within the party are urging him to focus on his mayoral duties rather than speculating on national leadership.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Wall Street Journal describes the Trump administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files as chaotic and marked by a series of public relations errors. The article alleges that President Trump was worried some of his friends might be named in the files and that he underestimated the public's intense interest in the case. The report details internal tensions, high-stakes meetings in the Situation Room, and the president's desire to distance himself from the ongoing scandal.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has started a gradual restart of its operations after a cyberattack in August forced a complete shutdown of its IT networks and production lines. The company is now able to process payments to suppliers and handle vehicle sales, though its manufacturing plants remain closed until at least next month. The prolonged shutdown has raised concerns about the viability of smaller firms in JLR's supply chain, prompting the government to consider offering support.</p>

The object's large size and unusual path, which brings it close to Mars, continue to fuel scientific curiosity and debate about its origin.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy demonstrated robust growth in the second quarter, with the final revision showing Gross Domestic Product expanding at a 3.8% annualized rate, higher than previous estimates.

The stronger-than-expected data suggests the economy remains on solid footing, which could influence future Federal Reserve decisions. (not investment advice)</p>
