          <p>Michigan Congresswoman Hillary Scholten revealed she was on a suspected killer's target list, along with 45 others, after state police informed her. The suspect is accused of fatally shooting a Minnesota state representative and her husband. Scholten emphasized her commitment to not be intimidated or silenced, characterizing such threats as domestic terrorism. She also criticized Utah Senator Mike Lee for his social media posts about the suspect, calling them offensive and urging bipartisan condemnation of political violence. The lawmaker has faced threats before and is determined to continue serving her constituents despite safety concerns, postponing a town hall meeting while maintaining troopers outside her home around the clock. Optimism remains as Scholten continues to push back against violence.</p>

          <p>Meta is "concerned" that WhatsApp may be blocked in Iran after Iranian state television urged citizens to delete the app, accusing it of being used by Israel to identify and target individuals. Meta denies these claims, stating that WhatsApp messages are end-to-end encrypted and that they do not track precise locations or provide bulk information to governments. This warning comes as the Israel-Iran conflict escalates and Iran appears to be restricting internet access, with a significant reduction in internet usage reported. Meta's platforms have previously been targeted by the Iranian government during times of unrest, and the company emphasizes its commitment to transparency and user privacy despite past hacking incidents. Meta aims to provide reliable services to its users amidst the conflict.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports fell by 1.7% year-on-year in May, marking the sharpest decline in eight months, as the country grapples with ongoing trade uncertainties. The decline, although less severe than economists' forecasts, reverses the gains seen in April, with exports to the U.S. and China both experiencing significant drops. This data follows the Bank of Japan's recent statement indicating a likely moderation in the country's growth due to trade-related factors, potentially impacting domestic corporate profits. Meanwhile, trade negotiations between Japan and the U.S. continue, with Japan potentially facing higher tariffs if a deal is not reached soon. Falling exports have contributed to Japan's recent economic contraction, highlighting the challenges the country faces in the global trade landscape (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed a recent pause on immigration arrests at farms, hotels, and restaurants, allowing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to resume worksite enforcement operations. This decision comes shortly after concerns were raised that the administration's crackdown on illegal immigration was affecting foreign-born workers in these industries. The Department of Homeland Security emphasized that worksite enforcement remains crucial for safeguarding public safety, national security, and economic stability, targeting illegal employment networks that undermine American workers. ICE arrests have increased in recent weeks, though they remain below the levels pushed by the White House, according to the agency.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing a policy that required Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals to choose the gender they identify with when renewing or applying for a passport. The executive order, issued by Mr. Trump, reversed a previous policy under the Biden administration that allowed for self-selection and included an "X" for those who do not identify as either male or female. The ACLU sued the Trump administration over the policy, claiming it was discriminatory, and the judge reaffirmed that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their case.</p>

Former officials and law enforcement analysts worry that these cuts will drain the Justice Department of experienced agents and leaders.

          <p>England forward Alessia Russo and her Lionesses teammates are preparing for their European Championship defense in Switzerland next month, where they will be facing the challenges of social media abuse. Russo says she prefers to stay off social media during major tournaments because of how "damaging" abuse can be. Manchester United midfielder Grace Clinton says she will try and stay away from social media to avoid a "toxic environment" while Chelsea forward Lauren James said "the abuse never really stops". Both Russo and Toone want to help younger players in the squad deal with it.</p>

The bomb, which has never been used in combat, is specifically designed for targets built underground and protected by thick concrete. While no other military has access to this weapon, the stealth capabilities of the B-2 bomber are not a factor due to Israel's destruction of Iran's air defense systems.</p>

          <p>New Yorkers participating in the Democratic mayoral primary will use ranked-choice voting, allowing them to rank their top five candidates. If a candidate receives over 50% of first-choice votes, they win outright; otherwise, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and the process continues until two candidates remain. This system has led to unique alliances, with some candidates cross-endorsing each other to prevent a specific candidate from winning. The full results will be reported a week after the primary, due to the complexity of tabulating ranked-choice ballots.</p>
