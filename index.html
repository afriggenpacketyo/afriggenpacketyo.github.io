          <p>Joseph Neumayer, a 28-year-old with U.S. and German citizenship, was arrested at JFK Airport after being deported from Israel for allegedly attempting to firebomb the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv. Prosecutors stated that Neumayer spat at an embassy guard and left a backpack containing three Molotov cocktails outside the embassy. Social media posts attributed to Neumayer contained threats against President Trump and anti-American sentiments. Neumayer faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of attempting to destroy the U.S. Embassy by means of fire or explosives. The authorities have emphasized that such violence will not be tolerated.</p>

          <p>Kate Shaw, a law professor, argues that the Supreme Court is increasingly granting President Trump more power, citing a recent case involving the National Labor Relations and Merit Systems Protection Boards. The court's decision effectively allowed the president to neutralize independent expertise within the executive branch. Shaw contends that the ruling overrules a nearly century-old precedent without full briefing or argument, risking the assimilation of a "move fast and break things" ethos into constitutional law. She expresses concern that this decision emboldens the administration to act outside traditional constitutional order, especially given other high-stakes legal questions pending before the courts.</p>

          <p>A longtime West Point professor, Graham Parsons, resigned in protest of the Trump administration's changes to the academy, objecting to the President's use of his signature red Make America Great Again hat. Parsons, who taught philosophy and military ethics, said that West Point began eliminating courses and censoring arguments to align with the administration's ideology. He criticized the executive order ending Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs in the armed forces, stating that these orders are to indoctrinate, not educate. Parsons felt professionally betrayed and unable to pursue important questions, calling it a dangerous removal of the boundary between politics and education.</p>

He argues that the Senate should halt the process until President Trump commits to spending reduction and reducing the deficit. Johnson's remarks highlight potential challenges for the bill, which narrowly passed the House and faces opposition from fiscal hawks in the Senate. The House Speaker urged his Senate colleagues not to significantly alter the bill, but some senators have signaled they won't support the package in its current form.</p>

Roger Floyd and Thomas McLaurin envision a pedestrian plaza with a memorial, shops, and a library. However, the city council is divided on the future of the square, with some members and business owners preferring a flexible open street plan to revive local businesses.

Johnson defended the bill against criticism from Senate Republicans and economists, arguing it will stimulate economic growth by reducing taxes and regulations.

          <p>Despite pledging to halt funding for fossil fuel projects at the G7 summit in 2022, Japan remains a major public financier of gas and oil production. From 2013 to 2024, Japanese public financial institutions invested $93 billion in oil and gas projects, with $56 billion allocated to overseas liquefied natural gas (LNG) development. Simultaneously, Japan leads the Asia Zero Emission Community (AZEC), promoting cooperation on net-zero emissions in Asia. Critics argue that Japan's reliance on LNG as a "transitional fuel" and the loopholes in its G7 pledge constitute greenwashing, as LNG emits significantly more greenhouse gases than coal when processing and shipping are considered.</p>

          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, a new parenting framework called "emotionally safe parenting" has emerged, prioritizing emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. This approach focuses on creating a safe environment where children feel comfortable expressing big emotions, asking questions, and being their authentic selves. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions without judgment, respond without shaming, and view misbehavior as a signal for support. The framework encourages parents to do their own internal work to become less reactive and to reconnect with their children after conflicts, fostering resilience, trust, and connection.</p>

          <p>Daniella Pierson, who built a $40 million business from her newsletter The Newsette, is launching CHASM to assist women in securing venture capital funding. Pierson faced numerous rejections from VCs early in her career and wants to help other women overcome similar barriers. The amount of funding received by all-women teams remains low, accounting for only a small percentage of total VC funding. Pierson's goal is to level the playing field and provide opportunities for women entrepreneurs who are often overlooked by traditional investors.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul won his first-round match at the French Open, but also shared the story of his truck being repossessed after he missed payments due to changing banks. He explained that he missed three payments and his truck was taken in the middle of the night. Paul found out about the repossession when his trainer asked him to check his security camera footage for packages, only to find his truck missing. He later regained the truck, describing the experience as funny and posting footage of the repossession on social media.</p>

          <p>Top Republicans in the Senate are threatening to block President Trump's spending bill unless there are serious efforts to reduce the national debt. Senator Ron Johnson warned that his faction has enough votes to halt the bill until the president addresses spending and deficit concerns. The bill extends the 2017 tax cuts in exchange for benefit cuts, including reductions in Medicaid and food stamps. Concerns have been raised about the number of Americans who would lose access to health coverage as a result of the legislation’s cuts to Medicaid. (not investment advice)</p>

This attack underscores the failure of diplomatic efforts to broker a cease-fire, as President Putin continues to add conditions he knows Ukraine will not accept. The Ukrainian air force reported that Russia had launched 69 ballistic and cruise missiles along with 298 attack drones. Ukrainian civilian deaths have risen each month since February, according to the United Nations, reaching 209 in April.</p>

The EU is one of Washington’s largest trading partners, sending more than $600bn in goods last year and buying $370bn worth. The Irish premier warned that tariffs of that height or scale would be extremely disruptive and would create even wider disruption across the global economy.</p>

While Israel has publicly cited concerns about the Druse minority and preventing weapons from falling into hostile hands, their primary goal was to hinder the new government's access to weaponry and influence. However, Trump's unexpected support for al-Shara has undermined Israel's efforts to prevent the rise of another anti-Israel neighbor.</p>
