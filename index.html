            <p>Jose Hermosillo, a 19-year-old US citizen, was wrongfully arrested and detained by border patrol agents in Arizona for nearly 10 days, despite claiming his citizenship. Border patrol officials initially claimed Hermosillo admitted to entering the US illegally from Mexico, a claim he refuted, and his family provided his birth certificate and social security card to authorities. The incident highlights concerns about escalating attacks on immigrants and wrongful detentions under the Trump administration, echoing similar cases and raising questions about due process and constitutional rights.

            <p>The Texas House passed a controversial school choice bill that would provide eligible families with public funds, up to $10,000 per student, to help pay for private school tuition. The bill, which passed after nearly 11 hours of debate, marks a significant step towards taxpayer-funded education savings accounts in Texas. While Republican leaders hailed it as a victory for parental choice, Democrats criticized it as "welfare for the rich" and expressed concerns about the potential impact on public school funding. The bill now heads to the Texas Senate for further consideration.</p>

            <p>Former Tennessee quarterback Nico Iamaleava has committed to UCLA after a falling out with Tennessee, citing name, image, and likeness concerns, marking a high-profile transfer in college football. Iamaleava's departure from Tennessee reportedly stemmed from a desire for more NIL money, though some sources suggest it was about bolstering the offensive line. His move to UCLA raises questions about the future of Joey Aguilar, the Bruins' presumed starting quarterback, and signals a potential smoothing over of past hard feelings between the Iamaleava family and the team. Iamaleava will have three seasons of eligibility remaining.</p>

            <p>Senator Amy Klobuchar has called on the Supreme Court to hold Trump administration officials in contempt for allegedly ignoring a court order to facilitate the return of Kilmar Ábrego García, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador.

The call comes after Justice Alito dissented from the Court's decision to block deportations of Venezuelans, criticizing the majority's decision as hasty and lacking sufficient explanation, further highlighting divisions within the court.</p>

            <p>Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee warns that President Trump's tariffs could cause a summer drop-off in economic activity after an "artificially high" start due to preemptive purchasing. Businesses are stocking up on inventory and consumers are accelerating purchases in anticipation of the tariffs, potentially inflating economic activity in April and leading to a slowdown in the coming months. Goolsbee expressed optimism about the longer-term economic outlook, but cautioned about the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs and their impact on inflation and employment.
