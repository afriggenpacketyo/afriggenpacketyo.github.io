          <p>Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv, praising former President Donald Trump for his role in brokering a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas. US envoy Steve Witkoff affirmed that hostages would return, while Palestinian officials reported a significant return of displaced persons to northern Gaza. An upcoming summit in Egypt, attended by multiple world leaders including Trump, aims to finalize the war-ending agreement. The rally highlighted both anticipation for the hostages' return and anger towards Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu.</p>

          <p>Kenya has converted $5 billion of Chinese railway loans from US dollars to Chinese yuan, a move projected to save the nation $215 million annually in debt servicing costs. Analysts suggest this decision could pave the way for other African countries facing debt stress to similarly shift their financial allegiances, strengthening ties with China. While specific terms of the new yuan loan were not fully disclosed, it is expected to significantly reduce interest rates. This financial maneuver represents a notable development in global economic diplomacy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Andrew faces renewed scrutiny following reports of an email suggesting continued contact with Jeffrey Epstein, contradicting his previous statements. This development has intensified calls for the Royal Family to take further action against him. The article details the King's limited power, including potential exclusion from royal events and the complex process of stripping titles or removing him from Royal Lodge. Despite past sanctions, Andrew's financial independence and the legal complexities make further formal actions challenging for the monarchy.</p>

          <p>Women who have experienced baby loss are actively challenging Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, over the continuous display of targeted pregnancy-related advertisements that cause severe emotional distress. Despite personal tragedies like miscarriages or stillbirths, Meta's algorithms persist in showing upsetting content. One woman successfully sued to halt direct marketing using her personal data, but this solution is not broadly available. Critics also question Meta's new "consent or pay" model and the effectiveness of current ad preference settings.</p>
