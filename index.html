          <p>Princeton, Texas, has been identified as the fastest-growing city in the U.S., with its population surging from 17,000 to 37,000 in just a few years. The rapid expansion is driven by affordable housing compared to the nearby Dallas area, attracting many first-time homeowners. However, this explosive growth has created significant challenges, forcing the city to pause construction to upgrade essential infrastructure like sewer lines, water systems, and roads. City officials acknowledge they are about five years behind in development and are now racing to manage the growth, with the population projected to reach 100,000 within five years.</p>

          <p>An Ontario judge has acquitted five former members of Canada's world junior hockey team of sexually assaulting a woman in a 2018 hotel room incident. The judge, Maria Carroccia, stated she did not find the complainant's testimony to be "credible or reliable," leading to the not-guilty verdict. The case centered on the issue of consent, with the players' defense arguing they believed the encounter was consensual, while the prosecution maintained the woman was intoxicated and fearful. The verdict has drawn significant public attention and disappointment from the complainant's side, while the players' lawyers highlighted the damage to their clients' reputations.</p>

          <p>Actress Winona Ryder recently shared some personal stories about her admiration for fellow actors earlier in her career. She revealed that she was so captivated by Christopher Walken that she kept the wishbone from a rotisserie chicken he once gave her, with plans to turn it into a necklace. Ryder also recalled being "actively in love" with Al Pacino during her early twenties while working with him, even directly confessing her feelings to him. Now happily with her partner Scott Mackinlay Hahn, the article portrays these past infatuations as charming and humorous memories from her life in Hollywood.</p>

          <p>During a joint tour of the Federal Reserve's renovation project, President Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell publicly clashed over the project's costs. The President claimed the total had reached $3.1 billion, a figure Powell disputed, explaining that Trump's number incorrectly included a separate building completed five years ago. This interaction occurred amid ongoing criticism from Trump regarding the Fed's management and interest rate policies, though he stated he does not think firing Powell is necessary.

The decision was welcomed by Palestinian officials but strongly condemned by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who argued it "rewards terror."

However, the proposal has sparked significant concern among volunteers, who fear it will dismantle a 70-year-old support system, lead to an exodus of volunteers, and create impersonal call centers.

          <p>Top officials from the U.S. Department of Justice, including Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, met with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell in Florida. The meeting comes amid intense political pressure on the Trump administration to release more information from the investigation into the late Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell's lawyer stated she answered every question asked during the multi-hour session. The event is significant as it represents the first time the government has formally interviewed Maxwell since her conviction, a move seen as a response to public and political demands for greater transparency about Epstein's network.</p>

          <p>A 34-year-old DACA recipient, Erick Hernandez-Rodriguez, is being detained and faces expedited removal to El Salvador after he made a wrong turn and accidentally drove into Mexico from San Diego. Despite having DACA protections, which are meant for immigrants brought to the U.S. as children, the government considers him to have "self-deported." His attorney argues the crossing was a brief, unintentional mistake, but he was arrested upon trying to re-enter the U.S. minutes later. The case highlights the precarious situation for DACA recipients under hardline immigration policies, as he now faces separation from his wife, who is expecting their second child.</p>

          <p>The mountain village of Ruidoso, New Mexico, experienced another bout of severe flash flooding on Thursday due to heavy rainfall. The rushing water forced road closures and led to the rescue of at least five people who were trapped. This event comes less than three weeks after previous massive flooding in the area killed three people and damaged hundreds of homes. The region is particularly vulnerable to flooding because past wildfires have stripped the surrounding mountains of vegetation, which would normally absorb rainwater. Forecasters have been issuing routine flood warnings as the area continues to be battered by the summer rainy season.</p>

          <p>The 2028 Democratic presidential primary appears to be unofficially underway, with several potential candidates making strategic media appearances on a variety of platforms, including non-traditional and conservative-leaning podcasts. Figures like Rahm Emanuel, Pete Buttigieg, and Gavin Newsom are using these opportunities to define their public personas and signal a potential shift toward the political center. This includes addressing sensitive cultural topics, such as gender identity, more directly than the party has in the past. This early activity is seen as a course correction following the 2024 election loss, aiming to broaden the party's appeal and find a new standard-bearer.</p>

          <p>A historic heatwave is gripping Finnish Lapland, with temperatures hovering around 30°C (86°F) for a record number of consecutive days, far above the seasonal average. The extreme heat is causing disruptions for the region's tourism, which is built around a wintery "Santa Claus" theme, and is affecting the health of local reindeer herds. Scientists point to the event as a clear manifestation of accelerating climate change in the Arctic, which is warming four to five times faster than the rest of the planet. The unusual weather serves as a stark reminder of the global impact of climate change, even in the northernmost parts of Europe.</p>

          <p>U.S. regulators have approved the $8.4 billion merger between Skydance Media and Paramount Global, a deal that has drawn criticism for its political overtones. The approval followed Paramount's $16 million settlement of a lawsuit with Donald Trump and came with commitments from Skydance to install a news ombudsman and end diversity initiatives to address conservative grievances. A dissenting FCC commissioner called the deal a capitulation that would erode press freedom. The merger's approval, involving the son of a major Trump ally, has intensified concerns about the intersection of corporate media, financial interests, and political power.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has asserted that major tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are not over-investing in artificial intelligence but are, in fact, underspending. He argues that the race for AI dominance is a "winner-take-all" situation, and increased capital expenditure is essential for securing a market-leading position. Citing Alphabet's strong quarterly earnings and increased spending on cloud infrastructure, Cramer suggests these investments are both urgent and necessary to build the most accurate and profitable AI services. He believes the company that wins the AI race could achieve a near-monopoly, justifying the massive financial outlays. (not investment advice)</p>

His supporters claim his continued incarceration, long after he became eligible for parole in 1999, was due to political pressure from the U.S. and Israel.
