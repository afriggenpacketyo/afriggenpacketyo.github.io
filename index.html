          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has dismissed a lawsuit aimed at forcing the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC) to hold its interest rate meetings in public. The suit, filed by investment fund Azoria Capital, an ally of Donald Trump, argued the FOMC was subject to federal "Sunshine Act" laws requiring open meetings. Judge Beryl Howell rejected this, finding the FOMC is not a government agency under the act's purview. The judge also questioned if the lawsuit was a publicity stunt for the new fund, a claim the plaintiff's lawyer denied.</p>

          <p>The 4% rule is a long-standing guideline suggesting retirees can safely withdraw 4% of their portfolio annually for about 30 years. However, this rule was not originally designed for annuities, which are insurance products providing guaranteed income. The article explains how retirees can use the 4% rule as a benchmark to compare the income stream from an annuity against traditional portfolio withdrawals. This comparison helps in creating a diversified retirement income strategy, balancing the security of an annuity with the flexibility and inflation-adjusted potential of investments.

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has discussed a new European-led peace plan for Gaza with U.S. President Donald Trump. The proposal, developed with France and Germany, follows the breakdown of recent U.S.-led negotiations and aims to provide immediate relief and a sustainable path to a two-state solution. Downing Street has scheduled an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the plan and aid efforts amid warnings of mass starvation in the territory. The move also comes as domestic pressure mounts on the UK government to formally recognize a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>Two prominent Israeli human rights organizations, B'Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights Israel, have accused the Israeli government of committing genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. In a joint report, the groups allege that Israel's actions constitute a deliberate effort to destroy Palestinian society through mass killings, the creation of catastrophic living conditions, and the systematic destruction of infrastructure, including healthcare and cultural sites. An Israeli government spokesperson has dismissed the allegations as "baseless," continuing the state's denial of such claims in international forums.</p>

          <p>A tariff simulator from Datawheel forecasts that Chinese exports to the U.S. could plummet by $485 billion by 2027 due to ongoing trade tensions and high tariffs. The model predicts this sharp decline as global trade relationships are reconfigured, with countries like Vietnam and South Korea also expected to see reduced exports to the U.S. Conversely, the U.S. is projected to increase imports from Canada and Mexico. The analysis highlights significant potential losses for U.S. exports to China as well, particularly in sectors like soybeans and integrated circuits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wall Street's anxiety over a potential recession caused by the U.S. trade war is diminishing, as the effective tariff rates appear to be settling in the 15-20% range rather than the feared 25% or higher. Economists now see the tax drag from tariffs as unlikely to derail the U.S. expansion, supported by a strong global growth backdrop. While institutions like JPMorgan Chase have lowered their recession risk, analysts remain cautious, noting that further escalations could still tip the economy toward a slowdown, even if a substantial recession seems less likely.

          <p>President Donald Trump has significantly accelerated his timeline for a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, stating a new deadline of "about 10 or 12 days." Speaking alongside the British prime minister, Trump expressed impatience with the lack of progress in negotiations, which recently took place in Istanbul with little result. This new, shorter deadline represents a shift from a previous 50-day ultimatum and reflects the president's growing frustration, as he cited Russia's continued missile attacks on Ukrainian cities as a reason for the increased urgency.</p>

          <h2>Report Details Six Product Categories Likely to Become More Expensive for Americans Due to Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 14:43:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New U.S. tariffs are expected to increase the cost of various goods for American consumers, even with some negotiated reductions for partners like the EU. Products likely to see price hikes include clothing and footwear, as the U.S. heavily imports these items from countries facing steep levies. Other affected categories are coffee, olive oil, and other foods; beer, wine, and spirits; imported cars; and even houses, due to tariffs on building materials like steel, copper, and lumber. The tariffs are also expected to impact energy and fuel costs.</p>

          <p>U.S. Congresswoman Delia Ramirez is requesting a congressional hearing into the use of federal funds to detain immigrants at a notorious megaprison in El Salvador. The request follows reports of "human rights abuses," including torture and sexual assault, against nearly 300 Venezuelan immigrants sent to the Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot) by the Trump administration. Ramirez's letter expresses concern that taxpayer dollars may have funded these violations under a secretive deal between the U.S. and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, a close Trump ally.</p>

          <p>A new report from five UN agencies indicates that over 2.3 billion people worldwide experience moderate to severe food insecurity, with 673.2 million being undernourished. While global hunger levels have declined slightly since the pandemic, the number of people unable to afford a healthy diet has increased due to rising food prices. The report highlights stark regional inequalities, with Africa being the hardest-hit continent where one in five people is undernourished. It also shows that women are disproportionately affected by food insecurity due to gender norms and limited access to resources.</p>

          <p>Adam Coy, a former Columbus, Ohio police officer, has been sentenced to a mandatory term of 15 years to life in prison for the 2020 murder of Andre Hill. Hill, a 47-year-old Black man, was holding a cellphone and keys in a friend's garage when Coy shot him four times. Coy claimed he feared for his life, believing Hill had a gun, but prosecutors argued Hill was never a threat. The case was one of several police killings of Black individuals that sparked national outrage, leading to Coy's firing and a $10 million settlement for Hill's family.</p>

          <p>The European Union has finalized a trade deal with the U.S., settling on a 15% tariff on most EU exports and averting a potentially harsher trade war. While European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called it a "good deal" that brings stability, many European leaders have criticized it as a submission to U.S. pressure. Critics, including the prime ministers of Hungary and France, argue the EU made too many concessions without securing reciprocal benefits, labeling the agreement "lopsided" and damaging to the bloc's economic interests.

According to an internal memo, only 13% of the 1.89 billion data pings the bank received in June were initiated by customers for actual transactions. The bank, which is preparing to charge new fees for data access, claims the high volume of requests increases costs and fraud risk.

          <p>Lawyers for Ghislaine Maxwell are petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court to hear an appeal of her 2021 sex trafficking conviction. The core of their argument is that a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) made with Jeffrey Epstein in Florida in 2008 should have also protected Maxwell from any criminal charges. They contend the government has an obligation to honor the deal, which they say was not geographically limited. Federal prosecutors have maintained that the agreement was only valid in Florida and did not prevent them from bringing charges against Maxwell in New York.</p>

The move is part of the airline's effort to align its staffing with a smaller flight schedule as it attempts to recover financially. The carrier, which emerged from bankruptcy in March, has been struggling with softer-than-expected travel demand during off-peak periods. The pilot's union expressed concern that the continued shrinking of the airline is eroding the value of pilot careers at the company.</p>
