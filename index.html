The incident occurred outside the town of Khuzdar. No group has claimed responsibility, but Balochistan has a history of insurgency and human rights violations. Pakistan's military has accused neighboring India and its proxies in Balochistan of orchestrating the explosion, though there is no evidence of this.</p>

Trump, in turn, uses them to project economic success, even as growth slows. However, these efforts haven't fully protected companies from Trump's anger, indicating that job creation commitments may be more about enhancing the president's image than safeguarding their profitability.</p>
