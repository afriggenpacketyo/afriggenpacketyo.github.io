        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom has sanctioned multiple Russian intelligence officers and GRU military units for engaging in a sustained campaign of malicious cyber activity aimed at destabilizing Europe. Foreign Secretary David Lammy stated the actions were a response to Russia's efforts to undermine UK support for Ukraine. Concurrently, the European Union has implemented its 18th round of sanctions, including a ban on transactions related to the Nord Stream pipeline and a lower price cap on Russian oil. These coordinated measures are intended to increase economic pressure on the Kremlin and curtail its ability to finance the ongoing war, though Russia has vowed to withstand the pressure.</p>

          <p>UNESCO has expanded its World Heritage List by adding 26 new sites, recognizing their significant cultural or natural value. Among the newly designated locations are King Ludwig II's palaces in Germany, the 17th-century remains of Port Royal in Jamaica, and memorial sites related to the Cambodian genocide. Other notable additions include the biodiverse Bijagós Archipelago in Guinea-Bissau and ancient imperial tombs from the Xixia Dynasty in China. This expansion brings the total number of protected sites to 1,248, with member countries committing to their preservation, sometimes with financial assistance from the international body. The selections were finalized by the World Heritage Committee during a meeting in Paris.</p>

          <h2>Alleged Victim in Surrogacy Scheme Speaks Out Amid Investigation into California Couple</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 12:46:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A woman named Kayla Elliott has come forward detailing her experience in an alleged surrogacy scam involving a California couple, Guojun Xuan and Silvia Zhang. Elliott claims she was misled by their company, March Surrogacy, and is now fighting for custody of the baby she delivered, who is currently in foster care. The investigation into Xuan and Zhang widened after they were arrested on child endangerment charges related to a separate infant who suffered severe head trauma from a nanny. Authorities have since placed 21 children connected to the couple into protective care, raising concerns about a large-scale, deceptive surrogacy operation.</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation after an international arbitration panel ruled in its favor against Exxon Mobil. The dispute centered on Exxon's claim to a right of first refusal over Hess's significant stake in the Stabroek Block, a prolific offshore oil development in Guyana. With the legal challenge resolved, Chevron gains a crucial 30% interest in the valuable Guyanese oil reserves, a key strategic goal for the company. While Exxon expressed disagreement with the ruling, it stated it respects the arbitration process and will welcome Chevron to the joint venture, which also includes China's CNOOC.</p>

          <p>Delta and United Airlines are increasingly separating themselves from other major carriers, accounting for over 86% of the industry's profits last year. Analysts suggest their success stems from strong brand loyalty, extensive global networks, and a strategic focus on premium travel and international routes. Despite challenges like falling domestic airfares and an air traffic controller shortage, both airlines are leveraging their premium cabins and loyalty programs to maintain profitability. This performance gap highlights a growing divide in the U.S. airline industry, with these two carriers better positioned to weather economic headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the Democratic Party is experiencing a structural crisis, evidenced by historically low approval ratings and the collapse of the political coalition that brought Barack Obama to power. The author contends that the party's focus on what it terms "intersectional obsessions and woke grievances" on issues of race, gender, and immigration has alienated a broad segment of the American electorate. The rise of figures like New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, with his radical economic platform and divisive cultural politics, is presented as evidence that the party is moving further away from the mainstream. The article concludes that this trajectory will lead to continued political decline.</p>

This underlying geopolitical tension may have contributed to the escalation of conflict, as Sharaa's forces moved into the region, triggering a violent response and subsequent Israeli airstrikes against Damascus.

Bolsonaro is accused of plotting a coup to remain in power after his 2022 election loss, charges he denies. The judge's order also bars him from social media and from communicating with his son and foreign diplomats. This development follows pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who threatened tariffs on Brazil to influence the case. Bolsonaro's lawyers expressed outrage at the restrictions, stating he has always complied with court orders.</p>

          <p>An employment tribunal heard testimony that a transgender doctor, Beth Upton, was sobbing and "very shaken" after a confrontation with a nurse, Sandie Peggie, over the use of a female changing room at a hospital in Kirkcaldy, Scotland. Dr. Elspeth Pitt, a consultant, testified that she found Dr. Upton pale and distressed following the incident on Christmas Eve 2023. The disagreement led to Dr. Upton filing a complaint and Ms. Peggie's subsequent suspension by NHS Fife. Ms. Peggie was recently cleared of gross misconduct in an internal health board hearing, but the employment tribunal, which she initiated, is ongoing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a funding package requested by President Trump that rescinds approximately $9 billion in federal spending, primarily targeting foreign assistance programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The vote passed narrowly along party lines, 216-213, and now heads to the president's desk. Passage of the bill was briefly delayed by procedural maneuvers from Democrats, who sought to force votes on releasing documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. This controversy has become a point of tension between Trump and some of his supporters, who believe in conspiracy theories surrounding the case.</p>

The bill, which focuses on regulating the $250 billion stablecoin market, passed the House with bipartisan support after overcoming initial resistance from some conservative members. This marks a significant moment for the digital currency industry, providing new legal clarity. The signing ceremony occurs as the White House also navigates other issues, including passing a separate bill to cut foreign aid and public broadcasting funds, and addressing pressure to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

          <p>Author Philippa Langley, known for her role in discovering the remains of King Richard III, now claims that the two young princes allegedly murdered in the Tower of London in the 15th century actually survived. The conventional narrative, popularized by Shakespeare, holds that Richard III had his nephews, Edward V and Richard, killed to secure the throne. Langley's decade-long 'Missing Princes Project' has reportedly uncovered documentary evidence suggesting both boys lived. She argues that the story of their murder was Tudor propaganda and that the burden of proof now lies with those who claim the princes died, challenging a historical mystery that has endured for centuries.</p>

          <p>The recent failure to elect law professor Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf to Germany's Federal Constitutional Court is being attributed to a targeted social media campaign by right-wing organizations. A study by the consultancy Polisphere found that online platforms, notably Nius, spread defamatory and false information describing the nominee as a "left-wing radical," which influenced conservative politicians to withdraw their support. This event is seen as a significant moment, demonstrating the power of new media to disrupt established political processes in Germany.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees who are "house rich but cash poor," a reverse mortgage can be a tool to supplement Social Security income by converting home equity into accessible funds. This financial product allows homeowners aged 62 and older to receive payments as a monthly stream, a lump sum, or a line of credit, helping to cover living expenses or unexpected costs like healthcare. One potential strategy involves using reverse mortgage funds to delay claiming Social Security benefits, which can increase the eventual monthly payments. This approach provides an alternative for managing retirement finances without requiring monthly loan repayments while the owner resides in the home. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's harvests of strawberries and asparagus have fallen to their lowest levels in decades, according to new data from the Federal Statistical Office. In 2025, the strawberry harvest was the lowest in 30 years, while the asparagus yield hit a 15-year low. The decline is attributed to farmers planting less of these crops due to rising production costs, particularly for labor, which they are unable to pass on to consumers. As a result, both seasonal delicacies are becoming luxury items, with prices for asparagus up 4% from last year. Germany's self-sufficiency in strawberries has also dropped significantly, increasing reliance on imports.</p>
