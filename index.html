          <p>Following the death of wrestling legend Hulk Hogan at age 71, fellow WWE icon Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson shared a heartfelt tribute on social media. Johnson recalled a personal childhood memory of Hogan and reflected on their historic WrestleMania X8 match, which he described as a symbolic "passing of the torch." He praised Hogan as a childhood hero and credited him with selling out arenas across the country, solidifying his status as one of the greatest of all time. WWE also honored Hogan with a 10-bell salute and a video tribute during its "SmackDown!" broadcast.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's broad use of tariff powers is facing a critical legal test in a federal appeals court, which could invalidate many of his recent trade actions. The lawsuit challenges his authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs, including those related to fentanyl and his worldwide "reciprocal" duties. While a lower court struck down the tariffs, an appeals court has kept them in effect pending the outcome of the case. Legal experts believe the tariffs are at risk, and the case is widely expected to reach the Supreme Court, with significant implications for numerous trade deals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi concluded a two-day visit to the Maldives, aiming to reinforce relations with the nation amid its increasing alignment with China. The visit comes after Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu, elected on a pro-China platform, requested the withdrawal of Indian military personnel. In a move to mend ties, Modi unveiled a $565 million credit line, reduced repayment terms on a previous loan, and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects. The diplomatic effort underscores the geopolitical significance of the Maldives, located on key Indian Ocean shipping lanes.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team faces uncertainty over the fitness of captain Ben Stokes for the final day of the fourth Test against India at Old Trafford. After taking five wickets in the first innings and scoring a century, Stokes did not bowl on day four, with assistant coach Marcus Trescothick citing stiffness and soreness. Stokes has a history of injury issues, including recent hamstring surgery, and his absence from the bowling attack is a significant concern for England's victory push. The team will assess his condition overnight, hoping the talismanic all-rounder will be able to contribute on the decisive day.</p>

          <p>More than two decades after its original release, a sequel to the hit film "Bend It Like Beckham" is in the works, according to director Gurinder Chadha. The 2002 movie, starring Keira Knightley and Parminder Nagra, is celebrated for inspiring a generation of female soccer players. Chadha stated that the success of England's Lionesses and the current momentum in women's sports make it an opportune time to revisit the characters. She is targeting a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary and the Women's World Cup, hoping to reunite the original cast.</p>

          <p>An internal USAID analysis of over 150 reported incidents found no evidence of widespread, systematic diversion of humanitarian aid by Hamas in Gaza, according to a presentation reviewed by ABC News. This finding appears to contradict claims by the Trump administration and Israel, which have been used to justify limiting aid through traditional channels and supporting a new distribution system. The State Department and the Israel Defense Forces have forcefully pushed back on the report's conclusions. The analysis was compiled between October 2023 and May 2024, before USAID ceased independent operations in Gaza.</p>

          <p>BBC analyst Jeremy Bowen describes the plan to airdrop aid into Gaza as an act of desperation that is unlikely to alleviate the widespread starvation. While Israel has agreed to allow airdrops, experts consider it a crude, last-resort method that delivers far less aid than truck convoys and poses risks to civilians on the ground. Bowen recalls past instances in Iraq and Bosnia where airdrops led to accidental deaths and injuries. He argues that with functional ports and land crossings nearby, the focus on airdrops is a distraction from the real solution: a ceasefire and an unrestricted, long-term ground-based aid operation.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed at record highs after a strong week driven by positive corporate earnings and trade developments. President Trump announced a trade agreement with Japan and is set to meet with EU officials, while talks with China are ongoing.

          <p>The health impacts of daily coffee consumption remain a complex topic, with experts advising that the right amount varies for each individual. While some research links one to three cups a day to heart health benefits, other studies suggest high consumption can increase dementia risk. The FDA recommends a limit of 400 milligrams of caffeine daily, but tolerance differs, and some people may experience anxiety or jitters with less. Experts stress the importance of moderation, being mindful of personal reactions, and not replacing meals with caffeine, especially for those with pre-existing health conditions.</p>

Kotsev, a member of the pro-European PP party, was arrested on corruption charges, which his supporters claim are politically motivated by the ruling conservative GERB party. The case has become a symbol of the struggle against perceived authoritarian trends and the hijacking of key state institutions.

          <p>An international research team has discovered that a family of "junk" DNA sequences, known as MER11, plays a significant role in regulating gene expression. These sequences, called transposable elements, were previously thought to be non-functional remnants of ancient viral infections. The study, published in Science Advances, found that younger versions of these elements can act like genetic switches, influencing which genes are turned on or off without altering the underlying DNA code. This finding suggests that a vast portion of the human genome, once considered clutter, has evolved to perform important regulatory functions.</p>

          <p>Despite CEO Elon Musk's ambitious promises of driverless cars and a widespread robotaxi service, Tesla investors are showing increasing concern over the company's immediate challenges. Following a recent earnings report, Tesla's stock fell sharply as focus shifted to slumping vehicle sales, thinning profits, and rising competition from lower-cost EV makers. Automotive sales declined 16% year-over-year in the second quarter, and the company faces headwinds from expiring EV credits and tariffs. Analysts noted that while long-term projects like robotaxis are promising, the company's current profit and loss dynamics need to improve.</p>

These chemicals are linked to serious health issues, including cancer and fertility problems, and persist indefinitely in the environment.
