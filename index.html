            <p>A Chinese official has condemned countries for allegedly trying to appease the United States in trade negotiations involving President Trump's tariffs. This response follows reports that the U.S. intends to pressure other governments to restrict trade with Beijing in exchange for exemptions from U.S. import taxes. The Trump administration has initiated tariff discussions with key trading partners like Japan and South Korea, imposing substantial tariffs on Chinese imports since returning to the White House in January. China views these actions as unfair and vows to take countermeasures against nations compromising its interests.</p>

            <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly shared details about impending U.S. airstrikes in Yemen with a private Signal group, including his wife, brother, and personal attorney. The messages, sent on March 15, included flight schedules for F/A-18 Hornets tasked with striking Houthi targets. This incident follows a previous report where Hegseth inadvertently shared similar operational details in a separate Signal chat with The Atlantic editor-in-chief, raising concerns about the handling of sensitive military information. The Pentagon's inspector general is evaluating Hegseth's use of the Signal app to determine compliance with DoD policies.</p>

            <p>China has warned it will retaliate against countries that cooperate with the U.S. in ways that compromise Beijing's interests, as trade tensions between the two nations escalate. This warning comes as the Trump administration reportedly plans to use tariff negotiations to pressure U.S. partners to limit their dealings with China. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce stated it firmly opposes any deals made at China's expense and will take reciprocal countermeasures. The ministry also cautioned about the risks to international trade if it returns to the "law of the jungle."</p>

While the show includes glimmers of ingenuity in exploring Ellie and Joel's relationship, it struggles to delve into Ellie's emotional journey, instead positing that all characters have gotten lost in the darkness.

The jet, painted with Xiamen livery, was one of several waiting at Boeing's Zhoushan completion center for final work and delivery. Trump's recent increase of baseline tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, with China retaliating with a 125% tariff on US goods, has made the delivery economically unviable.

            <p>President Trump is threatening to cut another $1 billion in funding for Harvard University, targeting health research, as the administration's conflict with elite schools intensifies. This action follows the withholding of government funding from Harvard, Columbia, and other universities due to their handling of pro-Palestinian demonstrations. The Trump administration officials thought a long list of demands they sent Harvard on April 11 was a confidential starting point for negotiations, and officials were surprised when Harvard released the letter to the public. Since his January inauguration, Trump has cracked down on top U.S. universities, saying they mishandled last year's pro-Palestinian protests and allowed antisemitism to intensify on campus.</p>

            <p>An opinion piece suggests that China is not eager to negotiate with the U.S. and recognizes that America's strategic goal is to systematically strangle China's economic rise, not merely rebalance trade. Instead of capitalizing on China's demand for semiconductors, the U.S. has imposed strict export controls. China is digging in for a long fight and could use fiscal stimulus to mitigate the impact, while also resolving its own economic weaknesses, such as the fragmentation of its domestic market. China could become faster, leaner, and stronger as a result of the tariffs.</p>

            <p>Despite government efforts to provide "free hours" of childcare in England, parents still face difficulties finding nursery places, and experts are concerned about a widening gap between those eligible for funding and those who are not. Access to childcare has declined over the last five years, while demand is increasing, particularly in deprived areas. Private nurseries are facing rising operating costs, and local authority-run nurseries are declining. The government is doubling its spending on childcare, but questions remain about whether disadvantaged children have the same opportunities as their more affluent peers.</p>

            <p>With mortgage rates expected to decrease, there are various ways for first-time buyers to save for a deposit and enter the housing market. These include starting to save early with a Lifetime ISA, exploring low-deposit mortgage options, considering shared ownership, utilizing an 'income boost' mortgage, and exploring 'professional' mortgages. Experts recommend saving as early as possible to maximize benefits from government bonuses and family contributions. Small deposit mortgages typically offer higher rates, and may not be suitable for many self-employed homebuyers who may struggle to meet the strict eligibility criteria. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Men tend to visit doctors less frequently than women, often delaying medical help until symptoms become unbearable. This behavior is influenced by societal expectations of masculinity, self-reliance, and a reluctance to show vulnerability. New NHS survey data suggests that many men feel pressured to "tough it out" when it comes to potential health issues. Other factors include appointment systems that don't accommodate working patterns and a focus on treatment rather than prevention. Support groups and redesigned services that cater to men's communication styles can encourage them to seek medical help earlier.</p>

Over-speeding, lack of basic safety precautions like helmets and seatbelts, overloading, and driving without a valid license are major causes. The hazardous environment is complicated by chaotic traffic, with motorized and non-motorized vehicles sharing the roads. Experts cite poor civil engineering practices, flawed road design, substandard construction, and systemic neglect as key contributors to the high accident rate. The economic burden of road crashes costs India 3% of its annual GDP.</p>
