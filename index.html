        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A wildfire near Greer, Arizona, has rapidly expanded to over 6,400 acres with 0% containment, fueled by high winds and dry vegetation. The Greer Fire, which began Tuesday morning, is moving north and has prompted evacuations in the unincorporated community of Greer, located in the White Mountains. Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs stated that multiple structures have been destroyed, and over 200 personnel are working to combat the blaze. Red flag warnings remain in effect, with continued high winds expected to challenge firefighting efforts and cause further road closures in the area.</p>

Despite a widened net loss due to stock-based compensation, CoreWeave secured a five-year deal with OpenAI worth up to $11.9 billion, supplementing OpenAI's reliance on Microsoft. The company expects to double its deployed power by the end of the year to accommodate its growth, while not expecting meaningful impact from President Trump's tariffs.</p>

          <p>Kseniia Petrova, a Harvard researcher, is facing deportation to Russia after being charged with criminal smuggling for failing to declare scientific samples in her luggage. Despite admitting to the oversight, Petrova's lawyer argues that such infractions usually result in a fine, not deportation, especially given her fear of arrest in Russia due to her history of political protest. A government lawyer stated the Trump administration's intention to deport her, leading to conflict with a federal judge in Vermont who questioned the authority to cancel her visa. The criminal charges could lead to a 20-year prison sentence if she is convicted.</p>

While some viewed Trump's remarks as a welcome shift away from lecturing, others expressed concern over the potential loss of pressure on human rights issues.
