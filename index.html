          <p>Despite optimistic tones from Israel, Hamas, and mediating countries, Israeli airstrikes were reported in Gaza ahead of crucial ceasefire talks scheduled in Egypt. The negotiations aim to end the war and secure a deal for the remaining hostages held by the militant group. A senior Hamas figure will lead the group's delegation, while high-level US envoys will also be present for the discussions. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed hope for the hostages' return while reaffirming his goal to disarm Hamas, either through diplomacy or military action.</p>

          <p>A terror attack outside a synagogue in Manchester during Yom Kippur services resulted in the deaths of two men, with three others seriously injured. The suspect, identified as a 35-year-old British citizen of Syrian descent, used a car to ram into people before attempting to enter the building with a knife and was shot dead by police. One of the victims, Adrian Daulby, was tragically killed by police gunfire while trying to secure the synagogue's doors against the attacker. The incident has been widely condemned by political and religious leaders, prompting increased security at Jewish sites across the UK.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that states opposed to Donald Trump should engage in their own form of "political theatre" by forming an interstate compact. Drawing parallels to the American colonies' resistance against Britain, the author proposes that states like New York and California could declare a national emergency and draft a new framework for rights and governmental obligations. This compact would serve as a prototype for a post-Trump America, aiming to shift the political focus and demonstrate a proactive, norm-breaking response from the left. The goal is to create a new constitutional model rather than simply reacting to Trump's actions.</p>

          <p>Actor Eric Dane, known for his roles in "Grey's Anatomy" and "Euphoria," recently spoke with lawmakers in Washington, D.C., about his ongoing battle with ALS. He advocated for the reauthorization of the ACT for ALS law, which expands access to treatments and is set to expire. The 52-year-old actor, who announced his diagnosis in April, expressed his determination to fight the disease, motivated by his desire to be there for his two daughters' future milestones.

          <p>Jennifer Welch and Angie Sullivan, hosts of the popular "I've Had It" podcast, are providing a provocative and unfiltered liberal counterpoint to the right-wing media landscape. Broadcasting from Oklahoma, the duo combines profanity-laced rants on daily life with sharp political commentary, attracting millions of followers and high-profile Democratic guests like Kamala Harris and Barack Obama. Their approach, which they describe as "fuck-you politics," aims to challenge the traditional, more reserved tone of liberal discourse. The podcast's success suggests a growing appetite among Democrats for a more aggressive and entertaining style of political engagement.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett stated she is "not afraid" despite facing routine protests and serious threats, including a recently thwarted assassination plot against Justice Brett Kavanaugh that also targeted her. Barrett explained that she has learned to be "businesslike" about the protests and refuses to reward threats with fear, attributing her resilience to a disciplined, non-emotional approach to her life and work. She also discussed her new book and her commitment to originalism, the judicial philosophy she shares with her mentor, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, emphasizing that her decisions are based on the law, not politics or personal feelings.</p>

Witnessing the decline of Caribbean corals over her 50-year career, Alvarado and her team are now collecting coral eggs and sperm to fertilize them in a lab, raising the hatchlings in nurseries before transplanting them. This technique allows them to cultivate hardier coral varieties that are more resistant to rising ocean temperatures and disease. Known as "the mother of Colombian corals," she is also training a new generation of scientists to continue this vital conservation work.</p>

          <p>Recent viral consumer fads, such as Labubu toys and Dubai chocolate, are examples of a new kind of trend cycle driven by social media algorithms rather than traditional cultural tastemakers. Unlike past crazes like Beanie Babies, which had traceable origins in marketing and new e-commerce platforms, today's trends often lack clear cultural context. According to consumerism writer Amanda Mull, these items gain traction because their visually stimulating qualities—like bright colors or rich textures—are perfectly suited to grab attention on platforms like TikTok. This phenomenon reflects a desire for shared, physical experiences to bridge the gap between online and offline lives.</p>

          <p>Under new leader Zack Polanski, the Green Party of England and Wales is shifting its strategy from well-meaning activism to a more confrontational, "eco-populist" approach. With party membership at an all-time high, Polanski aims to "pick fights" and create controversy to gain public attention and translate momentum into electoral power. This new boldness is seen by party leadership as necessary to combat voter disillusionment and the rise of right-wing populism, drawing tactical inspiration from the simple and provocative messaging of parties like Reform UK. However, some members worry this shift could alienate the rural voters who were key to their recent breakthroughs.</p>

          <p>A massive overnight Russian missile and drone attack across Ukraine has killed at least five people and left tens of thousands without electricity. President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that Russia fired over 50 missiles and approximately 500 drones, targeting energy infrastructure and civilian areas in multiple regions, including Lviv and Zaporizhzhia. Among the victims were four members of a single family in a village near Lviv. In response to the widespread assault, neighboring Poland scrambled its fighter jets to secure its airspace. The attacks are seen as a continued Russian effort to cripple Ukraine's energy grid as winter approaches.</p>

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood framed the move as a way to balance the right to protest with residents' freedom from intimidation, citing recent concerns within the Jewish community. The announcement follows a weekend of protests and nearly 500 arrests, and has been criticized by some groups as an authoritarian measure designed to silence opposition.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques a recent address by Donald Trump to the U.S. military's senior officer corps at Marine Corps Base Quantico, describing it as an unprecedented and disastrous event. The author argues that Trump treated the commanders not as defenders of the Constitution but as personal pawns, expecting applause and showing frustration at their disciplined silence. The speech, preceded by a confrontational talk from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, is portrayed as an attempt to enlist the military in a domestic war against political opponents. The silent, stoic response from the generals and admirals is interpreted as a testament to their professionalism and loyalty to the constitution over any individual.</p>

          <p>This article argues that Donald Trump's presidency has transformed him into the world's leading opponent of climate action, actively working to dismantle clean energy initiatives in the U.S. and abroad. His administration has not only withdrawn from the Paris Agreement again but has also banned renewable projects on federal land and eliminated subsidies, actions that have reportedly caused billions in project closures. This stance, which frames the climate crisis as a "hoax" and clean energy as a "scam," is causing the U.S. to fall behind competitors like China in the booming global renewables market.

This new tariff would be applied on top of existing duties and would effectively double the price for consumers. Italy's foreign ministry contests the findings, highlighting that the U.S. is one of its top three export markets for pasta, a key commodity worth nearly $800 million in exports annually.

          <h2>UK Conservatives Announce Plan to Deport 750,000 Migrants Over Five Years</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Conservative Party has unveiled a new immigration plan that includes a pledge to remove 750,000 migrants within five years. Unveiled at their annual conference, the proposal would ban anyone entering the UK without permission from ever claiming asylum and would replace court appeals with an internal Home Office review process. The plan involves creating a rebranded and better-funded "Removals Force" to deport at least 150,000 people annually. This hardline stance, which includes leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, is seen as an attempt to outflank the rival Reform UK party and create a clear policy distinction with the Labour government.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has urged the public to remain calm and sober in response to a recent wave of mysterious drone sightings over German airports and military sites. While stating that good progress is being made on drone defense, Pistorius clarified that the military cannot be responsible for downing drones everywhere, emphasizing the need for federal and state police to build their own capabilities. He suggested that Russia may be behind the provocations, aiming to instill fear and create uncertainty within Germany. The sightings have disrupted travel, including at Munich Airport, and have heightened security concerns across the country.</p>

          <p>At least 22 people have been killed and a dozen more are missing in Nepal following severe landslides, lightning, and flash floods triggered by heavy monsoon rains. The eastern Ilam district was hit hardest, with multiple villages swept away and 18 fatalities reported, including six members of a single family whose home was buried. The ongoing rainfall is hampering rescue and relief efforts, and major highways connecting the capital, Kathmandu, have been blocked. The weather department has warned that the heavy rains are likely to continue, prompting the government to declare a national holiday.</p>

          <p>Syria is conducting its first parliamentary elections since former leader Bashar Assad was unseated in December, though it will not be a popular vote. Instead, two-thirds of the 210-seat People's Assembly will be chosen by 7,000 electoral college members, with the remaining third appointed directly by the interim president. The interim authorities cited the impossibility of creating an accurate voter registry due to millions of displaced citizens as the reason for forgoing a direct election. The results will be closely watched as an indicator of the new government's commitment to inclusivity, especially regarding women and ethnic and religious minorities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite recent record sales, the U.S. electric vehicle (EV) market is lagging behind global leaders like China and Europe and is now facing a potential downturn. A recent sales boom was largely driven by a $7,500 federal tax credit that expired at the end of September, with automakers like Ford and GM now expecting a sharp drop in demand. The article attributes the slower U.S. adoption to weaker government support, higher average vehicle prices, and the effective exclusion of low-cost Chinese brands due to tariffs. President Trump's push to scrap pro-EV policies further complicates the industry's future, potentially ceding more ground to international competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

The states of Madhya Pradesh, where most deaths occurred, Tamil Nadu, and Kerala have all prohibited sales of the product.

This action follows similar deployments in other cities like Los Angeles and Portland, as the administration takes a more forceful role in managing urban unrest. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, a Democrat, condemned the move as a "manufactured performance" and an "outrageous and un-American" demand to use military troops against the state's will.

However, growth has been constrained by the Premier League's Profit and Sustainability Rules (PSR), preventing the owners from spending limitlessly and forcing a more strategic build compared to clubs like Manchester City post-takeover.
