          <h2>RFK Jr. Aims to Eliminate Artificial Food Dyes in US by Next Year</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 18:36:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes from the U.S. food supply by the end of next year, collaborating with the FDA and food companies to remove these dyes from products like cereals and snacks. Citing studies linking these dyes to health conditions such as ADHD and cancer, the FDA is looking to revoke authorization for certain synthetic food colorings and authorize new natural alternatives. While the food industry expresses concerns about the timeline and potential supply disruptions, consumer groups are largely supportive of the initiative, which also follows similar actions in several states to ban artificial dyes in school lunches. The plan's success hinges on the food industry's cooperation, as the enforcement mechanism remains unclear.</p>

          <p>A mass shooting at Florida State University's Student Union on April 17 resulted in two fatalities and six injuries, with the alleged shooter, 20-year-old Phoenix Ikner, also wounded. The victims killed have been identified as Robert Morales, a university dining worker, and Tiru Chabba, a campus vendor, both leaving behind grieving families. Five of the six gunshot patients have been discharged from the hospital, with the remaining patient, presumably the suspected shooter, in good condition.

          <p>U.S. stocks rebounded sharply on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average soaring over 1,000 points, driven by potential de-escalation of trade tensions with China. The market's recovery follows a significant sell-off on Monday triggered by President Trump's criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, leading to speculation about a potential shakeup at the Fed. Despite the positive market sentiment, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised its U.S. economic growth forecast downward, citing the ongoing trade war and policy uncertainty. While Trump has stated he has no intention of firing Powell, the trade war continues to influence global markets and economic outlooks.</p>

          <p>Tesla reported lower-than-expected earnings and revenue for the first quarter, with automotive revenue declining by 20% compared to the previous year. The company attributed the decrease to production line updates for the Model Y and lower average selling prices. CEO Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's administration, particularly in efforts to downsize the federal government, has sparked concerns about increased costs for crucial electric vehicle components due to tariffs. Tesla refrained from providing growth guidance for the year and said it will revisit its 2025 forecast, while Musk announced he would reduce his time allocation to the Trump administration in May to focus more on Tesla.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated he has no plans to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, despite recently criticizing him for not lowering interest rates quickly enough. This announcement follows a period of market volatility partly triggered by concerns that Trump intended to remove Powell from his position. Trump has been publicly pressuring the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, despite the central bank's concerns about inflation remaining above the target rate of 2%. The Fed's independence is seen as crucial for maintaining economic stability.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth convened a meeting with top Trump administration officials to address claims that the Biden administration unfairly targeted Christians. The Justice Department is investigating events during the Biden administration that conservatives argue demonstrated anti-Christian bias by senior law enforcement officials, including prosecutions against anti-abortion protesters and allegations of FBI surveillance of traditional Catholics. Bondi highlighted the Trump administration's success in combating violence targeting churches, citing the conviction of an Arizona man who plotted to bomb Christian churches, a case that originated during the Biden administration.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is requesting that the food industry voluntarily discontinue the use of synthetic food dyes, aligning with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

The FDA claims that the food industry is eager to make the switch, citing concerns about the impact of artificial dyes on children's health and behavior.

          <p>Six leading policy groups representing the U.S. automotive industry have joined forces to lobby the Trump administration against the implementation of 25% tariffs on auto parts, which are scheduled to take effect by May 3. The groups argue that these tariffs could jeopardize U.S. automotive production, as many auto suppliers are already facing financial difficulties and would be unable to absorb the additional costs. They emphasize the potential for widespread industry problems, including production stoppages, layoffs, and bankruptcies. While President Trump has indicated a willingness to reconsider the tariffs, auto executives and experts warn that the impact on auto suppliers could be more severe than on automakers themselves.</p>

The judge ordered the administration to reinstate VOA employees and contractors to their previous status, citing potential violations of federal laws and the First Amendment. The targeted networks deliver information to countries lacking a free press, promoting American democratic values. The Trump administration's legal team argued that they were not violating VOA journalists' First Amendment rights because it has stopped all journalism rather than singling out any individual for their viewpoint.</p>

Amazon disputes the claims, arguing that the complaint is based on a baseless legal theory.

          <h2>IMF Predicts Additional UK Interest Rate Cuts Amidst Inflation Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 17:40:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts that the Bank of England could cut interest rates three more times this year, despite the UK facing higher-than-expected inflation. The IMF forecasts UK inflation to be the highest among advanced economies at 3.1%, attributing it to higher energy and water bills. The organization also revised its UK economic growth forecast downward to 1.1% in 2025, citing the global impact of US trade tariffs. The report suggests that the expected inflation spike will be temporary, allowing for future rate cuts, while Trump tariffs could also slow down UK price increases.</p>
