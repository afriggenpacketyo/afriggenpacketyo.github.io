          <p>A judge in the Diego Maradona negligent homicide trial has recused herself after revelations of her involvement in a documentary about the case, raising concerns about impartiality. The judge, Julieta Makintach, is accused of violating ethics rules due to her role in the "Divine Justice" miniseries, which reconstructs Maradona's death. Prosecutors argued that Makintach was behaving more like an actress than a judge, potentially jeopardizing the trial's integrity. The remaining judges will decide whether to order a new trial for the seven medical team members charged with negligent homicide in connection to Maradona's death in 2020.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's upcoming IPO is notable for its structure, where existing shareholders are selling more shares than the company itself, a characteristic reminiscent of Facebook's 2012 IPO. In Circle's offering, 60% of shares will come from investors, versus 57% in Facebook's case. This unusual move likely reflects venture capital firms' eagerness for liquidity after a prolonged period of meager returns, with Silicon Valley investors keen to distribute funds back to their own investors. Circle, profitable with substantial cash reserves, aims to raise additional capital through the IPO.</p>

The administration's broader controls on international students have faced legal challenges, including a recent battle with Harvard University over enrollment restrictions.

The report suggests a mismatch between the oversupply of graduates in fields where business demand has waned, particularly in computer science.

          <p>Sean 'Diddy' Combs is facing accusations in court from a former employee who testified that he kidnapped her at gunpoint and plotted to kill rapper Kid Cudi. Capricorn Clark, who worked for Combs for over a decade, claimed that Combs forced her to drive with him to Kid Cudi's home in 2011 with the intention of killing him. Clark also stated that Combs threatened to kill her on her first day of work, while Combs has pleaded not guilty to racketeering, sexual assault, and related charges.</p>

          <p>During a live broadcast of an American Hockey League playoff game, Abbotsford Canucks announcer Brandon Astle was confronted by a rowdy fan who threw a chair at him. The incident occurred during the decisive Game 5 of the series against the Colorado Eagles, with the chair striking Astle in the leg. Astle addressed the situation on air and later apologized for his handling of it on social media, clarifying that the incident did not reflect the Eagles organization or their fans.

          <p>A federal judge has reduced the charge against an L.A. County sheriff's deputy, Trevor Kirk, convicted of excessive force, from a felony to a misdemeanor, despite a jury conviction. The decision follows a controversial move by U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli to offer Kirk a misdemeanor plea deal after he was convicted of using excessive force against an unarmed woman. The ruling has caused turmoil in the U.S. attorney's office, with several prosecutors resigning in protest, and the judge could still impose some jail time when sentencing occurs in June.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have reportedly found a way to mitigate critical vibration issues in Hyperloop technology, potentially salvaging the futuristic high-speed ground travel concept. A study from China's Journal of Railway Science and Engineering indicates that even minor track imperfections can cause severe turbulence in vacuum-tube maglev systems. However, the researchers claim to have discovered a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, making the ride more comfortable. The findings could revitalize interest in Hyperloop technology and address challenges faced by projects like Elon Musk's Hyperloop.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's latest Starship test flight successfully reached orbit but experienced an uncontrolled re-entry due to a propellant leak. The leak led to a loss of attitude control, causing the spacecraft to spin and likely disintegrate over the Indian Ocean. Despite this setback, the mission demonstrated that the vehicle could reach orbit, marking progress toward SpaceX's goal of sending humans to Mars. The company plans to review the data and make adjustments for future test flights, as part of its iterative approach to engineering.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's attacks on Harvard University have unexpectedly fostered a sense of unity on a campus previously divided over issues such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and free speech. The administration's decision to bar Harvard from enrolling international students and freeze billions in funding has prompted many to set aside their differences. Students and faculty members have rallied in support of the university, viewing the administration's actions as an existential threat to academic freedom. This unexpected unity contrasts sharply with the divisions that have characterized Harvard in recent years.</p>

          <p>The CDC will no longer recommend routine COVID-19 shots for healthy children or healthy pregnant women, according to Health Secretary Robert F.

While some experts agree that the initial vaccine course offered significant protection, the need for annual vaccines against new variants is more contentious. Some argue that children might not benefit as much as adults from yearly shots due to their longer-lasting immune memory.</p>

The order, aimed at firms associated with Trump's political opponents, was deemed a punitive measure that infringed on fundamental rights.
