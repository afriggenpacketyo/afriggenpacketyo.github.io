          <p>Jonathan Peter Brooks, a plastic surgeon, has been sentenced to life in prison for attempting to murder his colleague, Graeme Perks. Brooks broke into Perks's home armed with a crowbar, petrol, matches, and a knife, with the intention of killing him because Perks was a witness against him in disciplinary proceedings. The trial revealed that Perks had a "95% chance of dying" after being stabbed by Brooks, who was convicted of attempted murder and other related offenses. Brooks will serve a minimum of 22 years in prison for his crimes. The article focuses on the severity of the attack and the calculated nature of Brooks's actions against his colleague.</p>

          <p>A New York Federal Reserve survey indicated that Americans' inflation fears decreased in May following President Trump's partial reversal of tariff proposals.

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated that inflation is down by more than it has been in four years, despite rising tariff revenue.

          <p>An Italian referendum aimed at easing citizenship rules for foreigners and strengthening labor rights has failed due to low voter turnout. Less than a third of eligible voters participated in the poll, preventing the proposed changes from being enacted. The referendum's failure reflects a lack of widespread support for loosening citizenship requirements and enhancing labor protections. The outcome signifies a setback for those advocating for more inclusive citizenship policies and stronger worker rights in Italy.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Turley argues that California Democrats' resistance to ICE and President Trump's immigration policies could lead to unintended consequences. He suggests that Governor Newsom's opposition to deploying the National Guard to protect federal officers is misguided, especially after violent attacks on ICE personnel and property. Turley contends that Trump has the legal authority to deploy the National Guard and that Democratic leaders' rhetoric against ICE is fueling violent responses. The article concludes that while Democrats aim to oppose immigration enforcement, their actions might strengthen the case for federal intervention in hostile cities.</p>

The company will focus on scaling up HBO Max, aiming for 150 million subscribers by the end of 2026, while addressing revenue challenges in the studio business.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery's decision to split into two companies raises questions about the future of TNT Sports, as live sports rights held by TNT may be licensed to the Streaming and Studios business or other entities. CEO David Zaslav indicated that U.S. sports haven't been a major driver of HBO Max signups, suggesting a potential decoupling. The Global Networks division, led by Gunnar Wiedenfels, will decide how to monetize TNT's streaming and digital sports rights, including potential mergers or licensing deals. The company emphasized that transactions could begin as soon as the separation occurs.</p>

          <p>Tensions escalated in Los Angeles as protests against President Trump's immigration policies intensified following the deployment of the National Guard. Demonstrations led to freeway blockages, vehicle fires, and clashes between protesters and law enforcement, resulting in numerous arrests. California Governor Gavin Newsom intends to sue the Trump administration for deploying the Guard without state consultation. The protests were sparked by federal agents arresting immigrants in the LA area, leading to widespread unrest and accusations of overreach by both state and federal officials.</p>

          <p>Asian needle ants, an invasive species with a potentially deadly sting, have spread across more than a dozen states in the U.S., primarily in the Southeast. The ants' venom can cause anaphylactic shock in sensitive individuals, posing a threat to those with allergies to bee and ant stings. These ants are sneaky and capable of invading undisturbed forest areas, displacing native ant species crucial for seed dispersal. Experts advise vigilance and caution, especially in areas with logs, rotting debris, or rocks where the ants may nest.</p>
