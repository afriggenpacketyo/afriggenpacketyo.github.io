          <p>A 13-year-old Glasgow student, Rebecca Young, has been named one of Time magazine's 'Girls of the Year' for inventing a solar-powered blanket designed to help homeless individuals stay warm. Her idea, developed in a school engineering club, uses solar panels to charge a battery pack during the day, which then provides heat at night. Engineering firm Thales produced a working prototype, with 35 units distributed by Homeless Project Scotland, demonstrating a practical solution to a pressing social issue.</p>

          <p>An inquest jury has concluded that 14-year-old Ruth Szymankiewicz was unlawfully killed at the now-closed Huntercombe Hospital in Berkshire due to gross negligence. She was left unsupervised by a staff member who had used false credentials and was on his first shift, allowing her to self-harm. The jury identified multiple contributing factors, including insufficient staff training and an unsuitable care environment, prompting her family to call for urgent reforms in children's mental health services.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals struggling with high-interest debt, two primary relief strategies are debt forgiveness and debt management, each with distinct benefits and drawbacks. Debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to pay back less than the full amount owed, which can provide significant savings but severely damages credit scores and may have tax implications. In contrast, debt management involves creating a structured repayment plan with lower interest rates, which helps preserve credit but requires repaying the debt in full over several years. The best choice depends on an individual's specific financial situation and long-term goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a struggling plant-based meat market, industry leaders Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods are adopting contrasting strategies to attract consumers. Beyond Meat is rebranding to focus on simpler, 'cleaner' ingredients and less direct meat mimicry, responding to criticism about its products being 'ultra-processed.' Conversely, Impossible Foods is doubling down on taste and a 'meaty' experience, even considering blended plant-animal products, betting that flavor is the primary driver for consumers. The outcome of these opposing bets will likely shape the future of the alternative protein industry.</p>

          <p>The Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, surged by 0.9% in July, far exceeding economists' expectations and marking the largest monthly increase in over three years. This significant jump suggests that President Trump's tariffs are increasingly driving up costs for businesses, which are likely to be passed on to consumers soon. The data indicates that businesses' ability to absorb these tariff-related costs may be diminishing, creating new inflationary pressures in the economy and complicating the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decisions.

          <p>European leaders are watching with considerable apprehension as U.S. President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss the war in Ukraine. Ahead of the talks, key European allies held a video call with Trump to emphasize their desire for a ceasefire without conceding Ukrainian territory. Despite these efforts, there is widespread fear in Europe that Putin could persuade Trump to make damaging concessions, such as cutting off weapons supplies to Ukraine or weakening the U.S. military presence on the continent.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are meeting in Anchorage, Alaska, for a high-stakes summit focused on ending the war in Ukraine. The meeting, held at a major U.S. military base, represents Trump's effort to deliver on his campaign promise to quickly resolve the conflict. However, with Ukraine not participating in the talks and the White House managing expectations by calling it a 'listening exercise,' the potential outcomes remain highly uncertain amid concerns that any deal could involve territorial concessions from Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has announced that the state will open a new immigration detention facility, which he called a 'deportation depot,' at a closed correctional institution. The facility is planned to hold up to 1,300 undocumented immigrants awaiting deportation, adding capacity to the state's immigration enforcement efforts. The announcement comes as another controversial state-run immigration camp in the Everglades faces a legal challenge from environmental groups over its location and alleged inhumane conditions.</p>

While the price hike will not affect patients covered by the National Health Service, it highlights the complex global pricing strategies of drugmakers under political pressure to make medicines more affordable in the American market.</p>

This loss of confidence could lead to lower public participation in the surveys crucial for data collection, ultimately degrading the quality and reliability of economic reporting for everyone.</p>
