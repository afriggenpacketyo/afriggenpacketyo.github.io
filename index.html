          <p>United Airlines is reducing its schedule at Newark Liberty International Airport by 35 daily roundtrip flights after experiencing significant disruptions. CEO Scott Kirby cited air traffic controller staffing shortages and FAA technology problems as the cause. The cuts represent about 10% of United's daily schedule at Newark. Kirby criticized the FAA for understaffing the Newark facility and urged the agency to manage airport capacity more effectively. The airline is also advocating for investments in upgrading the aging air traffic control infrastructure.</p>

          <p>American consumers are beginning to feel the direct impact of the Trump administration's trade policies as a loophole on small, imported shipments from China closes. The de minimis provision, which allowed shipments under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, has been eliminated for goods from China and Hong Kong. This change is expected to lead to higher prices for consumers who rely on cheap goods from online Chinese retailers. The administration cited concerns about deceptive shipping practices and the flow of illicit substances as reasons for ending the exemption.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme Court to allow the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) access to Social Security Administration (SSA) systems. This appeal follows a lower court injunction limiting DOGE's access to personal information, citing Privacy Act concerns. The administration argues that restricting DOGE's access hinders efforts to eliminate waste and fraud in government. DOGE, led by Amy Gleason with input from Elon Musk, aims to modernize government systems and reduce costs, but faces legal challenges over data privacy and constitutional appointments.</p>

          <p>The 2025 English local election results reveal significant shifts in the political landscape. Reform UK made substantial gains, securing control of several councils and winning a by-election, while the Conservatives faced considerable losses. The Labour Party also experienced setbacks, prompting internal debate about future strategies. The Liberal Democrats and Greens saw gains, indicating a fragmentation of the traditional two-party system. The results suggest that voters are seeking change, and the party that can effectively position itself as the agent of change will likely succeed.</p>
