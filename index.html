          <p>China is reportedly considering lifting sanctions on several Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) as part of a broader diplomatic effort to improve relations with the EU, particularly in the face of trade uncertainties stemming from President Trump's tariff policies. These sanctions, imposed in 2021 in response to EU restrictions over human rights concerns in Xinjiang, have been a major obstacle to trade and investment discussions. While some sanctioned MEPs remain skeptical, experts suggest this move could signal a potential detente ahead of a planned EU-China summit, although significant hurdles remain due to China's ties with Russia and ongoing concerns over human rights.

          <p>MSNBC reported that President Trump's approval rating is declining, particularly on economic issues, with some Trump voters turning against him. Polls indicate that his handling of the economy is viewed unfavorably after weeks of economic instability triggered by tariffs and trade wars. Analysts suggest that the economic consequences of Trump's policies are alienating swing voters. Optimism score: 30</p>
