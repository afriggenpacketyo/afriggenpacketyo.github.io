Demonstrators voiced grievances over various administration policies, including government downsizing and immigration actions, with some invoking the spirit of the American Revolution. The protests, organized under the banner "50501," reflect ongoing opposition to the administration's agenda, though polling suggests Trump's approval rating remains relatively stable compared to his first term, with some decline in economic approval.</p>

            <p>Two Pentagon officials, Dan Caldwell and Dan Selnick, were fired amid a sweeping leak investigation initiated by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's chief of staff, Joe Kasper. The officials, who were suspended earlier in the week, expressed disappointment and denied any wrongdoing, while another official, Colin Carroll, was also placed on administrative leave. The investigation, which includes the potential use of polygraph tests, is reportedly looking into multiple unauthorized disclosures, as discussions about suspending more officials continue.</p>

            <p>An Indonesian student, Aditya Wahyu Harsono, was detained by ICE after his student visa was secretly revoked, and an immigration judge ruled his case can proceed. Harsono, a supply-chain manager and father of a child with special needs, was arrested at his workplace, with his attorney arguing that the visa revocation was unjust and the charges are not deportable offenses. This case is part of a wave of student visas being revoked under the Trump administration's policies, leaving hundreds of scholars at risk of detention and deportation.</p>
