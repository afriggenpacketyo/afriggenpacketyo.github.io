          <h2>New Study Reveals Lifestyle Changes Can Improve Cognitive Function in Older Adults</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 14:44:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major two-year study involving over 2,100 older Americans provides strong evidence that a combination of diet, exercise, and cognitive training can significantly enhance thinking and memory. Participants in the intensive program, known as the POINTER study, demonstrated cognitive function scores comparable to individuals one to two years younger. These findings, presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference, suggest that such lifestyle interventions can effectively slow the cognitive declines typically associated with aging. Researchers and health organizations are now focused on translating these results into accessible community programs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a visit to Great Britain, former President Donald Trump announced a new, accelerated timeline for a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, demanding a deal within "10 or 12 days." This statement reflects a shift from his previously more conciliatory stance and follows recent stalled diplomatic talks in Istanbul. Trump expressed disappointment with Vladimir Putin's recent actions, citing rocket attacks on Ukrainian cities. The new deadline is accompanied by threats of further sanctions and a recent agreement for European allies to supply additional advanced weaponry to Ukraine.</p>

          <p>According to sources familiar with forthcoming declassified intelligence, U.S. intelligence agencies possessed information from foreign sources predicting the FBI's involvement in promoting the Trump-Russia collusion narrative before the Crossfire Hurricane investigation began. The intelligence allegedly stemmed from a plan by Hillary Clinton's campaign to link Donald Trump to Russia. This information was reportedly shared with top officials, including then-CIA Director John Brennan and FBI Director James Comey, in July 2016. The release of a classified annex to the Durham report is expected to provide more details on these claims.</p>

          <p>Illinois Congresswoman Delia Ramirez is requesting a congressional hearing into the use of U.S. funds to detain immigrants at El Salvador's controversial Cecot megaprison. The request follows reports of severe human rights abuses, including torture and sexual assault, against nearly 300 Venezuelan immigrants sent there by the U.S. government. The men were recently released in a prisoner swap. Ramirez expressed concern that taxpayer dollars may have funded these violations under a secretive deal between the Trump administration and Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, whose government has faced scrutiny for its hardline anti-gang policies.</p>

          <p>A new tariff simulation model forecasts that U.S. imports from China could plummet by $485 billion by 2027 due to ongoing trade tensions and high tariffs. The forecast, based on current tariff rates of 51% on Chinese goods, suggests a significant reconfiguration of global trade, with countries like Vietnam and South Korea also seeing declines in their exports to the U.S. Conversely, the model predicts increased U.S. imports from Canada and Mexico. The analysis also indicates that U.S. exports to China will fall, with key sectors like soybeans and integrated circuits being heavily impacted. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new United Nations report reveals that over 2.3 billion people worldwide face moderate to severe food insecurity, with 673.2 million being undernourished. While global hunger levels have slowly decreased since 2022, they remain above pre-pandemic figures, and rising food costs have made healthy diets unaffordable for many more people. The report highlights stark regional inequalities, with Africa being the most affected, where one in five people are undernourished. Gender disparity is also a significant factor, as women globally experience higher rates of food insecurity compared to men, particularly in Latin America.</p>

An internal memo revealed that of the 1.89 billion data pulls in June, only 13% were initiated by customers for active transactions, with the rest being for data harvesting or product improvement. The bank claims this surge in API calls increases operational costs and is linked to higher fraud rates in electronic transactions.

This transformation is driven by the increasing frequency and intensity of natural disasters, such as the series of hurricanes and storms that devastated areas like Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, five years ago. The article suggests a shift in how the federal government, often personified by FEMA, responds to and funds recovery efforts in disaster-stricken regions. The goal is to create a more efficient and effective framework for rebuilding communities impacted by catastrophic events, moving beyond traditional models of assistance.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is proceeding with a plan to incinerate $9.7 million worth of taxpayer-funded contraceptives originally intended for women in low-income countries. This move follows the Trump administration's dismantling of USAID and a freeze on foreign aid. Several humanitarian organizations, including Doctors Without Borders and the UN, offered to purchase and distribute the supplies, but their offers were rejected, with the U.S. government citing the "Mexico City Policy." Critics, including U.S. lawmakers, argue the destruction is wasteful and will endanger lives by preventing access to essential family planning services.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies star Bryce Harper reportedly engaged in a heated, profanity-laced confrontation with MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred during a recent clubhouse meeting.

Harper allegedly told the commissioner to leave if he intended to discuss it, leading to a tense back-and-forth.

          <p>Leaders from Germany and France have responded negatively to the new trade agreement reached between the European Union and the United States. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned the deal would damage his country's finances, while French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou described it as an act of "submission." The agreement sets a 15% tariff on most EU exports to the U.S. in exchange for increased European purchases of American energy. While the deal averts a threatened 30% tariff, the downbeat reaction across the bloc suggests many feel the EU conceded too much to avoid a full-blown trade war with the Trump administration.</p>

Buttigieg used the Department of Education and USAID as examples, suggesting that these agencies were not perfect in 2024 and require rethinking, not just rebuilding. He advocated for a politics of courage to counter what he described as a rising politics of fear.</p>

          <p>For the first time, two prominent Israeli human rights organizations, B'Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights-Israel, have accused their own country of committing genocide in Gaza. In separate reports, the groups argue that Israel's military policies, statements from senior officials, and the systematic destruction of Gaza's health system meet the criteria for genocide under international law. This shatters a significant taboo within Israeli society, where such accusations are often dismissed as antisemitic. The groups, which are considered part of Israel's political fringe, hope their stance will force a domestic reckoning with the reality of the war.</p>

The talks began with President Trump imposing steep tariffs on steel, aluminum, and autos, prompting the EU to prepare countermeasures. Trump's tariff threats escalated from 20% to as high as 50% before he agreed to several delays to allow for negotiations. After months of tense discussions and internal EU division, the two sides reached an agreement for a 15% baseline tariff, narrowly averting a full-scale trade war that many feared would destabilize the global economy.</p>

For example, the UK's lower 10% tariff on cars is limited by a quota, after which a much higher 25% tariff applies.

In a discussion with Andrew Huberman, Norton explained that research indicates obese individuals who lose more weight early are more likely to maintain the loss long-term. This is partly due to a psychological "buy-in" effect from seeing early results. He clarified that the more body fat a person has, the more aggressively they can cut calories without risking significant muscle loss. However, this approach is not recommended for those who are already lean.</p>
