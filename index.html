        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is reportedly finalizing a deal to sign Dutch international Xavi Simons from RB Leipzig for approximately £51.8 million. The 22-year-old attacker, a product of Barcelona's renowned La Masia academy, has purportedly completed a medical ahead of the move. Simons gained prominence with impressive loan spells at PSV and Leipzig after leaving Paris St-Germain, showcasing his versatility on either wing or as an attacking midfielder. This transfer marks another significant Premier League acquisition from RB Leipzig this summer, following Benjamin Sesko's move to Manchester United.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's government has sharply reduced its 2025 economic growth forecast from 3% down to 1.4%, citing weaker performance expectations for pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk. The company, known for its popular weight-loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, is facing increased competition and reduced U.S. exports after a surge in late 2024. The economy ministry also noted that potential U.S. tariffs and statistical revisions contributed to the significant downward adjustment. Despite the lowered forecast, the ministry emphasized that the Danish economy remains fundamentally strong with high employment and low inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

The government plans to continue subsidizing companies' access to computing power and pilot consumer subsidies for AI products to encourage adoption.

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent her removal from the central bank's board. Trump attempted to fire Cook, whose term runs until 2038, based on an ally's allegation that she made an error on a past mortgage application. Cook's lawyers argue the dismissal is illegal and pretextual, stating the president lacks the authority to remove a governor without proper cause. The lawsuit represents a significant legal challenge to the president's efforts to exert political control over the traditionally independent Federal Reserve.</p>

          <p>Following a five-set loss to Daniel Altmaier in the second round of the US Open, a frustrated Stefanos Tsitsipas confronted his opponent about his use of underarm serves. After the match, Tsitsipas warned Altmaier not to be surprised if he hits him with the ball in the future for using the tactic, implying he had already targeted his body. The German player deployed the legal but unconventional serve while rallying in the fourth set of the four-hour, 26-minute contest. The defeat means Tsitsipas will end a season without reaching the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time since 2017.</p>

          <p>Starting in January, the NHS will offer a free chickenpox vaccine to all young children in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The vaccine will be administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab. This public health initiative aims to protect children from the varicella virus and its rare but severe complications, while also saving parents from taking time off work to care for sick children. Until now, the vaccine was only available privately at a significant cost, and the UK had lagged behind other countries like the US in offering it publicly.</p>

However, the CCN has since updated its analysis, which now suggests that some reorganization scenarios could result in no savings or even cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds.
