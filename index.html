          <p>Twenty-four-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic advanced to the US Open fourth round, defeating Britain's Cameron Norrie 6-4 6-7 (3-7) 6-2 6-3 in a nearly three-hour contest. Djokovic battled a lower back injury, requiring medical time-outs, yet demonstrated remarkable resilience and an improved serve, ultimately ending British singles interest in the tournament. Norrie, reflecting on his performance, admitted to being "a little overconfident" after an early break in the third set but acknowledged Djokovic's ability to elevate his game when it mattered most. This article highlights the Serb's enduring dominance and Norrie's positive perspective on his career trajectory despite the loss, noting the challenging conditions and Djokovic's strategic play.</p>

          <p>South Korea has indicted former First Lady Kim Keon Hee, wife of ex-President Yoon Suk Yeol, on charges including bribery and market manipulation, alleging over 1 billion won (approximately $720,000) in criminal proceeds. The accusations detail a stock manipulation scheme from 2010-2012 and the illicit receipt of opinion poll data and bribes from the Unification Church in 2022. These legal actions follow her husband's impeachment and arrest earlier this year for insurrection over a brief martial law declaration, indicating a period of significant political upheaval. The article highlights a complex and high-profile political scandal, revealing ongoing investigations into the former administration and its associates.</p>

This article reports two people were killed in previous overnight attacks, highlighting the escalating conflict as Russian troops had reportedly entered the region earlier in the week, despite Dnipropetrovsk not being among the five regions claimed by Moscow. The ongoing situation underscores the continued intensity of the war, with top EU diplomats discussing military training within Ukraine and the US reiterating calls for peace negotiations amidst the persistent hostilities.</p>

          <p>Japan is set to deploy the US-made Typhon missile system for the first time during joint military exercises with the United States next month, a strategic move widely seen as a significant signal against Beijing, especially concerning a potential conflict over Taiwan. China's foreign ministry strongly criticized the deployment, stating it would "further undermine the legitimate security interests of other countries" and urged both the US and Japan not to introduce the system. The system is expected to be withdrawn after the drills at the US Iwakuni base, but this article highlights escalating military tensions and geopolitical posturing in the Indo-Pacific region, raising regional security concerns.</p>

          <p>California and Texas are at the forefront of an intense national political battle over congressional redistricting, a process that significantly impacts the balance of power in Washington D.C. After Texas Republicans redrew maps to gain five congressional seats, California Democrats retaliated by voting to redraw their own districts to offset these gains. This "political arms race" is rapidly spreading to other states, with President Trump urging Republican-controlled statehouses to gerrymander districts to maintain GOP control of Congress. The article explains the legalities and partisan motivations behind these mid-decade redistricting efforts, highlighting the high stakes for the upcoming midterm elections and potential for further legal challenges.</p>

          <p>Millions of dollars in political TV ads are set to air in California for a November ballot measure, Prop. 50, aimed at redrawing congressional districts to favor Democrats and counter the Trump administration's agenda. This article highlights the intense financial battle, with opposition groups booking over $10 million in airtime and supporters aggressively securing more, indicating a costly campaign. The mid-decade redistricting effort, initiated by Governor Gavin Newsom to offset Republican gains in Texas, is a key part of a national "arms race" to control the U.S. House of Representatives in the upcoming midterm elections, challenging the state's independent redistricting commission.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump canceled $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid funding for 15 international programs, informing House Speaker Mike Johnson of the decision and asserting an "AMERICA FIRST!" stance. The White House justified the move as a "pocket rescission," a rarely used procedure that bypasses congressional approval. Democrats and some Republicans, including Senator Susan Collins, criticized it as an illegal tactic that undermines Congress's constitutional power over spending and increases the likelihood of a federal government shutdown. This article highlights a contentious executive action that could further diminish USAID's global humanitarian efforts and intensify political gridlock.</p>

          <p>New findings by Tennessee authorities allege that late sheriff Buford Pusser, the inspiration for the "Walking Tall" movies, killed his wife Pauline in 1967 and fabricated a story of her murder by his enemies. Investigators found evidence inconsistent with Pusser's original account, including the likelihood that Pauline was shot outside the car and signs of domestic violence, contradicting the long-held narrative. This article reveals a shocking re-evaluation of a celebrated law enforcement figure, aiming to provide dignity and closure to Pauline's family and correct historical inaccuracies.

          <p>A new study from Stanford Medicine, published in JAMA Network Open, indicates that young children aged 3 to 5 diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are frequently prescribed medication too quickly, often before behavioral interventions are attempted. The study found that 68% of these children received medication before age seven, with 42% prescribed drugs within 30 days of diagnosis. This article highlights concerns from experts about the high rate of early medication, citing potential side effects like irritability and the importance of starting with less harmful behavioral strategies, as recommended by clinical guidelines.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that many of President Trump's sweeping import taxes, justified by national emergency declarations, exceeded his authority under federal economic emergency laws. While the ruling does not immediately block the tariffs, it largely upholds a lower court's decision, marking a significant blow to Trump's signature trade strategy. This article details the court's reasoning, emphasizing that Congress holds core power over tariffs and that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant unlimited presidential authority for such actions. The administration plans to appeal to the Supreme Court, with the ruling creating uncertainty for future trade policy and potentially impacting the U.S. Treasury.</p>
