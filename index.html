          <p>The White House announced new tariffs, increasing total levies on India to 50% due to its ongoing purchase of Russian oil. President Trump stated this action aligns with his threat to penalize countries supporting Russia's war efforts in Ukraine, emphasizing the urgent need to halt the conflict. India's Ministry of External Affairs strongly condemned the decision, asserting that their oil imports are based on market factors and are crucial for the energy security of 1.4 billion people. This significant economic pressure, which Russia has called "illegitimate," is implemented days before a U.S. deadline for Russia to agree to a peace deal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump voiced support for Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears, acknowledging her "tough race" against an opponent he described as "not very good." While offering support, Trump did not issue a "complete and total" endorsement, a common practice for some candidates. Earle-Sears, currently Virginia’s lieutenant governor, is facing an uphill battle against former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, with recent polls showing her trailing significantly despite serving alongside a popular governor.

The 48-year-old from New Jersey, who played softball at Hofstra University, has been a Minor League umpire since 2016 and previously worked MLB spring training games. This milestone follows similar gender barrier breaks in the NBA, NFL, and men's soccer World Cup, marking a significant step forward for inclusivity in professional sports.

          <p>Student loan borrowers pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) are encountering new challenges, including changes to eligibility criteria under a recent executive order and significant backlogs in repayment plan processing. President Trump's order aims to exclude borrowers employed by organizations involved in certain "illegal" activities, though the specifics remain unclear. Additionally, millions of borrowers transitioning from the defunct SAVE plan face delays in accessing new repayment options, and PSLF Buyback applications are also accumulating. Experts advise borrowers to maintain their current course, as changes cannot be retroactive for past qualifying employment.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA estimates that the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year caused over 400 additional deaths beyond the official count of 31. Researchers analyzed mortality data during the Palisades and Eaton fires, attributing the excess deaths to factors like increased exposure to poor air quality and interruptions in healthcare access. The findings underscore the need for improved mortality surveillance during climate-related emergencies and for further research into the long-term health impacts of wildfires. Similar studies on the Maui wildfires also revealed substantial heart, lung, and psychological health issues among affected adults.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin held a three-hour meeting with U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff in Moscow, described by both sides as "useful and constructive," focusing on the Ukraine crisis and potential U.S.-Russia cooperation. President Trump hailed "great progress" from the talks, which occurred days before his deadline for Russia to agree to a peace deal or face severe economic penalties. Despite diplomatic efforts, Russia continues its attacks on Ukraine, including a recent strike on Zaporizhzhia that killed two. Trump has also intensified pressure on India, imposing additional tariffs for its Russian oil purchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Reports indicate that Israeli Defense Forces Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir warned Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against a full takeover of the Gaza Strip, cautioning it would be like "walking into a trap" and could endanger remaining hostages. Defense Minister Israel Katz affirmed the military would execute government decisions despite concerns. Opposition leader Yair Lapid also called a full occupation "a very bad idea." This comes as Gaza's infrastructure lies in ruins after nearly two years of conflict, with ongoing humanitarian crises and stalled ceasefire negotiations, as the IDF prepares to expand combat operations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed "secondary tariffs" on countries trading with Russia, if a Ukraine ceasefire isn't met, could significantly impact the global economy, primarily by increasing energy prices. India has already faced an additional 25% tariff for buying Russian oil, raising its total import tax to 50%. This article explains that such tariffs aim to deter countries from financing Russia's war, but could lead to higher consumer prices for goods like iPhones. Experts warn of potential inflation and challenges in enforcing these sanctions, especially given Russia's methods for evasion and the complexities of trade with major partners like China and the EU.

          <p>Over 50 Democratic lawmakers in the Texas House of Representatives have fled the state to prevent a vote on redrawing political districts, a practice known as gerrymandering. This move aims to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass a measure that would benefit GOP candidates ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. President Trump has pressured Texas Republicans to redraw maps, despite redistricting typically occurring only after a census. While gerrymandering is legal, the Democrats' dramatic walkout highlights intense political conflict and concerns over the integrity of electoral processes.</p>

          <p>Italy has granted final approval for the controversial €13.5 billion project to build the world's longest suspension bridge, connecting Sicily to mainland Calabria across the Strait of Messina. Designed to withstand earthquakes, the 3.3km bridge aims to boost economic growth in Italy's impoverished south and could be completed by 2033. Despite Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's support, the project faces ongoing criticism regarding its cost, potential environmental damage, and fears of mafia infiltration. Further approvals from environmental agencies and the Court of Auditors are still required, and legal challenges from affected residents could cause delays.</p>
