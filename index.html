            <p>Before Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color barrier, he and his brother Mack formed deep bonds with Japanese American families in Pasadena, CA, during an era of restrictive housing covenants and anti-Japanese sentiment. These friendships extended to caring for homes while Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II and playing baseball together. The story highlights a legacy of quiet solidarity and neighborliness that is as enduring as Robinson's athletic achievements.</p>

            <p>Despite the short-term economic shock of President Trump's tariffs, Beijing believes the trade war with the US could accelerate China's technological advancement and domestic market integration. Chinese officials see the tariffs as a catalyst to strengthen innovation and build a fully integrated domestic economic circulation system. China has vowed to "fight until the end" and has matched each round of tariffs imposed by Washington.</p>

            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey indicates that President Trump's tariffs will not lead to a reshoring of supply chains to the U.S. Most companies believe it would double their costs and instead plan to relocate to lower-tariff countries. Cost is the top reason for not reshoring, followed by the challenge of finding skilled labor. The survey also reveals concerns about the Trump administration's consistency and its perceived bullying of corporate America. (not investment advice)</p>
