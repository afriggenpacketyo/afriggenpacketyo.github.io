        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass described a climate of pervasive fear in the city following the start of federal immigration raids, stating that many residents, including legal citizens, are afraid to leave their homes. In an interview, Bass criticized the tactics used by ICE agents, describing masked men in unmarked cars snatching people from the streets, which she likened to kidnappings. She argued these methods are unnecessary and harmful, affecting the city's workforce and culture, and contrasted them with the identifiable and accountable local police force. Bass also condemned the continued military presence in LA as a misuse of taxpayer money.</p>

          <p>Following his dominant four-shot victory at The Open Championship, Scottie Scheffler is drawing comparisons to golf legends like Tiger Woods from his peers. Fellow golfers Xander Schauffele and Rory McIlroy praised his consistent excellence over the past few years, with Schauffele calling him a "tough man to beat." Scheffler has now won four major titles in three years, and his performance at Royal Portrush was characterized by a calm and composed demeanor that left little doubt about the outcome. This win further solidifies his status as the world's number one golfer and raises questions about how many major championships he may ultimately secure.</p>

          <p>Despite winning his fourth major title at The Open, Scottie Scheffler played down his achievements, stating he doesn't consider himself to be anything special. He emphasized that his family and faith are more important than his success in golf, which he says does not fulfill the deepest desires of his heart. Scheffler also dismissed comparisons to Tiger Woods as "silly," noting he is only a quarter of the way to Woods's major championship total. The 29-year-old celebrated the victory with his wife and 14-month-old son, Bennett, expressing hope that his son will one day enjoy the game of golf as much as he does.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has refuted a Wall Street Journal report that claimed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent persuaded him not to fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The report suggested Bessent warned that such a move could destabilize financial markets and argued it was unnecessary as the Fed is expected to cut interest rates soon. In a social media post, Trump called the story untruthful, asserting that he understands the market better than anyone and that he is the one who explains things to others, not the other way around. This dispute comes amid increasing criticism of Powell from some of Trump's top allies.</p>

          <p>According to Palestinian health officials, Israeli military fire killed at least 94 Palestinians across Gaza on Sunday, with one of the deadliest incidents occurring in the north where dozens died while trying to get flour from a UN convoy. The Israel Defense Forces stated its troops fired warning shots to address an "immediate threat" from the crowd and disputed the casualty figures. The UN's World Food Programme condemned the violence, confirming its convoy encountered massive crowds of hungry civilians and came under fire. The event marks one of the deadliest days in recent months for Gazans seeking desperately needed humanitarian assistance.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has affirmed that August 1 is a firm deadline for new tariffs on imported goods to take effect, though he noted that negotiations with other countries can continue after that date. In a recent interview, Lutnick explained that smaller nations in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa will likely face a baseline tariff of 10%. However, larger economies will either need to open their markets to American businesses or face higher tariffs. This confirmation comes as the Trump administration continues to press its aggressive trade strategy to renegotiate deals with major partners.</p>
