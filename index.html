          <p>U.S. job openings fell to approximately 7.18 million in July, a level not consistently seen since the COVID-19 pandemic began, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This figure, the lowest since a brief dip in September 2024, came in below economists' expectations and has heightened concerns about a cooling labor market. Analysts interpret this data as a significant turning point, suggesting a "frozen" job market that could indicate broader economic weakening. The report precedes upcoming weekly jobless claims and the monthly jobs report, which will provide further insight. (not investment advice)</p>

Figma provided an optimistic forecast for the third quarter and the full year, projecting revenue above analyst consensus.

          <p>As the price of gold surged to a new all-time high of around $3,549 per ounce, the value of gold bars sold by retailers like Costco has significantly increased. An ounce of gold purchased a year ago for about $2,679 has seen an unrealized gain of over 32%, driven by investor uncertainty, inflation concerns, and geopolitical tensions. However, the article notes that realizing these profits involves deductions from dealer fees and taxes. The IRS classifies physical gold as a collectible, subjecting long-term gains to a tax rate of up to 28%, which can substantially reduce the final return for sellers. (not investment advice)</p>

The sale values the company at $500 billion, a significant increase from its $300 billion valuation earlier in the year. This transaction allows eligible current and former employees to sell a portion of their equity, providing liquidity without the pressure of an immediate public offering. Major investors, including SoftBank, Thrive Capital, and T. Rowe Price, are participating in the purchase. This move aligns with a trend among high-value tech startups to use secondary sales for employee retention and compensation.</p>

This stance creates a procedural roadblock for the administration's efforts to fill the seat, pending the outcome of the legal adjudication over the legality of her termination.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that persistent violent crime in Chicago, highlighted by dozens of shootings over Labor Day weekend, necessitates federal intervention by President Trump. The author criticizes Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson for refusing federal assistance and downplaying the severity of the city's public safety issues. Citing personal tragedy and crime statistics, the author contends that local Democratic leadership has failed and that deploying federal agents and the National Guard, similar to actions taken in Washington D.C., is essential to restore law and order and save lives.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has ruled that advanced DNA evidence from whole genome sequencing can be used in the trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann, a first for the state's court system. This decision is a significant victory for prosecutors, as the technology linked Heuermann and his family to hair strands found on the remains of six victims. The defense immediately challenged the ruling, arguing the lab that conducted the testing is not licensed in New York, with a decision on that challenge expected later this month. This case could revolutionize how forensic evidence from degraded samples is used in criminal investigations statewide.</p>

MFE plans to strengthen Munich as a media hub and produce more localized German content, aiming to build a pan-European competitor to streaming giants like Netflix.

          <p>Despite ongoing diplomatic talks and President Trump's repeated assertions that a peace deal is imminent, the war in Ukraine is likely to continue for a significant time. While both Russia and Ukraine have engaged in direct discussions, their core demands remain far apart, with Russia seeking territorial concessions and restrictions on Ukraine's sovereignty that Kyiv finds unacceptable. Experts suggest that Russian President Vladimir Putin may be participating in negotiations primarily to avoid further penalties from the U.S. rather than seeking a genuine resolution. The conflict's existential nature for Russian leadership and the logistical realities of a war of attrition suggest a negotiated end is not yet on the horizon.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has grown to an estimated $1.4 billion, the fifth-largest in the game's history, after 40 consecutive drawings without a winner. As players anticipate the next drawing, data analysis reveals how state taxes significantly impact the final take-home amount for winners. States with no income tax, such as Florida and Texas, offer the highest potential payout, while winners in high-tax states like New York would receive considerably less. The odds of winning the grand prize remain exceedingly low at 1 in 292.2 million. The article also details which numbers have been drawn most and least frequently in recent drawings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new survey from PwC forecasts that Americans will decrease their holiday spending by an average of 5% this year, the most significant drop since 2020. The average person is expected to spend $1,552 on gifts, travel, and entertainment, down from the previous year due to pressures from inflation and tariffs. Gen Z is projected to cut their budgets most sharply, by 23%, reflecting concerns about the job market and rising costs. This anticipated pullback could pose a challenge for retailers, who rely heavily on the holiday season, which typically accounts for nearly one-fifth of their total annual revenue.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants. The court ruled that the current situation does not constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion," which is the legal standard required to invoke the wartime law. The administration had used the act to deport hundreds of individuals accused of belonging to the Tren de Aragua gang. This ruling represents a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration strategy, though the government can still seek to remove the migrants under other legal authorities. The White House has indicated it will continue to fight the decision.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving wildfire, part of a complex of blazes ignited by lightning strikes, has destroyed multiple structures in Chinese Camp, a historic Gold Rush town in northern California. By Wednesday morning, the fires had spread across more than 12,400 acres with zero containment. Officials have not yet confirmed the extent of the damage to the town's historic buildings, which include a 19th-century post office and church. The fires are burning in rugged, remote terrain, complicating firefighting efforts as California continues to face a devastating wildfire season with months of high-risk conditions still ahead.</p>

          <p>A California man who had publicly appealed for help in finding his missing wife has been arrested and charged with her murder. Tyler McCain pleaded not guilty to killing Nikki Saelee McCain, who disappeared in May 2024. Prosecutors allege the murder was motivated, at least in part, by a desire to prevent her from testifying against him in a pending domestic violence case. Despite Nikki's body not being found, the district attorney stated there is "overwhelming evidence" of her death and his responsibility. The case marks the first time the county has pursued a murder prosecution without a body.</p>

          <p>Survivors of Jeffrey Epstein's abuse joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers outside the U.S. Capitol to demand the full release of the Justice Department's files on the convicted sex offender. In an emotional press conference, survivors shared their stories and supported a legislative effort to force the release of all records, with redactions only to protect victims and ongoing investigations. The push for transparency comes after the House Oversight Committee released over 30,000 documents, which critics argue are heavily redacted and mostly contain previously public information. President Trump dismissed the issue as a "Democrat hoax," a comment one survivor called on him to retract.</p>

The administration has defended the move as a good deal for taxpayers and a measure to safeguard national security. This investment is one of several recent instances of the administration taking direct equity stakes in private companies, a trend that has drawn criticism from fiscal conservatives.</p>

          <p>A new report from a Washington-based think tank argues that the U.S. should de-escalate its rhetoric regarding the threat of a mainland Chinese invasion of Taiwan. The authors contend that strategic, political, and military factors make such an attack unlikely and that Washington's current posture of "threat inflation" is counterproductive. This analysis comes as the U.S. Congress finalizes its annual defense bill, which includes measures aimed at countering China. The report challenges the prevailing narrative that an invasion is imminent, suggesting a reduction in defense investments based on that premise would be a more prudent approach.</p>
