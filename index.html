          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders issued a reminder to his players and staff to prioritize safety and good judgment during the Memorial Day holiday. Sanders cautioned his team to be mindful of their associations and to avoid jeopardizing their professional opportunities. This message follows cryptic posts by Sanders on X, where he addressed "false stories" without providing specific details. The article also touches on the criticism Sanders and his son, Shedeur, have faced, particularly after Shedeur's NFL draft position, and the father's support for his son amidst the negativity. The article emphasizes Sanders' desire to connect with younger generations and address any questions they may have directly.</p>

          <p>Volvo Cars, the Sweden-based automaker owned by China's Geely Holding, announced plans to reduce its workforce by approximately 3,000 positions as part of a major cost-cutting initiative.

The job cuts will primarily affect office-based roles in Sweden, representing about 15% of the company's total office-based employees.

          <p>The Japan Sumo Association's Yokozuna Deliberation Council unanimously recommended Onosato for promotion to yokozuna, sumo's highest rank, after he secured his second consecutive championship.

Onosato clinched the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament title with a 14-1 record, expressing his commitment to learning and understanding the role of a yokozuna.

          <p>Finland has summoned Russia's ambassador to address an alleged violation of Finnish airspace by two Russian military aircraft near Helsinki. This action has heightened tensions as Finland strengthens its integration with NATO and reinforces its defenses along its border with Russia. The suspected breach occurred off the coast of Porvoo, prompting an investigation by Finnish authorities. Since joining NATO in 2023, Finland has reported increased security threats and pledged to boost its defense readiness, while Moscow has repeatedly criticized Finland's NATO membership and warned of potential repercussions. In April, Finland announced plans to increase defense spending to at least 3% of GDP by 2029.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book titled "Original Sin" makes the claim that Joe Biden's aides allegedly planned for him to have a reduced role in a potential second term, with advisers taking on significant responsibilities. According to the book, a longtime Biden aide suggested the strategy was for Biden to "show proof of life every once in a while," allowing his aides to manage the country. The author, Alex Thompson, suggests this approach rationalized potentially undemocratic actions based on the belief that Donald Trump poses an existential threat to democracy. The book also alleges that Biden's declining mobility led to discussions about using a wheelchair during the campaign, which was ultimately deemed politically unfeasible.</p>

          <p>Jake Wood, the executive director of Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, resigned shortly before the program's launch, citing an inability to maintain neutrality and independence. This decision followed reports questioning the group's autonomy and connections with Israel. Wood stated he could not implement the aid plan while adhering to humanitarian principles. The foundation, tasked with distributing aid in Gaza using an Israeli-initiated plan, has faced criticism from aid agencies fearing it violates fundamental humanitarian principles. The New York Times reported the project's origins were conceived by Israeli officials and military officers, raising further concerns about its independence.</p>

          <p>Analysts are advising investors to prepare for ongoing volatility despite President Donald Trump's decision to postpone imposing 50% tariffs on the European Union. Trump's delay, following a call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, provides a brief respite but does not eliminate the potential for a trade war. Experts suggest the six-week window may not be sufficient to resolve all detailed issues, and uncertainty remains regarding the Trump administration's specific demands. The EU is reportedly taking a measured approach to negotiations, but the situation remains precarious, with potential implications for various sectors including tech and industrials (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Senior figures in British business report a chilling effect on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, with many being "rebranded" to avoid unwanted political attention. This shift comes amid a right-wing backlash against DEI efforts on both sides of the Atlantic. Organizations are reframing policies previously known as DEI in the US, and sometimes EDI (equality, diversity and inclusion) in the UK, to address inequalities without explicitly using those terms. Some companies, particularly US-headquartered firms, have scaled back commitments and are less keen to celebrate inclusion work publicly, leading to concerns that progress made in recent years is being undone.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns about democratic erosion in the United States, the country possesses several exceptional traits that protect it from a Trump-led assault on democracy. These include a robust network of advocacy groups, a powerful and independent judiciary, a constitutional system that makes executive preferences hard to entrench, a diverse and free private press, a federal system of government, and a uniquely speech-protective legal tradition. While these features may have trade-offs in ordinary times, they provide a clear advantage when democracy is under threat.

          <p>The article proposes a new kind of Memorial Day to honor the far greater number of civilians killed in war, arguing that current observances primarily focus on fallen soldiers. It highlights the historical shift from wars primarily affecting combatants to total wars that indiscriminately kill civilians. The author points to conflicts like World War I, World War II, and more recent conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, where civilian deaths have been staggering. The author suggests that honoring civilian deaths could show war for what it is: a waste.</p>

          <p>Five years after anti-police protests, there is growing momentum behind initiatives to address law enforcement officers' mental health. The killing of George Floyd in 2020 served as a catalyst, bringing the issue into the public eye and exacerbating existing mental health challenges among officers. Agencies are creating dedicated wellness units, and state legislatures are mandating and funding wellness initiatives. Programs include peer support teams, mental health debriefings, wellness rooms, and therapeutic programs with horses, aiming to reduce burnout and improve officers' well-being.</p>

Between Sunday evening and Monday morning, Russia launched 355 drones and nine cruise missiles against Ukraine.</p>

These actions, driven by a desire to please Fox viewers and online Maga mobs, are viewed as a threat to academic freedom and the rule of law.
