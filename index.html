          <h2>Novo Nordisk Shares Rise as Drugmaker Anticipates Wegovy Sales Recovery in 2025</h2>

          <p>Novo Nordisk shares experienced a jump after the company projected improved sales for its Wegovy weight loss drug in the latter half of the year, anticipating a decline in copycat compounded drugs. Despite reporting lower-than-expected first-quarter sales and a trimmed full-year sales growth forecast due to alternative versions impacting its U.S. market share, CEO Lars Fruergaard JÃ¸rgensen anticipates a rebound following the FDA's end to a drug shortage ruling. The company's first-quarter net profit exceeded expectations, driven by an 83% increase in Wegovy sales, although overall revenue slightly missed forecasts. Novo Nordisk now forecasts sales growth of 13% to 21% for 2025, adjusting from the earlier 16% to 24% projection.</p>

          <p>Oscar-winning actress Alicia Vikander is set to make her UK theatre debut in Ibsen's 'The Lady from the Sea' at London's Bridge Theatre, marking her return to the stage after 17 years. Vikander expresses her excitement and slight apprehension about returning to the stage as an adult, having grown up around theatre due to her mother's acting career. The play, adapted and directed by Simon Stone, will also star Andrew Lincoln and explores themes of choices, dreams, and the universal struggles women face. Vikander emphasizes the play's relevance to modern audiences, as it delves into timeless emotional and societal issues.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have unveiled a series of expansive policy measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), to stimulate economic growth amid escalating trade concerns. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) will lower the seven-day reverse repurchase rate by 10 basis points and reduce the RRR by 50 basis points, injecting substantial liquidity into the market. Additional measures include supporting financing for technology and real estate sectors, establishing a relending tool for consumption and elderly care, and lowering mortgage rates under the housing provident fund. While these measures aim to boost domestic credit demand, some analysts suggest their impact may be limited without further fiscal policy support.</p>

          <p>Kent International, a U.S. bicycle company, has been forced to halt imports from China due to tariffs, with the company facing import duties and tariffs totaling 181.47% on a recent shipment. The tariffs have significantly increased the cost of bicycle components, making it financially unviable to continue importing from China. The company has canceled new orders from China and has no plans to place new orders in May. The article notes that manufacturing and assembling bikes in the U.S. is not financially feasible, as the cost of producing components domestically is significantly higher than importing them.</p>

          <p>India conducted strikes on Pakistan following a terrorist attack in Kashmir, escalating the conflict between the two nuclear powers. The Indian government stated that its forces targeted nine sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, while Pakistani officials reported casualties and damage. News channels reported aircraft losses on both sides, though claims remain unconfirmed. This action marks a significant escalation as it extends beyond the disputed Kashmir region into Punjab Province, prompting warnings from global leaders about the potentially dire consequences if de-escalation fails.</p>

          <p>Indian markets have demonstrated resilience in the face of heightened tensions with Pakistan, with investors maintaining optimism about India's growth prospects. The market's positive reaction follows India's military operation targeting territory controlled by Pakistan.

Progress on trade talks with major partners, including a potential bilateral trade deal with the U.S., further bolsters market confidence. The article references historical precedents, such as the market's reaction to the Pulwama attack in 2019, to support the view that Indian assets will remain relatively stable despite geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>The Catholic Church has declared that priests will face excommunication if they comply with a new Washington state law mandating clergy to report confessions of child abuse to law enforcement. The Archdiocese of Seattle asserts that this law violates the seal of confession, a fundamental tenet of the Church. The Church maintains its commitment to protecting children and reporting child sexual abuse but argues that priests cannot adhere to the law if it requires divulging information obtained during confession. The U.S. Department of Justice has launched an investigation into the law, citing potential violations of First Amendment religious protections.</p>

          <p>American investment in European soccer clubs is on the rise, but this influx of capital could soon create a conflict of interest within the sport.

This situation sets up a reckoning between American investors with interests in European soccer and those invested in the domestic game. The article explores the various motivations behind American investment in European clubs, ranging from billionaire acquisitions to content-driven ownership, and the potential repercussions for the future of soccer in the United States.</p>

Merz secured 325 votes in the second round, surpassing the 316-vote threshold required in the 630-seat parliament.

The plan proposes banning new gas contracts with Russian suppliers by the end of 2025 and phasing out all remaining imports by 2027.

          <p>India and Pakistan appear closer to conflict after India launched missile strikes targeting what it said were terrorist camps inside Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Pakistan condemned the action as an "act of war," saying it caused civilian casualties and put its military on high alert. The attacks were in retaliation for an assault on April 22 in Indian-administered Kashmir, where militants killed at least 26 Indian tourists. China also warned both countries to exercise "maximum restraint."</p>

          <p>AMD projects a US$1.5 billion revenue loss due to U.S. restrictions on sales to China, overshadowing an otherwise optimistic outlook for 2025. This guidance stems from an export restriction imposed in April that targeted AMDâ€™s MI308 chips, impacting data center revenue. Despite this setback, CEO Lisa Su remains confident in overall demand for AI infrastructure and anticipates new chips to boost sales in the second half of the year. The company faces investor concerns about trade restrictions, tariffs, and competition with Nvidia in the AI chip market.</p>
