          <p>Charles Rangel, a prominent figure in New York politics and a former U.S. Congressman representing Harlem for 46 years, has passed away at the age of 94. Rangel, a Korean War veteran and founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, was known for his advocacy for affordable housing, urban revitalization, and fair tax policies. Throughout his career, Rangel served as the first Black chair of the House Ways and Means Committee and played a key role in the creation of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone Development Corporation, contributing to Harlem's economic development. He was also the last surviving member of Harlem's "Gang of Four," a coalition of influential Black political figures.</p>

          <p>Israel is facing increasing diplomatic isolation as key allies express growing impatience with its military actions in Gaza. President Trump has called for a swift end to the conflict, while Germany's chancellor criticized the suffering inflicted on the civilian population. Britain, Canada, and France have also voiced strong concerns, with Britain suspending trade negotiations and France organizing a conference to discuss a Palestinian state. Despite these criticisms, these countries continue to support Israel through military, economic, and intelligence partnerships, but the shift in tone suggests a growing frustration with Prime Minister Netanyahu's policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) suggests that the official unemployment rate may not accurately reflect the state of the labor market. LISEP's "true rate" of unemployment, which stood at 24.3% in April, includes not only unemployed workers but also those seeking full-time employment and those in poverty-wage jobs. This measure seeks to capture nuances missed by official statistics, such as individuals struggling to make ends meet despite being employed. The report indicates that Hispanic, Black, and women workers are disproportionately affected by functional unemployment (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Former referees' boss Keith Hackett has criticized the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) for appointing Thomas Bramall, an inexperienced referee, to officiate Aston Villa's defeat by Manchester United. Villa complained to PGMOL about Bramall's "big mistake" in the 2-0 defeat, which contributed to them missing out on the Champions League. Hackett argued that a top referee like Michael Oliver should have been appointed instead, especially considering Oliver was operating VAR on another game.

          <p>President Trump has expressed rare criticism of President Putin's recent attacks in Ukraine, describing them as "absolutely CRAZY" following a weekend of intense bombardment on Ukrainian cities. Despite this criticism, Trump has declined to join European allies in imposing new financial sanctions on Russia or to offer additional aid to Ukraine. This decision creates a strategic void, where Trump acknowledges the ongoing violence but is unwilling to take concrete actions to penalize Putin. Experts suggest this pattern signals a continued pullback from the conflict, potentially emboldening Russia's aggression.</p>

The move has sparked controversy, raising questions about judicial independence and the protection of human rights.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are working with closer Tanner Scott to address recent struggles, particularly his tendency to leave pitches in the middle of the strike zone. Despite having good "stuff," Scott has been making mistakes that opponents are capitalizing on, leading to blown saves. The Dodgers' coaching staff is encouraging Scott to focus on locating pitches outside the zone to generate more swings and misses, even if it means issuing more walks. With several key relievers injured, Scott's performance is crucial for the Dodgers' bullpen stability.</p>

After paying move-in fees, they discovered the listing was fraudulent and they had no legal right to reside there. The incident highlights the increasing sophistication of rental scams and the importance of verifying listings and avoiding untraceable payment methods.

While some EU nations have reduced or suspended arms exports, a significant impact would require the US and Germany to join the embargo, which is unlikely given their strong diplomatic and military support for Israel.
