          <p>Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar is meeting with his German counterpart, Johann Wadephul, in Berlin, focusing on bilateral relations and Germany's continued arms support for Israel. The visit includes a wreath-laying ceremony at Berlin's Holocaust Memorial, and a joint press conference. The backdrop to the visit includes planned protests by human rights groups against Israel's actions in Gaza, and recent parliamentary disruptions related to displays of support for Palestine. Wadephul's commitment to arms deliveries follows earlier suggestions that such shipments depended on a review of Israel's compliance with international humanitarian law.

          <p>E-commerce giants Shein and Temu are experiencing a significant decrease in U.S. demand, attributed to President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports and the closure of the "de minimis" trade loophole. Daily active users (DAUs) for Temu dropped by 52% in May compared to March, while Shein's DAUs decreased by 25%. These declines are also reflected in lower monthly active users (MAUs) and a drop in their Apple App Store rankings. The reduction in user engagement coincides with a pullback in U.S. advertising spending by both platforms following the tariff announcements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Russia is attempting to re-establish a strategic alliance with China and India to counter the Western-led international order, but faces challenges due to existing distrust between the two Asian powers. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has criticized NATO's efforts to involve India in "anti-China" initiatives and expressed hope for the revival of the Russia-India-China (RIC) framework. Tensions stemming from the 2020 China-India border dispute have largely stalled bilateral ties, though a disengagement agreement was reached in October of last year. Russia has previously brokered meetings between Chinese and Indian officials and advocated for a leaders' summit to promote cooperation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of military force to the US-Mexico border, including armored vehicles and thousands of soldiers, is drawing scrutiny. The deployment is intended to stop what Trump describes as an "invasion," but declining border crossings raise questions about the necessity of such measures. The use of military force along the border is raising legal questions and concerns. The Posse Comitatus Act typically prevents the military from participating in law enforcement activities, but the Trump administration argues the military is patrolling its own bases and detaining trespassers.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into Joe Biden's actions during his presidency, alleging a "conspiracy" to conceal Biden's mental state. Trump claims Biden's aides used an autopen to sign executive actions, suggesting the public was shielded from the true decision-makers. Biden, who is battling advanced prostate cancer, has dismissed these claims as "ridiculous and false," asserting that he made all decisions during his presidency. The inquiry follows scrutiny over Biden's mental and physical capacity, fueled by a new book alleging a cover-up of his "physical deterioration" during his ill-fated re-election campaign.</p>

          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China should lead Pakistan's energy transition by promoting decentralized solar power, potentially creating a model for other countries in the Global South. The Renewables First report argues that China must choose between its coal-fired plants financed in Pakistan and its solar panels sold to the country, as both cannot succeed simultaneously. However, a Chinese energy scholar questions whether this vision is too expensive, while the report emphasizes the importance of developing indigenous manufacturing to mitigate rising global trade tensions. The increasing influx of cheap Chinese solar panels is undercutting demand for power from Chinese-financed coal plants, creating a cycle of stranded assets.</p>

          <p>Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, argues that President Trump's tariffs are disrupting the global trading system and weakening international relations. Raising tariffs undermines trade and destabilizes economic links, potentially leading to increased migration and political discontent. By disregarding free trade agreements and hindering the World Trade Organization, Trump's policies threaten the entire international rules-based order. The author concludes that these tariffs will make the world poorer and more dangerous by disrupting established trade relationships and potentially escalating geopolitical tensions.</p>
