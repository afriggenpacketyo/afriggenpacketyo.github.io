            <p>The Florida Gators secured their third NCAA men's basketball championship, defeating the Houston Cougars 65-63 after overcoming a double-digit deficit in a game that went down to the wire.

The game took place at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas. The Gators' resilience and clutch performance secured them the championship trophy.</p>

            <p>China's Commerce Ministry expressed strong opposition to President Trump's threat to impose an additional 50% tariff on U.S. imports from China, promising to take countermeasures to protect its interests. This escalation follows Trump's demand that China withdraw its 34% tariff on American products. China views the U.S. action as a mistake and insists it will fight to the end if the U.S. persists, further escalating trade tensions between the two economic giants. The back-and-forth tariffs could significantly impact both economies and global trade.</p>

            <p>A CNBC survey of CEOs reveals widespread concern about President Trump's tariffs, with a majority (69%) expecting a recession, many believing it will hit this year. The CEOs anticipate rising prices and potential job losses due to the tariffs, with some expressing anger and frustration over the administration's trade policies. Many are preparing for potential inflation scenarios and the possibility of consumer boycotts of American brands. The uncertainty surrounding the trade policies is causing businesses to downsize building plans and limit investment. (not investment advice)</p>

This shift could create opportunities for Hong Kong as a gateway between the world and mainland China. The reciprocal tariffs go against the idea of comparative advantage in trade between countries.

            <p>U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield, the only woman on NATO's military committee, was fired over the weekend by the Trump administration. Although no reason was given, officials said it was apparently tied to comments she has made that supported diversity in the force. Chatfield was on a list of senior military officers targeted as “woke” by the conservative American Accountability Foundation. She is the third top female officer to be fired since Trump took office.</p>

            <p>Budget carrier Avelo Airlines has signed an agreement to fly deportation flights from Arizona starting in May. The flights will be both domestic and international trips to support DHS’s deportation efforts. The decision may be controversial, according to the company. The domestic and international flights will be supported by three Boeing 737-800 planes and based at Mesa Gateway Airport. A local immigrant advocacy group is urging people to sign an online petition pledging to boycott the airline.</p>

            <p>New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham signed legislation to create a “turquoise alert” for missing Native Americans in the state. The effort responds to a troubling number of disappearances and killings in Indian Country. The “turquoise alert” system will allow law enforcement to quickly share information, functioning much like “amber” and “silver” alerts. Cellphone alerts will be issued when law enforcement finds evidence of imminent danger in the disappearance of a Native American.</p>

            <p>President Trump's approach to tariffs is creating uncertainty in the global economy, as nations respond in various ways. Some countries, like Israel, are attempting to negotiate deals to avoid tariffs, while others, like China, are retaliating with their own tariffs. Trump's insistence on "reciprocal" trade deals is reshaping international relations, with alliances depending on whether a country is giving the U.S. a good deal. The situation has led to volatile market conditions and concerns about the long-term impact on global trade.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration may use a wartime law to deport alleged members of a foreign crime gang, but only if they are given the right to challenge the government’s claim.

The ruling was a victory for Trump and setback for federal judges who sought to check the check the president’s power.</p>

            <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has temporarily paused a lower court's order that required the Trump administration to return a Maryland man who was mistakenly arrested and removed to El Salvador back to the U.S. The Justice Department had argued that the government does not have jurisdiction over the man anymore because he is in the custody of the Salvadoran government. The dispute over the man's removal sparked widespread attention and outrage after the Trump administration admitted in a court filing last week that his deportation to El Salvador was an "administrative error" and "oversight."</p>

Trump extended the deadline by 75 days, giving ByteDance more time to sell US assets of the short video app.</p>

The measure to allow new parents to vote remotely was introduced by Democratic Rep. Brittany Pettersen of Colorado in January.</p>
