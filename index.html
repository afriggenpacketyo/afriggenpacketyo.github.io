          <p>Hundreds of thousands are expected to attend Pope Francis's funeral in St Peter's Square, including numerous world leaders and dignitaries. Political figures such as Prince William, President Macron, and President Lula da Silva are confirmed to attend, with Trump also attending. The ceremony is viewed as a significant gathering of global leaders and an opportunity for potential diplomatic interactions, though formal meetings are not planned out of respect for the solemn occasion. The funeral presents a chance for leaders to pay their respects while also engaging in informal discussions on pressing global issues.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein who alleged she was sexually trafficked to Prince Andrew, has died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia. Her family confirmed her death, attributing it to the lifelong trauma of sexual abuse and sex trafficking. Giuffre was a vocal advocate for other victims, and her lawyer and representative have expressed their deep sorrow and admiration for her courage. Her death is being investigated but is not considered suspicious, and comes shortly after she posted about a car accident.</p>

          <p>The funeral of Pope Francis is drawing world leaders who may use the occasion for informal diplomatic interactions. While formal meetings are unlikely out of respect for the event, diplomats anticipate opportunities for casual conversations and relationship-building. Attention is focused on potential discussions between Presidents Trump and Zelensky regarding the Ukraine conflict, although tensions and seating arrangements may complicate direct engagement. The Vatican anticipates numerous delegations, including heads of state and monarchs, increasing the likelihood of diplomatic encounters during travel to and from Rome.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's actions against the press, including barring reporters and attempting to defund publicly funded media, are testing the limits of US press freedom. Courts have ruled against some of these actions, citing First Amendment protections, but experts warn that active defense of these freedoms is necessary. Concerns are rising about the potential chilling effect of Trump's targeting of law firms that represent those challenging his administration. These actions are seen as part of a broader strategy to control the public narrative and undermine independent reporting.</p>

          <p>The Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on single-sex spaces following a UK Supreme Court ruling that defines "woman" and "sex" as biological. The guidance states that transgender women should not be permitted to use women's facilities in places like hospitals, shops, and restaurants, and pupils who identify as trans girls should not be permitted to use the girls' toilet or changing facilities. The EHRC emphasizes that trans people should not be left without any facilities to use, and mixed-sex facilities should be provided where possible. A consultation is planned to seek views from affected stakeholders.</p>
