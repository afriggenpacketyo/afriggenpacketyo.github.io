          <h2>Golfer Phil Mickelson Criticizes Democratic Representatives' Remarks Following Charlie Kirk's Death</h2>

          <p>Professional golfer Phil Mickelson publicly criticized Democratic Representatives Ilhan Omar and Jasmine Crockett for what he termed "hateful rhetoric" following the assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk. He contrasted their statements with the message of forgiveness delivered by Kirk's widow, Erika, at her husband's memorial, which he praised as demonstrating "amazing strength, and amazing grace." The article highlights the sharply polarized political reactions to Kirk's death, with Omar defending her criticism of Kirk's legacy and Crockett pointing out that opposition to honoring him came primarily from lawmakers of color who were targeted by his rhetoric.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands attended a public memorial for conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Arizona, an event described as part political rally and part religious revival. Donald Trump delivered a speech that mixed eulogy with campaign commentary, while Vice President JD Vance characterized Kirk as a martyr for his faith. In a widely noted moment, Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, took the stage to announce that she forgives the man accused of assassinating her husband, emphasizing a message of love over hate in line with her Christian beliefs. The service underscored Kirk's significant influence within the MAGA movement and conservative youth politics.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region are poised for a mixed opening as investors await China's decision on its loan prime rates, which are widely expected to remain unchanged. This follows a strong week on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones and S&P 500 closed at record highs after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates. Futures for Japan's Nikkei 225 and Australia's ASX/S&P 200 indicate a higher open, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng is set to open flat. The market is currently pricing in two additional quarter-point rate cuts from the Fed before the end of the year.</p>

The victory was hard-fought, with the Chargers also losing running back Najee Harris to a potentially serious Achilles tendon injury during the game.</p>

          <p>In a coordinated diplomatic move, the governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia have officially recognized a Palestinian state. The leaders of the three nations stated the decision is intended to revive momentum for a two-state solution and is not a reward for Hamas, which they asserted can have no future role in governance. The announcement drew a sharp rebuke from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a "huge reward to terror" and vowed that a Palestinian state would not be established. This historic shift in policy from key Western allies aims to create a new path toward peace in the region.</p>

          <p>According to a child development expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, raising children with exceptional social skills is less about memorizing polite phrases and more about early environmental modeling. The article outlines nine key practices, including talking openly about feelings, modeling empathy, fostering authentic confidence, and teaching conflict resolution. Parents who validate their child's emotions and treat mistakes as learning opportunities help build a foundation of emotional safety. This approach enables children to develop the self-assurance and emotional intelligence necessary for healthy, real-world relationships.</p>

The government plans to offer voluntary skills and employment support to tens of thousands currently on sickness benefits without a requirement to seek employment. This initiative aims to fix a system McFadden describes as creating an "unhealthy" binary divide between those deemed fit for work and those who are not.</p>

          <p>On the island of Nantucket, a team of scientists is pioneering a novel approach to reduce the transmission of Lyme disease by genetically engineering wild white-footed mice, the primary carriers of the bacteria. Led by MIT's Kevin Esvelt, the "Mice Against Ticks" project uses CRISPR technology to make the mice immune to Lyme, thereby breaking the infection cycle where ticks feed on them. This heritable immunity would be passed down through generations, aiming to drastically reduce the number of infected ticks in the ecosystem.

          <p>A special "super generation" of monarch butterflies, born in late summer, undertakes an extraordinary 3,000-mile migration from the northern U.S. and Canada to a specific mountain forest in Mexico. These butterflies can live up to nine times longer than typical monarchs, conserving energy by suppressing their reproductive hormones for the arduous journey. Despite their resilience, the monarch population has declined by 70% in the last 30 years due to threats like habitat loss from illegal logging and the eradication of milkweed, their primary food source. Conservation efforts, including tagging programs and planting milkweed waystations, are underway to protect this mysterious and vital migration.</p>

          <p>After catching Mike Trout's 400th career home run ball, a fan named Alberto negotiated a unique return: in addition to signed memorabilia, he asked to play catch with the Angels superstar on the field. Trout happily obliged, creating a memorable moment for the fan and his family following the Angels' victory over the Colorado Rockies. The 485-foot home run made Trout the 59th MLB player to reach the 400-homer milestone and the 20th to do so with a single franchise. The heartwarming interaction highlighted a personal connection between a player and a fan over a historic baseball.</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals center fielder Jacob Young made two extraordinary defensive plays to secure a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets, damaging the Mets' playoff hopes. In the fifth inning, Young made a juggling, "hacky-sack" style catch with his foot to rob Brett Baty of extra bases. He followed up in the ninth inning with a leaping grab at the wall to take away a potential game-tying home run from Francisco Álvarez. The loss dropped the Mets into a tie with the Cincinnati Reds for the final National League wild-card spot, with the Reds holding the tiebreaker.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has stated he would support a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that freezes North Korea's nuclear weapons production as a realistic interim step. In an interview with the BBC, Lee argued that while complete denuclearization remains the ultimate goal, an "emergency measure" to halt the creation of 15-20 new nuclear weapons annually is a feasible alternative to the current diplomatic stalemate. He expressed hope that the mutual trust between Trump and Kim could be leveraged to resume talks that broke down in 2019, contributing to regional stability and global security.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has officially approved a £2.2 billion, privately-financed project to build a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport. The plan involves converting the airport's existing northern runway for regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 by the late 2030s. While the government touts the expansion as a "no-brainer for growth" that will create jobs, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups and local campaigners. Concerns about increased noise, traffic, and climate emissions have been central to the long-standing debate over the airport's expansion.</p>

          <p>A three-year-old mountain lion, known as F390, was struck and killed by a vehicle on State Route 74 in San Juan Capistrano, leaving her two 14-month-old cubs to fend for themselves. Researchers from the UC Davis California Carnivores Program, who were tracking the mother via a GPS collar, expressed concern for the adolescent cubs who are at a critical learning stage. The team has since successfully collared one of the cubs to monitor its survival.

          <p>A 93rd-minute goal from Gabriel Martinelli allowed Arsenal to salvage a 1-1 draw against Manchester City, dealing a blow to both teams' Premier League title ambitions.

The result leaves both teams trailing league leaders Liverpool, who now hold a five-point advantage at the top of the table. City's possession of 32.8% was the lowest ever recorded by a team managed by Guardiola in his league career.</p>
