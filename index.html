          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that faulty diagnostic machines from Trinity Biotech have produced inaccurate results, forcing at least 55,000 people in England to undergo new blood tests for diabetes. The errors have led to some patients being wrongly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and prescribed medication they did not need, causing significant stress and health issues. NHS England has confirmed that 16 hospital trusts used the affected machines and are now in the process of recalling patients for re-testing to correct any misdiagnoses.</p>

Biden was seen with a bandage on his head, prompting the announcement. This follows a previous procedure in February 2023 where a basal cell carcinoma was removed from his chest. His doctor stated at the time that all cancerous tissue was removed and that he would continue regular dermatologic surveillance as part of his ongoing healthcare.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC) is facing criticism for its apparent support of New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, a self-identified Democratic socialist. The DNC highlighted Mamdani's message of building a broad coalition, but this has drawn renewed attention to his past anti-Israel statements and far-left policy positions. While the DNC chair has described the party as a "big tent," key Democratic leaders have not yet endorsed Mamdani, reflecting internal divisions over his radical platform.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order to have the Pentagon use the secondary title of the "Department of War," its original name until 1947. The order will also designate the defense secretary as the "Secretary of War." The administration argues the name change conveys a stronger message of readiness and aligns with a broader effort to refocus the military on a "warrior ethos." Since this is a name change, it would require an amendment from Congress to be legally binding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice, under the Trump administration, has filed a lawsuit against the City of Boston and Mayor Michelle Wu, alleging their sanctuary city policies violate federal law. The suit claims Boston's refusal to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement endangers public safety. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the DOJ will act if Boston won't protect its citizens, specifically targeting the Boston Trust Act which limits the city's role in federal immigration matters. This action is part of a broader federal campaign against sanctuary cities nationwide.</p>

          <p>Nikesh Arora, CEO of cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, stated that enterprises are unlikely to adopt agentic AI browsers without robust security controls. While acknowledging the consumer appeal of AI agents that can autonomously perform tasks like booking flights, he warned that their need for user credentials and autonomy is at odds with corporate security protocols. Arora emphasized that credential theft is a primary cause of security breaches, highlighting his company's planned acquisition of identity security provider CyberArk to address these vulnerabilities.</p>

The administration argues that the FTC's modern powers are substantial enough that its members should serve at the president's will, challenging a 1935 Supreme Court precedent.

O'Neill stated he "had to get into them" during the interval, and the team responded immediately, with Shea Charles scoring just 25 seconds into the second half. A red card for a Luxembourg player helped solidify Northern Ireland's position, and Justin Devenny added a third goal to secure the crucial win.</p>

          <p>A strong, rotten-egg-like smell has been pervading the city of Gloucester, Massachusetts, with officials identifying the cause as a large amount of decaying invasive seaweed. The seaweed, a Japanese species called Heterosiphonia japonica, was pushed onto the shore and into an estuary by the high winds and rough surf of Hurricane Erin. As the seaweed decomposes without a strong tide to wash it back out, it releases a powerful odor that has alarmed residents. The red seaweed is known to spread aggressively and has been linked to fish die-offs in other areas.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates in September, savers are advised to act strategically to lock in the current high returns on certificates of deposit (CDs). This article suggests that individuals with significant funds, such as $10,000, should consider their options before rates decline further. Key recommendations include assessing whether to deposit more money to maximize interest, shopping directly with online banks which typically offer higher rates, and acting quickly as banks may lower their rates in anticipation of the Fed's decision. Taking these steps can help savers make the most of the current high-rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

Investigators now believe he also targeted another woman earlier the same day at a nearby MARTA station.

          <p>Daniel Levy, the longest-serving chairman in the Premier League, has ended his nearly 25-year tenure as the executive chairman of Tottenham Hotspur. While the official announcement stated he "stepped down," reports suggest the club's ownership made the decision in a bid for greater sporting success. During his time, Levy oversaw the construction of a new billion-pound stadium and the club won two trophies, but he was often a target of fan protests over a perceived lack of on-field achievement. The club's ownership, the Lewis family, will now implement a new leadership structure to guide Tottenham into a new era.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has paused a lower court's order that would have shut down the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades. The facility, built by the DeSantis administration to support President Trump's deportation efforts, can now continue to operate while a lawsuit from environmental groups proceeds. A district judge had previously ordered the facility to be wound down due to concerns about environmental damage and harsh conditions for detainees. However, the appellate panel ruled that the state was likely to succeed in its appeal, allowing the remote detention camp to stay open.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s recent Senate testimony suggests a significant shift from the more reassuring tone he adopted during his confirmation hearings. The Health and Human Services Secretary appeared combative and aggressively defended anti-vaccine talking points, clashing with senators from both parties who expressed alarm at his recent policy changes. This confrontational style, coupled with President Trump's apparent support, indicates Kennedy may feel politically secure in dismantling the U.S. vaccination system. The hearing has left lawmakers deeply concerned about the future of the nation's public health agencies under his leadership.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Chinese President Xi Jinping's call for a new global order centered on the Global South is a significant challenge to U.S. dominance in world politics. By advocating for "true multilateralism" and opposing "hegemonism," Beijing is tapping into widespread disillusionment among developing nations with Western-led institutions like the IMF and World Bank. For many countries, particularly in the Muslim world and the Middle East, aligning more closely with China offers economic relief and political leverage to reduce dependency on Washington. The piece suggests a paradigm shift is underway, as nations recalibrate their foreign policies in a changing geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have been on a downward trend throughout 2025, offering some relief to prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance. The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen by more than half a percentage point since January, from over 7% to around 6.50%. This decline, while not returning rates to the historic lows of a few years ago, translates into lower monthly payments and significant savings over the life of a loan. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut its key interest rate soon, there is potential for mortgage rates to fall even further. (not investment advice)</p>
