          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-13 20:21:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of children in the UK are experiencing emotionally based school avoidance (EBSA), a condition where attending school becomes too traumatic. The article shares the story of one mother whose autistic daughter suffered severe distress, leading to the family's difficult decision to remove her from formal schooling. School leaders report a significant post-pandemic spike in EBSA, particularly among students transitioning to secondary school, citing sensory overload and social media pressures as contributing factors. In response, some schools are creating specialized, more inclusive units and adopting a "support first" approach to address the underlying anxiety rather than punishing absences.</p>

          <p>A U.S. official confirmed that Coast Guard personnel aboard a Navy destroyer inspected a Venezuelan fishing boat for narcotics in what they state were international waters. The search followed a tip but yielded no illegal substances. This incident prompted a sharp rebuke from Venezuela's government, which claimed the U.S. deployed armed personnel to illegally occupy the civilian vessel for eight hours within its exclusive economic zone, calling it a "direct provocation." The event occurs amid heightened U.S. counter-narcotics operations in the region, which the Trump administration has recently expanded.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, authorities have taken 22-year-old Tyler Robinson into custody, revealing he lived with a transgender partner who is reportedly cooperating with the FBI. The national reaction has been immense, with Kirk's widow, Erika, vowing to expand his Turning Point USA movement and political figures from both parties condemning the violence. The event has sparked widespread discussion on political rhetoric, gun violence, and the future of the conservative youth movement. Community leaders in Utah have called for unity and respectful dialogue in the wake of the tragedy.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has accused the Trump administration of attempting an "end-run" around its legal duties to protect individuals fleeing persecution. The criticism follows the deportation of a group of non-Ghanaian African migrants to Ghana, a third country, with some now facing return to their home nations where they fear torture. Attorneys argue this action violates U.S. and international law, as the deportees have legal protections barring their removal to their countries of origin. The judge has ordered the government to explain how it will prevent these individuals from being sent to dangerous situations.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have approved a controversial bill designed to stabilize the state's energy market by permitting up to 2,000 new onshore oil wells annually in Kern County. The legislation, part of a deal brokered by state leaders, aims to counter rising gas prices and the planned closure of two refineries by boosting domestic production. However, the measure has angered environmental groups and progressive Democrats, who view it as a concession to the oil industry that undermines California's climate goals. The bill also includes provisions to tighten regulations on offshore drilling pipelines and extend the state's cap-and-trade program.</p>

          <p>On the television show "The View," co-host Whoopi Goldberg criticized the Democratic Party for its handling of concerns surrounding former President Joe Biden's age and fitness for office. Goldberg argued that Democrats should have addressed the issue "in-house" rather than allowing it to become a "public spectacle." Her comments were made during a discussion about an excerpt from former Vice President Kamala Harris's new book, in which Harris reportedly described Biden's decision to run again as "reckless." Goldberg contended that public infighting was detrimental and that the party mishandled the situation, contributing to the current political climate.</p>

          <p>In her first public remarks since the assassination of her husband, Erika Kirk delivered a tearful and defiant address, vowing that the conservative movement he built will not die. Standing next to his empty studio chair, she thanked first responders, supporters, and President Trump, and pledged that Turning Point USA's work would become "stronger, bolder, louder and greater than ever." She announced that the organization's campus tours and annual conference will continue as planned. Mrs. Kirk also shared a poignant story about explaining her husband's absence to their three-year-old daughter, stating he was on a "work trip with Jesus."</p>

          <p>A London rally organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, dubbed "Unite the Kingdom," descended into violence, resulting in injuries to 26 police officers, four of them seriously. The demonstration drew an unexpectedly large crowd, estimated between 110,000 and 150,000 people. Clashes erupted when some protesters threw bottles and other projectiles at police who were attempting to keep them separated from a smaller counter-protest. The Metropolitan Police described the violence as "wholly unacceptable" and have made at least 25 arrests for offenses including violent disorder and assault, with investigations ongoing to identify more individuals.</p>

          <p>According to leaked military planning documents, the Trump administration has drafted a proposal to deploy 1,000 Louisiana National Guard troops for law enforcement operations in the state's urban centers, including New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The plan, which would hinge on a request from the state's Republican governor, outlines a potential mobilization lasting until September 2026. Critics and some residents view the proposed deployment not as a genuine crime-fighting effort but as a political maneuver by an administration that has focused heavily on crime in Democratic-led cities. The Pentagon has not confirmed the plan, stating that leaked documents do not represent official policy.</p>

          <p>Glenn County, a rural community of 28,000 in Northern California, is set to lose its only hospital in October after a federal agency revoked its essential funding status. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services stripped Glenn Medical Center of its "critical access" designation, citing a reinterpretation of a rule that requires such hospitals to be at least 35 miles from the next nearest facility. The hospital claims it is short by only three miles according to the agency's new measurement. This decision will result in a 40% revenue loss, forcing the closure of its emergency room and inpatient services.</p>

          <p>A congressional staffer for Mexico's ruling Morena party has resigned after making controversial comments about the murder of U.S. conservative activist Charlie Kirk on a national news program. The staffer, Salvador Ramírez, suggested Kirk received "a spoonful of his own chocolate" due to his pro-gun stance. The remarks drew a sharp rebuke from a U.S. State Department official, who hinted at visa revocations for those who glorify violence. The television network, Milenio, issued a public apology, and Ramírez subsequently stepped down from his position, becoming one of several individuals to face professional consequences for commentary on Kirk's death.</p>

Israel has intensified its offensive in the area, which it describes as the last major stronghold for Hamas, and has been urging the hundreds of thousands of remaining Palestinian residents to evacuate. The strikes have destroyed multiple high-rise buildings, with one attack on a house in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood killing a family of ten.

The move is expected to allow refugees to become more self-sufficient, support their families, and stimulate the local economy.
