          <p>A section of Interstate 40 in the Great Smoky Mountains has been closed again due to heavy rain, flooding, and a rock slide. The incident occurred near mile marker 450 in Tennessee, close to the North Carolina border. Crews are working to clear the water and rock from the highway, but there is no estimated time for reopening. This section of I-40 had previously been heavily damaged by Hurricane Helene, and a permanent fix involving steel rods and concrete spraying is expected to take years to complete. The closure forces detours of dozens of miles, impacting truck traffic especially. The optimism score for this article is 20.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new guidance on assessing applications for oil and gas projects, requiring operators to consider emissions from burning oil and gas, not just production emissions. This decision follows a Supreme Court ruling and will impact projects like Rosebank and Jackdaw, which require fresh approval before extraction. Climate campaigners argue that new developments will barely affect the UK's reliance on imported fossil fuels. Energy Minister Michael Shanks said the guidance provides clarity for the North Sea oil and gas industry, while climate groups remain critical, stating projects like Rosebank are incompatible with climate commitments.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is urging further negotiations to de-escalate the Israel-Iran conflict, as President Trump weighs joining Israeli strikes. Conservative figures are calling for the UK to back the US if it attacks Iran, while Liberal Democrats are requesting the publication of any legal advice regarding UK involvement. Foreign Secretary David Lammy is meeting with US and EU counterparts, as well as Iran's foreign minister, to seek a diplomatic resolution.

          <p>Airbus is dominating the Paris Air Show with significant orders and new model announcements, while Boeing maintains a low profile amid ongoing challenges. Airbus has secured nearly $21 billion in orders, including deals with AviLease, ANA, and LOT, while Boeing has refrained from major promotional activities. The industry continues to face supply challenges, leaving airlines struggling to renew their aging fleets. Boeing's muted presence is attributed to past crises, including the 737-Max crashes and recent quality control issues. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>
