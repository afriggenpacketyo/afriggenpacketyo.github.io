        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the collapse of the French government after Prime Minister François Bayrou lost a confidence vote, concerns are mounting over the country's significant public debt. France's debt-to-GDP ratio is among the highest in the EU, and its large budget deficit has already led to higher borrowing costs in financial markets. Economists worry that continued political instability could hinder necessary fiscal reforms, potentially destabilizing the entire eurozone, though immediate contagion risk is currently seen as manageable. The situation is complicated by ongoing trade disputes and the rise of populist parties resistant to austerity measures. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has granted an interim request from the Trump administration, allowing for the temporary removal of Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Kelly Slaughter. The decision pauses a lower court's order that had reinstated Slaughter, who argued her firing violated the Federal Trade Commission Act's for-cause removal protections. This case is one of several where President Trump has removed appointees at independent agencies, challenging long-standing legal precedents regarding presidential authority. The Supreme Court will now take more time to consider the administration's request to fully lift the lower court's injunction while the legal challenge proceeds.</p>

          <p>North Carolina's Governor Josh Stein addressed the murder of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte train after facing significant public backlash for his initial silence. Surveillance footage of the brutal, random stabbing prompted widespread criticism, with many contrasting his delayed reaction to his previous statements on other high-profile cases. In his response, Stein called the act senseless and advocated for more police funding, which critics argued deflected responsibility from the justice system's failure to keep the suspect, a man with multiple prior arrests, off the streets. The incident has intensified the debate on public safety and criminal justice reform.</p>

          <p>Julie Gard Schnuelle, a 59-year-old retired Auburn University professor, was fatally stabbed while walking her dog in Kiesel Park, a large public space near the campus. Police discovered her body in a wooded area and determined her death was the result of an assault with a sharp object. A 28-year-old man, Harold Rashad Dabney, was arrested and charged with two counts of capital murder for both kidnapping and robbery. Authorities allege he stole Schnuelle's truck after the attack, and her dog was later found unharmed. Before her retirement, Schnuelle was a respected professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has permitted the continuation of large-scale immigration raids in Los Angeles, overturning a lower court's order that had restricted them. The 6-3 decision allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to resume stops that critics argue are unconstitutional, as they are sometimes based on factors like race or language. A federal judge had previously found a "mountain of evidence" that the raids violated constitutional rights against unreasonable seizures. The ruling is a significant development in the Trump administration's strategy of conducting mass deportations, which has led to civil unrest and legal challenges in cities with large immigrant populations.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has launched a sped-up process to elect a new deputy leader following the resignation of Angela Rayner. Nominations opened Tuesday, with a winner to be announced on October 25. Prominent party figure Baroness Harriet Harman has suggested the replacement should be a woman from outside London to complement the party's leadership and broaden its reach. The contest, which requires candidates to secure the backing of at least 80 MPs by Thursday, is expected to shape the future direction of the party on issues like workers' rights and public service investment.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has unanimously upheld the $83.3 million judgment awarded to writer E. Jean Carroll in her defamation case against Donald Trump. The court rejected Trump's arguments that the damages were excessive and that he was protected by presidential immunity, ruling that the jury's award was "fair and reasonable" given the facts. This decision affirms the second of two successful lawsuits Carroll brought against Trump, who was found liable for sexual abuse and defamation. Carroll's attorney expressed hope that this ruling would bring an end to the appellate process and deliver final justice.</p>

          <p>A survey by the New York Federal Reserve has revealed that American workers' confidence in their ability to find a new job has fallen to its lowest point since the survey began in 2013. The probability of finding new employment after a job loss dropped to 44.9% in August, a significant decline that signals a reversal of the "Great Resignation" trend. This sentiment aligns with recent data showing a dramatic slowdown in hiring and the first monthly job loss since 2020. The findings reflect growing economic uncertainty and a less favorable market for job seekers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The trial of Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to kill Donald Trump at his golf course, has begun with a challenging jury selection process. Routh, who is representing himself, was barred by Judge Aileen Cannon from asking potential jurors irrelevant and "politically charged" questions. Prosecutors allege Routh planned the attack for months, hiding in bushes with a rifle before being spotted by a Secret Service agent. Routh has pleaded not guilty to five criminal charges, including attempting to kill a presidential candidate, and faces a potential life sentence if convicted in the month-long trial.</p>

Republicans intend to allow votes on large groups of nominees at once, a move aimed at breaking a blockade that has left many government positions unfilled. Democrats have blocked nearly all of Trump's nominees, forcing time-consuming procedural votes for each one. While both parties have used obstruction tactics in the past, Republicans argue the current level of delay is unprecedented and necessitates altering the chamber's long-standing procedures.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals a significant ideological divide, with a majority of Democrats now holding a more positive view of socialism (66%) than capitalism (42%). While U.S. adults overall still favor capitalism, its popularity has declined since 2021, driven largely by shifting attitudes among Democrats and independents. The survey indicates a gradual but persistent trend over the last 15 years, particularly among Democrats under 50, who are much less likely to view capitalism favorably than they were in 2010. This shift reflects growing concerns about economic fairness and deepens the debate within the Democratic party.</p>
