          <p>Jimmy Kimmel returned to his late-night show after ABC's suspension, addressing the controversy surrounding his comments on Charlie Kirk's murder. He clarified that it was never his intention to make light of the tragedy or to blame any specific group for the actions of a deeply disturbed individual, though he understood how his remarks could have been perceived as ill-timed or unclear. Kimmel expressed his disagreement with ABC's decision to temporarily remove the show but thanked both supporters and those who, despite differing views, defended his right to free speech. The incident ignited a nationwide debate over free speech and censorship, with several major network affiliates continuing to preempt his show despite its return to ABC.</p>

          <p>Super Typhoon Ragasa, one of the strongest storms in years, has caused significant devastation across Asia, resulting in at least 14 deaths and 124 people missing in eastern Taiwan due to a lake burst and subsequent torrents of mud and water. The typhoon also lashed Hong Kong with winds up to 195 kph, causing at least 13 injuries, suspending flights, schools, and train services, and damaging infrastructure. Authorities in southern China's Guangdong province have relocated over a million people and ordered businesses and schools to shut down as the storm is forecast to make landfall. The storm previously caused three deaths and displaced thousands in the northern Philippines, underscoring its widespread destructive impact across the region.</p>

Ong previously held professorships at National Taiwan University, the University of Malaya, and the University of Central Florida. Six years ago, he publicly observed a "talent outflow" from Taiwan, expressing a hope for talent retention on the island. His departure underscores the ongoing trend of highly skilled professionals moving from Taiwan to mainland China, contributing to discussions about academic and scientific talent migration in the region.</p>

          <p>Datong, a city in Shanxi province, successfully averted disaster during heavy summer rains, despite almost 20 hours of upstream flood discharges, thanks to proactive infrastructure development. Over 15 years ago, former mayor Geng Yanbo spearheaded a project to widen the city’s main waterway and reinforce its banks, an initiative initially met with skepticism due to the region's low rainfall. This article highlights how this foresight proved critical, prompting discussions on the importance of long-term investment in disaster prevention. Economists suggest such spending not only enhances urban resilience but also serves as an effective short-term economic stimulus, exemplified by Beijing's recent issuance of 1 trillion yuan in sovereign debt for disaster relief.</p>

She was renowned for her sultry gaze and became a muse for acclaimed filmmakers Luchino Visconti and Federico Fellini, gracing the screen alongside stars like Marcello Mastroianni, Burt Lancaster, Alain Delon, and Henry Fonda. Her illustrious career, which began after winning a beauty contest that took her to the Venice Film Festival, left an indelible mark on European and Hollywood cinema throughout the 1960s and 1970s.</p>

          <p>Camp Mystic, a Texas summer camp, plans to reopen next summer, a year after devastating floods along the Guadalupe River swept away 27 girls and counselors. The camp's reopening will adhere to new safety legislation, successfully championed by victims' parents, which prohibits cabins in dangerous flood zones and mandates detailed emergency plans, staff training, and emergency warning systems. A memorial will also be constructed to honor those lost in the tragedy, which was part of wider destructive flooding that claimed at least 136 lives across Texas. While the original 99-year-old Camp Mystic Guadalupe remains too damaged, its sister site, Camp Mystic Cypress Lake, is set to resume operations next summer.</p>

Experts also refuted his claims about Amish children not developing autism due to lack of vaccines, the exaggerated number of vaccines children receive, and the suggestion to delay the Hepatitis B vaccine for newborns.

The investigation began when Cesium-137 was detected in imported shrimp from Indonesia, though no illnesses have been reported so far.

          <p>China's successive five-year plans have been instrumental in transforming its economy from limited industrial capacity to a global manufacturing powerhouse, despite its shift away from a command economy. Since 1953, 14 such plans have guided the country's economic trajectory, earning it the title "world's factory." Beijing is now focusing on moving up the value chain to become a global hub for innovation in cutting-edge sectors, with the upcoming 15th five-year plan expected to continue this strategic direction. These foundational documents offer a comprehensive survey of China's long and complex economic history, illustrating its remarkable industrialization and modernization journey.

          <p>The U.S. Air Force plans to replace its C-17A Globemaster III and C-5M Galaxy cargo planes with a single Next Generation Airlift (NGAL) platform by the mid-2040s. The new aircraft will prioritize greater speed, operational flexibility, and enhanced defensive capabilities against evolving threats in the air and on the ground. Air Mobility Command head Gen. John Lamontagne emphasized the need for quicker refueling times and effective countermeasures, as current airlifters face increasing risks. While the C-17 and C-5 have served for decades, the Air Force aims to proactively recapitalize these aging fleets to maintain strategic airlift superiority.</p>

          <p>Nexstar Media announced it will continue to preempt "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its ABC-affiliated stations, even after the show's return to ABC following a week-long suspension. This decision mirrors Sinclair's similar stance, meaning dozens of ABC stations nationwide will not broadcast Kimmel's show. Nexstar stated it would "monitor the show" and stands by its decision to ensure an environment of "respectful, constructive dialogue." The corporation has a pending $6.2 billion acquisition of Tegna, requiring FCC approval, which adds a regulatory dimension to its decision. Nexstar emphasizes its stations will focus on local news and programming while Kimmel's show remains available on Disney streaming platforms.</p>

          <p>International health experts have strongly rejected President Trump's and RFK Jr.'s claims linking acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy to an increased risk of autism in children. The European Medicines Agency, UK's MHRA, and Australian health authorities all stated there is no new or robust scientific evidence to support such a causal link. Spain's Minister of Health criticized Trump for spreading misinformation, referencing his past controversial health remarks. The World Health Organization also noted inconsistent evidence. These organizations reiterate that paracetamol remains a safe and important option for pregnant women to treat pain and fever, emphasizing evidence-based medical advice.</p>

          <p>Ryan Routh was found guilty by a Florida jury on all five charges, including attempted assassination of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and assaulting a federal officer. Routh, who represented himself, reportedly attempted to harm himself with a pen after the verdict was read, prompting US marshals to intervene. Prosecutors detailed Routh's weeks-long plot to kill Trump, including aiming a loaded rifle at a Secret Service agent and attempts to acquire an anti-aircraft weapon. This conviction marks the second assassination attempt against Trump in 2024, underscoring the serious threat of political violence. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated the verdict sends a clear message against such acts, with Routh facing a potential life sentence.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump returned to the United Nations General Assembly, seven years after being mocked, now asserting a transformed relationship with the world. His speech underscored an "America First" doctrine, challenging the post-WWII global order, criticizing climate change as a "con job," and advocating for individual nations' sovereignty. Trump boasted of ending seven wars, despite disputes, and unexpectedly shifted his stance on Ukraine, suggesting it could reclaim all territory while emphasizing NATO and EU support. He also criticized allies, cut UN funding, and recounted escalator and teleprompter mishaps, reflecting his transactional approach and disdain for multilateral institutions.</p>

          <p>Greece's "Watergate"-like spyware scandal has deepened, with four individuals – two Israelis and two Greeks – appearing in court on misdemeanor charges related to marketing Predator spy software. The software allegedly targeted mobile phones of government ministers, military officers, judges, and journalists. The scandal broke in 2022 when MEP Nikos Androulakis discovered he was tracked by both Predator and Greece's National Intelligence Service (EYP), which was under the Prime Minister's direct supervision. Critics accuse the government of a cover-up, as no officials have been charged despite evidence of dual surveillance and the government's controversial new law legalizing state security use of surveillance software under strict conditions.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young people in the UK are unable to move out of their parents' homes due to rising living costs, leading to a "lost opportunity" for independence. Leoni Clancey, 21, returned home after nine months, her savings depleted by utilities, council tax, and rent. Research from the Skipton Group indicates that nearly 98% of young adults living with parents cannot afford average first-time buyer homes, with nine out of ten facing housing costs consuming nearly half their income. This trend highlights the financial strain on youth and the broader societal impact, including on parents' ability to downsize. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tyrique George, a 19-year-old Chelsea forward, has seized a first-team lifeline with a starring performance in a Carabao Cup comeback victory against Lincoln City, after a potential £22m move to Fulham fell through. Playing out of position as a lone striker, George scored a crucial equalizer and assisted the winning goal, impressing manager Enzo Maresca. This breakthrough comes as Chelsea has signed numerous attacking players, making George's path to the first team challenging. His dedication, including extensive extra training from a young age, has allowed him to disrupt the typical "breakthrough, loan, sale" narrative for academy graduates, offering Maresca a valuable attacking option.</p>

          <p>Remains unearthed in Oregon City are believed to belong to Oak Grove Jane Doe, potentially resolving the state's oldest unidentified person case dating back to April 1946. The dismembered body parts of a petite white woman, estimated to be 30-50 years old, were found along the Willamette River and later buried under a headstone. The case went cold in the 1950s after critical evidence went missing. State police attribute the discovery of the remains' location to the Human Identification Program and plan advanced forensic testing. Investigators determined she died from blunt force trauma, and authorities are hopeful of finally restoring her identity after nearly 80 years.</p>
