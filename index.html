          <p>Utility workers in Lima, Peru, unexpectedly unearthed a pre-Incan tomb estimated to be over 1,000 years old while installing an underground gas network. The tomb contained the remains of one individual, found in a seated position and wrapped in a bundle, alongside several ceramic vessels and artifacts. Archaeologists have linked the find to the Chancay culture, highlighting how common such discoveries are in the historically rich capital, which holds over 400 archaeological sites. This particular gas company has made over 2,200 similar archaeological finds during its infrastructure work over the last two decades, underscoring Lima's dense historical layers.</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, annuities are gaining appeal as a source of guaranteed retirement income, but making an informed decision is crucial. This article outlines five key guidelines for prospective buyers, such as keeping total annual fees below 1% and not committing funds to a deferred annuity unless you can wait at least a decade for returns. It also advises covering essential living expenses with guaranteed income sources before investing further and limiting total annuity allocation to 25% of one's retirement portfolio. These rules help benchmark an annuity's value against other retirement strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Approximately 8 million student loan borrowers enrolled in the Biden administration's SAVE repayment plan will see interest begin to accrue again starting August 1st. This change follows court injunctions that had paused the program, leading the government to place enrollees in zero-interest forbearance. The Department of Education cited "fiscal responsibility" for the decision, but advocacy groups estimate the restart of interest could increase monthly costs by an average of $300 for a typical borrower. Enrollees can remain in forbearance without making payments, but their loan balances will now grow, prompting advice to re-evaluate repayment options.</p>

          <p>Nintendo has announced it will raise the prices for its family of Switch systems and related products for customers in the United States, effective August 3. The Japanese gaming giant cited "market conditions" as the reason for the price hike, which will affect the original Switch, Switch Lite, and OLED models, as well as some accessories. The company clarified that the price of the newly released Switch 2 console and its games will not change for now, though future adjustments have not been ruled out. This decision follows a strong earnings report and comes amid shifting U.S. tariff policies.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed significant signs of cooling as employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, falling well short of estimates and raising concerns about the economy's direction. The Bureau of Labor Statistics also issued substantial downward revisions for May and June, reducing the job gains for those months by a combined 258,000. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.2%, while wage growth remained steady. This slowdown is prompting economists to re-evaluate the market's strength, with some attributing the weakness to firms adapting to new cost structures amid ongoing trade tariff uncertainties.

          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, but its stock still declined due to a weaker-than-expected profit forecast for the upcoming quarter. While revenue and advertising sales showed strong growth, investors expressed concern over the company's heavy spending on artificial intelligence and the comparatively slow growth of its cloud division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS revenue grew 18%, trailing the growth rates of rivals Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. CEO Andy Jassy defended the company's market position and noted that the business has so far effectively navigated U.S. tariff policies without seeing diminished consumer demand.

The funding round was reportedly five times oversubscribed and included major contributions from investment firms like Dragoneer, Blackstone, and Sequoia.

          <p>A closer look at the July jobs report reveals that the healthcare and social assistance sectors were almost solely responsible for the month's modest employment gains. These sectors added a combined 73,300 jobs, while the national total for nonfarm payrolls was just 73,000, indicating that other areas of the economy saw net job losses. Sectors such as professional and business services, manufacturing, and government all shed jobs during the month. This heavy reliance on healthcare for job creation suggests a lack of broad-based hiring momentum and points to a potential freezing in other parts of the labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

The disappointing employment data, which included large downward revisions for previous months, has increased investor expectations that the Federal Reserve will be forced to cut interest rates in September.

These attacks on the central bank's traditional independence come as the latest jobs report indicates a significant economic slowdown.

Critics, such as Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, argue that the lack of transparency is unacceptable and that a clear, confirmed plan is needed to ensure the safety of the detainees.

It is the sixth named storm of the season and the first since January, with forecasts predicting wind gusts of 60 to 70 mph in northern coastal and hilly regions. Because trees are in full leaf at this time of year, there is a greater risk of them being toppled, potentially causing travel disruption and power outages.

          <p>U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Ambassador Mike Huckabee visited a controversial, privately-run aid distribution site in Gaza, a trip intended to assess the humanitarian situation for the Trump administration. The visit to the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) site comes amid reports of hundreds of Palestinians being killed near these distribution points. While U.S. officials highlighted the millions of meals being delivered, some Gazans denounced the visit as a "media stunt" that ignores the reality of the siege and starvation. The UN and human rights groups have criticized the militarized aid system, describing the distribution events as "regular bloodbaths."</p>

          <h2>The Rise of Tobacco-Free Products Complicates the Public Health Conversation Around Nicotine</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 10:34:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The growing popularity of tobacco-free products like vapes and nicotine pouches such as Zyn is creating a complex debate about the risks of nicotine itself. While these alternatives are widely considered less harmful than combustible cigarettes, which kill due to burning tobacco, the long-term health effects of consuming nicotine alone are still largely unknown. Public health experts are divided; some see these products as a harm-reduction tool, while others worry about creating a new generation addicted to a highly potent drug. Nicotine remains highly addictive, and its use can carry significant financial and psychological costs even without carcinogens.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The competition for executive talent at family offices, the private wealth management firms serving the ultra-rich, is intensifying, leading to higher pay and more structured incentive plans. According to a new report, a majority of these firms now use long-term incentive compensation to attract and retain top professionals. The median total compensation for a CEO at a large, investment-focused family office now exceeds $1.2 million. Popular incentives include co-investment opportunities, which allow executives to invest alongside the family in exclusive deals, as well as carried interest and phantom equity, marking a shift from informal agreements to more formalized, performance-based rewards.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron reported second-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations, although its profits were significantly lower compared to the previous year due to a drop in crude oil prices. The oil major's net income fell by about 44%, but adjusted earnings per share still came in ahead of forecasts. The company achieved record second-quarter production, which helped offset the impact of lower prices on its bottom line. Chevron also expressed optimism that its recent $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, which just cleared a major legal hurdle, will begin to boost its earnings by the end of the year.

          <p>Smoke from hundreds of wildfires burning across Canada is drifting south, creating hazardous air quality conditions for millions of people in the U.S. Midwest. On Friday, cities including Minneapolis, Chicago, and Detroit were ranked among the top 10 globally for the worst air quality, prompting official alerts across several states. This event highlights the wide-reaching environmental impact of the Canadian wildfires, affecting public health far from the fires themselves. Meanwhile, other parts of the U.S. are dealing with different weather threats, including cleanup from heavy rains in the Northeast and a new flood risk in the Carolinas and Texas.</p>

          <p>A 36-year-old zookeeper at the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo has died after being attacked by a Sumatran tiger that had escaped from its enclosure. The employee, Uriel Nuri, was the head of the carnivores team and was attacked during a "behind-the-scenes tour" activity for visitors. The zoo stated that visitors were never in physical danger as they were protected behind a glass window. After resuscitation efforts failed, the zookeeper was pronounced dead at a local hospital. The zoo is now closed as it works with police to investigate how the critically-endangered tiger managed to get into the inner courtyard.</p>
