          <p>Tropical Storm Barbara has formed off the southwestern coast of Mexico and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane. The National Hurricane Center has issued no coastal watches or warnings, but anticipates two to four inches of rainfall in Mexico's western states, potentially leading to flooding and mudslides. The storm is also expected to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along the southwestern coast. NOAA officials have predicted an above-normal hurricane season, with 13 to 19 named storms expected.</p>

          <p>At least four Palestinians were killed by Israeli gunfire near an aid distribution center in Gaza, according to local health workers. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that warning shots were fired after a verbal challenge to a group deemed a threat. This incident is the latest in a series of deadly events near aid distribution points set up by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is supported by Israel and the US. Humanitarian groups have widely condemned this new aid system, stating that it aims to bypass the UN, which Israel accuses of failing to prevent Hamas from diverting aid.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News discusses the growing trend of American parents financially supporting their adult children and argues that this coddling is detrimental to both the children and the parents' retirement. The author suggests that parents should cut off financial support between the ages of 22 and 25, encouraging young adults to become financially independent. While acknowledging the rising costs of living, the author emphasizes the importance of teaching financial responsibility and accountability. The piece concludes by urging parents to prioritize their own financial futures and avoid enabling their children's dependence. (not investment advice)</p>

The latest image of the larger J-36 fighter , which started circulating on social media on Saturday, offers the closest look at the mysterious jet so far. The photo, the first to show the aircraft on the ground, shows the jet parked on a tarmac at what appears to be Chengdu Aircraft Corporationâ€™s main plant in Sichuan province.

          <p>A new study analyzing the effects of water-only fasting diets on 20 people over 10 days found that while participants lost an average of 7.7 percent of their body weight, they also experienced side effects including headaches, insomnia, and low blood pressure. Overall, fasting seemed to increase inflammation and put more stress on the body, which can then lead to numerous complications with health â€“ especially for those with existing heart or vascular conditions. The researchers also analyzed how fasting affected plasma proteins in the body, finding that a number of proteins linked to inflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin 8 (IL-8), became much more abundant in the blood plasma of participants. The study suggests that medical advice should always be sought before starting a diet like this.</p>

          <p>A state-backed think tank in China has proposed "four core principles" as a framework for addressing disputes in the South China Sea. These principles include resolving disputes through consultation, managing differences through co-management, achieving mutually beneficial cooperation, and opposing external interference. China's expansive claims over the resource-rich waters are contested by several ASEAN member states. The proposal comes amid increasing tensions between Chinese and Philippine vessels in disputed areas.</p>

          <p>Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has accused First Minister John Swinney of running a "dishonest and disgraceful" campaign in the recent Holyrood by-election, alleging the SNP pushed voters toward Reform UK. Swinney defended his "two-horse race" remark, citing Labour's vote share collapse and data showing a surge for Reform. Labour unexpectedly won the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse seat, previously held by the SNP. Reform UK finished third, facing criticism for an advert deemed controversial. Meanwhile, Sarwar urged faster change to put more money in people's pockets.</p>

However, the U.S. has shifted away from nation-building efforts and lecturing others on governance, while China has emerged as a major economic power. The author suggests that Trump's policies have inadvertently diminished the perceived threat of American influence.</p>
