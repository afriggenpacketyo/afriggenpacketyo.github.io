          <p>This opinion article asserts that China is spearheading the global green energy revolution, with its renewable energy additions far outpacing those of the United States. The author contrasts China's rapid advancements in solar and wind power with the U.S., which is portrayed as prioritizing its status as a top oil and gas producer. The piece criticizes the U.S. for its higher per capita carbon emissions and suggests that potential policy shifts under a new administration could further hinder American progress in clean energy.</p>

          <p>Cameroon faces a potential crisis of youth voter engagement ahead of its presidential election, where 92-year-old incumbent Paul Biya is expected to win an eighth term. The disqualification of popular opposition figure Maurice Kamto has left many young Cameroonians feeling disenfranchised and frustrated with widespread unemployment and corruption. While some youth leaders observe growing political involvement, widespread apathy and disillusionment could lead to a significant boycott of the polls, casting doubt on the election's legitimacy.</p>

In a leaked recording, Jenrick commented on not seeing "another white face" during his time there, sparking criticism from Labour and Handsworth's MP for being irresponsible and divisive. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch suggested Jenrick was making an observation about integration, a topic he maintains he will not shy away from discussing for the sake of national unity.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police have successfully dismantled a major international criminal network suspected of smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China over the past year. The investigation, which began after a single victim tracked their stolen iPhone to a warehouse, led to 18 arrests and the recovery of over 2,000 devices. Authorities believe this gang was responsible for exporting a significant portion of all phones stolen in London, where phone theft has nearly tripled in the last four years.</p>

          <p>UNESCO's executive board has nominated Khaled el-Anani, an Egyptian Egyptologist and former minister of tourism and antiquities, to become the agency's next director-general.

His nomination comes at a challenging time for UNESCO, which faces significant budget shortfalls following the U.S. withdrawal, a decision el-Anani has pledged to work toward reversing as a top priority.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced on state television that his government had foiled a plot by a "local terrorist group" to plant explosives at the U.S. embassy in Caracas. Maduro claimed the operation was a "false flag" attempt designed to escalate tensions between Venezuela and the United States, which have been strained by recent U.S. military strikes on Venezuelan vessels. He stated that security at the embassy has been reinforced and that authorities are working to capture those involved in the alleged plot.</p>

Charities and MPs have criticized the company for earning "obscene" profits from public money while asylum seekers are housed in what are described as "miserable" conditions, prompting scrutiny of the government's contracting practices.</p>
