          <p>The Indian government has expressed serious concern over the new $100,000 annual fee for U.S. H-1B skilled worker visas, a policy change ordered by President Trump. India's Ministry of External Affairs highlighted the potential for "humanitarian consequences" due to the disruption it would cause for families of workers, who constitute over 70% of H-1B visa recipients. The move adds to existing trade tensions between the two nations, with India's commerce minister scheduled to visit the U.S. for talks amidst the new visa uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma State football fans expressed their frustration by chanting "Fire Gundy" during a historic 19-12 home loss to the University of Tulsa, the team's first defeat to Tulsa at home in 74 years. The loss dropped the Cowboys to a 1-2 record on the season, following a 69-3 blowout loss to Oregon the previous week. Head coach Mike Gundy, who has a 170-90 record over 21 seasons, acknowledged the fans' passion but stated that decisions about his job are not his to make.</p>

          <p>In a detailed interview, musician Sonny Curtis looks back on his expansive career, which began in West Texas as a teenage bandmate of rock 'n' roll pioneer Buddy Holly. Curtis discusses opening for Elvis Presley, his time with The Crickets after Holly's death, and his remarkable success as a songwriter. He penned iconic hits like "I Fought the Law" and the Everly Brothers' "Walk Right Back," but he is perhaps most famous for writing and performing "Love Is All Around," the beloved theme song for "The Mary Tyler Moore Show."</p>

          <p>A chaotic Formula 1 qualifying session in Baku, Azerbaijan, was marred by a record six red flags as over a quarter of the drivers crashed in difficult, windy conditions.

          <p>Thousands of protesters gathered in several German cities for demonstrations focused on climate change and abortion rights. In Berlin, climate activists from the Fridays for Future movement rallied against the government's new energy policy, which includes building new gas-fired power plants. Simultaneously, both anti-abortion and pro-choice groups held competing marches in Berlin and Cologne, with thousands participating on each side to voice their starkly different views on reproductive rights. The events occurred as Munich kicked off its annual Oktoberfest celebration.</p>

          <h2>Political Scientists Warn Marjorie Taylor Greene's 'National Divorce' Proposal is Alarming</h2>

          <p>Following the killing of Charlie Kirk, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has renewed her call for a "national divorce," suggesting a separation of the U.S. into red and blue states. Political science experts have expressed alarm at this rhetoric, warning that any such division would be far from peaceful and would likely trigger widespread violence and instability. They point to the American Civil War as a historical precedent for the violent outcome of secessionist movements, arguing that the solution to political polarization is finding common ground, not separation.</p>

          <p>The release of Apple's new, ultra-thin iPhone Air is being viewed by some critics as a symbol of a broader cultural trend toward a sterile and uninspired minimalism. An opinion article argues that technology, design, and art are increasingly embracing a spartan aesthetic that feels cold and controlling, contrasting sharply with the bold, colorful designs of past tech like the original iMac. This move toward less tangible, less expressive objects is seen as a reflection of a world that feels chaotic, with the clean exterior of devices like the iPhone masking the digital madness they deliver.</p>

The Estonian government described the incursion as "unprecedentedly brazen" and has requested urgent consultations with its NATO allies under Article 4, which is invoked when a member's security is threatened. This incident follows recent breaches of Polish and Romanian airspace by Russian drones, heightening fears that the war in Ukraine could spill over into direct conflict with the military alliance.

          <p>Critics and political analysts are expressing concern that President Trump is using the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to justify a crackdown on political opponents and dissent. Following the shooting, the administration has escalated threats against "radical left" groups and suggested classifying some as domestic terrorists, despite no evidence linking them to the crime. This response is being viewed by some as a classic authoritarian tactic, leveraging a tragedy to erode civil liberties, silence opposition, and consolidate power under the pretext of preventing political violence.</p>

          <p>A cyberattack targeting Collins Aerospace, a major provider of check-in and boarding software, has caused disruptions and delays at several key European airports, including London Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack on the company's MUSE system forced airlines to revert to manual check-in and boarding procedures, leading to long queues and some flight cancellations. While the company is working to resolve the issue, the incident highlights the vulnerability of the interconnected aviation industry to third-party digital system failures, which can have a widespread ripple effect.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has proposed using the Civil Contingencies Act, typically reserved for wartime or national emergencies, to address the country's significant asylum application backlog. The plan involves setting up temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and doubling the number of caseworkers to speed up decisions and reduce the costly use of hotels for housing asylum seekers. The party argues this emergency measure is necessary to "get a grip" on the situation and create a more efficient and humane system.</p>

          <p>In the wake of his killing, conservative activist Charlie Kirk is being portrayed as a martyr by figures within the Christian nationalist movement in the United States.

This framing reflects Kirk's own political evolution, where he increasingly embraced Christian culture war rhetoric, aligning his Turning Point USA organization with ideologies that advocate for Christian dominance in American society.</p>
