            <h2>Coroner Advocates for Mandatory Eye Tests for Older Drivers After Fatal Accidents</h2>
            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-18 02:53:40 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A coroner in Lancashire is urging the Transport Secretary to implement mandatory eye tests for older drivers, citing the current self-reporting system as "ineffective and unsafe" after inquests into four deaths caused by drivers with impaired vision. The coroner highlighted that the UK is among the few countries relying on self-reporting and the only European country without visual checks until age 70. Families of the victims expressed their grief and frustration, emphasizing that the tragedies were avoidable and called for stricter enforcement of visual standards. The Department for Transport stated they would consider the coroner's report and are committed to improving road safety.</p>

            <p>Analysts suggest that the recent earthquake in Myanmar could disrupt the supply of rare earth minerals to China, potentially increasing price volatility. Myanmar is a major source of rare earths for China, accounting for over half of its imports. The earthquake may have damaged mining equipment, affected mine safety, and blocked transport routes. This disruption could force China to diversify its rare earth sources, as these minerals are crucial for various industries, including smartphones and advanced weaponry.</p>

            <p>A cable car crash near Naples, Italy, resulted in the deaths of four people, including the driver, after a cable snapped. A second cabin was rescued with 16 people safely extracted, but difficult weather conditions hampered rescue efforts. Initial reports suggest a traction cable failure caused the accident, although regular safety checks were supposedly conducted. Prime Minister Meloni expressed condolences, and investigations are underway to determine the exact cause of the tragedy on the Mount Faito cable car line, which has been operating since 1952.</p>

            <p>Director James Cameron, known for films like "The Terminator," has revised his views on artificial intelligence, now seeing its potential to reduce VFX costs in Hollywood. He joined the board of Stability AI to understand AI development and integrate it into VFX workflows, aiming to double the speed of shot completion. Cameron believes AI can automate tedious tasks like rotoscoping, freeing artists for more creative work. While acknowledging concerns about copyright and training data, he suggests focusing on the output and monetization of AI-generated content rather than restricting the input.</p>

            <p>An international graduate student from UCLA has been detained at the U.S.-Mexico border by Customs and Border Protection, adding to concerns about visa cancellations affecting foreign students. The student's detention comes amid the Trump administration's cancellation of over 1,000 student visas, including some at UCLA. The reasons for the visa cancellations and the student's detention remain unclear, though some attorneys suggest it may be related to criminal record checks, even for minor infractions.

Despite this, China has become a dominant force in global manufacturing, prompting concerns about overcapacity and security risks.

            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen met with Kilmar Ábrego García in El Salvador, a man mistakenly deported by the Trump administration. Despite a court order for his return, Ábrego García remains in El Salvador, with President Bukele refusing to release him. The White House maintains Ábrego García is an MS-13 gang member, a claim his lawyer denies. Van Hollen expressed his commitment to securing Ábrego García's release, while Bukele mocked speculation about the inmate's death.</p>
