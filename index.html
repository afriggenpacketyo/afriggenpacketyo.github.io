          <p>A death row inmate, Julian Mendez, was killed at Kern Valley State Prison in California after being attacked by fellow inmate Mario Renteria, which then escalated into a mob assault involving over 30 inmates. Prison staff initially used chemical agents to stop the attack, but later deployed blast grenades to quell the escalating violence. Mendez, who was serving a condemned sentence for the murder of two teenagers, died from multiple wounds despite life-saving measures. Renteria, who was serving a life sentence for murder and arson, is currently in restricted housing pending investigation.</p>
