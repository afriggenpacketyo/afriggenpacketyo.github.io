          <p>The U.S. economy added 147,000 jobs in June, significantly surpassing economists' predictions and demonstrating continued resilience in the labor market. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, its lowest point since February, with major gains seen in the government and health care sectors. Despite this positive performance, economists remain cautious, anticipating a slowdown in the latter half of the year due to potential impacts from U.S. trade tariffs. The strong data makes it likely the Federal Reserve will delay interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comparison of current interest rates reveals that a high-yield savings account could generate slightly more earnings on a $10,000 deposit over 18-month to three-year terms compared to a long-term CD. However, this calculation assumes that the variable rate on the savings account remains constant, which is unlikely. With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates soon, locking in a fixed, high CD rate now might prove to be a more profitable long-term strategy.

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has advanced President Trump's significant spending and tax cut package after an overnight session where Republican leadership successfully swayed party holdouts. The bill, which extends tax cuts from Trump's first term while cutting social programs and raising the debt limit, passed a key procedural vote early Thursday morning. Democrats have strongly opposed the legislation, arguing it disproportionately benefits the wealthy and will cause millions to lose health insurance. The bill now heads for a final vote before being sent to the president's desk.</p>

          <p>A 35-year-old Maryland man was arrested last week after allegedly attempting to bring a "ghost gun" into the Cannon House Office Building on Capitol Hill. U.S. Capitol Police detected the fully functional, untraceable firearm in the man's bag as it passed through a security checkpoint X-ray machine. The suspect, who claimed he forgot the gun was in his bag, is not licensed to carry a firearm in Washington, D.C., and faces a felony charge. The incident is part of a rising trend, with over 20 unlawful firearm arrests on Capitol Hill so far this year.</p>

The project, a collaboration between the Perdue Research Foundation and the Archaeological Legacy Institute, will investigate a satellite anomaly known as the "Taraia Object." Scientists hope to determine if this object is the submerged wreckage of Earhart's Lockheed Electra plane, which vanished in 1937. The expedition represents what some involved are calling the greatest opportunity yet to finally solve one of aviation's most enduring mysteries.</p>

To offset these costs, it imposes significant cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, which the CBO estimates could leave millions uninsured and add trillions to the deficit.

From worries in 1925 about dancing and short skirts to critiques of 1970s hippies, adults have consistently scrutinized the habits and character of young people. The author, a Millennial now turning 30, contemplates the fine line between empathetic observation and judgmental criticism when writing about Gen Z.

          <p>Music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs faces a potential prison sentence after being found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, though he was acquitted of more severe sex trafficking and racketeering charges. A judge has denied him bail ahead of his sentencing, which is proposed for October 3, 2025. Each count carries a maximum of 10 years, but legal experts suggest a sentence of around four to five years is more likely, as indicated by prosecutors' preliminary calculations. The verdict concludes a high-profile, seven-week federal trial.</p>

Analysts suggest that by failing to condemn the bombing, which killed hundreds of civilians, Pahlavi misread the national sentiment and damaged his own brand.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced he will hold a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a move that comes just days after the U.S. paused some weapons shipments to Ukraine. The Pentagon stated the halt on certain munitions was ordered to prioritize "America's interests first" following a review of U.S. military stockpiles. The decision has fueled concern among critics, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who warned that letting Russia win would be a disaster for American security. Ukrainian officials have stressed that any delay in defense support only encourages Russian aggression.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court to Rule on State Laws Banning Transgender Athletes from Female Sports</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to decide whether states can constitutionally ban transgender girls and women from competing on female sports teams. The justices will review cases from Idaho and West Virginia, where lower courts had blocked such laws, finding they likely violated the Equal Protection Clause and Title IX. This decision sets the stage for a landmark ruling on a contentious issue that has seen two dozen states enact similar bans. The case follows a recent Supreme Court decision upholding a ban on gender-affirming care for minors, placing transgender rights at the center of another legal battle.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old American pilot, Ethan Guo, has been detained on an Antarctic island by Chilean authorities while attempting to become the first person to fly solo to all seven continents in a small plane. Officials have charged him with submitting a false flight plan, alleging he landed on King George Island without authorization. Guo was undertaking the ambitious journey to raise $1 million for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. His unauthorized flight is also being investigated for violating international rules governing access to Antarctica and for posing a safety risk to regional air traffic.</p>
