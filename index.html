          <p>PayPal has partnered with the Big Ten and Big 12 conferences to facilitate payments to student-athletes, enabling them to receive compensation through PayPal's platform. This agreement follows a court settlement in the House v. NCAA case, which allows schools to compensate athletes for the first time. The deal will allow athletic departments to distribute payments using PayPal, offering students quick and secure access to their compensation, with the option to pay tuition via PayPal at select schools. Big 12 Commissioner Brett Yormark anticipates other conferences will follow suit, with the ACC expected to be next, as the program rolls out across campuses nationwide.</p>

          <p>Conservative lawmakers are expressing outrage after the Senate Parliamentarian blocked key parts of President Trump's agenda in the budget reconciliation process. Republicans are urging the Senate to disregard the parliamentarian's decisions, with some calling for her to be fired, arguing that an unelected staffer should not have the power to decide what is in the budget. Senate Democrats have vowed to challenge the bill line-by-line to ensure compliance with the Byrd Rule, and the parliamentarian has already ruled against several key provisions, including changes to Medicaid. The removal of these provisions has set back the Republican plan to pass the bill by July 4.</p>

          <p>The British pound briefly reached its highest level against the dollar in almost four years following a report that President Trump may accelerate the appointment of a new head of the Federal Reserve. Trump has criticized current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, raising concerns about the Fed's independence, and the market is pricing in the possibility of Trump appointing someone more sympathetic to his policies. Concerns about the Fed's independence could lead to higher borrowing costs if investors demand higher interest rates for holding debt. The US economy shrank in the first quarter of the year, increasing concerns that Trump's tariffs will push up inflation (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy shrank at a faster rate than previously estimated during the first quarter of 2025, marking the first contraction in three years, with the gross domestic product falling at an annual rate of 0.5%. This decline was attributed to a surge in imports as companies rushed to buy foreign goods before tariffs took effect, although consumer spending also slowed significantly. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell noted that businesses stocking up on inventory early in the year delayed the inflationary impact of tariffs, and economists predict a rebound in economic growth for the second quarter. Despite the contraction, experts anticipate a recovery, forecasting a 3% growth rate for the second quarter (not investment advice).</p>

Prosecutors argued that Combs used his money, influence, and inner circle to cover up his crimes for two decades, emphasizing that he did not act alone.

          <p>For those nearing or entering retirement, a $200,000 annuity purchased at age 65 could provide a monthly income of approximately $1,200 to $1,300 for life, according to current estimates. The actual payout depends on factors such as gender, the type of annuity chosen, and the prevailing interest rate environment. Annuities can act as a personal pension, providing guaranteed monthly income and hedging against longevity risk, but it's crucial to consider liquidity needs before investing.

The ruling is likely to pave the way for more states to exclude Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs.

          <p>President Trump stated he is "not happy" with both Iran and Israel after they reportedly violated the ceasefire he announced. The president and his administration are pushing back on an intelligence report suggesting that the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities only set Tehran's nuclear program back by months. Despite the ceasefire agreement, Trump's remarks indicate ongoing tensions and disagreements between the involved parties.</p>

The officers are awaiting their penalty, and new rules are due to take effect that would mean any police officer proven to have committed gross misconduct would be sacked.

This provision was intended to offset the costs of the bill's tax cuts, and its rejection has raised concerns about funding for rural hospitals. The parliamentarian also flagged other provisions, including those barring Medicaid from covering gender-affirming care. The ruling has complicated the Senate's efforts to pass the bill by the July 4th deadline, and lingering debates persist over various tax and social safety net provisions.</p>
