          <h2>Hershey Announces Significant Price Increases for Candy Due to Surging Cocoa Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 18:58:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Hershey Company will implement a "low double-digit" price increase across its candy brands, including Reese's and KitKat, citing the unprecedented cost of cocoa. The price surge is attributed to a global cocoa shortage caused by climate change impacting crops in West Africa and chronic underinvestment in farms. To navigate these high costs, Hershey plans to focus more on products that are less cocoa-intensive as part of its strategy to become a broader "snacking powerhouse." The company's share prices rose following the announcement.</p>

          <p>U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff is traveling to Europe to continue pushing for a ceasefire and peace deal in the Israel-Hamas conflict. Indirect negotiations are ongoing, with mediators awaiting Hamas's response to a recent Israeli proposal for a 60-day truce and hostage release. A key sticking point remains the positioning of Israeli troops within Gaza during the ceasefire. The Trump administration is reportedly cautiously optimistic about a potential breakthrough, as diplomatic efforts intensify to resolve the 21-month war.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated he is considering eliminating the federal capital gains tax on home sales, a move that could significantly alter the real estate market. Currently, sellers can exclude up to $250,000 (or $500,000 for joint filers) in profit from taxation, a limit unchanged since 1997. Proponents argue that removing the tax would unlock housing inventory by incentivizing older homeowners to sell, while critics contend it would primarily benefit wealthy Americans and could further inflate home prices. The proposal aims to address the current housing shortage and affordability crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board has released its final report on the 2023 plane crash that killed Eugene Peltola Jr., the husband of former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola. The investigation concluded that the small plane was overweight for takeoff with a load of moose meat and that a set of moose antlers affixed to a wing strut created significant drag. These factors, combined with turbulent weather and downdrafts, likely resulted in the aircraft having insufficient power to maneuver over the terrain. Peltola was the sole occupant of the plane in the remote western Alaska crash.</p>

          <p>More than six months after the destructive Eaton and Palisades wildfires swept through Los Angeles, the remains of another victim have been found in Altadena, bringing the total death toll to 31. The discovery was made on La Venezia Court, in an area where residents did not receive evacuation alerts before the fire arrived. The unprecedented fires destroyed over 16,000 structures, mostly homes, and stand as one of the deadliest in California's history. The medical examiner's office is working to identify the remains, a complex process that can take considerable time.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced its decision to withdraw the United States from UNESCO, the UN's educational, scientific, and cultural agency, for the second time. The State Department cited the organization's promotion of "divisive social and cultural causes" and its "anti-Israel rhetoric" as reasons for the departure, which will take effect at the end of 2026. The U.S. had only rejoined the agency in 2023 under the Biden administration after a previous withdrawal in 2018.

The CDC, part of Kennedy's own department, recommends lightweight, light-colored clothing in extreme temperatures.

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's recent social media activity suggests a notable increase in erratic and defensive posts, possibly as a distraction from the ongoing Jeffrey Epstein scandal. The article points to a weekend spree of 33 posts on Truth Social, including unusual AI-generated videos and culture war grievances, which deviate even from his typical posting style. This behavior is compared to his online conduct after the January 6 insurrection, suggesting a pattern of lashing out when feeling politically cornered.
