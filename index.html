          <p>US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expressed optimism about a potential trade agreement between the United States and India, emphasizing the need for New Delhi to improve market access for American businesses and reduce the trade deficit. He also urged India to distance itself from Russia and China, citing concerns about the Russia-India arms trade and de-dollarization efforts within the BRICS economic alliance, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, plus Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Lutnick's remarks came during an event promoting US-India economic ties, highlighting the ongoing trade dynamics between the two nations. The US official believes India is working hard to be one of the first countries to reach a trade deal with the US. The optimism score for this article is relatively high given the positive outlook for trade relations. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey indicates that China's manufacturing activity contracted in May at its fastest rate since September 2022, primarily due to a sharp decline in new export orders attributed to tariffs. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell below 50, signaling contraction for the first time since last year, and the decline in foreign demand accelerated, with new export orders hitting their lowest level since July 2023. The survey also revealed a grim job market, with employment shrinking for the second consecutive month, and factories' finished goods inventory accumulated due to falling sales and shipping delays. The uncertainty in the external trade environment has increased, adding to domestic economic headwinds, with major macroeconomic indicators showing a marked weakening at the start of the second quarter. The article's optimism score is low due to the negative economic indicators.</p>

          <p>Mongolian Prime Minister Luvsannamsrain Oyun-Erdene resigned after failing to secure enough support in a confidence vote following weeks of public protests against allegations of corruption, inequality, and rising living costs. Oyun-Erdene received only 44 votes in the 126-seat parliament, falling short of the 64 needed to remain in office, and he warned that the confidence motion could cause instability and threaten democracy in the country. The protests were fueled by reports of lavish spending by Oyun-Erdene's son and a decline in Mongolia's Corruption Perceptions Index since he came to power in 2021. The political crisis brews as formerly communist Mongolia adopted democracy after the fall of the Soviet Union. This situation warrants a low optimism score due to the political turmoil and corruption allegations.</p>

The Israeli military denied its troops fired at civilians, while the US ambassador to Israel accused news outlets of reckless reporting and stated drone video showed no injuries or fatalities. The UN human rights chief described the way humanitarian aid is being delivered as unacceptable and dehumanizing.

          <p>President Donald Trump's new portrait has been posted to the White House website, depicting him in a blue suit coat, white button-up shirt, and a red tie, and the photo was taken by White House photographer Daniel Torok. The unveiling comes shortly after Trump announced the termination of Kim Sajet, the director of the National Portrait Gallery, citing her support for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), which Trump deemed inappropriate for her position. A White House official noted that Sajet had donated to Democratic campaigns, including those of Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton, and pointed to the gallery's photo of Trump with a critical caption. The photo is currently hanging in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building and will eventually be distributed to other offices. The optimism score is neutral, reflecting the routine nature of the portrait unveiling and the political context surrounding the director's firing.</p>

Ricardo Aquino of Mexico City reported being hit in the back by a baseball-sized chunk of concrete in the top deck of Dodger Stadium. Protective netting has been installed in the affected area, and the Dodgers have engaged experts to examine the facility and ensure its safety, with a longer-term review planned. Dodger Stadium, which opened in 1962, underwent a major renovation project before the 2020 season, and more renovations were completed in advance of this year’s season, this time focused on upgrading the clubhouse.

Mwangi recounted being stripped naked, hung upside down, beaten, and sexually assaulted, while Atuhaire reported being blindfolded, tied up, and similarly assaulted.

          <p>The UK government is threatening to sue Roman Abramovich to ensure the £2.5 billion proceeds from the sale of Chelsea Football Club go to Ukrainian humanitarian causes. The funds have been frozen in a UK bank account since the sale, as Abramovich was sanctioned following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and the delay stems from a disagreement over whether the funds should benefit all victims of the war, including those in Russia, or solely be used for humanitarian efforts in Ukraine. The UK government insists the money should only be spent on humanitarian efforts inside Ukraine. The situation reflects poorly on both Abramovich and the government, as the funds remain frozen and the intended beneficiaries are not receiving aid. The optimism score is low due to the ongoing dispute and the delay in providing humanitarian aid.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has increased pressure on California school districts to bar transgender athletes from competing in school sports, warning of potential legal trouble if they continue to comply with state rules allowing transgender athletes to compete. Assistant Atty. Gen. Harmeet Dhillon stated that complying with the CIF rules would deprive girls of athletic opportunities based solely on their biological sex. The Justice Department is demanding that districts certify in writing by June 9 that they are no longer complying with the federation’s rules and barring transgender athletes from competition. LGBTQ+ advocates have criticized the move, arguing it is a political tactic targeting transgender children rather than a genuine concern for cisgender athletes.

          <p>A columnist argues that Donald Trump prioritizes loyalty above all else, citing his reaction to a court ruling against his global trade tariffs. Trump blamed the judges' decision on a hatred of him and criticized the Federalist Society for recommending them, viewing any unfavorable outcome as evidence of a rigged system. The columnist notes that Trump's administration demands servile loyalty, extending this expectation to law firms, universities, and media outlets. The columnist suggests that the Federalist Society, once a key conservative legal organization, is now under attack for not bending to Trump's needs. The optimism score is low, reflecting concerns about the erosion of principles in favor of personal loyalty. </p>

          <p>President Trump is actively lobbying Senate Republicans to support the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a massive tax bill containing the bulk of their legislative agenda. The White House is planning an "all-out advocacy effort" involving high-ranking officials and potential state visits to pressure Republican senators. Sticking points include concerns about the bill's cost and potential Medicaid cuts, and Trump is directly engaging with senators to address these issues. The bill narrowly passed in the House, and any Senate changes must ultimately be approved by the House, limiting the scope for significant alterations. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the bill's passage and the potential impact of the proposed changes. </p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that his government will fast-track legislation to accelerate ambitious national projects aimed at boosting Canada's economy in response to tariffs imposed by President Trump. Following a meeting with provincial and territorial leaders, Carney outlined a plan to narrow down a list of "nation-building" projects, such as pipelines, nuclear reactors, and trade corridors, and create a framework for approval within two years. The goal is to strengthen Canada's autonomy and resilience, with Carney calling the latest tariffs "unjustified and unlawful".
