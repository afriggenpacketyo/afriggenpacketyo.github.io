          <p>The U.S. plans to implement a 50% tariff on copper imports, a move President Trump announced as part of a broader strategy to protect American industries. The decision, justified on national security grounds, has caused copper prices to rise and created uncertainty among trading partners like Chile and Canada, the top suppliers. This action follows similar tariffs on steel and aluminum and is part of a wider series of planned levies on various goods, raising concerns among businesses that rely on copper for manufacturing.

          <p>President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu held extensive meetings at the White House to discuss a potential 60-day ceasefire in Gaza. A U.S. envoy indicated that negotiators for Israel and Hamas are close to an agreement, with only one major issue remaining unresolved. The proposed deal would involve the release of several living hostages and the remains of others, though Qatari mediators suggest more time is needed to finalize the terms, underscoring the complexities of the ongoing talks.</p>

The proposals aim to tackle a backlog of nearly 77,000 cases by using judge-only trials for certain offenses like fraud, thereby reserving jury trials for the most serious crimes. While proponents like the Magistrates' Association support the changes to speed up justice, some legal professionals argue that removing juries undermines the right to be tried by one's peers.</p>

          <p>Financial analyst Jim Cramer endorsed online used car dealer Carvana, describing it as a company he believes in for the "long-haul." He pointed to the company's convenient online sales model and its potential to gain market share in a fragmented industry as reasons for his positive outlook. While acknowledging the stock's volatility, Cramer suggested that Carvana is well-positioned to benefit from potential interest rate cuts and new tariffs on foreign automakers, which could make used cars more attractive.

          <p>The head of France's DGSE intelligence service, Nicolas Lerner, has stated that recent U.S. and Israeli strikes have "extremely delayed" Iran's nuclear program by several months. He reported that various stages of the program were "very seriously affected," although a portion of Iran's highly enriched uranium stockpile remains in its possession. The assessment comes as Iran has suspended cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, limiting the ability of international inspectors to monitor its nuclear materials and activities.</p>

          <p>A government-led austerity campaign in China, aimed at curbing wasteful spending and potential corruption among public officials, is having unintended social effects. The strict rules, which ban officials from consuming liquor or "high-end dishes" at official receptions, have made some civil servants fearful of even attending private social gatherings like weddings. This reflects Beijing's broader effort to rein in ostentatious behavior, a long-standing source of public resentment, but it has also created a climate of fear that extends beyond official duties.</p>
