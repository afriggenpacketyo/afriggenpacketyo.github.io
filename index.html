          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flights after the Canadian government ordered an end to a strike by over 10,000 flight attendants that caused widespread cancellations. The government invoked federal labor laws to force binding arbitration, citing the need to protect the economy and supply chains during a period of international trade tension. While the airline works to stabilize its schedule over the next week, the flight attendants' union has criticized the intervention as a violation of workers' rights, as key issues like pay and compensation for ground time remain unresolved.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russia's refusal to accept a ceasefire is complicating peace negotiations ahead of his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and European leaders. The statement follows a U.S.-Russia summit where Moscow reportedly demanded Ukraine cede the entire Donetsk region, a condition Kyiv rejects without security guarantees. As Zelenskyy prepares for crucial talks at the White House, Russia continues its drone and missile attacks, highlighting the challenge of achieving a diplomatic breakthrough while active conflict persists.</p>

The shrine honors convicted war criminals among others, and the tributes coincided with the 80th anniversary of Japan's World War II surrender. China condemned the actions as a "blatant provocation against historical justice," urging Japan to reflect on its history of aggression and sever ties with militarism to maintain stable regional relations.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic-era fortress on Thorne Island in Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been fully renovated and is now on the market for £3 million. The new owner, Mike Conner, purchased the abandoned property in 2017 and undertook a challenging five-year restoration project to transform it into a modern space with 40 beds and a nightclub. The historic fort, originally built to defend against French naval attacks, now represents a unique piece of real estate, blending Victorian military architecture with luxury amenities for private events.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly intensifying to a powerful Category 5. The storm is currently located north of the Caribbean, bringing heavy rain and strong winds to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Turks and Caicos Islands, where a tropical storm warning is in effect. While forecasters note the storm is undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, which can cause fluctuations in intensity, current models predict it will remain offshore and not directly impact the U.S. mainland.</p>

          <p>Businesses in China are increasingly hiring retirees, a trend that is expected to accelerate as the government cracks down on companies that evade social insurance contributions for regular employees. Since employers are not required to pay these contributions for retired workers, hiring them has become a cost-saving measure, as highlighted by recent recruitment notices from McDonald's. This practice is sparking public concern that it will reduce job opportunities for the record number of young university graduates currently entering a competitive job market.

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has defended the government's decision to ban the activist group Palestine Action, asserting that its activities go beyond legitimate protest. Cooper cited incidents of property damage and alleged assaults for which the group claimed responsibility, noting that the Crown Prosecution Service has assessed related charges as having a "terrorism connection." The defense comes as police announce that 60 more people will be prosecuted for supporting the group, following over 700 arrests since the ban was enacted in early July.</p>

          <p>The Republican governors of West Virginia, South Carolina, and Ohio have announced they are sending hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington D.C. at the request of the Trump administration. This deployment is intended to support a federal intervention aimed at addressing crime and homelessness in the capital, an action President Trump initiated by federalizing the local police force. The move is seen as an escalation of federal control over the heavily Democratic city and has been met with protests from residents concerned about a military occupation and an overreach of executive power.</p>

          <h2>An Appreciation of Renaissance Art's Power to Reflect Deep Life Experiences</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This personal essay reflects on how a deeper appreciation for Renaissance art can develop through life experience, moving beyond a youthful dismissal of its religious themes. The author describes how events like trauma, pregnancy, and motherhood opened up the emotional complexity of works by artists like Piero della Francesca and Michelangelo, making them profoundly resonant. The article connects this artistic empathy to a broader willingness to be moved by the pain of others, suggesting that great art's power lies in its ability to mirror universal human struggles and emotions.</p>

          <p>A Phoenix cold case detective successfully obtained a DNA sample from a murder suspect during a staged meeting at a Chili's restaurant in 2015, leading to the capture of the "canal killer." The suspect, Bryan Patrick Miller, was known locally for dressing as a "Zombie Hunter" character at festivals. An undercover operation secured Miller's DNA from a water glass, which matched evidence from the brutal murders of two women in the early 1990s. Miller was subsequently convicted and sentenced to death in 2023.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its previous ban and will now permit Nvidia and AMD to sell certain AI chips to China, on the condition that they share 15% of the revenue with the U.S. government. This unprecedented deal, which some critics argue could be an illegal export tax, was personally negotiated by President Trump. Trade experts have expressed concern that the arrangement sets a "dangerous precedent" by creating the perception that national security-based export controls are for sale, potentially undermining the integrity of U.S. trade policy.

          <p>The National Museum of China in Beijing is hosting a major exhibition of works by the 19th-century realist painter Ilya Repin, who was born in present-day Ukraine but worked within the Russian Empire. The exhibition, organized in collaboration with Moscow's State Tretyakov Gallery, is designed to emphasize the artist's "Russianness" and connection to St. Petersburg. This framing comes as Ukraine's Ministry of Culture has asserted that Repin's works are part of its own national cultural heritage, highlighting the cultural dimensions of the ongoing geopolitical tensions.</p>
