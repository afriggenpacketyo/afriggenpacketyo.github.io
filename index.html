          <p>In response to a weaker-than-expected August jobs report, CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified Home Depot as a prime stock to purchase. He argues that the disappointing labor data will lead to lower interest rates, including mortgage rates, which will in turn stimulate the housing market. Cramer believes this economic environment will create a significant surge for housing-related stocks, with Home Depot positioned as a key beneficiary due to its strong performance and positive business outlook. He advises investors to let the stock run, anticipating substantial gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The first jobs report since President Trump fired Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer revealed a significant hiring slowdown, with only 22,000 jobs added in August. The dismissal followed a previous weak report and accusations of data manipulation from the president, a move condemned by former BLS officials as a dangerous precedent. The administration has since nominated E.J. Antoni, a critic of the agency, to lead the BLS. This political context surrounds the latest economic data, which shows the unemployment rate at 4.3% and increases pressure on the Federal Reserve.</p>

          <p>British actor John Alford, known for his roles in "London's Burning" and "Grange Hill," has been found guilty of sexually assaulting two teenage girls in 2022. A jury at St Albans Crown Court convicted the 53-year-old on four counts of sexual activity with a 14-year-old and charges of sexual assault and assault by penetration against a 15-year-old. The prosecution stated that both victims were intoxicated when the attacks occurred at a friend's house. Alford, who denied the charges and claimed his innocence, shouted in the dock as the verdict was read.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a weak August jobs report that has increased expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut, financial experts advise investors to consider defensive strategies to protect recent portfolio gains. With global equities at all-time highs, there is concern that a weakening labor market could signal broader economic trouble ahead. Analysts suggest investors re-evaluate their heavy concentration in mega-cap tech stocks, which constitute a significant portion of the S&P 500. Shifting some capital toward undervalued sectors or defensive stocks that have not participated in the recent rally could provide a buffer against potential market downturns.

          <p>American music artist Post Malone has been forced to postpone two stadium shows in London originally scheduled for this weekend due to planned strikes on the London Underground. Promoters Live Nation stated that the event license could not be granted without adequate public transport to ensure attendees could travel safely. The concerts at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium will now take place on September 20 and 21. This follows a similar decision by the band Coldplay, which also had to reschedule Wembley Stadium dates because of the industrial action by RMT union members over pay and working conditions.</p>

          <p>In Germany, advice centers for conscientious objectors are seeing a surge in inquiries as the government considers reintroducing military service to meet NATO obligations. A new law requires young men born after 2008 to complete a questionnaire about their willingness to serve, which many view as a precursor to a draft. Peace organizations report a significant increase in online traffic and requests for guidance on how to legally refuse service on grounds of conscience. The debate highlights a generational divide, with polls showing younger Germans are far less supportive of conscription than older generations.</p>

          <p>The investment platform Yieldstreet has informed customers who invested in a series of marine loan deals totaling $89 million that they are unlikely to see any of their principal returned. The company reached a $5 million settlement with the defaulted borrowers, but stated that this amount will not even cover its own extensive legal recovery costs. The loans, intended to finance the dismantling of ships for scrap metal, soured after Yieldstreet lost track of the vessels acting as collateral. This outcome represents a significant loss for investors in the deals, which were originally offered in 2018 and 2019.</p>

Adelson was arrested in 2023 at a Miami airport with a one-way ticket to Vietnam.

The unemployment rate edged up to 4.3%, while average hourly earnings saw a modest increase.

While the registration rules remain, the elimination of the tax has emboldened groups to argue in court that the entire regulatory framework is now unconstitutional.

The maneuver, conducted 36,000 km above Earth, was described as the largest of its kind and demonstrates a significant technological leap that could give China a strategic advantage. This development, along with China's broader space ambitions, has led experts to suggest that Beijing may be on a path to surpass the U.S. in key areas, potentially including the race to establish a presence on the moon.</p>

          <p>This book review examines "Snowy Day and Other Stories," a newly translated collection of early fiction by the acclaimed South Korean writer and director Lee Chang-dong. The reviewer argues that Lee's cinematic eye is evident in his prose, which uses powerful, evocative imagery to communicate the oppressive atmosphere of South Korea under the 1980s military dictatorship. The stories are praised for their ability to convey complex emotions and the subtle indignities of life under a repressive regime through visual details, much like the memorable shots in his films, such as the 2018 thriller "Burning."</p>

          <p>This article highlights a successful conservation initiative in India aimed at protecting the vulnerable olive ridley sea turtle. Along the country's coast, activists collect turtle eggs from nests on the beach to safeguard them from predators and poachers, incubating them in protected hatcheries. After hatching, the tiny turtles are released onto the sand, where conservationists and sometimes tourists watch over them and ward off threats like crabs and birds as they make their crucial journey to the sea. The effort represents a hopeful moment of human intervention supporting the survival of a vulnerable species.</p>

          <p>Angela Rayner has resigned from her roles as UK Deputy Prime Minister and Housing Secretary after an ethics investigation concluded she breached the ministerial code. The inquiry found that she failed to pay sufficient tax on the purchase of a property, a mistake she attributed to not seeking specialized tax advice. Rayner, who also stepped down as Deputy Labour Leader, accepted full responsibility for the error. Prime Minister Keir Starmer accepted her resignation, acknowledging the painful decision while praising her service to the government and her achievements in politics.</p>

          <p>Chicago is bracing for the arrival of federal law enforcement agents, a move initiated by President Trump to address violent crime, despite opposition from local and state leaders. Mayor Brandon Johnson has passed an executive order to limit federal influence on local policing, while Governor JB Pritzker has voiced concerns about potential ICE operations. While the city experienced a violent Labor Day weekend, overall crime rates have been declining. Community organizations are mobilizing to inform residents of their rights, as the deployment is viewed by many as a politically motivated and potentially unconstitutional act targeting a Democratic-led city.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is escalating its campaign against Caribbean drug cartels by deploying ten F-35 stealth fighter jets to Puerto Rico. This move follows a recent deadly U.S. missile strike on a boat suspected of carrying Venezuelan drug traffickers and a warning from Secretary of State Marco Rubio that more such attacks would occur. The Pentagon also accused the Venezuelan military of a "highly provocative" maneuver after its planes flew close to a U.S. warship in the region. This military buildup signals a more aggressive U.S. posture, which critics warn could lead to unintended consequences.</p>

The policy, issued by two government ministries, identifies the sector as strategic for national economic and political security. It sets goals for developing advanced core technologies and mandates the increased use of domestically produced equipment to fill gaps in the supply chain. This move is a direct response to escalating U.S. export restrictions on advanced semiconductor technology, prompting Beijing to prioritize industrial resilience and reduce its reliance on foreign components.</p>

The package would award Musk approximately 423 million shares if the company achieves ambitious milestones, including reaching an $8.5 trillion market capitalization and hitting major production targets for vehicles, robotaxis, and humanoid robots. This proposal follows a Delaware judge's decision to void his previous $56 billion pay package from 2018.

Only 33% of active funds delivered higher returns than their index averages, a drop from the previous year. This trend challenges the conventional wisdom that active managers excel during turbulent periods. The primary driver for this underperformance remains the higher fees associated with active funds, which create a significant hurdle that most managers struggle to overcome over both short and long-term horizons.
