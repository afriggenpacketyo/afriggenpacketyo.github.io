          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index surged to a record high, marking its second consecutive day of gains following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation.  The technology sector led the rally, with significant increases in shares of Advantest, Tokyo Electron, and Renesas Electronics. Analysts attribute the market's positive response to investor anticipation of potential fiscal stimulus under the next LDP leader.  Despite short-term volatility expectations, analysts foresee greater long-term political stability and economic growth, projecting further Nikkei gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Disposable Vape Ban Ineffective, Says Waste Firm Boss</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 19:06:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A leading waste firm's boss claims the ban on disposable vapes is failing, with an increase in improperly disposed devices causing issues for waste management.  The rise in discarded vapes is partly attributed to the launch of cheap reusable alternatives that are often treated as disposables.  The ban has also led to a surge in new vape models, complicating recycling efforts.  The vape industry counters that the ban's success is evident in increased refilling and recharging, attributing any rise in discarded devices to black market activity.</p>
