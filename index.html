          <p>President Donald Trump has reportedly asked the European Union to impose tariffs of up to 100% on China and India for their continued purchases of Russian oil. The proposal is intended to increase economic pressure on Russia to end the war in Ukraine. This move comes as Washington has already placed punitive tariffs on India for the same reason, and it highlights the administration's strategy of using secondary sanctions to influence geopolitical conflicts and international trade dynamics.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction blocking President Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The judge found Cook has a strong case that the removal, based on allegations predating her tenure, violates the Federal Reserve Act's 'for cause' provision, which is likely limited to conduct in office. This ruling temporarily upholds the principle of Federal Reserve independence amid political pressure from the administration.</p>

          <p>Documents from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, including a 50th birthday scrapbook, reveal details about his elite social network and highly sexualized lifestyle before his crimes became public. The materials contain crude messages and drawings from associates, raise new questions about his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell, and include a purported letter from Donald Trump, which the president has denied writing. The book sheds light on Epstein's connections but not the source of his wealth.</p>

These figures reflect sluggish domestic demand and have intensified calls for Beijing to implement stronger stimulus measures to support the economy and counteract weakening export growth.

          <p>A new blood test capable of detecting biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease is being trialed with over 1,000 patients in the UK's National Health Service. Researchers believe the test, which identifies the rogue proteins amyloid and tau, could increase diagnostic accuracy from 70% to over 90%. If successful, this relatively inexpensive test could revolutionize early diagnosis, replacing more invasive and less accessible methods like PET scans and lumbar punctures.</p>

          <p>New Mexico is set to become the first state in the nation to provide free, universal childcare for all its residents, regardless of income. This initiative expands an existing program that offered no-cost care to families earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level and was credited with reducing poverty. The new policy is expected to provide significant financial relief to families and support the state's economy and workforce participation.</p>

          <p>In Chicago, community activists are working to support immigrant communities as the Trump administration ramps up ICE enforcement in an operation dubbed "Midway Blitz." Organizers are tracking ICE activity and providing resources to families who fear being targeted, with some residents staying home and public events being postponed. The Department of Homeland Security states it is targeting criminals, but activists argue the enforcement is targeting anyone who appears to be of a certain ethnicity.</p>
