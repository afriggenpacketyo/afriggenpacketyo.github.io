            <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is undergoing mass firings, with an estimated 1,400 to 1,500 employees expected to be terminated due to restructuring efforts initiated by the Department of Government Efficiency. Acting CFPB Director Russ Vought stated the cuts are necessary to better align the Bureau's operations with its priorities and mission. Terminated employees will retain system access until April 18, 2025, and will be officially separated from federal service by June 16, 2025. The CFPB was established after the 2007-2008 financial crisis to protect consumers from unfair financial practices.</p>

He noted the case moved quickly, emphasizing the importance of antitrust laws in fostering competition and preventing monopolies from harming the advertising ecosystem.

            <p>Luigi Mangione has been indicted on federal charges, including murder with a firearm, for the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City. The indictment alleges that Mangione traveled across state lines to stalk and kill Thompson, making him eligible for the death penalty if convicted. Authorities believe Mangione meticulously planned the killing, but a motive remains unclear, as Mangione was never a UnitedHealthcare customer. A 3D-printed ghost gun, believed to be the murder weapon, was found on Mangione when he was apprehended in Pennsylvania.</p>

            <p>A group of burglars tunneled through multiple walls to steal an estimated $10 million in gold and jewels from Love Jewels, Reina de Oro, in downtown Los Angeles. The thieves deactivated the security alarm and cut the Ring camera feed before clearing out the display cases and safes. The family is offering a $100,000 reward for the recovery of their merchandise and are operating online only for the time being. The FBI's major theft task force is assisting with the investigation.</p>

The layoffs come after a court ruling that allowed the agency to reduce its workforce.

The bureau will also shift its focus back to banks and depository institutions, deprioritizing areas like medical debt and digital payments. (not investment advice)</p>
