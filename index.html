        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With one in three adults reporting insomnia, this article outlines scientifically-backed methods for improving sleep, particularly during disruptive summer heatwaves. Key recommendations include daily exercise to increase melatonin production and reduce stress, avoiding caffeine within eight hours of bedtime, and reducing screen time before sleep in favor of reading. The article also discusses the anecdotal benefits of deep breathing exercises like the '4-7-8' method for calming anxiety, noting that while scientific evidence is limited, it is a low-risk technique that many find effective for falling asleep more quickly.</p>

          <p>Leaders are closely watching the planned meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, viewing it as a critical opportunity to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed expectations that Putin will seriously consider the offer for talks and engage with Ukraine without preconditions. President Trump himself stated he believes a peace agreement could be reached in the near future if the initial summit is successful, acknowledging a 25% chance the meeting could go poorly but emphasizing that a follow-up would include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking study from Tsinghua University reveals that China has produced over one billion tonnes of textile fibers between 1978 and 2022, an amount roughly equivalent to twice the total human mass on Earth. This massive output highlights China's dominant role in the global textile industry, where it accounts for more than half of the world's processing capacity. However, the research also points to a significant environmental challenge, with China's textile waste recovery rate at only 17 percent, most of which is downcycled into lower-quality products.</p>

          <p>U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has accused Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of attempting to sabotage the upcoming peace talks between President Trump and President Putin. In a social media post, Greene claimed that a recent large-scale Ukrainian drone attack on Russia was a deliberate effort to undermine the summit, stating that Zelenskyy "doesn't want peace." Her comments came in response to reports of Ukrainian strikes that damaged buildings and injured civilians in Rostov-on-Don, which followed Russian attacks on Ukraine's Sumy region. The accusation adds a layer of political tension ahead of the high-stakes meeting.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has struck down two Trump administration directives that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools by threatening to withdraw federal funding. U.S. District Judge Stephanie Gallagher ruled that the Education Department violated procedural requirements when it issued memos ordering an end to all "race-based decision-making." The judge, a Trump appointee, clarified that her ruling was based on the unlawful implementation of the guidance, not its policy merits, stating it created a "sea change" that caused educators to fear punishment for lawful speech and activities.</p>

          <p>New home prices in China's 70 major cities fell by 0.3% in July, matching the previous month's decline and marking the sharpest drop since last October. This continued slide indicates that a series of government support measures, including eased purchasing restrictions and lower mortgage rates, have failed to revive consumer confidence in the property market. While prices in Shanghai saw a slight increase, most major cities, including Guangzhou and Shenzhen, experienced steady declines. The persistent downturn in the housing sector highlights the ongoing challenges facing China's economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After winning the Premier League title, Liverpool has embarked on a massive spending spree, potentially exceeding £300 million, which significantly raises the pressure on manager Arne Slot to secure more trophies. The club has made several high-profile signings, including Florian Wirtz for £116 million and striker Hugo Ekitike, fundamentally changing expectations for the upcoming season. This aggressive investment transforms Liverpool from challengers into the team to beat, meaning that anything less than a major title and a strong Champions League run would be viewed as a disappointment.</p>

This article provides a breakdown of the five primary stakes: Russian demands for Ukrainian territory versus Kyiv's refusal to concede more land; Moscow's push for Ukrainian neutrality against Kyiv's search for Western security guarantees; the potential lifting of economic sanctions on Russia; accountability for war crimes and reparations for Ukraine's reconstruction; and the exchange of thousands of prisoners of war.

          <p>An Australian man who murdered British expatriate Emma Lovell during a 2022 home invasion in Brisbane will be eligible for release 17 months earlier after a successful appeal. The Queensland Court of Appeal reduced his non-parole period from 70% to 60% of his 14-year sentence, meaning he could be released after serving eight years and five months. The judges cited the man's early guilty plea, which spared the victim's family the trauma of a trial, as well as his genuine remorse and troubled upbringing, as key factors in their decision to alter the sentence.</p>

          <p>A man was fatally struck by a vehicle on the 210 freeway in Monrovia, California, while attempting to flee an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at a nearby Home Depot. The incident occurred during an operation where agents were targeting day laborers, and local officials confirmed that ten other people were detained. This tragic death has intensified criticism of the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement tactics, with a state assembly member stating that such raids terrorize families and put lives at risk rather than making communities safer.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has started canceling flights as it prepares for a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, which could begin as early as Saturday. The airline initiated a gradual suspension of operations after contract negotiations with the union reached an impasse over key issues, including what the union calls "poverty wages." A complete shutdown of Canada's largest airline threatens to disrupt travel for approximately 130,000 people per day. The airline has stated that customers with canceled flights will be eligible for a full refund and that it is working to arrange alternative travel options.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced that state Democrats will pursue a plan to redraw the state's congressional district maps, a move intended to directly counter a Republican-led effort in Texas to create more GOP-friendly districts. Newsom has called for a special election on November 4 to approve the new map, which would override the state's independent redistricting commission. The governor stated this defensive measure would only take effect if Texas or another state advances a partisan mid-cycle redistricting plan, framing it as a necessary action to "meet fire with fire" and protect democracy.</p>

          <p>A 50-year-old man in Van Nuys, Los Angeles, was arrested after tormenting his neighbors for two months by repeatedly sounding a powerful train horn he had attached to a palm tree in his yard. The window-rattling blasts, which occurred at irregular intervals, prompted numerous complaints to the police. In an interview before his arrest, the man, Gary Boyadzhyan, described the situation as a "cry for help" stemming from personal issues that cost him his job. He was arrested for interfering with a peace officer and disturbing the peace after sounding the horn again shortly after promising police he would stop.</p>

Many users have lost access to years of cherished photos and have seen their businesses disrupted, with little recourse through Meta's automated appeal process. Despite acknowledging a problem with Facebook Groups in June, Meta has not admitted to a wider issue, though it has frequently reinstated accounts after being contacted by media outlets about specific cases.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled a new high-speed military drone with vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) capabilities, allowing it to operate from the decks of ordinary warships without a runway. This technological breakthrough could effectively transform vessels like destroyers and frigates into miniature aircraft carriers, significantly extending the operational range and surveillance capabilities of the Chinese navy. The project team claims the jet-powered drone is far superior in speed compared to other mainstream VTOL drones currently in use, enabling it to transition seamlessly into long-range cruise flight.</p>
