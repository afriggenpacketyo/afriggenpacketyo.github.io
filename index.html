          <p>Following a tense meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Donald Trump has publicly suggested that the war in Ukraine should end by freezing the current battle lines. This proposal would effectively cede the eastern Donbas region, largely occupied by Russia, to Moscow's control. The meeting reportedly ended without an agreement to supply Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, a key request from Kyiv. While the Kremlin welcomed the proposal, analysts remain divided on whether Trump's transactional approach can effectively pressure Russian President Vladimir Putin into a lasting peace agreement.</p>

          <p>A fragile peace deal in Gaza, brokered by the Trump administration, is being tested after a weekend of renewed violence between Israel and Hamas. Senior U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner have returned to Israel to help ensure the ceasefire holds, with Vice President JD Vance also scheduled to visit. The recent clashes, which included deadly Israeli strikes and a Hamas attack on soldiers, briefly halted humanitarian aid deliveries. Both sides have since recommitted to the process, with diplomatic efforts focused on stabilizing the region and maximizing the flow of essential aid into Gaza.</p>

          <p>Pizza Hut's UK restaurant operator has fallen into administration, leading to the permanent closure of 68 restaurants and 11 delivery locations across the country. This move will result in the loss of 1,210 jobs as the company restructures its operations. However, Pizza Hut's global parent company, Yum! Brands, has stepped in to save 64 other UK locations, a decision that will preserve 1,276 jobs. The popular dining chain has faced significant financial struggles in recent months, marking this as its second time entering administration this year.</p>

          <p>For those in the housing market, current mortgage rates remain a critical factor. As of mid-October, the national average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage is 6.46%, while a 15-year mortgage averages 5.81%; refinance rates are slightly higher. The article notes that while rates are higher than in recent years, they have stabilized, and borrowers with strong credit profiles can still secure favorable terms. It advises prospective buyers and refinancers to strengthen their credit scores and compare offers from multiple lenders to find the best possible rate in the current economic environment.

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown requires all active-duty military personnel to continue performing their duties without receiving pay until Congress passes a funding deal. While a 2019 law ensures federal employees receive back pay after a shutdown, military pay requires separate legislation, which has not yet passed. Essential civilian Defense Department employees will also continue to work, while others will be furloughed. Financial institutions like Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA have announced plans to offer no-interest loans to affected service members to help mitigate financial hardship during the funding lapse.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is expected to have a minimal impact on the majority of mortgage applications, as most are handled by private lenders. However, borrowers seeking government-backed loans through agencies like the FHA, VA, or USDA may experience minor processing delays due to employee furloughs. The USDA will halt the issuance of new loans entirely during the shutdown. Additionally, homebuyers in flood zones could face delays in securing required flood insurance, which is administered by the FEMA-run National Flood Insurance Program.</p>

          <p>While a government shutdown forces hundreds of thousands of federal employees to work without pay or be furloughed, members of Congress and the president will continue to receive their salaries. This is because their compensation is authorized under the Constitution and funded by a permanent appropriation that does not require annual renewal. In contrast, most federal workers and their own congressional staffers will see their paychecks delayed until a funding agreement is reached. This disparity often draws public criticism during funding impasses that disrupt the lives of many government employees.</p>

          <p>A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding legislation for federal agencies before the fiscal year begins on October 1.

Essential employees, such as active-duty military and air traffic controllers, must work but do not get paid until the shutdown ends. While entitlement programs like Social Security continue, customer service functions can be severely disrupted, and national parks may close, impacting the public in various ways.</p>

          <p>According to Columbia University business psychologist Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, mastering certain social skills is more crucial for career advancement than simply "being yourself." He identifies three key abilities that make individuals more employable and effective: being receptive to critical feedback, cultivating social awareness by focusing on others' needs, and demonstrating adaptability by stepping outside one's comfort zone. These components of emotional intelligence allow professionals to navigate workplace dynamics effectively, close the gap between self-perception and reality, and foster continuous personal and professional growth.</p>

          <p>Claims of a "Christian genocide" in Nigeria are being amplified on social media and by some public figures, but an analysis suggests the reality is more complex. While attacks on Christian communities are frequent, the violence is driven by a mix of factors including land disputes between farmers and herders, climate change, poverty, and weak governance. Survivors and analysts from the region indicate that the conflict affects multiple faiths, with both Christians and Muslims suffering losses. The article argues that framing the crisis solely as religious persecution oversimplifies deep-rooted issues and could undermine peacebuilding efforts.</p>

Instead of chasing short-term speculative victories, Cramer urges investors to focus on buying and holding shares in fundamentally strong, best-of-breed companies.
