          <p>Korean Air announced a substantial deal to acquire 103 Boeing jets, including 787, 777, and 737 models, as part of its fleet modernization strategy amidst its merger with Asiana Airlines. This significant agreement was unveiled shortly after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung's meeting with US President Donald Trump, where trade discussions, including US tariffs on South Korea, were a key topic. The deal supports President Trump's initiative to encourage trading partners to increase business with American firms, and Boeing projects it will sustain approximately 135,000 jobs across the United States. This major purchase reflects a trend of countries making large Boeing orders during trade negotiations with the Trump administration, contributing to Boeing's competitive edge against Airbus despite recent crises.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns have traded quarterback Kenny Pickett to the Las Vegas Raiders for a 2026 fifth-round NFL Draft pick, a move that surprised many expecting the Browns to carry four quarterbacks. This trade addresses the Raiders' urgent need for a backup after Aidan O’Connell's wrist injury, providing them with Pickett's 25 starts of NFL experience. Pickett, who previously played for the Steelers and Eagles, was competing for a backup spot in Cleveland behind Joe Flacco, alongside rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders. His hamstring injury during training camp hindered his competition, leaving the Browns' backup quarterback situation uncertain as the roster deadline approaches.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced the immediate removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, citing allegations of false statements on mortgage agreements. Trump posted a letter on Truth Social informing Cook of his decision, asserting constitutional powers to justify the unprecedented move. Cook, the first African American woman on the Fed board, had previously stated she would not be "bullied" into resigning and was gathering facts regarding the four-year-old mortgage allegations. This action escalates Trump's ongoing pressure on the Federal Reserve, particularly its chair Jerome Powell, over interest rate policies, and is expected to raise significant legal challenges regarding the central bank's independence.</p>

          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has characterized illegal immigration as a "scourge" impacting the UK on an "historic and unprecedented" scale, ahead of outlining his party's comprehensive plans. These proposals include detaining and deporting illegal arrivals, leaving the European Court of Human Rights, repealing the Human Rights Act, and disapplying international treaties like the Refugee Convention to facilitate removals. Farage advocates for a legal obligation on the Home Secretary to remove illegal entrants and to ban them from claiming asylum. Labour and the Tories have criticized Reform's plans, which come amidst growing popularity for the party and ongoing government efforts to tackle Channel crossings.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, Dauphin Island, Alabama, a barrier island, is facing an existential crisis as it continues to shrink due to ongoing erosion from storms and sea level rise. Katrina severed the island's west end, destroying over 300 homes and permanently washing away land, leaving some residents still paying taxes on underwater lots. Despite beach restoration efforts funded by Deepwater Horizon oil spill settlements, constant maintenance is crucial and costly, with a $60 million project planned for the west end. The recent cancellation of FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) grant program by the Trump administration, which disproportionately affected Trump-supporting counties and vulnerable communities, further jeopardizes critical mitigation projects, leaving communities like Dauphin Island in limbo.</p>

Despite Lee's hopes for Trump to resolve the Korean standoff, North Korea has continued its nuclear program and military support for Russia, recently testing new air defense systems.

          <h2>Dynamic Movement and Mindset Key to Improved Back Health, Expert Suggests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 20:07:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Conventional wisdom about posture, often emphasizing rigid upright sitting, is outdated and potentially harmful, according to Dr. Xand van Tulleken. He suggests three key rules for better back health: prioritize continuous movement rather than static positions, build core and back strength through regular exercises like pilates or yoga, and cultivate a healthy mindset. Dr. Xand explains that back pain is not solely muscular but also emotional and psychological, influenced by stress and work-life balance. Therefore, addressing posture effectively involves dynamic physical activity, strengthening, and managing mental well-being, rather than relying solely on ergonomic gadgets or fixed positions.</p>

          <p>The UK government has approved plans for around 40 Gazan students to come to the UK on funded university scholarships in the coming weeks, marking the first such evacuations since the Hamas-Israel war began in 2023. Nine students under the Chevening scheme and about 30 others with private scholarships have received approval, though Israel's consent for their departure is still required. This decision follows months of advocacy by politicians and academics, amidst deteriorating UK-Israel relations and significant logistical challenges in evacuating students from a war zone. The UK also plans to evacuate critically ill and injured children for medical treatment.</p>

After being taken into custody for an alleged Saturday morning assault, Reedus, when confronted by a New York Post journalist, allegedly said, "You want to watch me kill myself?" He pleaded not guilty to charges including third-degree assault and resisting arrest, and was released without bail. This marks his second arrest on assault suspicions, with a previous incident in 2021 leading to a plea deal for disorderly conduct and mandatory counseling.</p>

His guilty plea, which came after US prosecutors confirmed they would not seek the death penalty, is expected to result in a more lenient sentence.

This increase is largely attributed to significant price hikes in staples like chocolate, butter, and eggs, driven by high demand, tightening supply, increased labor costs, and poor cocoa harvests linked to climate change. While there's some relief in cheaper clothing and stationery, the rising food costs contribute to overall inflation and compel households to reassess budgets.

          <p>A BBC study reveals UK councils are grappling with spiraling debt, totaling £122 billion, forcing them to sell off public assets like schools and care homes to cover costs. This "fire sale" reflects an unsustainable system, with the combined debts growing 7% last year, equivalent to £1,700 per UK resident. Increasingly, councils are granted "capitalisation directions" to sell assets or take short-term loans for day-to-day services, further exacerbating debt. Experts attribute the crisis to years of underfunding and risky investments, with a third of councils predicting bankruptcy within five years without government intervention. Reforms are underway, but calls for debt write-offs persist. (not investment advice)</p>
