          <p>Three L.A. County Sheriff's deputies were killed when a grenade they recovered detonated at a training facility after they believed the device was inert. A second grenade recovered from the same location is now missing, prompting a wide-scale search and public safety warnings. The sheriff's department has announced policy changes, vowing to treat all explosive devices as live in the future to prevent similar tragedies. This incident marks the department's largest single loss of life in over 150 years, and an investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Tesla's plan to expand its robotaxi service to the San Francisco Bay Area faces regulatory roadblocks, as California officials have clarified the company is not authorized to operate autonomous vehicles for public transport. The California Public Utilities Commission stated that while Tesla can offer a private car service, it must include a human driver. This comes as the company tests a supervised robotaxi service in Austin and faces separate accusations from the DMV of misleading consumers about its "Full Self-Driving" capabilities. Local officials have also expressed disappointment over the lack of communication from Tesla.</p>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight from Burbank to Las Vegas executed a sudden, sharp dive to avoid a potential collision with a private jet shortly after takeoff. The dramatic maneuver, which passengers likened to a freefall ride, resulted in injuries to two flight attendants. The pilot reportedly took evasive action after a collision warning system activated. The FAA has launched an investigation into the near-miss incident, which occurred just days after another similar event involving a different airline.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami's owner, Jorge Mas, has publicly condemned Major League Soccer's decision to suspend star players Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba for one game. The suspension was a direct result of the players missing the MLS All-Star game, a penalty mandated by league rules. Mas labeled the punishment "draconian," arguing the league doesn't understand the players' need for rest and criticizing the scheduling of games so close to the exhibition match. While MLS Commissioner Don Garber defended enforcing the long-standing policy, he acknowledged the league would reevaluate the rule.</p>

          <p>Disgraced former New York Congressman George Santos has surrendered to a federal correctional facility in New Jersey to begin his 87-month prison sentence. Santos pleaded guilty to federal wire fraud and identity theft charges, admitting to a wide-ranging scheme of fabricating his background to defraud donors and enriching himself with campaign funds. The funds were illicitly spent on luxury goods, Botox, and personal expenses. Following his sentencing, Santos publicly appealed to former President Trump for a future pardon, a request the White House has declined to comment on.</p>

          <p>A small business owner in Leicester is preparing for a crucial hearing in her protracted trademark dispute with cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell, owner of the 'nkd' salon, is fighting L'Oréal's opposition to her re-registering the trademark, which she had held for a decade before accidentally letting it lapse. L'Oréal claims the name is too similar to its 'Naked' makeup line and would cause consumer confusion, a claim Dowdeswell disputes, citing a lack of any such confusion over 15 years. Despite spending over £30,000, she remains determined to fight the corporate giant.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a significant boom for certain insect species, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The favorable conditions led to an abundance of aphids, a primary food source, which in turn supported predator populations like ladybirds. Butterfly Conservation reported an "extraordinary" year for early sightings of numerous species, a stark contrast to the record lows of the previous year. However, experts caution that the lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year due to drying wetland habitats.</p>

In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins sided with the city, a decision praised by Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor.

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the infamous Hollywood blacklist era, which began in 1947 with the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation into alleged Communist influence in the film industry.

It highlights the personal and professional toll on those affected, including screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, and the difficult choices faced by those who named names, such as Walt Disney and Ronald Reagan.

Unlike other presidents who used golf for diversion, Trump's outings are often transactional, providing a private venue for discussions away from public scrutiny. While his skill and adherence to the rules are debated, his passion for the sport and its role in his professional life are undeniable.</p>

A recent follow-up revealed the mission's success, with the relocated herd not only surviving but also growing with the birth of new lambs.</p>

          <p>An examination of the humanitarian aid boxes being distributed in Gaza by the Israel- and US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) has raised concerns among experts about their nutritional value. While the boxes contain sufficient calories for basic survival, they are reportedly deficient in key micronutrients like iron, calcium, and various vitamins. Aid experts described the contents as a "'first aid' food basket" that, over time, could lead to hidden hunger and diseases like scurvy. The aid also consists largely of dried goods that require clean water and fuel, both of which are critically scarce in the besieged territory.</p>

          <p>San Angelo police have arrested a 17-year-old, Justin Ramirez, and are actively searching for two other teenagers in connection with the murder of 19-year-old Joe Angel Martinez III.

The victim was found with a gunshot wound inside a vehicle after what was initially reported as a car accident. The police chief held a press conference urging the two remaining suspects, a 17-year-old and a 16-year-old, to turn themselves in to the authorities.</p>

          <p>In a modern twist on civic duty, the U.S. Treasury Department is now allowing Americans to make contributions to pay down the national debt using the mobile payment app Venmo. The "Gifts to Reduce the Public Debt" program has existed for decades, but the addition of Venmo offers a more accessible way for citizens to donate. As of this writing, the national debt stands at over $36 trillion. Since 1996, the program has collected approximately $67.3 million in public donations, a small fraction of the total debt but a symbolic gesture of public participation.</p>

          <p>Twenty-five years after "Big Brother" first aired, some psychologists and social experts are suggesting that reality television may have positive cognitive and social effects on viewers. Contrary to common criticism, the genre can serve as a tool for social understanding by exposing audiences to diverse demographics and perspectives they might not otherwise encounter. By showcasing raw emotions and difficult conversations on topics like health, disability, and relationships, these programs can make people feel less isolated and even prompt valuable societal discussions. Some studies even link reality shows to positive behavioral changes.</p>

The problem is compounded by smaller tea harvests in Japan due to heatwaves and a shrinking farming population.

Konyndyk criticizes the current aid model of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation as deeply flawed and dangerous, forcing desperate people to risk their lives for meager supplies.
