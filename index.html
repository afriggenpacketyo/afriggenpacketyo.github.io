        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate has failed for a fifth time to pass spending measures, extending the government shutdown into its second week as competing proposals from both parties did not reach the required 60-vote threshold. President Donald Trump suggested a willingness to negotiate with Democrats on healthcare provisions, a central demand from their side, though Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer quickly refuted claims of active talks, stating Trump's assertion was untrue. The prolonged impasse has left thousands of federal employees furloughed or working without pay, with the White House warning of imminent layoffs as agencies prepare for workforce reductions. This legislative deadlock underscores deep partisan divisions over budget priorities, particularly concerning health insurance subsidies and Medicaid funding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research published in Environmental Research has linked long-term exposure to sulfur dioxide, a major pollutant from fossil fuel mining and combustion, to an increased risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The study, initiated after healthcare workers observed a higher ALS incidence in New Brunswick, Canada, compared diagnosed individuals with healthy controls, estimating their exposure to pollutants based on home addresses. Researchers found a 23% higher chance of an ALS diagnosis among those exposed, even within Canada's clean air guidelines, though the study establishes association rather than direct causation. These findings highlight potential public health implications and emphasize the need for further studies to develop prevention strategies and improved regulatory interventions on air pollution levels.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is intensifying efforts to deploy National Guard troops to cities like Portland and Chicago, despite strong objections and legal challenges from state and local leaders. Up to 400 Texas National Guard troops are reportedly en route to Chicago after a federal judge temporarily declined to block their deployment, which Illinois' governor described as an "unconstitutional invasion." Meanwhile, a federal judge in Oregon blocked a similar deployment to Portland, citing a lack of evidence for its necessity. The administration justifies these actions by pointing to protests at ICE facilities, but critics argue the deployments are politically motivated, aiming to use cities as "training grounds" for the military, raising significant concerns about federal overreach and civil liberties.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer is bullish on Take-Two Interactive, arguing its stock could climb due to its newfound "scarcity value" in the video game industry. With major competitors Activision Blizzard acquired by Microsoft and Electronic Arts going private, Take-Two is now positioned as the sole major publicly-traded American pure-play video game company, attracting sophisticated investors. Cramer highlighted the highly anticipated May 2026 release of "Grand Theft Auto VI," expected to be a massive success following its predecessor's record sales, as a key driver for future growth. He also praised Take-Two's strong recent financial performance, including beating Wall Street estimates and the growing success of other franchises like NBA 2K and its expanding mobile business.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy acknowledged a slight increase in sick calls since the shutdown began, recognizing the significant morale impact of unpaid work on these critical employees. This situation underscores the severe strain on aviation safety professionals and the broader federal workforce, raising concerns about potential operational delays and the long-term effects of the ongoing budget impasse.</p>

          <p>A deadly tornado that ripped through Enderlin, North Dakota, in June has been upgraded to an EF-5 rating by the National Weather Service, marking it as the first U.S. twister of this highest intensity in 12 years. The twister, which had estimated maximum wind speeds exceeding 210 mph, caused extensive destruction, including tipping several train cars loaded with grain and sweeping the foundation of at least one farm building clean. The severe weather event lasted just under 20 minutes, creating a 12-mile path of damage and tragically resulting in three fatalities. This significant upgrade underscores the extreme power and rarity of such a storm, serving as a stark reminder of the devastating force of natural disasters.</p>

This strategic move, announced by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and the White House, aims to support mining exploration and bolster the U.S.'s supply of critical minerals. Concurrently, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to further boost Alaska's resource potential and facilitate the construction of a 200-mile road in the state. Officials assert that this investment will benefit Americans by enhancing national security through the securement of essential mineral supplies.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has declined to hear Ghislaine Maxwell's appeal, effectively upholding her 2021 conviction and 20-year prison sentence for her role in sexually exploiting and abusing minor girls alongside convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell's appeal hinged on a 2007 non-prosecution agreement Epstein made with federal prosecutors in Florida, which she argued should have barred her prosecution. However, both a federal district court and the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the agreement was geographically limited and did not preclude charges brought against her in New York. This decision solidifies her conviction, leaving a presidential pardon as her only remaining avenue for early release.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is set to implement higher parking meter rates and extend paid parking hours, marking the first rate increase in over a decade for the city's 35,000 metered spaces. Meter prices will jump by 50 cents per hour, with new costs expected by late October, and paid hours will extend until midnight in nightlife areas and 8 p.m. in all other on-street areas, including Sundays. City transportation officials state these changes aim to encourage vehicle turnover to help businesses whose customers struggle to find parking, and to generate an estimated $14.4 million in revenue for the financially struggling city.

Legal experts note that conservative judges, including Trump's appointees, are increasingly pushing back against the administration's broad interpretation of statutes for military intervention in civil affairs.

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, a foundational document outlining national development goals for the coming half-decade, a key question is whether it can successfully restore confidence among its private firms. Entrepreneurs have faced years of sluggish demand, intense price wars, and unexpected administrative penalties, with over 60% describing the current business climate as "difficult." Despite a barrage of government measures intended to make life easier for private businesses, many industries could face a "wave of bankruptcies" if conditions do not significantly improve. The success of the upcoming plan hinges on Beijing's ability to genuinely empower private enterprises and help its entrepreneurs stay competitive in a rapidly changing and unpredictable global economic environment.</p>

This strong critique comes amid rising WNBA popularity, skyrocketing franchise valuations, and ongoing labor negotiations where players demand higher salaries and a greater share of league revenue.

While the White House cited rising violent crime based on FBI data, Memphis Police reported a decrease, with murder at a six-year low. This article explains that discrepancies primarily arise from two factors: differences in geographical scope, as FBI data covers a wider nine-county metro area, and varying counting methodologies, where the FBI counts each victim while local police count each incident. Experts emphasize the critical need for careful interpretation of crime data, considering definitions, time frames, and reporting gaps to accurately understand the full picture of crime trends.</p>

          <p>A career federal prosecutor in Virginia, Elizabeth Yusi, has reportedly concluded there is no probable cause to file criminal mortgage fraud charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James, despite alleged pressure from former President Donald Trump. This situation sets up a high-profile confrontation within the Justice Department, echoing past instances where Trump reportedly fired or pressured officials who resisted prosecuting his perceived enemies. The allegations against James stem from mortgage documents related to a 2023 home purchase for her niece, where James appeared to indicate she intended to use it as her primary residence. However, internal evidence suggests James clearly indicated otherwise, making it difficult for prosecutors to prove she knowingly lied on the documents.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has appointed Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano to a newly created second role as CEO of the IRS, where he will oversee all daily operations while continuing to lead the SSA. Bessent cited shared technological and customer service goals between the two federal agencies as justification for this dual appointment. However, Social Security advocates express significant concerns about a potential "leadership vacuum" at the SSA, especially given the Trump administration's recent job cuts at the agency and the current lack of a confirmed deputy commissioner. This article highlights the unprecedented nature of a commissioner holding two major federal agency leadership positions and the potential challenges it poses for both critical government services.</p>

          <p>Illinois and Chicago have filed a lawsuit to block the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard troops to the city, but it was revealed in court that Texas National Guard members are already en route and could be deployed imminently. Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul described the deployment as "patently unlawful" and an "unconstitutional invasion," arguing it would cause additional unrest and mistrust of police. A judge declined an immediate temporary restraining order but cautioned federal lawyers to "take a pause" on the matter. This legal challenge underscores the ongoing conflict between state and federal authorities over the use of military force in domestic law enforcement, with state officials citing constitutional militia clauses and the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>

          <p>China's decision to relinquish its "developing country" status at the WTO is being examined as a strategic maneuver, potentially allowing it to gain more than it loses in the long run. Historically, this status entitled members to special and differential treatment, including more extended implementation periods for trade commitments. However, the United States and European Union have consistently highlighted the supposed inconsistency of a hi-tech export powerhouse still seeking benefits similar to far poorer states. By conceding these benefits, China removes one of Washington’s most effective talking points while sacrificing very little of substance, as it had already made practical concessions. This move allows Beijing to reframe the global trade battlefield and align itself more closely with the Global South.</p>

          <p>A new intelligence bulletin from the Secure Communities Network warns that extremist groups are increasingly exploiting artificial intelligence tools to intensify antisemitic propaganda, recruitment, and operations targeting Jewish communities across North America. The report highlights how chatbots, deepfake imagery, and generative content are used to automate and amplify disinformation, spread antisemitic narratives, and spur the self-radicalization of lone actors. Examples include the chatbot "Grok" posting antisemitic content and AI allegedly assisting in planning an explosion, illustrating how AI can aid operational tactics. This trend poses significant challenges for law enforcement and communal security, as AI-generated content blurs the line between real and fake, making false material appear more credible and harder to trace.</p>

          <p>The number of students arriving from Asia to the U.S. in August fell by nearly 24% this year compared to last year, marking the lowest August figures on record outside of the Covid-19 pandemic. This data, published by the Department of Commerce’s International Trade Administration, typically serves as a reliable indicator of fall semester enrollment and reflects a significant decline in international student arrivals. China and India, which remain the two largest sources of international students, both saw sharp decreases, down 12.4% for mainland China and 44.5% for India. Many international students who usually leave the U.S. over school breaks also opted to stay this year, fearing re-entry issues, a trend with broad implications for U.S. educational institutions and international relations.</p>

The article also highlights the intensifying AI arms race, particularly between the U.S. and China, with Chinese rival DeepSeek innovating with domestically made AI chips and raising national security concerns from the U.S. government. OpenAI's partnerships are crucial steps in increasing production and building more complex AI models to meet this escalating global demand. (not investment advice)</p>

Schiffmann claims the controversy was intentional, viewing the vandalism as effective PR that generates "mindshare" for his product. Despite low sales, significant flaws, and an unclear path to profitability, Schiffmann aims to normalize the concept of AI companionship, even comparing the AI pendant to "talking to a god," amidst broader public skepticism about AI's role in human relationships.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police have dismantled an international gang suspected of smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China in the last year, in what is described as the largest operation against phone thefts in the UK. The investigation began when a victim electronically traced a stolen iPhone to a warehouse near Heathrow, leading to the discovery of thousands of devices and the identification of key suspects through forensic analysis. Police believe the gang is responsible for exporting up to 40% of all phones stolen in London, with Apple products specifically targeted due to their high profitability overseas, selling for up to £4,000 each in China. The operation highlights the lucrative nature of phone theft and the sophistication of international organized crime networks.</p>

Net sales dropped 15% from the same period last year, and the company's operating margin fell 200 basis points, partly due to aluminum tariffs. Executives specifically noted a trend of lower demand from Hispanic consumers, which they linked to concerns about President Donald Trump's immigration policies and potential job losses.
