          <p>Fashion retailer H&M announced better-than-expected third-quarter results, causing its shares to jump significantly. The company's operating profit rose 40% year-on-year to 4.9 billion Swedish krona, surpassing analyst forecasts. This positive performance is attributed to CEO Daniel Erver's turnaround strategy, which focuses on tight cost controls, store optimizations, and a return to core product lines. Despite the success, H&M noted that upcoming U.S. tariffs could impact future pricing and consumer sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's fourth-ranking official, Wang Huning, has publicly praised the government's policies in the Xinjiang region, declaring them "completely correct." Speaking at an event attended by President Xi Jinping, Wang asserted that Xinjiang's "brilliant achievements" demonstrate the advantages of the Communist Party's leadership and its specific governance strategy for the region. These remarks signal Beijing's continued firm stance on its approach in Xinjiang, which has faced significant international criticism over human rights concerns. The statement reinforces the official narrative of success and stability in the autonomous region.</p>

          <p>A Paris court has found former French President Nicolas Sarkozy guilty of criminal conspiracy related to allegations of receiving illicit campaign funds from the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. The case centered on accusations that Sarkozy used millions from Gaddafi to finance his successful 2007 presidential campaign. While acquitted of other charges like corruption, the court determined he had allowed aides to seek financial support from Libyan officials. This verdict adds to a series of legal troubles for Sarkozy since he left office in 2012.</p>

          <p>Following the shooting death of anti-LGBTQ+ activist Charlie Kirk, the transgender community is facing an intensified wave of political and rhetorical attacks. The article argues that right-wing figures and the Trump administration have seized upon the event to accelerate a campaign targeting transgender existence, despite the shooter not being transgender. This has included calls for institutionalization and the advancement of federal legislation with anti-transgender provisions, such as healthcare and bathroom access restrictions. The escalating hostility has created a climate of fear, prompting some transgender individuals to consider leaving the country for their safety.</p>

          <p>Public health leaders are raising alarms over a proposed 53% budget cut to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which would eliminate 61 programs and lead to significant staff layoffs. According to a new report, these cuts would severely undermine efforts to prevent chronic illnesses like cancer and diabetes, as well as programs for HIV/AIDS and emergency preparedness. Experts argue that reducing the CDC's funding, 80% of which supports state and local health departments, poses a direct threat to the health of all Americans and could increase long-term healthcare costs.</p>

          <p>A new report from the preservation group Latinos in Heritage Conservation has identified 13 historic U.S. landmarks significant to Latino history that are at risk of being lost. The list aims to draw attention to their cultural importance and vulnerability due to neglect and a lack of maintenance funds. This initiative coincides with proposed deep cuts to the federal Historic Preservation Fund, which advocates say will disproportionately harm the preservation of sites representing marginalized communities. The group is calling for urgent action to protect these "community anchors" from being erased from the national narrative.</p>

          <p>In a groundbreaking ruling, a Spanish court has convicted a man for killing a puppy by applying a law typically used for gender-based violence. The court on the island of Gran Canaria found that the 18-year-old intentionally threw the four-month-old puppy he co-owned with his partner off a cliff to inflict psychological harm on her. This act was recognized as "vicarious violence," where an abuser harms something or someone important to the victim, such as a child or pet, to cause suffering. The decision marks the first time Spain's legal system has extended this concept to a case of animal abuse.</p>

          <p>A proposal to redevelop a 32-acre plant nursery in Woodland Hills into a cemetery and funeral home is facing opposition from some local residents. The property was sold last year to Dignity Memorial, a large funeral provider, which is now seeking city approval for the project. Residents of the affluent surrounding communities have raised concerns about traffic, property values, and the general unsettling nature of living next to a cemetery, hiring a law firm to challenge the development. The developer maintains that a cemetery is a low-impact use for the land, which is already zoned for such a purpose.</p>

          <p>Teresa Sánchez-Gordon, the new president of the Los Angeles Police Commission, brings a unique perspective to the role, shaped by her childhood experience of nearly being deported. Now 74, the retired judge and former federal public defender will help guide the LAPD's policies amid the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement. Sánchez-Gordon has expressed concern about the perception of LAPD officers working with federal agents and the fear this creates within immigrant communities. Her appointment places a figure with deep personal understanding of immigration issues at the head of the civilian body overseeing one of the nation's largest police departments.</p>

          <p>A contributor argues that Israel's severe restrictions on foreign press access to Gaza are creating a distorted narrative of the conflict. By preventing independent journalists from entering, Israel controls the flow of information and discredits the work of Palestinian journalists who are risking their lives to report from within the strip. The author, who has been denied entry herself, contends that if foreign media were present, they would witness the famine, destruction, and humanitarian crisis firsthand, directly contradicting official Israeli claims. This lack of access allows a state-controlled narrative to gain more credibility than the eyewitness accounts of those living through the events.</p>

          <p>A nearly $1-million project to install a permanent restroom facility at Runyon Canyon Park, one of Los Angeles' most popular hiking spots, is facing renewed criticism from local residents. Opponents argue that the project is fiscally irresponsible and will attract unwelcome activity, increase foot traffic, and add environmental strain to the 160-acre park. City officials, however, maintain that the bathrooms are a necessary amenity for the estimated 2 million annual visitors and that the project is funded by park fees, not the general fund.

The credit amount varies by utility provider, with customers of PG&E, Southern California Edison, and SDG&E receiving between $56 and $82.

          <p>The total amount of debt owed by customers to energy suppliers in Great Britain has climbed to a new record of £4.4 billion, according to the regulator Ofgem. This represents an increase of over £750 million compared to the previous year, with more than one million households having no repayment plan in place. The surge in debt follows recent years of high energy prices that have pushed many households into financial difficulty. Ofgem is considering new measures to address the issue, including a potential debt relief scheme that could be funded through all customers' bills. (not investment advice)</p>

By openly discussing the possibility and outlining an alternative policy prospectus, Burnham is directly questioning the government's economic direction. The article notes the path for Burnham to become leader is complex, as he would first need to win a by-election to return to Parliament. Nevertheless, his public maneuvering creates an unwelcome distraction for Starmer's government ahead of the Labour Party conference.</p>

The report suggests that Beijing's efforts to stimulate economic growth by cutting prime loan rates to historic lows are squeezing bank profitability. Unlike other banking systems that have managed low rates by diversifying revenue, Chinese lenders may have fewer options, making them more reliant on reducing credit losses.
