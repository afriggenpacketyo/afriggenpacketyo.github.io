        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's retail sector is being reshaped by a fierce rivalry in 'instant commerce,' where platforms like Alibaba's Taobao Shangou and Meituan offer rapid delivery of goods, from meals to iPhones, often in under 30 minutes. This competition has led to significant consumer subsidies, with some items costing mere pennies as companies vie for market dominance. The battle is pushing the boundaries of on-demand services beyond food, transforming consumer expectations and logistics across the country. This evolution signifies a major shift in both online and brick-and-mortar retail strategies in the world's second-largest economy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Connecticut Republican Party has condemned a Democratic school board chairman, Bill Beckert, for allegedly celebrating the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The accusation stems from Beckert reportedly reposting a social media comment that read, "They Reap What They Sow." Connecticut GOP Chairman Ben Proto described the action as grotesque and an endorsement of political violence, questioning if this is the example Farmington wants for its children. The article highlights the intense political polarization following the assassination and includes details of a similar incident involving a teacher in Florida.</p>

          <p>Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya stated that dozens of political prisoners recently freed in a U.S.-brokered deal were forcibly deported rather than genuinely released. The agreement saw 52 individuals sent to Lithuania in exchange for the U.S. lifting sanctions on Belarus's national airline. While some former prisoners expressed gratitude, others, particularly those nearing the end of their sentences, said they were exiled against their will and separated from their families. Tsikhanouskaya is urging Western governments to pressure leader Aleksandr Lukashenko to allow freed prisoners the right to remain in their home country.</p>

          <p>Boxers Saúl "Canelo" Álvarez and Terence “Bud” Crawford are set for a legacy-defining super middleweight championship fight in Las Vegas. Crawford, moving up two weight classes, surprised observers by weighing in at 167.5 pounds, matching the champion Álvarez and appearing in exceptional physical condition. The bout pits Álvarez's power and experience at higher weights against Crawford's undefeated record, speed, and technical skill. This event, held during Mexican Independence Day weekend, is highly anticipated, with Crawford aiming to become the first male boxer to be an undisputed champion in three different divisions.</p>

          <p>The Missouri state legislature has approved a new congressional map that could give Republicans an additional seat in the U.S. House. The plan, which now awaits the governor's signature, redraws districts to make the Kansas City area, represented by Democrat Emanuel Cleaver, more conservative. This move is part of a broader, Trump-endorsed Republican effort to reshape congressional maps mid-decade to protect their narrow House majority. Opponents immediately filed a lawsuit, arguing the new map is an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander that violates state requirements for compact districts and dilutes the votes of Black residents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Harvard study reveals that women who have experienced stalking or have obtained a restraining order face a significantly higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The research, which analyzed data from over 66,000 nurses for two decades, found the risk was 41% higher for stalking survivors and 70% higher for those who secured restraining orders. These associations remained even after adjusting for other factors like diet and exercise, suggesting the profound stress from these experiences directly impacts heart health. Researchers propose that these findings could lead doctors to include questions about such traumatic experiences in future cardiovascular risk screenings.</p>

          <p>Three elderly nuns in Austria, aged 82 to 88, have defiantly returned to their former convent after being moved to a care home against their will. The nuns, who are the last remaining members of the Kloster Goldenstein convent, said they were unhappy and homesick in the facility where they were placed after their community was dissolved. With assistance from former students and a locksmith, they regained access to their old apartments within the historic building. Church authorities have called the move "incomprehensible," citing the nuns' health, but the women are determined to live out their days in their lifelong home.</p>

A CBS News analysis found that X's chatbot, Grok, repeatedly misidentified the suspect before an official announcement and generated altered images of the person of interest. Other AI services, like Google's AI Overview and Perplexity, also produced inaccurate information, with one labeling the shooting a "hypothetical scenario." Experts warn that people tend to perceive AI as less biased than human sources, making the technology a powerful tool for amplifying misinformation during rapidly evolving news events.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the 2024 election results suggests that Donald Trump's improved performance with younger voters, particularly young men, was crucial to his victory, with Charlie Kirk's activism playing a significant role. Kirk's organization, Turning Point USA, focused on mobilizing this demographic, which Democrats had long considered a stronghold. According to exit polls, Trump achieved his best results with voters under 30 since 2004, even drawing even with Kamala Harris among young men. This shift, combined with Kirk's multimillion-dollar "Ballot Chasers" program in key states, helped build a more diverse and motivated coalition for the Republican ticket.</p>

The IDF said it was unaware of arson by its troops and that a complaint is under review, while noting that operational needs sometimes require using civilian homes.

          <h2>Trump Administration Proposes Ending EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 19:26:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced plans to eliminate the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, a rule in place since 2009 that requires over 8,000 industrial facilities to report their emissions. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin argued the program is unnecessary "red tape" that does not materially improve health or the environment and that its removal would save businesses billions. Environmental experts and former EPA officials counter that ending the program would blind the public and policymakers to crucial data about climate pollution from major sources like power plants and refineries. The move aligns with the administration's broader efforts to roll back climate regulations.</p>

          <p>Sean Astin, widely known for his role as Samwise Gamgee in “The Lord of the Rings,” has been elected the new national president of SAG-AFTRA, the influential union representing 160,000 performers. Astin won the election with 79% of the vote, succeeding Fran Drescher, who led the union through a major strike last year. He will now lead the union as it prepares for new contract negotiations with major studios in 2025, facing challenges from industry consolidation and the rise of artificial intelligence. Astin, whose mother Patty Duke was also a past president, expressed determination to get to work immediately.</p>

          <p>A new report from House Republicans has identified approximately 50 joint educational programs between U.S. and Chinese universities as "high-risk" and is calling for their termination. The report, from the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, argues these partnerships pose a threat by potentially advancing Beijing's military and technological capabilities. Among the flagged programs are collaborations involving prominent institutions like New York University, Johns Hopkins, and the University of Minnesota. The committee considers partnerships risky if they involve Chinese universities with links to the military or defense industries, escalating a campaign to curb academic ties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The sequel to the iconic 1984 rock-mockumentary, "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," reunites the original cast for one last concert, but struggles to recapture the magic of its predecessor. While seeing the clueless band members—Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls—reunite provides some nostalgic smiles, the film's premise is weakened by the band's now-revered status. Cameos from real-life music legends like Paul McCartney and Elton John sap the satirical tension that made the original a classic. The review suggests that while the film is an agreeable but undercooked nostalgia lap, it ultimately feels more like a collection of outtakes than a fresh comedic take.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to terminate humanitarian parole protections for approximately 430,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The decision lifts a lower court's stay, allowing the administration to end the Biden-era policies that granted these individuals temporary legal status and work authorization. The judges acknowledged the risk of irreparable harm to parolees but stated it was insufficient without a strong likelihood of success on the legal merits. This ruling is a victory for the administration's efforts to dismantle previous immigration policies, though the underlying lawsuit continues.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging the ride-hailing giant engages in a pattern of discrimination against passengers with disabilities. The suit claims Uber drivers frequently refuse service to individuals with service animals, illegally charge cleaning fees for animal shedding, and fail to accommodate mobility devices. According to the lawsuit, these actions have caused disabled individuals to miss appointments and be stranded. While Uber states it has policies prohibiting such discrimination and a hotline for complaints, the government is seeking $125 million for affected individuals to end what it calls persistent and illegal conduct.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have passed Senate Bill 79, a significant piece of legislation designed to address the state's housing crisis by allowing for denser housing development near public transit. The bill, which now heads to the governor's desk, overrides local zoning laws to permit multi-story buildings near bus and train stations, even in single-family neighborhoods. Proponents argue this is a necessary step to create more housing in existing communities, while critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, claim it is a one-size-fits-all mandate that strips local control. The bill gained crucial support after amendments were added to include union hiring requirements for certain projects.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece contrasts the responses of Utah Governor Spencer Cox and President Donald Trump to the assassination of Charlie Kirk. While Trump immediately blamed the "radical left" and called for aggressive reprisals, Cox consistently urged calm, de-escalation, and unity, framing the killing as an attack on all Americans. The article suggests Cox's measured remarks were a direct, albeit implicit, counterpoint to the president's inflammatory rhetoric. Despite Cox's efforts to appeal to the nation's "better angels," the author notes that the dominant impulse within the Republican party has been to amplify division and cast blame, reflecting a deep political schism.</p>
