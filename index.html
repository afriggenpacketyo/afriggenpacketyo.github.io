          <p>The Trump administration has officially announced new tariffs on nearly 70 trading partners, with rates ranging from 10% to over 40%. The executive order gives a seven-day grace period for implementation, intended to allow customs officials time to adjust. The tariff levels are reportedly based on the size of the U.S. trade deficit with each nation, separating partners into different tiers. This move follows through on earlier threats and aims to reshape U.S. trade policy, despite criticism about potential economic uncertainty for businesses and consumers. (not investment advice)</p>

In that case, a Chinese man attacked another Japanese mother and child, resulting in the death of a Chinese woman who intervened to protect them. The Japanese embassy in China has been contacted for comment regarding this latest event, which raises concerns about the safety of foreign nationals.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a record-breaking 6,443 drones and missiles into Ukraine during July, marking the highest monthly total since the full-scale invasion began. This represents a significant escalation, with an average of over 200 drones deployed daily, primarily the Iranian-designed Shahed variant. Despite Ukraine intercepting a high percentage of these projectiles, the relentless attacks have led to a surge in civilian casualties and terrorize the population nightly. Analysts warn that Russia's drone production capabilities are growing, posing a severe and sustained threat to Ukrainian cities and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Nations across the globe have responded to the new U.S. tariffs with a mix of relief, disappointment, and resolve. Countries like Cambodia and Thailand expressed positive sentiments after their proposed tariff rates were significantly reduced, while others like New Zealand and Switzerland voiced regret over facing higher duties. Key trading partners such as Japan and South Korea secured lower 15% rates through negotiations, but Canada faces a steep 35% tariff. The varied reactions highlight the widespread impact of the U.S. trade policy and the ongoing efforts by many countries to negotiate more favorable terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Mexican government has deployed over 7,000 military and security personnel to popular tourist areas like Cancún and the Riviera Maya to combat escalating cartel-related crime. This initiative, "Operation Summer Vacation 2025," aims to protect the millions of tourists visiting the region with land, air, and sea patrols. While intended to provide security, some experts suggest the heavy military presence might serve as a stark reminder of the underlying danger rather than a source of comfort.

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the Muhammad Ali American Boxing Revival Act, has been introduced in the U.S. Congress, potentially altering the landscape of professional boxing. The legislation proposes creating alternatives to traditional sanctioning bodies, which could empower a new boxing venture backed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and run by TKO Holdings, the parent company of UFC and WWE. Critics argue this guts key protections of the Ali Act, allowing a single promoter to control rankings and titles, similar to the UFC's controversial model. This move is seen as part of Saudi Arabia's broader strategy to gain significant influence over global sports.</p>

          <p>Nintendo has reported that its revenue more than doubled in its fiscal first quarter, largely driven by the successful launch of its new Switch 2 console.

Despite sacking the presenters, the BBC decided to air the pre-filmed series after consulting contestants, a move criticized for potentially distressing the complainants.

Successful interns will be given priority for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry route into the civil service.

          <p>El Salvador's parliament has approved constitutional reforms that remove term limits, allowing for indefinite presidential reelection. The changes, passed with a 57-3 vote by supporters of President Nayib Bukele, also extend the presidential term from five to six years and eliminate the need for a second-round runoff election. President Bukele, who has described himself as a "cool dictator," was re-elected earlier this year after the Supreme Court permitted him to bypass a previous ban on successive terms. Opposition lawmakers condemned the move, stating that democracy has died in El Salvador.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's Air Force is reporting the use of new jet-propelled Shahed-type drones by Russia in its nightly attacks. These upgraded loitering munitions, unofficially dubbed Geran-3, are believed to fly much faster than the propeller-driven models, with some estimates suggesting speeds up to 500 mph. This significant increase in speed poses a major challenge for Ukraine's air defenses, particularly for the mobile fire groups that have been effective against slower drones. If deployed en masse, these jet-powered drones could force Ukraine to expend more valuable and scarce advanced anti-air missiles to counter them.</p>

          <p>Florida's Division of Emergency Management has released a heavily redacted 33-page hurricane evacuation plan for the "Alligator Alcatraz" detention center, sparking demands for transparency from lawmakers. Key details, including the locations of alternate facilities for detainees, have been blacked out. Officials state the facility can withstand a Category 2 hurricane, but evacuation would be required for stronger storms. Critics, including Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, argue that the blacked-out document is unacceptable and that a clear, confirmed plan is needed to ensure the safety of the detainees in a major storm.</p>

          <p>Washington Commanders star wide receiver Terry McLaurin has formally requested a trade after contract extension talks with the team stalled. The 29-year-old, who is entering the final year of his contract, had previously sat out the start of training camp due to the lack of progress in negotiations. McLaurin is coming off a career year, recording 1,096 receiving yards and 13 touchdowns, and was instrumental in the team's successful season. The two-time Pro Bowl selection's request puts pressure on the Commanders to either meet his contract demands or trade a key offensive player.</p>

          <p>China and Kuwait have pledged to strengthen their military relationship, with a new joint ammunition plant in Kuwait expected to be inaugurated soon. Kuwait's deputy minister of defence called the factory a "milestone" in their cooperation during a reception at the Chinese embassy. The two nations also plan to expand joint military training programs that began in 2019. This deepening of ties is significant as Kuwait is a key U.S. ally in the Gulf, and it reflects Beijing's increasing engagement and influence in the region.</p>

          <h2>An Explainer on Tariffs and the Rationale Behind Current US Trade Policy</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the function of tariffs, which are taxes imposed on imported goods, and their role in the current U.S. administration's trade policy. President Trump has utilized tariffs as a tool to encourage domestic purchasing, boost American manufacturing, and reduce the nation's trade deficit. The policy has been applied through broad baseline tariffs, higher rates on specific countries, and taxes on certain goods like steel and cars. While the administration argues this strategy protects U.S. jobs and provides leverage in negotiations, critics point to economic volatility and increased costs for consumers.

          <p>The Trump administration has frozen nearly $200 million in federal research grants for UCLA, citing allegations of antisemitism and discriminatory practices at the university. The funding suspension, affecting an estimated 300 grants from agencies like the National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health, follows a Justice Department finding that UCLA acted with "deliberate indifference" to the civil rights of Jewish students. UCLA's chancellor called the penalty a loss for the nation and stated that defunding life-saving research does nothing to address the underlying allegations of discrimination.</p>
