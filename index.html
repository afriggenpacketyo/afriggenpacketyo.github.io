            <p>Singapore has eased its monetary policy for the second consecutive time, citing lower-than-expected GDP growth for the first quarter. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) reduced the rate of appreciation of its policy band. The country's Ministry of Trade and Industry also downgraded its GDP forecast for the year. The slowdown is attributed to declines in manufacturing and some services sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite these concerns, a majority consider the current economic climate to be influenced by Trump's policies.</p>

            <p>In a turbulent market, a bond ladder strategy offers investors a way to gain 'peace of mind' income by investing in a range of treasury maturities and holding them to maturity, offering exposure to treasury bonds without having to worry about massive short-term swings in prices and yields. The LifeX 2035 Term Income ETF (LDDR) brings the same approach into an ETF at a reasonable cost (an expense ratio of 0.25%, or 25 basis points), investing in treasuries, from 30-day issues to 10-year bonds, and has a fixed monthly income distributing roughly 11% to investors, through 2035. A U.S. treasury default is the only other reason to worry about a bond ladder strategy. (not investment advice)</p>
