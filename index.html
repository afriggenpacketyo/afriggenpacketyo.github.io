        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Japanese high court overturned a previous ruling that ordered former executives of Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc. (TEPCO) to pay damages for failing to prevent the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant crisis. The Tokyo High Court determined that it was difficult for TEPCO's management to foresee the massive tsunami that caused the disaster, thus reversing the 2022 court decision which had ordered the executives to pay around 13 trillion yen in compensation. The original ruling had held the executives liable for negligence in failing to take adequate measures to protect the plant from the tsunami. The new ruling shifts the blame away from individual executives, focusing on the unpredictable nature of the natural disaster.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Russia has lowered its key interest rate to 20%, marking the first reduction since September 2022, a signal that inflation pressures are subsiding. The rate had been at 21% since October 2024, the highest since 2013, but April's inflation rate was 6.2%, down from 8.2% in the first quarter of 2025. The central bank indicated that while domestic demand still exceeds supply capabilities, the Russian economy is gradually returning to a balanced growth path and will maintain a tight monetary policy to reach its 4% inflation target.

          <p>Robert Agius and Jamie Vella have been convicted in Malta for supplying the explosives used in the 2017 assassination of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. The two men were found guilty of complicity in the murder, joining the three hitmen already convicted for carrying out the car bombing. Caruana Galizia's reporting focused on corruption and cronyism within Malta's political and business elite, drawing international attention to the case. The Caruana Galizia family expressed that the convictions brought them closer to justice, but noted that the institutional failures that enabled her murder remain unaddressed.</p>

          <p>A security guard at Endeavor Health Evanston Hospital, near Chicago, was shot and wounded during a struggle in the emergency room. The incident began when a man, who appeared to be experiencing a mental health crisis, was brought to the hospital by the Crisis Alternative Response Evanston (C.A.R.E.) team. While in the ER, the man became agitated and lunged for his belongings, leading to a struggle with security during which a weapon was discharged. The hospital was briefly placed on lockdown, but officials confirmed there is no ongoing threat and praised the quick response of hospital personnel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Roads, railways, and bridges are facing challenges due to rising global temperatures, leading to increased maintenance and potential failures. Extreme heat can cause asphalt to melt, rail tracks to buckle, and bridge joints to expand, disrupting transportation and trade. Solutions include heat-reflective coatings for roads, lighter-colored pavements, and using more heat-resistant materials like concrete and martensite rail steel. Addressing these issues is crucial to ensure the resilience of infrastructure in a changing climate, especially as experts anticipate more record-breaking heat in the future.</p>

          <p>A recent Ipsos poll reveals that many Europeans believe their societies are in decline, with negative sentiment increasing across major economies like Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy. Economic concerns contribute to this sentiment, as a majority of respondents feel their economies are rigged to favor the wealthy. In Great Britain, over half of respondents expressed support for a strong leader who breaks the rules, contrasting with lower support in Germany and the United States. Analysts suggest this reflects widespread frustration with the status quo and declining living standards.</p>

The EU banned titanium dioxide for food use in 2022, citing concerns about neurotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and potential genetic damage.

          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered what is likely the largest intact remains of an ancient Native American agricultural site in the eastern United States, located in Michigan. Using drone technology, researchers mapped parallel rows of earthen mounds, revealing raised gardening beds used by ancestors of the Menominee Indian Tribe. The scale of the agriculture is surprisingly vast, considering the relatively poor growing conditions and the presence of wild rice nearby. The discovery challenges previous understandings of the extent and sophistication of indigenous farming practices.</p>
