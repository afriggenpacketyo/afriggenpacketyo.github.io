        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court issued a ruling that suggests Federal Reserve board members would have greater protection against presidential firings. The ruling came in a case where President Trump fired members of other federal agencies' boards, but the court explicitly addressed concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence. The court emphasized the Federal Reserve's unique structure as a quasi-private entity, indicating that any presidential attempt to remove a board member would likely face strong legal challenges. The three liberal justices dissented, but the majority opinion signaled a continued resistance to presidential overreach into the Federal Reserve's operations.</p>

The suspect, Elias Rodriguez, shouted "Free Palestine" during his arrest, leading to an investigation as a possible hate crime and act of terrorism. Lischinsky and Milgrim were reportedly about to get engaged, with Lischinsky having recently purchased a ring for a proposal in Jerusalem. President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu condemned the attack, with Netanyahu linking the incident to anti-Israeli incitement and the October 7th attacks by Hamas.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to terminate the Flores Agreement, a longstanding court settlement that ensures basic rights and services for migrant children in U.S. custody. The Justice Department argues the agreement has hindered immigration policy and incentivized illegal border crossings. The Flores Agreement requires federal immigration officials to provide safe and sanitary facilities, access to lawyers, and expeditious release for migrant children. Advocates for migrant children argue that eliminating these protections would give the government unchecked power to detain children indefinitely in secret facilities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration halted Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, citing concerns about a hostile learning environment for Jewish students. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that Harvard failed to comply with demands for information on purported misconduct of foreign students on campus. Harvard called the action unlawful, emphasizing its commitment to international students and scholars. The decision could significantly impact Harvard's finances and academic mission, as international students make up a substantial portion of the student body and contribute significantly to tuition revenue. A federal judge issued an injunction, potentially blocking the administration from terminating the legal status of international students already enrolled.</p>

          <p>A California high school athlete, Audrey Vanherweg, revealed she changes clothes in her car to avoid sharing a locker room with a transgender athlete. This decision follows another student's account of feeling traumatized by having to change in front of a biological male trans athlete. The issue of transgender athletes in girls' sports has sparked heated debate in California, with some advocating for trans inclusion and others expressing concerns about privacy and fairness. California has allowed transgender athletes to compete in girls' sports since 2014, and the CIF is under investigation for potential Title IX violations.</p>

          <p>Gas prices are expected to be at their lowest level since 2021 for the upcoming Memorial Day weekend, averaging around $3.08 per gallon. This is significantly lower than the $3.58 per gallon average from Memorial Day 2024. GasBuddy forecasts prices to remain relatively low throughout the summer, potentially dipping below $3 a gallon towards the end of the season. The lower prices are attributed to uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration's economic policies and increased oil production by OPEC+ countries. Despite lower gas prices, other vacation-related expenses, such as entertainment and dining out, have increased.</p>

          <p>Democrats are criticizing the Republican-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," claiming it benefits the wealthy while harming low-income Americans. The bill, which narrowly passed the House, extends Trump's 2017 tax cuts, increases military and border security spending, and makes cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add $3.8 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Democrats argue the bill would cause millions to lose healthcare and food assistance, while Republicans defend the measures as efforts to remove waste and abuse from assistance programs.</p>

Experts have raised ethical concerns about potential pay-to-play policymaking, as some attendees include individuals and companies with strategic policy incentives.

The study found a 7% lower risk of developing an obesity-related cancer and an 8% lower risk of death from any cause in patients taking GLP-1s compared to those taking DDP-4 inhibitors. While the difference was not statistically significant for men, women treated with GLP-1s had a notable reduction in risk.

Researchers emphasized the critical need for targeted prevention efforts and increased awareness regarding alcohol's role as a cancer risk factor.

          <p>More than 90 lorry loads of humanitarian aid have been collected by UN teams inside the Gaza Strip, following a three-day delay after Israel eased an 11-week blockade. The aid, including flour, baby food, and medical equipment, was picked up from the Kerem Shalom crossing. The UN stated that the delays were due to security concerns along the approved access route. Despite the aid deliveries, the UN emphasized that it is "nowhere near enough to meet the vast needs in Gaza," where acute levels of hunger and shortages persist.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing the creation of $1,000 "Trump accounts" for babies born during President Trump's second term, aimed at kickstarting wealth creation. These accounts, managed by financial institutions, would be invested in the stock market and could be used for specific expenses like education or starting a business. While families could contribute up to $5,000 annually, concerns have been raised about whether the accounts would provide sufficient funds for low-income families. Experts also question the tax benefits and potential penalties for early withdrawals for non-qualified expenses.</p>

The government argues the decision was necessary to maintain the joint UK-US military base on Diego Garcia, as legal challenges threatened its operability. Critics contend the government is exaggerating the legal threat and weakening UK security, while officials claim the deal prevents China from establishing a presence in the islands. The agreement has garnered support from the US and other intelligence allies, but faces scrutiny in Parliament.</p>
