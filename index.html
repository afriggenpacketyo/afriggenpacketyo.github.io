          <h2>Former Prison Guard Reflects on Executions in Japan</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A former prison guard in Japan recounts his experiences as a "noose handler," detailing the procedures involved in executions and the emotional toll it took on him. The guard, now in his 70s, says he supported the death penalty as a job but is haunted by the faces of the condemned. He explains that inmates are typically notified only one to two hours before their execution and are provided snacks and drinks, and can leave a verbal will. The Justice Ministry opened the Tokyo Detention House's execution chamber to media organizations in 2010, when the Democratic Party of Japan was in power, but has not responded to requests for further inspections since. The former prison officer pointed out that he does not know how the order of executions is determined, calling it a "black box."</p>

          <p>Zia Yusuf has resigned as chairman of Reform UK, stating that working to get the party elected is no longer a good use of his time. His resignation follows criticism of Reform UK MP Sarah Pochin for urging a burka ban, which Yusuf deemed "dumb." Nigel Farage expressed regret over Yusuf's departure, acknowledging his talent and contribution to the party's recent electoral successes. Yusuf, a former Conservative, played a key role in professionalizing the party and increasing its activist base, and his unexpected resignation has sparked internal tensions within Reform UK.</p>

          <p>Driven by concerns over ultra-processed foods, retailers and brands are increasingly offering products with fewer ingredients. This trend caters to consumers with allergies and those seeking simpler, more recognizable ingredient lists. However, some nutritionists caution against sacrificing essential nutrients in the pursuit of minimal processing. While processing ensures food safety and extends shelf life, simplifying formulas and utilizing novel processing technologies can help create less processed products without compromising nutritional value.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have tested core components of quantum-based network in space, marking a key step towards building an integrated space-ground system for secure communications. A laser module and phase encoding device were tested on a rocket flight to assess their robustness against vibration and radiation. This test is a key step in Chinaâ€™s transition from experimental validation to the construction of a fully integrated space-air-ground quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network. QSDC skips the key-sharing step and sends the actual message directly through a quantum channel, making the system more efficient and secure.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is intensifying its efforts to address homelessness through targeted sweeps of encampments and increased enforcement of illegal camping laws. City data shows nearly 1,000 people have been arrested or cited for illegal camping between June 2024 and June 2025. Mayor Daniel Lurie emphasizes that the city's focus is on providing shelter, mental health services, and drug treatment, not criminalizing poverty. While arrests are a last resort, the city's efforts have led to a visible increase in the number of sheltered homeless individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders are often denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention centers while awaiting trial. Unlike the adult system, many states do not count this time toward a juvenile's sentence, adding months to their confinement. This practice is criticized by policy experts who argue that it wastes resources and negatively impacts young people's rehabilitation. The juvenile justice system is supposed to be rehabilitative, not punitive, but this discrepancy in time credit raises concerns about fairness and due process.</p>

Despite the spectacular performance, the tour has been marked by slow ticket sales and high prices, leading to price cuts and some fan dissatisfaction. The concert included elaborate costumes, seamless transitions, and appearances from BeyoncÃ©'s daughter, Blue Ivy.</p>

Developers will be required to add panels unless buildings fall under certain exemptions, such as being covered by shade. The Home Builders Federation supports fitting more panels but cautions against burdensome paperwork that could hinder efforts to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029.</p>

The ICC has responded, saying it "deplores" the sanctions, which are "a clear attempt to undermine" its independence.
