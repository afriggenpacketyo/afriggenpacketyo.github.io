          <p>A car-ramming attack at Vancouver's annual Lapu Lapu festival, a celebration of Filipino culture, has left the community in shock and mourning, with the death toll rising to 11 and dozens injured. The suspect, a 30-year-old with a history of mental health issues, is in custody, though a motive remains unclear, but authorities do not believe this was an act of terrorism. The attack occurred at East 43rd Avenue and Fraser, prompting an outpouring of grief and support from the tight-knit Filipino community, with community members laying flowers near the scene. Acting Vancouver police chief Steve Rai called it the "darkest day" in the city's history, emphasizing the devastating impact on the community.</p>

          <p>Canada is holding a snap general election after Prime Minister Mark Carney, who succeeded Justin Trudeau, called for an early vote. The election features a tight race between Carney's Liberals and Pierre Poilievre's Conservatives, with trade tensions with the US and domestic issues like cost of living dominating voter concerns. The election uses a first-past-the-post system across 343 ridings, and the outcome could result in a minority government if no party secures a majority of seats. This election marks a significant shift, being the first in a decade without Justin Trudeau on the ballot.</p>

          <p>A BBC reporter witnessed the Myanmar junta violating a ceasefire intended to follow a devastating earthquake, repeatedly attacking civilian and rebel-held territories. The violations included rocket and mortar attacks that resulted in civilian casualties, including the death of a father of one and husband. The UN has reported that the military has continued operations after the earthquake, and beyond the ceasefire. This occurred despite the junta vowing a ceasefire after the earthquake, which killed at least 3,700 people.</p>
