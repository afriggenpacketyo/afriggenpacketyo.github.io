          <p>Attorneys for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man facing human smuggling charges, claim the U.S. government is trying to coerce him into a guilty plea by threatening deportation to Uganda. After being wrongly deported and returned to the U.S., Abrego Garcia was offered a deal to plead guilty in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, which had agreed to accept him. His lawyers allege that after he refused the deal and was released from custody, immigration officials retaliated by threatening to send him to Uganda, where his safety could be at risk, creating an ultimatum between a guilty plea or a dangerous deportation.</p>

          <p>The annual Notting Hill Carnival has begun in west London, filling the streets with vibrant costumes and music for its opening children's parade. The festivities started at dawn with J'ouvert, a tradition where participants cover themselves in colorful paint and powder to mark the start of the weekend-long celebration of Caribbean culture. The event, which has been running for over five decades, maintains its historical and community roots. A 72-second silence is planned for both days to commemorate the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire and others who have died, including Kelso Cochrane, whose murder in 1959 was a catalyst for the carnival's creation.</p>

          <p>Israeli troops allegedly opened fire and killed four Palestinians who were traveling through a military corridor to reach a food distribution point south of Gaza City. According to eyewitnesses and Al-Awda Hospital, the incident occurred when a crowd was heading toward an aid site, and gunfire erupted as some people pushed forward before its scheduled opening. This event adds to the rising death toll of civilians seeking humanitarian assistance amid a worsening famine, which was recently declared in Gaza City by a U.N.-backed initiative. The violence comes as Israel intensifies military operations in northern Gaza ahead of a planned major offensive.</p>

          <p>A judge in Mexico has ruled that boxer Julio César Chávez Jr. will stand trial for alleged ties to the Sinaloa Cartel and arms trafficking, though he may await the trial outside of detention. The charges stem from a 2019 investigation by Mexican prosecutors following a U.S. complaint against the cartel. Chávez Jr., who was recently deported from the U.S. after overstaying his visa, could face four to eight years in prison if convicted. His lawyer has dismissed the claims as "speculation," while the case highlights the Trump administration's increased pressure on Mexico to address organized crime.</p>

          <p>A new online database now provides detailed profiles of 16,000 victims of forced medical experiments conducted during the Nazi era, shedding light on one of history's darkest chapters. The research, often performed on persecuted groups in concentration camps, yielded data on topics like cold tolerance and chemical weapons that was used for decades after the war, sometimes without acknowledging its horrific origins. Medical historian Dr. Herwig Czech noted that expertise gained from these inhumane studies was even utilized in the development of NASA's space medicine program.

          <p>Archaeologists in Vence, France, have discovered an ancient baptistery dating back 1,500 years, offering new insights into early Christian rituals. The structure, found next to a previously unearthed fifth-century cathedral, features a well-preserved, cross-shaped baptismal font at its center. According to supervising archaeologist Fabien Blanc Garidel, the discovery confirms the antiquity of the bishopric of Vence and enhances understanding of religious practices in the region during the fifth and sixth centuries. The excavation also revealed several burials in the cathedral's nave, likely of religious figures from the Carolingian period, further illuminating over six centuries of the site's history.</p>

          <p>Amid declining public trust and increasing political pressure from both the left and right, American universities are facing an existential crisis that threatens their core mission. The article argues that institutions have become partisan punching bags by failing to defend academic freedom and by issuing bland, corporate-style statements on complex issues. To regain credibility and save their souls, universities must adopt a stance of institutional neutrality, protecting all forms of speech and creating an open environment for research and learning. This approach requires administrators to vigorously defend free inquiry, even for unpopular views, to restore the university's role as a space for genuine intellectual debate.</p>

          <p>Despite China's significant trade relationships with U.S. allies, such as the European Union, Beijing's recent "charm offensive" aimed at countering American pressure has failed to secure meaningful political alignment. The opinion article argues that this resistance is rooted in deep-seated factors, including shared identity, integrated security pacts, and cultural ties that bind these nations to Washington's strategic framework. While economic pragmatism is a factor, foundational security interests, like intelligence-sharing agreements and defense commitments with the U.S., remain the paramount priority. This dynamic creates an unbridgeable gap between China's global ambitions and the current geopolitical reality, where allies may seek restraint but will not support a China-led confrontation.</p>

          <p>Recent economic data indicates that the 2026 Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) may not be sufficient to keep pace with inflation, potentially diminishing the real-world purchasing power of retirees. The Senior Citizens League has updated its COLA projection to 2.7%, up from an earlier estimate of 2.1%, due to a rebound in key inflation metrics. A recent study by the league found that Social Security benefits have already lost 20% of their purchasing power since 2010. The concern is that even with an adjustment, benefit increases will lag behind the rising cost of living, continuing a trend of financial strain for seniors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a significant overhaul of the asylum appeals system to address what Home Secretary Yvette Cooper called "unacceptable delays" and reduce the reliance on housing migrants in hotels. The plan involves establishing a new body staffed by independent adjudicators to handle appeals more swiftly than the current court system, where it takes over a year on average to hear a case. With 51,000 cases pending, the government aims to speed up the process for failed asylum seekers who are accommodated at taxpayer expense during their appeal. Critics, like the Refugee Council, argue that the best way to reduce appeals is to improve the accuracy of initial decisions.</p>

The letters also show that the case reached the Jesuits' worldwide leader at the time, Pedro Arrupe, whose cause for sainthood is currently underway.

This move, along with a barrage of lawsuits and combative social media posts, marks a strategic shift for Newsom, who is now positioning himself as a national political brawler.

After 15,000 miles, his only maintenance expense for the Tesla was $600 for two new tires, highlighting that long-term savings from avoiding typical engine and transmission repairs accumulate over time.

          <p>In an opinion piece, former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy argues that despite the Trump administration's focus on fossil fuels and efforts to dismantle environmental regulations, the fight for climate action is far from over. She points out that states, cities, and corporations are continuing to push for clean energy, driven by economic benefits and public demand. McCarthy highlights that states like California, Florida, and even Texas are setting records in renewable energy capacity. She asserts that this sub-national and private-sector leadership, along with international partnerships, ensures that the U.S. remains engaged in the climate fight, regardless of federal policy.</p>

          <h2>Experts Argue for AI as a Collaborative Tool Rather Than a Replacement for Human Expertise</h2>

          <p>The discourse around artificial intelligence often focuses on its potential to automate and replace human jobs, but this article argues for a different approach: designing AI as a collaborative tool. Using examples from radiology and aviation, it explains that imperfect automation can be dangerous, as it may degrade human skills needed for critical interventions. Instead of aiming to automate entire expert roles, AI should be built to complement human strengths like context, ethics, and creativity. A collaborative AI can serve as a force multiplier, amplifying human expertise and leading to better outcomes than either humans or AI could achieve alone, especially in complex, high-stakes fields.</p>

          <p>Despite growing favorability for socialism among young Americans and Democrats, the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) struggles to translate numbers into significant political power. The article argues that the organization is hobbled by a deep internal rift between a pragmatic, mass-politics wing focused on winning elections within the Democratic Party, and a sectarian, extremist wing. This latter faction, which holds significant influence in the DSA's leadership, espouses anti-democratic and anti-Zionist views that alienate mainstream voters and popular figures like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. This ideological conflict prevents a unified national strategy, leaving the movement fragmented and politically ineffective on a larger scale.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of parents reading aloud to their young children is declining, with a recent survey showing a significant drop over the last decade. The article argues that this trend represents a loss not just for children's literacy development but for parents as well. Reading aloud is presented as a profound way for parents to connect with their children, guide their understanding of the world, and interpret their child's own developing personality. From sharing complex novels with a newborn to simple board books, the act of reading together creates a shared experience that helps parents learn to "read" their child's cues and expressions, fostering a deep, early bond.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. Open brings tennis into the spotlight, the article makes a case for it as an ideal lifetime sport due to its comprehensive health benefits. Tennis provides a full-body aerobic workout that improves bone density and cardiovascular health, with one study linking it to a nearly decade-longer lifespan compared to sedentary peers. The sport's complexity, requiring rapid decision-making and motor coordination, also offers significant cognitive advantages, enhancing reaction times and potentially staving off cognitive decline. Unlike many sports, tennis has a low risk of catastrophic injury, making it a safe and engaging activity for people of all ages.</p>

In a recent interview, Marinovich described the writing process as cathartic, allowing him to reconcile with his past and his complicated relationship with his late father, Marv. He discusses how the intense media attention from a young age created a false narrative he felt unable to escape. Now 47 and living in Hawaii, Marinovich reflects on his journey through addiction and recovery, sharing his life experiences with newfound openness.</p>

          <p>A new book proposes a novel approach to climate change: treating excess atmospheric carbon as a sacred, priceless commodity to be sequestered, much like the U.S. hoards gold in Fort Knox. The concept, developed by an anthropologist and an artist, envisions a grassroots movement of cooperative community "carbon banks." These banks would accept organic waste, convert it into a stable form like biochar, and in return, issue depositors a local digital currency. This system aims to create both a financial and a moral incentive for carbon sequestration, operating independently of government action and building a post-carbon economy from the ground up.</p>

          <p>Two decades after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, causing over 1,400 deaths and flooding 80% of the city, the disaster serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of inadequate infrastructure and preparation. The catastrophe was long predicted, with experts warning that the city's levee system was insufficient to protect it from a major storm surge. The subsequent failure of federal, state, and local responses exposed deep-seated vulnerabilities and a lack of coordination. Today, while New Orleans has a rebuilt, stronger levee system, the city has not fully recovered its population, and concerns persist about the federal government's commitment to disaster preparedness.</p>

          <p>As the new school year approaches, families are likely to face higher prices on school supplies due to President Trump's recently implemented tariffs on imports from China. A survey by the National Retail Federation found that 72% of parents expect higher prices, with many starting their shopping earlier this year out of concern. While some retailers like Target have pledged to hold prices on certain items, economists predict that the costs will ultimately be passed on to consumers. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has acknowledged that the effects of tariffs are beginning to appear in consumer prices, contradicting the administration's claims about their economic impact.

          <p>President Donald Trump and his allies are being accused of engaging in "lawfare" by using allegations of mortgage fraud to target political opponents, a strategy some experts compare to tactics used in authoritarian regimes. The effort is led by Bill Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who has publicly accused New York Attorney General Letitia James, Senator Adam Schiff, and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook of owner-occupancy fraud. Critics argue this represents a selective and politically motivated weaponization of the legal system, particularly in the case of Cook, whose position on the interest-rate-setting Fed board makes her a target for a president demanding rate cuts.</p>
