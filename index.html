          <p>Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen has summoned the top US diplomat in Copenhagen following reports of American citizens conducting covert influence operations in Greenland. The alleged aim was to promote Greenland's secession from Denmark to the US, a move previously expressed by former US President Trump. Rasmussen stated that any interference in the Kingdom of Denmark's internal affairs is unacceptable, prompting the summoning of the US charge d'affaires in the absence of an ambassador. This incident highlights ongoing foreign interest in Greenland's future and its position within the Kingdom.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has implemented a broad program of tariffs, taxes charged on imported goods, citing their role in boosting American manufacturing and protecting jobs. These tariffs, which can be passed on to consumers, are often used as a negotiating tactic in trade disputes. The article details specific tariffs on goods like steel and cars, and on countries such as India and Brazil, which have caused global economic volatility and increased prices for US consumers. Critics, including the IMF and OECD, predict negative impacts on global and US economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

A third officer was seriously injured but is recovering after surgery. A massive manhunt is underway for the suspect, Dezi Freeman (56), who is heavily armed and knows the dense bushland well. The community is in shock, and authorities have warned residents to stay indoors until he is caught. The incident has also brought renewed attention to how authorities handle extremist views, as Freeman has previously identified as a "sovereign citizen."</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets closed mixed, diverging from Wall Street, as investors evaluated China's industrial profits data for July, which showed a narrowed 1.5% decline. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw slight gains, boosted by Nikon, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 experienced losses. Secondary US tariffs of 25% on Indian shipments also took effect, increasing overall duties to 50%. Analysts noted some "irrational exuberance" in the CSI 300 but suggested any market correction would be shallow given improving liquidity and a dovish Fed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the article explores the lasting trauma experienced by its youngest survivors, now adults. The storm, which claimed 1,200 lives and displaced thousands of children, led to persistent mental health problems and disrupted community bonds, particularly in predominantly Black neighborhoods. Filmmaker E'jaaz Mason, a survivor himself, highlighted how many struggled in silence, finding healing through the documentary "Katrina Babies." The piece also warns of New Orleans' ongoing vulnerability to climate change and federal agency cuts, questioning the "resilient" narrative that may shift accountability from those in power.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK households will see their energy bills rise by an average of £35 annually starting October, as energy regulator Ofgem increases its price cap. This 2% rise is attributed to higher wholesale energy costs and new government support measures for consumers. Campaigners warn this means another winter of high energy bills, with many families already struggling and accumulating significant debt. While some fixed-price deals are available, the increase adds to broader cost of living pressures, with food costs also rising sharply.

The Air Force investigation attributed the January crash to ice in the hydraulic lines, which prevented the landing gear from deploying correctly.

          <p>China has successfully tested a new passive residual heat removal system, a crucial step towards making its next-generation nuclear power plants more meltdown-proof. The China Institute of Atomic Energy confirmed this breakthrough for integral fast reactors, which are designed for radioactive waste recycling and a closed-loop fuel cycle. Unlike conventional reactors, fast reactors use high-energy neutrons, making them more fuel-efficient and capable of breeding new fissile material. This development signifies a major advancement in China's pursuit of fourth-generation nuclear technology, enhancing safety and sustainability in nuclear energy production.</p>

          <p>Coffee companies are issuing urgent warnings as climate change and new tariffs threaten to significantly increase coffee prices for consumers. Extreme weather and prolonged droughts in top-producing nations like Brazil and Vietnam have already pushed prices to a 47-year high. Compounding this, the Trump administration has imposed substantial tariffs on goods from both countries, exacerbating economic burdens on growers and companies like Copper Cow. Efforts to adapt include experimenting with more drought-resistant coffee varieties and sustainable farming practices, but the unprecedented combination of challenges leaves the industry facing an uncertain future.

State-backed firms saw profits drop, while foreign-invested and private enterprises increased.

          <p>US President Donald Trump's new 50% tariffs on Indian exports have taken effect, posing a significant threat to India's $434 billion merchandise export economy. Analysts warn these steep duties could substantially diminish the competitiveness of Indian goods, potentially hitting the country's GDP by 0.6 percentage points and slowing growth. Key sectors most exposed include engineering goods, gems and jewelry, textiles, and electronics, which heavily rely on the US market. The tariffs, imposed over India's Russian oil purchases, could force India to diversify its export markets, a challenging prospect given its dependency on the US. (not investment advice)</p>

This retaliatory strike signals Israel's intent to respond with greater force to Houthi attacks, which began in late 2023 in solidarity with Palestinians.
