          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos was sentenced to more than seven years in prison on federal wire fraud and identity theft charges. Prosecutors stated that Santos defrauded voters and donors in New York's 3rd Congressional District by fabricating aspects of his background. The judge emphasized Santos' lack of remorse, while the U.S. Attorney highlighted the severity of his crimes. Santos expressed remorse in a statement, but the judge handed down the maximum sentence. He was ordered to pay over $575,000 in restitution.</p>
