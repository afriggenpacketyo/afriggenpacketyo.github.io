          <p>Shares in Japanese retail giant Seven & i Holdings plummeted after Canadian convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard withdrew its $47 billion takeover offer. Couche-Tard cited a "persistent lack of good faith engagement" from Seven & i's leadership as the reason for terminating the talks. Seven & i expressed disappointment, refuting the Canadian firm's claims and highlighting the complexities of the proposed deal, which some analysts noted faced hurdles due to Japan's protectionist business environment and the company's strategic national importance.</p>

          <p>A 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of southern Alaska, initially prompting a tsunami warning for the peninsula that was later downgraded to an advisory and then canceled. The quake, which occurred about 50 miles south of Sand Point, led to precautionary evacuations in some coastal towns, but authorities confirmed there was no danger of large, widespread waves. The U.S. Coast Guard and other agencies stood down their response after the threat passed, with no major damage or injuries reported from the seismic event or its multiple aftershocks.</p>

          <p>Deportation data obtained by CBS News indicates that the Trump administration's immigration enforcement has primarily targeted individuals without violent criminal histories, contrary to public messaging. Of the approximately 100,000 people deported in the first half of the year, less than 1% had homicide convictions, and a small fraction had convictions for other violent crimes like sexual assault or kidnapping. The data shows that a majority of infractions were for traffic or immigration offenses, raising questions about the administration's stated focus on removing the "worst of the worst" offenders from the country.</p>

Musk urged the president to release the files to substantiate his claim, highlighting a public rift between the two influential figures over the transparency of the government's investigation into the late sex offender.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports fell for the second straight month in June, contracting by 0.5% year-over-year and missing economists' expectations for a rise.

This downturn, exacerbated by a 25% U.S. reciprocal tariff and a steep drop in automobile exports, raises fears that Japan's export-reliant economy could enter a technical recession after contracting in the first quarter.

          <p>The Department of Justice has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. She was a highly regarded prosecutor who recently led the case against Sean "Diddy" Combs and was involved in the prosecutions of Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. Her dismissal follows a series of leadership changes in the prominent prosecutor's office and comes years after her father was fired by President Trump, who had reportedly expressed frustration about her employment within his administration.</p>

A cockpit voice recording allegedly indicates that the captain moved the fuel switches to the "cutoff" position moments after takeoff, prompting the first officer to question the action. A preliminary report had previously noted the switches were moved but did not state how, and also mentioned that both engines appeared to have been relighting just before the low-altitude crash that killed 260 people.</p>

          <p>The average cost for parents in Britain to place one child in a holiday club for the six-week summer break has risen to £1,076, according to new research from the charity Coram. Prices have increased significantly in some regions, with high demand and a shortage of more affordable council-run programs cited as key drivers. Many working families find the cost prohibitive and struggle to pay the fees upfront, as government support for those on Universal Credit is paid in arrears, highlighting a growing childcare affordability crisis during school holidays.</p>

A research note from Wolfe Research outlined several scenarios, all of which it described as a "mess" that would likely trigger an equity selloff and a spike in long-term yields. The legality of such a move is uncertain and would likely result in a court battle, potentially reaching the Supreme Court to decide if the president has the authority to remove the Fed chair for policy disagreements.

The column asserts that confirming Bove would set a dangerous precedent, compromising judicial integrity by rewarding personal fealty to a president over constitutional duty.</p>
