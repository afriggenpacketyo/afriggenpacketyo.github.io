          <p>Advanced Micro Devices announced second-quarter financial results that surpassed revenue expectations but fell short on earnings per share. The company's stock declined in after-hours trading following the news. A significant factor impacting performance was the decline in its AI business revenue, attributed to U.S. export restrictions on chip sales to China. Despite these challenges, AMD's data center and client segments showed strong year-over-year growth, and the company provided an optimistic sales forecast for the upcoming quarter.

          <p>Snap's shares fell by 15% after the company reported second-quarter earnings that failed to meet Wall Street expectations, particularly on the key metric of global average revenue per user. CEO Evan Spiegel attributed the weak performance to a flawed update to its advertising platform, the timing of Ramadan, and trade policy changes. While the company's daily active users slightly exceeded forecasts, the inability to effectively monetize its user base concerned investors. Snap did, however, provide a third-quarter revenue forecast that was ahead of analyst estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has dismissed five of the eight members of the Financial Oversight Management Board responsible for overseeing Puerto Rico's finances as the U.S. territory navigates a long-standing debt crisis. A White House official stated the move was to restore "common sense leadership" to a board deemed inefficient. The board, created under the PROMESA Act, has been central to the island's efforts to achieve fiscal solvency, though progress on major issues like the electric utility's debt has been slow. The firings have generated political reactions, with Puerto Rico's governor indicating she will work with the new appointees.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates a split in the U.S. housing market, with home prices declining in some major metropolitan areas while rising in others. Cities in the South and West, such as Austin and Miami, are seeing price drops due to a significant increase in housing inventory and a boom in pandemic-era construction. Conversely, markets in the Northeast and Midwest are experiencing continued price growth and limited supply, making conditions challenging for buyers. This regional divergence highlights how supply and demand dynamics are creating distinctly different real estate environments across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has threatened to exert federal control over Washington, D.C., stating that youth violence in the city is "totally out of control." In a social media post, he called for minors over 14 to be prosecuted as adults for violent crimes, arguing that suspects are not afraid of consequences. The president claimed that if local officials do not act quickly to make the city safer, he will "federalize this City" to restore order. His comments follow several high-profile violent incidents in the D.C. area involving young people.</p>

          <p>Fire authorities in California are on high alert as an impending heat wave threatens to worsen several large wildfires already burning across the state. The warming trend is expected to bring triple-digit temperatures to many inland areas, drying out vegetation and increasing the risk of new fires starting and spreading rapidly. Major blazes, including the state's largest of the year, the Gifford fire, are challenging crews with difficult conditions and have prompted evacuations. Officials warn that while strong winds are not in the forecast, the combination of extreme heat and low humidity creates a dangerous environment.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle manufacturer Lucid Group reported second-quarter financial results that fell short of Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations, causing its stock to drop in after-hours trading. The company also softened its full-year production forecast, lowering its target from 20,000 vehicles to a range of 18,000 to 20,000, citing a challenging year with supply chain constraints. Despite the setbacks and increasing cash burn as it ramps up its new Gravity SUV, Lucid highlighted a recent $300 million investment from Uber and its focus on disciplined cost management.

The piece contends that while some sensational rumors proved false, the core of the Russia investigation was not a hoax but a response to real events.

A CD, in contrast, offers a guaranteed fixed rate, providing certainty but sacrificing liquidity.

          <p>In an NPR interview, David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report discussed the intense political dynamics behind the current push for congressional redistricting, particularly in states like Texas. Wasserman explained how the fight over redrawing electoral maps has become a high-stakes battle with the potential to determine control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections and beyond. He elaborated on the strategies being employed by both Republican and Democratic parties as they seek to maximize their political power through gerrymandering. The conversation highlights the significant national implications of these state-level legislative fights.</p>

          <p>The Oval Invincibles began their title defense in The Hundred cricket competition with a decisive six-wicket victory over London Spirit at Lord's. After choosing to bat, London Spirit collapsed, getting bowled out for just 80 runs, the second-lowest men's score in the tournament's history. Invincibles' bowler Rashid Khan was the standout performer, taking three wickets for only eleven runs, well-supported by Sam Curran's three wickets. Despite a challenging pitch, the Invincibles comfortably chased down the small target with 31 balls remaining, marking a dominant start to their season.</p>

          <p>A dramatic political fight is unfolding in Texas as Democrats have fled the state to block a Republican vote on redrawing the state's congressional electoral map. This article explains that the proposed changes, pushed by President Trump, could create five new Republican-leaning districts, a shift significant enough to potentially decide the balance of power in the U.S. House. The conflict has escalated with the Republican governor threatening arrests, and it could trigger a redistricting "arms race" as Democratic-controlled states like California and New York vow to respond with their own partisan gerrymandering.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that former Vice President Kamala Harris, despite speculation about another presidential run, is not the right person to solve the Democratic Party's deep unpopularity. The author points out that the party is viewed unfavorably even by many of its own supporters for losing to Donald Trump and failing to be an effective opposition. The column suggests Harris symbolizes this discontent, as she is a politician best known for losing and has struggled to appeal to voters beyond the party's progressive base. The piece concludes that nominating her again would likely lead to another defeat.</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance for homeowners thinking about borrowing $100,000 against their home's equity using a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). It advises owners to ask critical questions before proceeding, such as whether looming interest rate cuts are guaranteed and how those cuts would actually impact their monthly payments. Given the variability of HELOC rates, the piece also suggests that borrowers should carefully consider if a fixed-rate home equity loan might be a more stable and suitable alternative. The central message is to approach borrowing against home equity judiciously. (not investment advice)</p>
