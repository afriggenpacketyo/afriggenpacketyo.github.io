          <p>U.S. prosecutors have officially charged a suspect with first-degree murder and hate crimes for the May shooting of two Israeli embassy employees in Washington D.C. The Department of Justice is also exploring the possibility of pursuing the death penalty against the 31-year-old suspect, Elias Rodriguez. He is accused of fatally shooting Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim outside the Capital Jewish Museum, allegedly shouting "Free Palestine" during his arrest. The indictment details that Rodriguez had expressed anti-Israel sentiments online and traveled from Chicago with a handgun after researching the museum event the victims attended.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to increase tariffs on Indian goods to 50% could significantly impact India's economy, particularly in sectors like gems, jewelry, apparel, and textiles. The move, a response to India's oil trade with Russia, puts an estimated $8 billion worth of exports at risk. However, economists note that the 21-day implementation window may provide an opportunity for negotiation. Key sectors such as IT services and pharmaceuticals, which are major exports to the U.S., are not targeted by the current duties, potentially insulating parts of the Indian market from the full impact.

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to impose a tariff of approximately 100% on imported computer chips and semiconductors, a move that could significantly increase prices for consumer electronics and automobiles. The president specified that companies building manufacturing facilities in the United States would be exempt from this import tax. This policy represents a shift from the subsidy-based approach of the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, favoring punitive measures to incentivize domestic production. The announcement was made during a White House meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook, highlighting the administration's focus on reshoring critical supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bomb threat prompted the temporary evacuation of a hotel in St. Charles, Illinois, where Texas Democratic lawmakers are staying. The legislators left their state to prevent a quorum needed for a vote on a controversial Republican-led redistricting bill. No device was found after a thorough search, and all guests safely returned. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker stated that law enforcement is investigating the threat, which he linked to a right-wing podcaster who revealed the lawmakers' location. The incident adds tension to the ongoing political standoff over Texas's congressional maps.</p>

          <p>The head of the UK's Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) predicts a record number of 18-year-old domestic students will secure their first-choice university placement this year. This is partly due to uncertainty surrounding international student enrollment, which is making UK undergraduates a more stable and desirable option for universities' financial planning. Consequently, institutions may be more flexible, potentially accepting students who narrowly miss their required grades. The trend comes as tuition fees for English and Welsh students are set to rise for the 2025-26 academic year for the first time since 2017.</p>

          <p>Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani delivered one of his best all-around performances of the season, striking out eight batters over four innings and hitting his 39th home run. Despite his efforts, the Los Angeles Dodgers lost 5-3 to the St. Louis Cardinals due to a bullpen collapse in the later innings. The article highlights the ongoing challenge Ohtani faces in balancing elite-level hitting and pitching, a feat rarely attempted since Babe Ruth. While his pitching has been solid, his offensive production has seen a noticeable decline since he began pitching for the Dodgers, sparking debate about the sustainability of his dual role.</p>

The situation is viewed as a significant missed opportunity by housing charities, especially as homelessness figures remain high.

          <p>The Bank of England is widely expected to announce an interest rate cut on Thursday, lowering the benchmark rate from 4.25% to 4%. This would be the fifth reduction since last August and would bring borrowing costs to their lowest point since March 2023. While this move could reduce monthly payments for homeowners with variable-rate mortgages, it will likely mean lower returns for savers. The decision comes amid signs of a cooling UK economy, with stagnant growth in April and May and a slowing labor market, even as inflation remains above the Bank's 2% target.

While violent crime in D.C. has recently declined, the incident provided a political opening for the president to act on previous threats to exert more control over the nation's capital.

Research from new excavations suggests that some survivors, possibly unable to afford relocating, resettled among the ruins. This post-eruption settlement is described as a 'precarious' and informal community that existed until the 5th century. The inhabitants are thought to have lived in the upper floors of buried buildings, using the lower levels as cellars, and likely scavenged for valuable materials within the ash-covered city, challenging the long-held belief that the site was completely abandoned.</p>

While the USACE stated the action met operational criteria and did not require a deviation from normal procedure, the news has raised ethical questions. Critics suggest it represents a potential misuse of public resources for personal recreation, especially given the administration's focus on budget cuts for government services.</p>

          <p>England all-rounder Chris Woakes has been widely praised for his courage after emerging to bat with a suspected dislocated shoulder during the final day of the fifth Test against India. Despite his arm being in a sling, Woakes came to the crease with England needing 17 runs to win, stating he 'wouldn't have been able to live with himself' if he didn't try. He did not face a ball but managed to run four times before his partner was dismissed, resulting in a narrow six-run victory for India. Woakes, who is now in doubt for the upcoming Ashes series, said the support from the public has helped him cope with the devastating loss.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. suggests that the recent Eaton and Palisades fires in Los Angeles County may have led to far more deaths than officially reported. Researchers estimate there were 440 'excess deaths'—fatalities above the expected average—between January 5 and February 1, a period encompassing the fires. This figure is more than 14 times the official coroner's count of 31. The study argues that the higher number reflects the broader health impacts of the disaster, such as poor air quality and disruptions to medical services, which are often not captured in official tallies.</p>

In a strange turn of events, a park official reported that the same woman was arrested the following day after she returned and attempted to climb back onto the same roof.

          <p>On the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, new photo comparisons illustrate the city's transformation from utter devastation to a thriving metropolis. The article recounts the events of August 6 and 9, 1945, when the U.S. dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, leading to Japan's surrender and the end of World War II. By the end of 1945, an estimated 210,000 people had died from the blasts and radiation. Today, as both cities stand rebuilt, the mayor of Hiroshima used the anniversary to warn against rising global tensions and the renewed acceptance of nuclear weapons as a means of defense.</p>

          <p>E.l.f. Beauty's net income fell by 30% in its first fiscal quarter, a drop the cosmetics company attributes to the impact of new U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. The company, which sources about 75% of its products from China, saw its net income fall to $33.3 million. Citing the volatility and uncertainty of the tariff situation, E.l.f. declined to provide a full-year financial forecast. Despite the profit decline and slowing revenue growth, the company's results still surpassed Wall Street's expectations, and its CEO noted that it continues to gain market share in a challenged consumer environment.

          <p>This article examines the potential returns for savers placing $10,000 in either a 6-month certificate of deposit (CD) or a money market account in the current interest rate environment. While rates are currently similar, a CD offers a fixed rate, guaranteeing a predictable return, whereas a money market account's rate is variable and likely to decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. Based on current rates, a 6-month CD would yield slightly more, and this advantage could grow if market rates fall. The analysis suggests that for savers prioritizing maximum guaranteed returns over liquidity, a CD may be the preferable option. (not investment advice)</p>
