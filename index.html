          <p>Jannik Sinner secured his first Wimbledon championship by defeating Carlos Alcaraz in a compelling four-set final. This victory marks a significant comeback for the 23-year-old Italian, who had suffered a heartbreaking loss to Alcaraz at the French Open just five weeks prior after holding championship points. The article highlights Sinner's emotional and mental resilience, noting how he processed the previous defeat and overcame challenges, including a past doping ban and a mid-tournament injury scare, to claim the prestigious title. His win solidifies his rivalry with Alcaraz as a defining feature of modern men's tennis.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee report has condemned the U.S. Secret Service for a "cascade of preventable failures" leading to the assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. The investigation found that significant communication breakdowns were a primary cause, citing a 25-minute delay in disseminating a report about the shooter's presence before the attack. The report also highlights organizational mistakes, such as a countersniper team having an obstructed view, and accuses the agency of denying resources to Trump's detail. The Secret Service has acknowledged the failures and stated it is implementing reforms and has disciplined six employees.</p>

          <p>In an address to the CNBC Investing Club, Jim Cramer urged investors to separate their personal politics from their financial decisions, particularly regarding the Trump administration. He posits that despite personal reservations one might have about the president, the market has shown resilience, driven by individual investor confidence and pro-business policies. Cramer suggests that factors like deregulation, a favorable environment for mergers, and the deflationary impact of artificial intelligence are creating bullish conditions. He argues these economic forces may outweigh the inflationary risks of tariffs, creating opportunities for investors regardless of their political leanings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new "Superman" film, written and directed by James Gunn, launched with a strong $122 million opening weekend at the box office in the U.S. and Canada. The debut is a significant one for DC Studios, which has seen recent superhero films underperform and is counting on this movie to reset its cinematic universe. The article notes this is the first DC film to surpass a $100 million opening since 2017's "Wonder Woman." While the domestic take was strong, its international performance was more subdued, earning $95 million in 78 markets.</p>

          <p>Muhammadu Buhari, a former president and one-time military ruler of Nigeria, has died at the age of 82 after battling an illness in London. A towering and often polarizing figure, Buhari's career spanned from a repressive military dictatorship in the 1980s to a historic democratic victory in 2015. His first term was known for a harsh anti-corruption drive, while his later presidency was marked by economic decline and widespread insecurity, despite his "converted democrat" image. Though his legacy is fraught with disappointment for many, he retained a loyal following, particularly in Nigeria's north.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators, led by Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal, is advancing a sanctions bill described as a "sledgehammer" to pressure Russia into ending the war in Ukraine. The legislation would grant President Trump the authority to impose massive tariffs on countries like China, India, and Brazil that economically support Russia's war effort. The move comes as President Trump expresses growing frustration with Vladimir Putin and is reportedly considering new aid for Ukraine. The senators believe this strong economic leverage is necessary to force Putin to the negotiating table. (not investment advice)</p>

The 57-year-old worker, Jaime Alanis, died from injuries sustained after falling from a greenhouse roof while allegedly trying to evade Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. The raid on two large cannabis farms resulted in around 200 arrests and claims of forced child labor. Homan emphasized that the man was not in ICE custody at the time of the fall and that agents were simply "doing their job."</p>

          <p>A Senate report reveals that prior to the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service denied or left unfulfilled at least ten requests from Donald Trump's security detail for additional resources. These requests included enhanced drone countermeasures, more counter-assault team personnel, and additional snipers. The report accuses former Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle of falsely testifying to Congress that no requests were denied for the Butler rally. The findings point to a pattern of inadequate support and a lack of a formal process for resource requests within the agency.</p>

The Washington Democrat, who chairs the committee overseeing NOAA, plans to send bipartisan recommendations to the president for upgrading forecasting infrastructure. She argues that a one-time investment in better technology, such as Doppler radar and data analytics, could provide earlier and more accurate warnings for floods, tornadoes, and fires. Cantwell emphasized that such federal investment is crucial to prevent future tragedies like the one that occurred in Kerr County.</p>
