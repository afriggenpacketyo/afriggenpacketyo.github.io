        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has requested the Supreme Court's permission to deport nearly 200 Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas, citing the Alien Enemies Act. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that these migrants, alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang, pose a significant threat to safety and security in detention facilities, with reports of hostage threats and violence against staff. The administration asserts that the migrants have been given adequate notice and opportunity to pursue legal challenges. The solicitor general said the court should modify its recent temporary block to "clarify" that the order only bars removal of the class members under the AEA.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read trial, the defense has presented a theory suggesting that a 'jealous' Brian Higgins may have been involved in the death of John O'Keefe. The defense argues that flirty text messages between Read and Higgins leading up to O'Keefe's death indicate a possible motive for Higgins to confront O'Keefe. The defense questioned Sgt. Yuri Bukhenik of the Massachusetts State Police about this possibility, highlighting Higgins' presence at the bar the night of O'Keefe's death and unanswered texts to Read. The trial continues to explore various angles and testimonies surrounding the events of January 29, 2022.</p>

          <p>A China-led international research team has analyzed seismic waves from 'marsquakes' and meteorite impacts recorded by NASA's InSight lander, revealing a mysterious zone in the Martian crust that suggests a layer of water-saturated rock. This underground layer, located between 5.4km and 8km deep, could contain a significant amount of water, potentially matching what scientists believe to be Mars' missing water. The findings offer new insights into Mars' water cycle and the potential for habitable environments on the planet. If confirmed, this discovery could reshape our understanding of Mars' geological history and future prospects for exploration.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses how German companies are reassessing their investments in the United States due to ongoing trade disputes and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Despite a long history of German companies producing goods in the U.S., recent surveys indicate a pullback in investment and a more pessimistic outlook. Many German firms are now considering keeping their investments at home, especially with a new government in Germany focused on reducing bureaucracy and energy prices. The automotive sector, heavily invested in the U.S., has been particularly affected by the tariffs.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's offer to mediate between India and Pakistan over Kashmir has placed India in a tight spot, given its long-standing opposition to third-party involvement. The offer followed a ceasefire brokered by the U.S. after cross-border clashes. While Pakistan welcomed Trump's offer, India has historically insisted on bilateral negotiations, citing the Simla agreement of 1972. The situation is further complicated by India's hardened stance on Kashmir since revoking its special status in 2019. The main opposition Congress party has demanded an explanation from the government regarding the shift in diplomatic channels.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports on an underwhelming auction of the Riggio family art collection, signaling potential caution for the art market. Despite a $272 million total, the sale lacked enthusiastic bidding and fell short of pre-sale expectations, attributed to economic uncertainty surrounding President Trumpâ€™s tariffs. A Mondrian painting, the top lot, sold for $47.6 million, below the previous record for the artist. While some paintings performed well, the withdrawal of a major Warhol painting highlighted weakness in that market. The auction's results suggest a shift from the frothy art market of 2022.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has defended his administration's plan to receive a luxury jumbo jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One, citing the U.S.'s support for the country's security. The move has drawn criticism due to legal and ethical concerns, including the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which restricts gifts from foreign governments. While some Republicans have made light of the situation, Democrats have called for investigations. The White House maintains that any gift is accepted in full compliance with applicable laws.</p>

Newsom emphasized that there are no more excuses for inaction, calling on cities and counties to address encampments and provide alternatives. The model ordinance requires policies to prioritize shelter and services while allowing local authorities to clear encampments. The effort is supported by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding. Newsom's focus on homelessness comes as he approaches the end of his term and amidst speculation about his political future.</p>

Central banks have been net buyers of gold, seeking independence from dollar-based banking systems. Some experts forecast continued upward trends, while others caution about a potential market bubble. Investors should consider diversifying their portfolios and avoid short-term speculation.</p>
