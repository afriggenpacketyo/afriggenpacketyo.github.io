          <p>Index funds have long dominated the market, but active management is making a comeback as investors are increasingly engaging in active trading, particularly within exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Data indicates a net outflow from equity ETFs overall, but active equity ETFs saw inflows, suggesting a transformation in the ETF space. Experts note a record number of ETFs launching, with active ETFs rivaling index ETFs in number, and investors are allocating more capital to actively managed funds. Investors are advised to identify funds with unique approaches and consider factors like R-squared to gauge a fund's active nature. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A girls' track meet in Maine has ignited controversy following a trans athlete's success in multiple running events, amid ongoing legal and political tensions over transgender athletes' participation in girls' sports. The athlete, competing for North Yarmouth Academy, won both the 800-meter and 1600-meter races, leading to widespread debate and prompting reactions from state representatives and conservative activists. The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against Maine over its policies on transgender athletes, while state officials defend their inclusive approach based on the Maine Human Rights Act. The article notes that a survey indicates a majority of Maine voters believe sports participation should be based on biological sex.</p>

          <p>Since Donald Trump's return to power, the administration has dismissed tens of thousands of federal workers, particularly probationary employees, leading to legal challenges and court-ordered reinstatements, creating a state of limbo. The administration cited efficiency as the goal, but a federal judge deemed the mass dismissals a sham, and the office of special counsel dropped its inquiry into the firings. The Partnership for Public Service estimates the firings, rehirings, and lost productivity will cost upwards of $135 billion this fiscal year. Concerns are rising about the loss of expertise and the impact on government functions, with some workers feeling demoralized and expecting further layoffs.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have arrested relatives of Carmen Lau, a former Hong Kong politician who protested against China's new "mega-embassy" in London. Lau, who fled Hong Kong five years ago, spoke at a rally against the embassy plans, leading to the detention of her aunt and uncle in Hong Kong. The relatives were questioned about Lau's connections to Hong Kong, with Lau claiming this harassment is a method by the Chinese regime to stop her "anti-Chinese" activities in the UK. Lau had previously been placed on a wanted list by Hong Kong authorities, and her neighbors in Berkshire received a note offering money for information about her.</p>

          <p>Dozens of U.S. arts organizations have had their government grants terminated after Donald Trump proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). The NEA is updating its grant-making policy to focus on projects that align with the president's priorities, such as celebrating the 250th anniversary of American independence and supporting historically Black colleges and universities. Democrats and arts unions have criticized the proposed cuts, arguing they would be disastrous for public access to creative expression. Several organizations, including a playhouse in Portland, Oregon, and Yale's repertory theater, have reported receiving notices of grant cancellation.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to respond after a missile fired by the Houthi group in Yemen struck near Israel's main airport, causing injuries and temporarily halting flights. The Houthi military spokesperson claimed the airport was "no longer safe for air travel." The Israeli Air Force is investigating the failure to intercept the missile. Several airlines have canceled flights to and from the airport. The Houthis have regularly launched missile attacks at Israel in solidarity with Hamas in Gaza.</p>
