          <p>The entire Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board resigned, asserting that the Trump administration interfered with their authority to award scholarships. The board stated that the State Department denied Fulbright awards to selected individuals for the 2025-2026 academic year. They also claimed the administration subjected 1,200 foreign Fulbright recipients to an unauthorized review process, potentially leading to further rejections. The board believes these actions contradict the Fulbright mission and values, including free speech and academic freedom, as specified by Congress.</p>

          <p>An associate director at Vox, born and raised in Los Angeles, offers a counter-narrative to the media's portrayal of the city as a war zone overrun by immigrants. She emphasizes the vital contributions of immigrants, particularly Latinos, to the city's identity, culture, and economy, highlighting their resilience and camaraderie. The author contrasts this with President Trump's depiction of Los Angeles as a lawless place requiring federal intervention, arguing that the media often overlooks the positive aspects of immigrant communities and their struggles. The piece underscores the importance of acknowledging the humanity and sacrifices of immigrants who have quietly built Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>According to a European Central Bank report, gold became the second-largest global reserve asset in 2024, driven by central banks' increasing appetite for the precious metal. Central banks amass liquid assets like gold as a hedge against inflation and to diversify their holdings, and the metal is now second only to the U.S. dollar in value terms. China, India, and Turkey have been major buyers, and geopolitical and economic uncertainty have spurred a flight to safe-haven assets, particularly since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Analysts suggest that central bank purchases may cool in the coming months, but many tailwinds that have propelled gold still remain. (not investment advice)</p>

Apple initiated legal action after receiving a notice from the Home Office seeking the right to access information secured by its Advanced Data Protection system.

Opinions on the US and its democracy, as well as on President Trump's leadership, varied widely depending on ideological alignment.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under increasing pressure as coalition partners from ultra-Orthodox parties consider supporting an opposition motion. The motion concerns rules that exempt most religious students from serving in the military, a contentious issue in Israeli politics. The potential defection of these parties could lead to the dissolution of parliament and trigger new elections, creating further instability in the Israeli government.</p>

          <p>Disney and Universal have jointly filed a lawsuit against artificial intelligence image creator Midjourney, alleging copyright infringement for the unlicensed use of their characters.

          <p>The annual inflation rate in the U.S. increased slightly in May to 2.4%, driven by a rise in grocery prices, which was partially offset by lower gasoline prices. Economists anticipate that President Trump's tariff policy will likely increase consumer prices in the coming months, although the impact remains muted for now. The consumer price index rose 0.1% from April to May, and the monthly rate is consistent with bringing inflation down to the Federal Reserve's long-term target. The healing of supply chains and a weakening labor market are also contributing to the moderation of inflation.</p>

The Department of Justice filed an amicus brief supporting Trump's request, citing the United States' strong interest in the issues presented.
