          <p>Following the assassination of a conservative activist, Senators Chris Coons and James Lankford appeared together in a bipartisan call to lower the nation's political temperature. They identified the internet and social media algorithms as significant accelerants driving extremism and division by promoting the loudest and angriest voices. The senators advocated for legislative action, such as the Kids Online Safety Act, to mitigate online harms and protect children from radicalization. They emphasized that leaders have an obligation to urge respect and discourse over political violence, fostering a safer environment for public debate and service.</p>

          <p>University of Chicago Professor Robert Pape describes the current U.S. political climate as a "watershed moment" for "violent populism," marked by rising political violence and growing public support for it. He argues that while the internet acts as an accelerant, the root cause is a major demographic shift from a white-majority to a white-minority democracy, which radicalizes politics on both the right and the left. Pape contends this trend will likely worsen over the next decade if left unaddressed. He calls for political leaders from all sides to publicly and jointly condemn violence to restrain their constituents.</p>

          <p>Bobby Hart, a prolific songwriter who, with his partner Tommy Boyce, wrote some of the biggest hits for the 1960s television pop group The Monkees, has died at the age of 86. The duo was responsible for iconic songs such as the band's theme, "(Theme from) The Monkees," and their first number-one single, "Last Train to Clarksville." They also penned the classic "(I'm Not Your) Steppin' Stone," which was later covered by the Sex Pistols. Hart's contributions as both a writer and producer were instrumental in crafting the signature sound of The Monkees during their peak.</p>

          <p>The small town of Stanley, Idaho, narrowly avoided destruction by two major wildfires in 2024, an experience that highlights the growing threat fires pose to communities across the American West. The article revisits the town's survival, which depended on heroic firefighting and favorable weather, and uses it as a case study for the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires due to climate change. Residents and officials reflect on the economic devastation and the realization that even with significant resources, communities are not as secure as they once thought. The key question remains how to adapt and thrive in a fire-prone environment.</p>

          <p>The Venezuelan government has accused the United States of a "direct provocation" after a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Jason Dunham, allegedly detained a Venezuelan tuna fishing boat in its exclusive economic zone. According to Caracas, the warship deployed 18 armed agents who boarded and occupied the vessel with its nine fishermen for eight hours in the Caribbean Sea. Venezuela condemned the incident as a hostile act intended to escalate tensions and justify military action aimed at regime change. This event occurs amid heightened friction, as Washington has increased its military presence in the region to target drug cartels.</p>

          <p>New York Giants offensive lineman James Hudson III had a difficult start to the game against the Dallas Cowboys, accumulating four penalties for 30 yards on the team's opening drive alone. His miscues proved costly, potentially taking points off the board for the offense. One notable penalty for unnecessary roughness occurred when Hudson took an open-handed swing at Cowboys pass-rusher James Houston. Another penalty on Hudson nullified a 35-yard pass, forcing the Giants to settle for a field goal instead of a potential touchdown opportunity in the crucial divisional matchup.</p>

          <p>In municipal elections held in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state, the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) of Chancellor Friedrich Merz emerged as the strongest party. However, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) saw a significant surge in support, more than tripling its share of the vote from 16.5% compared to 5.1% in 2020. The results are viewed as a key test for the national governing coalition, indicating a rightward shift in the electorate. Meanwhile, the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and especially the Green Party experienced notable losses, with the Greens dropping from 20% to around 11.5%.</p>

          <p>The popularity of "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services like Affirm and Klarna is surging, with an estimated 91.5 million American users expected by 2025. These services, which allow consumers to split purchases into interest-free installments, pose a direct challenge to the revenue models of traditional credit card companies by diverting transaction activity. For banks and credit rating agencies, the trend creates a significant challenge, as BNPL loans are often not reported to credit bureaus, creating what one expert calls a "giant black hole" in a consumer's credit profile.

          <p>This poem by Ashley M. Jones, from her new book "Lullaby for the Grieving," reflects on the enduring power of language, faith, and song for African Americans throughout history. It traces a journey from the holds of slave ships, through oppression where reading and writing were forbidden, to the Civil Rights Movement in Birmingham. The poem frames historical figures and everyday people as messengers carrying a divine word, using their hands, voices, and spirits to create and persevere. It concludes with a powerful affirmation of collective resilience, describing the community as a "living tongue" and an "unstoppable song."</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel to address significant diplomatic tensions. The visit aims to manage the fallout from a recent Israeli missile strike in Doha, Qatar, that targeted Hamas leaders but also killed a Qatari security officer, angering the key U.S. ally. Rubio's mission is to convey President Trump's displeasure with the strike while reaffirming broad U.S. support for Israel, especially as it faces international criticism over the war in Gaza. The incident has strained relationships with Arab nations and prompted an emergency summit.</p>
