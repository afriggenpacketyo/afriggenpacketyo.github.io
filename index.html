          <p>Russia has accused Ukraine of conducting drone attacks that caused a fire at the Kursk nuclear power plant, though officials state the blaze was extinguished without casualties and with normal radiation levels. The alleged attacks coincided with Ukraine's Independence Day, where President Zelenskyy vowed to continue fighting for a just peace and received messages of support from international allies. Several nations, including Norway, Canada, and the UK, have pledged continued military and financial aid to Ukraine as the conflict continues. The UN's atomic agency has reiterated its call for maximum restraint around all nuclear facilities.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $750 million for the upcoming Monday drawing after no ticket matched all six numbers on Saturday night. This prize now stands as the tenth-largest in the history of the lottery, with a cash value option of approximately $338.6 million. While there was no grand prize winner, several tickets won smaller prizes, including three tickets that matched five numbers for $1 million each, with one doubling to $2 million due to the Power Play option. The drawing marks the 37th consecutive round without a jackpot winner since May.</p>

          <p>The White House has issued a list of "objectionable" art and programs at the Smithsonian Institution, targeting works that focus on race, immigration, and sexuality, prompting a review to align the museums with the administration's cultural directives. Artists and scholars whose work was singled out have responded with a mix of fear and defiance, with some calling the scrutiny a "badge of honor" while others worry about a chilling effect on artistic expression. The move has drawn comparisons to historical censorship and critics fear this pressure could lead to self-censorship within the broader museum and gallery community.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Foreign and Domestic Policies Are Driven by Personal Interests</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Critics and political analysts argue that President Trump's policy decisions, both foreign and domestic, are consistently filtered through the prism of his personal self-interest rather than a coherent ideology. This approach was highlighted by his recent summit with Vladimir Putin, where he appeared to accept the Russian leader's views on the 2020 US election, subsequently directing lawyers to draft an executive order against mail-in voting. This pattern of conflating personal grievances with national policy is seen as a departure from presidential norms, raising alarms about his vulnerability to manipulation by foreign adversaries and his tendency to denigrate predecessors.</p>

          <p>The animated Netflix movie "KPop Demon Hunters" is experiencing massive success, transitioning from the streaming platform to sold-out singalong screenings in nearly 1,800 theaters for a special weekend event. The film, about a fictional all-girl rock band fighting evil spirits, is on track to become Netflix's most-watched movie ever, with its soundtrack dominating music charts. This unusual move for a streaming-first film is seen as both a reward for its dedicated fanbase and a strategic promotion to broaden its audience.

          <p>North Korea has test-fired two newly developed types of missiles designed to target aerial threats like drones and cruise missiles, according to state media. The tests were personally overseen by leader Kim Jong Un and occurred as the United States and South Korea were conducting their annual "Ulchi Freedom Shield 25" joint military exercises. A North Korean military official condemned the drills as reckless actions by "warmongers" that are destabilizing the region and pushing tensions to an extreme level. This follows Kim Jong Un's recent call for a "rapid expansion of nuclearization" in response to the joint exercises.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that China must adopt a more pragmatic approach and view India as a partner rather than a rival to reset bilateral relations at a critical juncture. Recent high-level diplomatic exchanges, including a visit by Foreign Minister Wang Yi to New Delhi, have shown encouraging signs of re-engagement after a period of tension marked by unresolved territorial disputes. The piece suggests that global economic uncertainties and shifting geopolitics, such as new US tariffs on India, present a strategic opportunity for the two nations to find common ground. Restarting talks on India's participation in the RCEP is proposed as a crucial step towards constructive collaboration.</p>

In their apology, the organizers pledged to make a substantial donation to humanitarian relief efforts for the Palestinian people.

          <p>The UK government is planning to overhaul sentencing rules in England and Wales, allowing courts to impose broader restrictions on individuals serving non-custodial sentences. Under the proposed reforms, offenders could be barred from pubs, concerts, and sports matches, and could also face driving and travel bans or be ordered to remain in specific areas, even if the restrictions are unrelated to their crime. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated the changes are intended to toughen up community punishments and restrict criminals' freedom.

Others have expressed concern over American isolationism and political polarization, suggesting these trends undermine democracy and hand advantages to geopolitical rivals.

While some brands are attempting to create provocative ads to capture attention in a crowded market, the risk of alienating consumers is high.

          <h2>UK Government Announces Overhaul of Asylum Appeals System to Reduce Delays</h2>

          <p>The UK government is planning a significant overhaul of the asylum appeals system to address what Home Secretary Yvette Cooper called "unacceptable delays" and reduce the reliance on housing migrants in hotels. A new, independent body staffed by adjudicators will be established to hear cases more quickly, as the current average wait time for an appeal is over a year, with 51,000 cases pending. The move comes amid increasing public and political pressure over the use of asylum hotels, which currently house 32,000 people. The government aims to end hotel use within this parliament and believes the new system will be more efficient than the courts.</p>

          <p>In a milestone for cultural heritage collaboration, a Chinese archaeological team from the Shanghai Museum will lead an excavation project at the ruins of the Sekhmet Temple in Egypt. The temple is part of the ancient Memphis archaeological site, which dates back over 5,100 years and was once the capital of ancient Egypt. The Chinese team selected this site after surveying multiple locations during a research trip last year. This joint effort marks a significant step in international scientific and cultural exchange, allowing Chinese experts to delve into the rich history of one of Egypt's most important ancient religious centers.</p>

          <p>In Estonia, citizens are increasingly participating in civil defense organizations like the Women's Voluntary Defense Organization (Naiskodukaitse) to prepare for a potential Russian invasion. Since Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine began, membership has surged, with volunteers learning skills in first aid, military tactics, and safety. Despite the proximity to Russia and recent acts of sabotage like GPS jamming in the Baltic Sea, residents express a sense of preparedness rather than fear. Analysts note that Estonia's deep-rooted defense culture, significant defense spending (3.4% of GDP), and crucial NATO membership provide a strong deterrent against a direct military assault.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of French citizens are joining the military reserves, driven by growing security concerns in Europe, particularly the threat from an aggressive Russia. The number of operational reservists has soared from 28,000 in 2014 to over 46,000 today, with the government aiming to reach 105,000 by 2035. This trend reflects a broader European effort to bolster defense capabilities, as young people and professionals volunteer for rigorous part-time military training. Recruits cite a patriotic duty to protect their country in a complicated geopolitical context, signaling a renewed public interest in national defense more than two decades after France ended compulsory military service.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's ambassador to the United States, Xie Feng, has dismissed claims that Chinese ownership of American farmland constitutes a national security threat, calling such suggestions "completely unfounded." Speaking at a soybean industry event, Xie stated that Chinese investors own less than 0.03 percent of total US farmland and argued that restricting such purchases is a form of political manipulation. He asserted that these restrictions are intended to hijack agricultural cooperation for political agendas rather than address a genuine security risk. The comments come amid heightened scrutiny and legislative efforts in some US states to limit foreign ownership of agricultural land.</p>

          <p>Several leading economists are warning that the United Kingdom is at risk of a 1970s-style debt crisis and may require a bailout from the International Monetary Fund unless the government changes its fiscal course. Citing UK borrowing costs that are now higher than those of Greece, one former Bank of England rate-setter stated that an economic crash is imminent without a policy reversal. The Sunday Telegraph's editorial echoed these concerns, suggesting the nation faces impoverishment. A Treasury spokesperson has dismissed these claims as unfounded, noting that the IMF had endorsed the UK's fiscal strategy in May. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the Los Angeles Chargers' final preseason game, undrafted linebacker Marlowe Wax delivered a standout performance, strengthening his case to make the 53-man roster. Wax made several crucial plays against the San Francisco 49ers, including a strip-sack and a key tackle on fourth down, earning praise from coach Jim Harbaugh. While Wax excelled, the Chargers' backup units struggled overall in the 30-23 loss, committing numerous penalties and turnovers. The game provided a final opportunity for players on the roster bubble to make an impression before the team makes its final cuts ahead of the regular season.</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has condemned President Trump's plan to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago as an "abuse of power" and an attempt to "manufacture a crisis." The governor stated there is no emergency justifying such an action in his state. Chicago's mayor also expressed "grave concerns" about the potential deployment, warning it could inflame tensions and undermine progress in reducing crime. The move is part of a broader administration strategy to send troops to major Democrat-run cities as a crackdown on crime, a policy that has already been implemented in Washington D.C. and is deeply unpopular with local residents.</p>
