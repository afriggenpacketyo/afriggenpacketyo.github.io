          <p>Donald Trump stated that the U.S. would cease attacks on the Houthis in Yemen, citing their alleged capitulation and a ceasefire agreement mediated by Oman, which ensures freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab Strait. The Houthis began targeting shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, leading to U.S.-led naval forces thwarting attacks and intensifying air strikes under both Joe Biden and Trump. Trump said the Houthis announced they no longer want to fight, and he would honor that. In recent developments, Israel responded to Houthi missile attacks with strikes on Yemen's main international airport and other facilities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is set to resume collection efforts on defaulted student loans, potentially affecting 5.3 million borrowers through wage garnishments and seizure of federal benefits. The Treasury Department will notify borrowers of these collection activities later this summer. This marks a shift from the Biden administration's focus on providing relief measures to struggling borrowers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts are concerned about the impact on retirees, who may face reduced Social Security benefits, potentially impacting their ability to afford basic necessities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that the U.S. does not need to "sign deals" with trade partners, asserting that other countries need access to the American market more than the U.S. needs theirs. This comment contradicts weeks of White House officials touting bilateral trade talks as a top priority. Trump expressed frustration with the pressure to announce formal trade agreements, suggesting the U.S. could present numerous deals at once in the future. The statement comes amid mounting pressure on the White House to demonstrate progress on trade talks.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to begin enforcing its ban on transgender individuals serving in the U.S. military, blocking a lower court order that had temporarily halted the ban. The court's three liberal members dissented. The policy implements an executive order that defines gender dysphoria as a disqualifying medical condition for military service. Critics argue that this is a thinly veiled ban on transgender service members and a violation of the Constitution’s equal protection clause. The ban has been challenged by current and aspiring transgender service members, including Commander Emily Shilling, a Navy pilot with 19 years of service.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has blocked the Trump administration from deporting noncitizens detained under the Alien Enemies Act, deeming the president's proclamation an overreach of the law. The judge, Alvin Hellerstein, argued that the administration failed to demonstrate the existence of a war, invasion, or predatory incursion justifying the act's use. This ruling echoes a similar decision in southern Texas, challenging the administration's efforts to deport Venezuelan migrants allegedly associated with the Tren de Aragua gang. The judge stated that noncitizens in his judicial district can still be removed under the Immigration and Nationality Act.</p>

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) said the man and his dog were not killed at the same time, suggesting more than one bear may have been involved. DNA samples have been sent for testing to determine if the bears were involved in the deadly attack, which is the first ever deadly bear attack on a human in the state.

          <p>Utah has become the first state in the U.S. to ban fluoride in public drinking water, despite opposition from dentists and health experts. Republican Governor Spencer Cox signed the law, influenced by claims that fluoride can have harmful effects, though health officials dispute these claims. The ban will affect about 1.6 million people in northern Utah, with dentists bracing for an increase in tooth decay, especially among children and low-income residents. Dentists in Salt Lake City say they can tell where someone grew up based on the level of decay in their teeth, indicating the impact of fluoridated water.</p>

A Maryland judge ruled that the Trump administration had improperly removed him in violation of a 2024 legal settlement that forbade immigration authorities from deporting him while his application for asylum was pending. The justice department is disputing the judge’s assessment, saying he belonged to a violent terrorist gang, thus disqualifying him from asylum in the US.</p>

Strategies to improve settlement chances include doing homework on the debt, offering proof of hardship, and working with a debt relief expert. It emphasizes patience and persistence in negotiations. The article also states that debt collectors aren't legally required to settle for less than what's owed, but it does not give investment advice.</p>

CEO Alex Karp defended the company, stating that Palantir is "pretty happy" and investors are not obligated to buy their shares. The decline was attributed to concerns over declining international revenue and failure to meet high growth expectations. Despite this, Palantir exceeded revenue expectations and increased its revenue guidance for the year, reporting adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share on $884 million in revenues.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to proceed with its ban on transgender military service members while appeals continue. The justices blocked a lower court order that temporarily halted the ban's enforcement. The court's three liberal justices said they would have denied the application. The Defense Department now lists "gender dysphoria" as a medical condition that disqualifies people from military service, affecting approximately 0.2% of the U.S. military members.</p>
