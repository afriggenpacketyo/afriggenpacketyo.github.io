          <p>Thieves executed a seven-minute robbery at the Louvre Museum in Paris, stealing jewelry of "inestimable heritage and historical value." The perpetrators used a basket lift to access a window and smash display cases in the Galerie d'Apollon while tourists were already inside the museum. The targeted items were part of the French Crown Jewels, and the thieves escaped on motorcycles, prompting a major investigation and the museum's temporary closure. This incident highlights ongoing security vulnerabilities at major European cultural institutions, echoing similar high-profile museum raids in recent years.</p>

          <p>In south-central Turkey, archaeologists discovered a remarkable 1,200-year-old loaf of burned bread from the ancient city of Eirenopolis. The carbonized artifact bears a faint image of Jesus Christ, depicted not in the common Pantocrator style but as a sower, symbolizing fertility and labor. Inscriptions on the loaf read, "With gratitude to the Blessed Jesus," leading specialists to believe it may be an example of early Christian communion bread. The exceptional preservation of this and four other loaves provides significant insight into the religious rituals and daily life of the period in Anatolia.</p>

          <p>Zhu Guangyao, China's former vice-minister of finance, expressed confidence that the nation's economy will achieve its growth target of around 5% for the current year. Speaking at a conference in Beijing, he projected that China could maintain an annual growth rate between 4.5% and 5% for the next five years. This sustained growth would establish a strong foundation for the country to meet its long-term goal of achieving "socialist modernization" by 2035. Zhu's optimistic forecast comes as Chinese leaders prepare for a key party meeting to finalize the next five-year plan amid ongoing economic rivalry with the United States.

          <h2>American Consumers Report Financial Strain and Scarcity Due to Trump's Economic Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent report details the growing financial burden on American households as a direct result of the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs. Consumers across the country describe facing higher prices on everyday goods, from groceries to car tires, forcing them to shrink their budgets and alter their lifestyles. Studies estimate that these tariffs will cost the average household an additional $2,400 per year, with a significant portion of the expense shock being passed from companies to consumers. Many interviewees expressed fear and frustration, noting that the policy has led to empty store shelves and contradicts promises of making life more affordable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Georgia is experiencing a historic surge in demand for electricity, primarily driven by the rapid construction of data centers for artificial intelligence. Georgia Power is requesting a massive increase in energy generation, estimated to cost nearly $16 billion, to meet this need. The proposal has sparked concerns among consumer advocates and environmental groups about potential utility rate hikes for residents and an increased reliance on fossil fuels. The state's Public Service Commission faces a pivotal decision on how to balance industrial growth with consumer costs and environmental responsibilities.</p>

          <p>A Suzhou-based robotics manufacturer, MyActuator, has seen a dramatic increase in orders, attributing the rush to President Trump's threat of a 100% tariff on all Chinese imports. The company, which specializes in components for humanoid robots, reported receiving over 1,000 new orders in a single week as American clients make emergency purchases to avoid potential price hikes. A company representative noted that factories are now working overtime to ship products before the proposed tariff deadline. This surge in business highlights the immediate, and sometimes ironic, consequences of escalating trade tensions on global supply chains.</p>

          <p>AI company Anthropic finds itself in a dual challenge, competing with the larger, Microsoft-backed OpenAI while also facing public criticism from the U.S. government. David Sacks, President Trump's AI czar, has accused Anthropic of "fear-mongering" to promote restrictive AI regulation, a stark contrast to OpenAI's closer relationship with the White House. The conflict stems from fundamental differences in philosophy, as Anthropic was founded on the principle of building safer AI and has advocated for stronger regulatory guardrails. This dynamic illustrates the deepening politicization of AI development and the high-stakes battle over its future governance.</p>

Experts stress that plans can change significantly, affecting out-of-pocket costs, prescription drug coverage, and access to preferred doctors. Beneficiaries can switch between original Medicare and private Medicare Advantage plans, or change their Part D prescription coverage. While the ongoing government shutdown may cause some delays in accessing information, resources like the online Plan Finder remain available to help individuals find the most cost-effective coverage.</p>

Liu defended China's response as a necessary measure to protect its own shipping interests.

          <p>Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, once a staunch loyalist of Donald Trump, has recently taken positions that diverge from the Republican mainstream, earning her unlikely praise from some Democrats. She has criticized the party's stance on the war in Gaza, supported the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, and sided with Democrats on extending Affordable Care Act subsidies. While she has avoided direct criticism of Trump, her independent streak has fueled speculation about her motives and future political ambitions. Her actions challenge the perception of the MAGA movement as a monolith, suggesting a more populist-driven approach to her political identity.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Democratic-led states should consider "fiscal disobedience" to resist what it calls the Trump administration's authoritarian tactics, such as slashing federal funding to blue cities. The proposed strategy involves states creating escrow accounts to temporarily hold federal tax revenues collected from their residents. These funds would only be released to the federal government once constitutional obligations are met and punitive actions are ceased. The author suggests this form of state-level civil disobedience could create material leverage and force a constitutional confrontation over the balance of federal and state power.</p>

The article explores why forgetting is essential, how emotions prioritize certain recollections, and why traumatic events can be so persistent. Dr. Ranganath explains that each time we recall an event, we are essentially repainting it, which allows our relationship with past experiences to evolve, shaping both personal and collective identities.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues FDA's Loosened Approval Standards for Rare-Disease Drugs Ultimately Harm Patients</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 06:01:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article contends that the Food and Drug Administration's increasing flexibility in approving drugs for rare diseases, often based on limited or inconclusive evidence, is a disservice to patients. The author argues that while the impulse to provide hope is understandable, approving drugs that have not been proven effective erodes the meaning of FDA approval and can expose vulnerable patients to ineffective treatments. The piece criticizes the current administration for pushing the agency to approve drugs based on plausibility rather than rigorous data. It suggests that true progress lies in better research funding, not in lowering standards for safety and efficacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Labor unions have become a primary source of opposition to the Trump administration's agenda to reduce the federal workforce and curtail workers' rights. Unions have filed dozens of lawsuits to combat executive orders aimed at stripping collective bargaining rights from over a million employees and facilitating mass layoffs. These legal battles are framed as a defense not only of workers but also of the principle of a nonpartisan civil service that serves the public rather than a political agenda. Despite some setbacks, unions have achieved victories, including a temporary restraining order blocking layoffs related to the government shutdown.</p>

          <p>Aaron Mahan, a food server in Las Vegas and a two-time Trump voter, details his personal financial struggles, which he attributes to the president's economic policies. He describes a significant drop in income due to a tourism slowdown—the "Trump slump"—and the depletion of his savings, all while facing rising costs for gas and groceries. Mahan blames the downturn on the administration's failure to control inflation, its tariff policies, and an antagonistic foreign policy that has deterred international visitors. His experience provides a personal narrative of the economic malaise affecting service industry workers, even those who previously supported the administration.</p>

          <p>The ongoing technological and economic conflict between the United States and China is characterized by a pattern of reciprocal escalation that has become a standard feature of their relationship. This analysis argues that both nations are testing the limits of their strategic leverage—China with its dominance in rare earth processing and the U.S. with its powerful sanctioning capabilities. For decades, the global tech ecosystem operated under a de facto American-led system, but now each side is actively challenging the other's influence. This dynamic is creating systemic uncertainty and reshaping the global technological landscape.</p>

          <p>A long-running investigation has culminated in the conviction of 14 people involved in a £28 million conspiracy to defraud over 3,500 timeshare owners. The company, Sell My Timeshare, targeted elderly victims who were desperate to exit their contracts, subjecting them to high-pressure sales tactics and selling them useless fake "credits." A 2016 BBC Scotland investigation, which used secret filming to expose the company's illegal "bait-and-switch" scam, played a crucial role in the police case. The fraud funded a lavish lifestyle for the company's owners, with the ringleader receiving a seven-and-a-half year prison sentence.</p>
