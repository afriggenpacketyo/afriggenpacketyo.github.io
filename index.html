          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully conducted a human trial for a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels, avoiding open-skull surgery. This minimally invasive technique, performed on a 67-year-old paralyzed patient, reportedly enabled him to regain some limb movement. The method contrasts with Elon Musk's Neuralink, which requires cranial surgery, and potentially offers reduced risks and faster recovery times for patients. The procedure involved inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vascular network via a neck vein.</p>

          <p>U.S. federal prosecutors have charged 11 individuals in connection with a major transnational fraud scheme that targeted Medicare for over $10 billion. The Russia-based criminal organization allegedly stole the personal information of more than a million Medicare recipients to file fraudulent claims for expensive medical equipment that was never provided. The scheme involved purchasing legitimate medical equipment companies to submit the false claims. Prosecutors state that while the group billed for billions, Medicare paid out approximately $41 million, with supplemental insurers paying an estimated $900 million more.</p>

          <p>Japanese and U.S. officials have agreed to continue discussions on tariffs, though significant disagreements reportedly persist, particularly concerning the U.S. treatment of Japan's auto industry. The talks in Washington occurred as a July deadline for President Trump's 90-day pause on certain "reciprocal tariffs" approaches, though the administration has indicated a possible extension. Japan faces a potential country-specific tariff of 14%, in addition to a baseline 10% duty, and is particularly concerned about a separate 27.5% tariff on imported passenger vehicles.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that parents have a right to be notified and opt their children out of public school lessons that conflict with their religious beliefs, specifically concerning the use of LGBTQ+-themed storybooks. The case originated in Montgomery County, Maryland, where parents sued over a curriculum that included nine such books in elementary school classes. The majority opinion stated that schools must provide advance notice for parents to remove their children from these lessons.

          <p>This article presents an analysis of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, suggesting a long-standing objective has been to prevent any regional power from achieving military or technological parity with Israel. It cites an anecdotal exchange where a U.S. senator allegedly stated the goal regarding Iraq was to reduce it to a "pre-industrial society." The piece argues that this neoconservative-driven agenda became official U.S. policy following the September 11 attacks. This perspective frames decades of U.S. intervention in the region, from Iraq to Iran, as part of a strategy to ensure Israel's military dominance.</p>

          <p>A new Tulane University study reveals that parts of New Orleans' concrete flood wall system, reinforced after Hurricane Katrina, are sinking at an alarming rate, in some places nearly two inches per year. This subsidence is occurring faster than sea-level rise, potentially degrading the city's flood protection. The research used satellite radar data to identify sinking hotspots, particularly around industrial sites and new developments, likely due to soil compression and groundwater withdrawal. The findings serve as a critical warning that ongoing monitoring and maintenance are necessary to protect the low-lying city.</p>

          <p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has condemned a new aid distribution system in Gaza, calling it "inherently unsafe" and a "death sentence" for Palestinians seeking food. The system, operated by the Israel- and U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), bypasses the UN. The UN reports that over 400 Palestinians have been killed while trying to get aid from GHF sites, and Guterres stated that UN-led humanitarian efforts are being "strangled." The GHF denies any deaths have occurred at its sites, while Israel maintains the system prevents Hamas from seizing aid.</p>

          <p>The new administration has purged and replaced the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the expert panel that sets national vaccine policy. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appointed new members, including noted vaccine skeptics, who held their first meeting this week. The meeting was characterized by questions challenging the established science on vaccine safety, particularly regarding COVID-19 and flu vaccines. Critics view the shake-up as a dangerous move that politicizes science and could undermine public health, while the administration frames it as a turn towards "open scientific inquiry."</p>

          <p>In a major 6-3 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has limited the authority of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which have been used to block policies from both Republican and Democratic administrations. The ruling came in a case related to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, argued that such broad orders exceed the power granted to courts by Congress. While the decision narrows the injunctions blocking the birthright citizenship policy, it did not rule on the policy's constitutionality, leaving that for lower courts.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has stated that a Republican budget bill in the U.S. Senate could cause as many as 3.4 million Californians to lose their Medi-Cal health insurance. The bill proposes new work requirements for many Medicaid recipients, which Newsom argues would be difficult for millions to navigate, leading to a loss of coverage. He also warned the cuts could force the closure of rural hospitals and drive up insurance premiums. The proposal is a key part of President Trump's second-term agenda and aims to reduce federal spending on Medicaid significantly.</p>

          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security has found a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet. The diet, which includes rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and seaweed, was assessed among nearly 12,500 employees. Researchers noted that certain foods in the diet, such as those rich in omega-3 fatty acids and folic acid, may contribute to improved mental well-being by assisting in the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine. The findings suggest a potential link between traditional dietary patterns and mental health.</p>

As antibiotic resistance grows into a global health crisis, this alternative approach is gaining new attention.

A project at the University of Southampton is actively hunting for new phages, even in common places like household toilets, with the hope of developing them into viable treatments for patients with otherwise incurable infections.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has performed a major U-turn on its planned welfare reforms, backing down on cuts to disability payments to avoid a large-scale rebellion from its own MPs. The reversal raises questions about the government's ability to manage its finances and enact its long-term agenda. The proposed cuts were intended to generate savings to meet self-imposed fiscal rules, but critics argued they were a short-sighted cost-cutting exercise rather than a genuine reform. The episode has cast doubt on the government's credibility and its overall strategy for renewing the country.</p>
