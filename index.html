          <p>Kyiv experienced a severe aerial assault with relentless waves of drones and missiles, causing near-constant explosions across the city. Dozens of drones were reportedly launched toward the Ukrainian capital, and while many were intercepted, some reached their targets, resulting in fires in multiple districts. Authorities have confirmed at least two injuries, and the attack occurred a day after Russian forces targeted regions throughout Ukraine with over 470 attack drones. Russia and Ukraine recently held the first stage of a prisoner swap following an agreement reached during peace talks in Istanbul. The situation is still developing as authorities continue to assess the full extent of the damage and casualties. Optimism amidst the chaos is low.</p>

          <p>More than 300 Foreign Office staff who expressed concerns about the UK's potential "complicity" in Israel's actions in Gaza were advised to consider resigning if they profoundly disagreed with government policy. A letter sent to Foreign Secretary David Lammy questioned the UK's arms sales and what they deemed a disregard for international law by Israel. Senior civil servants responded by stating that while healthy challenge is encouraged, resignation is an "honourable course" for those with deep disagreements. This response has sparked outrage among some officials, who feel the space for challenging government policy is shrinking, highlighting a growing tension within the Foreign Office regarding the UK's stance on the Gaza conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an "unprecedented decline in fertility rates" globally, with many people unable to have their desired number of children. The report cites the prohibitive cost of parenthood and the lack of suitable partners as key factors, based on a survey of 14,000 people across 14 countries. One in five respondents indicated they have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. The UNFPA emphasizes that this trend represents a real crisis, as many individuals feel unable to create the families they want, prompting a shift in the agency's focus towards addressing low fertility issues.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed £14.2 billion to the construction of the Sizewell C nuclear power plant on the Suffolk coastline, aiming to boost economic growth and achieve clean energy goals. The project is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed it as a "landmark decision," critics like Alison Downes from Stop Sizewell C argue that ministers are not being transparent about the project's costs and that the investment could be better spent elsewhere. The government maintains that nuclear power is crucial for eliminating fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030, despite concerns about delays and cost overruns seen with similar projects like Hinkley Point C.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased, with a 47% reduction in fatal overdoses among those aged 20 to 29. This decline is attributed to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, increased addiction healthcare access, and a shift towards less risky drug use among teens. The number of teens abstaining from substance use has reached its highest level, and younger generations are reportedly turning to cannabis and psychedelics instead of opioids. Despite this positive trend, experts warn that sustaining progress may be difficult, as many individuals still struggle with addiction and the Trump administration seeks to cut funding for addiction services.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has asserted its independence by stating that it retains authority over personnel decisions, including the director of the National Portrait Gallery. This statement is seen as a rejection of President Trump's announcement that he was firing the director, Kim Sajet, for being a supporter of DEI. The Smithsonian emphasized that the Board of Regents and the Secretary manage the institution, underscoring its nonpartisan stance. This move comes amid proposed budget cuts to the Smithsonian by the White House, signaling a potential conflict between the institution and the Trump administration over cultural and personnel matters.</p>

The trial, which was scheduled to start at FamilyMart stores in Tokyo, aimed to encourage young people's interest in politics amid low voter turnout. However, the company decided not to participate after careful consideration, although it will continue exploring ways to improve voter turnout using digital signage. The initiative, announced in May, involved lawmakers, advertising professionals, and legal experts, but companies in Japan have so far refrained from using digital signage for political advertisements.</p>

Rice prices have doubled compared to the previous year, prompting the government to take this step after previous releases through auctions.
