            <p>The Trump administration has canceled Temporary Protection Status (TPS) for Afghans, effective May 20, 2025, making them deportable. The decision, based on a USCIS review consulting with the State Department, concludes that Afghanistan no longer meets the requirements for TPS designation. Simultaneously, President Trump is hosting El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele at the White House amidst controversy over migrant deportations to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison. Trump praised Bukele's handling of "violent alien enemies," while legal experts question the constitutionality of potentially sending U.S. citizens convicted of violent crimes to the same prison.

Cena's heel turn involved siding with Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and attacking Cody Rhodes, shocking wrestling fans.

Critics say the actions create a humanitarian crisis and displace hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.
