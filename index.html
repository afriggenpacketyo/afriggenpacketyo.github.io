          <p>Avalon Victoria McCloud, the UK's only openly transgender former judge, is set to challenge the Supreme Court's ruling on biological sex at the European Court of Human Rights. McCloud argues the ruling and subsequent equality watchdog guidance violate her human rights, leaving her in a legal paradox of being "two sexes at once". The Supreme Court's decision defines a woman by biological sex, leading to interim guidance that could restrict trans individuals' access to single-sex spaces. McCloud contends that the court failed to consider the human rights implications for trans people, leading her to seek a declaration from the European Court that the UK government and Supreme Court judgement are in violation of her rights.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. of the Philippines are scheduled to meet to initiate discussions for key security pacts, aiming to bolster their security cooperation amid concerns over China's maritime activities. The talks will focus on an intelligence-sharing agreement and a bilateral acquisition and cross-servicing agreement to facilitate defense supplies and logistical support. This move comes as both countries, allies of the U.S., seek to address China's assertive territorial claims in the South and East China Seas. The leaders are also expected to discuss the global economy amid U.S. President Donald Trump's imposition of higher import tariffs.</p>

          <p>Young voters in Australia, now outnumbering baby boomers, are prepared to express their frustration with climate inaction in the upcoming election. Feeling ignored by major parties, Gen Z and Millennials, making up nearly 50% of voters, are demanding stronger climate policies, including a 75% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2035. While the incumbent Labour government promotes renewable energy, it faces criticism for approving new fossil fuel projects. The opposition Liberal party favors increased gas production and nuclear energy, leading many young voters to consider supporting minor parties with stronger climate platforms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada's Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, secured a victory in the recent federal election, a turnaround largely attributed to President Trump's territorial threats and tariff policies. Carney emphasized the need for Canada to safeguard its sovereignty and economy in the face of American pressure. The election saw a record number of Canadians casting advance votes, with sovereignty, tariffs, and affordability being key issues. While domestic issues like affordability and immigration remained important, Trump's actions significantly influenced voters' choices, leading to a rejection of the Conservative party.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul and state lawmakers have reached an agreement to add a criminal charge for individuals who wear masks while committing crimes. This additional charge will apply to suspects facing a Class A misdemeanor or more serious charges, with a reduced penalty for separate crimes. The legislation aims to address concerns raised last summer about individuals concealing their identities during crimes, particularly during protests. The budget deal also includes provisions for involuntary commitment of mentally ill individuals and banning cell phone use in schools.</p>

          <p>Belfast-based rap group Kneecap has issued an apology to the families of murdered MPs Sir David Amess and Jo Cox following the emergence of a video where a band member appeared to advocate violence against Tory MPs. The footage is under review by counter-terrorism police, and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for prosecution. The group rejects any intention to incite violence and says the footage was taken out of context, while reaffirming their lack of support for Hamas or Hezbollah. The controversy has led to calls for the group to be denied entry to the USA and Canada ahead of their North America tour.</p>

          <p>The Society of Radiographers is advocating for a policy change to allow male health workers to perform mammograms due to critical staff shortages.

While some women express discomfort with the idea, others like Sally Reed, a breast cancer survivor, prioritize the life-saving potential of the procedure regardless of the practitioner's gender. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch believes most women would prefer female radiographers, emphasizing the need to recruit more women into the field.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering expanding the sugar tax to include pre-packaged milkshakes and lattes, including non-dairy alternatives. This proposal aims to reduce sugar consumption, particularly among children, and incentivize manufacturers to lower sugar content in these drinks. The original sugar tax, formally known as the soft drinks industry levy (SDIL), was introduced in 2018 and applies to pre-packaged drinks sold in supermarkets. The government is also proposing to reduce the maximum sugar allowance in drinks before they are subject to the levy from 5g to 4g per 100ml.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's second term has seen a rapid shift towards authoritarianism, coupled with economic and foreign policy missteps. Critics highlight the president's retribution against perceived enemies, the imposition of trade tariffs, and the disruption of international alliances. His administration has been marked by executive overreach, cabinet infighting, and a culture war targeting arts, media, and cultural institutions. Despite a well-planned agenda, the execution has been undermined by the president's mercurial nature and the actions of figures like Elon Musk, who is leading efforts to cut government spending.</p>

          <p>Economists at Morgan Stanley predict that the United States and China will engage in trade negotiations and gradually reduce tariffs on Chinese imports to 60% by the end of the second quarter. More comprehensive talks later in the year could lead to further tariff reductions, bringing them down to 34% by year's end. Despite these potential reductions, the analysts note that the economic cycle has already been significantly damaged, with the overall direction of growth expected to remain downward.

          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a 39% jump in profit, driven by robust investment banking performance, surpassing analyst expectations. However, the bank increased credit provisions due to uncertainties surrounding U.S. tariff policies. The lender's core investment banking division posted a 10% year-on-year hike in net revenues, with a 17% increase in the fixed income and currencies unit. Despite the positive results, analysts noted mixed core divisional trends and flagged the lender's provision guidance as including a caveat for economic uncertainty.</p>

Carney, who replaced Justin Trudeau as Liberal leader, has presented himself as the most experienced leader to navigate the crisis. The election results have highlighted divisions within Canada, with the Liberals largely shut out of Alberta and Saskatchewan. Carney has acknowledged these divisions and pledged to govern for all Canadians, while also addressing cost of living issues that resonated with younger voters.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney and the Liberal Party have claimed a remarkable victory in the Canadian election – and it appears to have come with a big assist from Donald Trump. The US president's constant badgering of America's northern neighbour and taunts about making it the 51st US state since his return to office in January coincided with a dramatic reversal in fortune for the centre-left party. Carney has been almost singularly focused on his neighbour, and this was reflected in his victory speech. After warning that the US wanted Canada's land and resources, Carney declared: "President Trump is trying to break us so that America can own us. That will never ever happen."</p>
