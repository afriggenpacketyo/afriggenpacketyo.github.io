          <p>The Trump administration is exploring investments in companies that mine and process critical minerals to reduce U.S. reliance on imports, particularly from China, according to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. The administration is considering using a sovereign wealth fund to invest in domestic miners, aiming to counter China's practice of dumping minerals and undercutting U.S. competitiveness. Burgum also mentioned the possibility of a sovereign risk insurance fund to protect companies from political changes that might impact their investments and a strategic stockpile of key minerals, similar to the strategic petroleum reserve.

          <p>President Trump has requested the Supreme Court to allow the administration's policy prohibiting transgender individuals from serving in the military to take effect. The request comes after a federal appeals court upheld a lower court order blocking the ban. The administration argues that the policy is necessary to maintain high standards for troop readiness, while opponents claim it violates constitutional guarantees of equal protection. The Supreme Court has given plaintiffs until May 1 to respond.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice (DOJ) accidentally filed a document outlining legal flaws with the Trump administration's plan to halt New York City's congestion pricing tolls. The document, a letter to the Department of Transportation, stated that the administration's attempt to terminate congestion pricing faces "considerable litigation risk." DOJ lawyers suggested an alternative justification for canceling the program, but the accidental filing has raised questions about the administration's legal strategy and the future of congestion pricing in New York City.</p>
