          <p>This article details Ukraine's covert operations within Russia, targeting key infrastructure to disrupt Russian military logistics and create panic. Ukrainian intelligence services, the SBU and HUR, have executed acts of sabotage, including railway explosions, attacks on the Crimean bridge, and strikes on Russian airfields.

The article highlights the increasing sophistication and range of these attacks, which have reached deep into Russian territory, and have also targeted individuals involved in missile attacks on Ukrainian civilians. The effectiveness of these operations varies, but they serve to expose vulnerabilities in Russia's defenses and disrupt its war efforts.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the economic disillusionment prevalent among Gen Z, with nearly half feeling that planning for the future is pointless. Experts attribute this sentiment to a tough labor market, debt concerns, and the ease of accumulating debt through services like buy now, pay later. This "YOLO mindset" can lead to high-interest debt and delayed milestones, but experts stress the importance of developing healthy financial habits early. The article suggests that young adults should rewire their financial mindset and view investing, even small amounts, as an opportunity to benefit from compound interest. The current economic uncertainty and political climate contribute to this lack of optimism among young people. (not investment advice)</p>
