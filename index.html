        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sean 'Diddy' Combs' trial began with jury selection in New York, with charges including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation for prostitution, potentially leading to a life sentence if convicted. He also faces numerous civil lawsuits accusing him of sexual assault, drugging, and intimidation, all of which he denies, claiming they are attempts for a "quick payday". Combs has consistently denied all allegations, and his legal team argues he is unfairly targeted due to his race, portraying his lifestyle as that of a "swinger" rather than a criminal. The trial is expected to last around eight weeks, and Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn since his arrest, where his lawyers cite the jail‚Äôs ‚Äúhorrific‚Äù conditions. Optimism Score: 5</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration plans to make Social Security cards available digitally, a move that experts view with cautious optimism, citing potential benefits for accessibility and convenience. Richard Fiesta from the Alliance for Retired Americans notes that while this could be a positive step, it's crucial to ensure the system is secure and user-friendly, particularly for older or disabled individuals who may not be tech-savvy. Eva Velasquez, CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, highlights the need for robust security measures to protect both Social Security numbers and the devices used to access them, given the high likelihood of prior data breaches.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medicare in 2025 will not cover key healthcare costs such as dental care, vision care, hearing aids, overseas medical care, and long-term custodial care, leaving retirees vulnerable to significant out-of-pocket expenses. The average cost of a private room in a nursing home exceeds $120,000 per year, making long-term care a particularly critical gap. Seniors are encouraged to consider supplemental insurance like Medigap to cover expenses Medicare doesn't fully cover, including copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles. Purchasing Medigap coverage early, during the open enrollment window, is advisable to avoid potential denial or higher costs based on health status.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor suspended its 2025 financial guidance due to an expected $2.5 billion impact from President Donald Trump's tariffs, despite beating Wall Street's first-quarter expectations. The company anticipates offsetting $1 billion of these costs through remediation actions and volume/pricing strategies, resulting in a net impact of $1.5 billion in 2025. The decision to pull guidance was influenced by near-term risks, including potential industry-wide supply chain disruptions and the possibility of future or increased tariffs. The tariff impact on Ford is less severe than that projected for General Motors, as Ford imports fewer vehicles.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to incentivize prescription drug manufacturing in the U.S., streamlining the FDA approval process for domestic pharmaceutical production sites. The order aims to reduce reliance on foreign drug suppliers, citing national security concerns and directs the FDA to increase inspection fees for foreign plants and improve enforcement of active-ingredient source reporting. The move precedes planned tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, which have already prompted some drugmakers to increase domestic manufacturing investments.

          <p>United States Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed a 20% reduction in the number of four-star generals and admirals within the U.S. military. In a memo issued on Monday, Hegseth also called for a 10% cut in general and flag officers and a 20% reduction in general officers in the National Guard. The goal is to eliminate ‚Äúredundant force structure to optimize and streamline leadership by reducing excess general and flag officer positions,‚Äù the memo stated, adding to the turbulence at the Pentagon since President Donald Trump's administration took over in January.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's announcement about reopening and expanding Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary has drawn renewed attention to the infamous prison. Alcatraz, which closed 60 years ago, housed notorious criminals like Al Capone and earned a reputation as the final stop for uncontrollable inmates. The prison's strict regimen included granting inmates only basic rights like food, clothing, shelter, and medical care, with other privileges earned through good behavior. While no one officially succeeded in escaping, five prisoners remain missing and presumed drowned. Today, Alcatraz Island attracts approximately 1.2 million visitors annually as a national park site.</p>

          <p>Former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is under scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by using his campaign website to instruct a super PAC on how to support his mayoral bid. This practice, known as red-boxing, involves posting strategic information in a public location for big money groups to access, circumventing rules that prohibit direct communication. The New York City Campaign Finance Board has warned against this practice, stating that it could undermine fundraising and spending limits.

          <p>President Trump's deportation policies are under scrutiny regarding due process rights for non-citizens, as the Constitution and Supreme Court mandate that all individuals on U.S. soil must be afforded "due process of law". While the specifics remain contested, legal experts emphasize that the type of notice and hearing provided depends on an immigrant's status and circumstances. The expedited removal program allows for swift deportation of migrants in the country illegally for less than two years without a hearing, but anyone claiming refuge in the U.S. must be given a hearing before an Immigration judge and provided a chance to appeal an adverse decision.</p>

However, experts warn that this offer could be deceptive, as leaving the country may impose severe consequences, including a bar on reentry.
