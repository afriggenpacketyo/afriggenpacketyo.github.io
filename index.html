          <p>The FBI has revealed that the suspect arrested for the fatal shooting of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, appeared to have an "obsession" with him based on his digital footprint. Investigators found evidence that Robinson had been tracking Kirk's public appearances and was familiar with the Utah Valley University campus where the attack occurred. Robinson was apprehended after his father recognized him in photos released by authorities and convinced him to turn himself in. The case has drawn national attention, with President Trump calling for the death penalty.</p>

Vance paid tribute to the conservative activist, whom he described as the "smartest political operative I ever met" and credited with significantly contributing to the Trump administration's success. During the show, Vance and guests like Stephen Miller called for justice and pledged to dismantle what they termed "left-wing extremism," framing it as a cause of the political violence that led to Kirk's death.</p>

          <p>The Dallas Cowboys honored the late conservative influencer Charlie Kirk with a tribute on their stadium's videoboard before their game against the New York Giants. Team owner Jerry Jones explained the decision as a unified stand against violence, stating that such acts impact everyone and must be condemned. He drew parallels to the political assassinations of the 1960s, emphasizing the importance of supporting law enforcement and keeping violence in check. Several other NFL teams also held tributes for Kirk following his assassination earlier in the week.</p>

          <p>President Trump has called for public companies to report their earnings every six months instead of the current quarterly requirement, arguing it would save money and allow managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term results. The proposal, which would require SEC approval, revives a debate from his first term. However, many finance experts and investor advocates have raised concerns, warning that less frequent reporting could reduce transparency, increase market volatility, and potentially create more opportunities for accounting fraud or insider trading.</p>

The study uses the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark, which shows renewables are more cost-competitive than fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, even before accounting for government subsidies. Experts note that while renewables have high upfront capital costs, their operational expenses are significantly lower, as they do not rely on volatile fuel prices.</p>

          <p>The American Federation of Teachers (AFT) is seeking class-action status for its lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that the Department of Education is unlawfully delaying and denying access to student loan relief programs. The complaint argues that borrowers are being harmed by significant backlogs in processing applications for Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans and Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). According to court records, over a million borrowers are currently stuck in the IDR application backlog, potentially waiting years for legally mandated debt cancellation.</p>

          <p>Constance Marten and Mark Gordon have each been sentenced to 14 years in prison for the gross negligence manslaughter of their newborn daughter, Victoria. The couple went on the run with the baby to avoid social services, leading to a 53-day manhunt that ended in Brighton in 2023. The baby's decomposed body was later found in a shopping bag in an allotment shed, with the court concluding she had died of hypothermia while the couple was living in a tent.
