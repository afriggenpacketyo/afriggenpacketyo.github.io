          <p>Alex Ovechkin etched his name in hockey history by scoring his 895th career goal, surpassing Wayne Gretzky's all-time NHL record during a game against the New York Islanders. The Washington Capitals captain achieved the milestone with a power-play goal in the second period, prompting a celebratory on-ice dive and enthusiastic chants from fans. Gretzky himself congratulated Ovechkin, acknowledging the magnitude of the achievement, while Russian President Vladimir Putin also sent his congratulations. Despite missing 16 games earlier in the season due to injury, Ovechkin's pursuit of the record remained undeterred, showcasing his remarkable durability and goal-scoring prowess. The 39 year old has one season left on his contract. Optimism is high for hockey fans as a new record has been set.</p>

          <p>Global stock markets experienced a dramatic downturn following President Trump's announcement of new tariffs, triggering widespread investor panic.

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields declined as investors sought safe-haven assets in response to President Trump's tariffs, which have stoked fears of a global trade war. The 2-year Treasury yield fell to its lowest level since September 2022, reflecting increased demand for less risky investments. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated little room for negotiation with countries seeking tariff relief, further fueling market uncertainty. Stock futures also experienced a significant drop, mirroring the pressure on equity markets across Asia and Europe.

          <p>Asian stock markets experienced their worst drop in decades following the announcement of tariffs by President Trump, with economies particularly sensitive to fears of a global trade war. The Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong's Hang Seng, and Japan's Nikkei 225 all saw significant declines, reflecting investor concerns about the impact on exports. Goldman Sachs increased its forecast for a U.S. recession, while other Wall Street firms also revised their economic outlooks downward.

          <p>The UK government announced a relaxation of electric vehicle (EV) sales targets to support the car industry in response to tariffs imposed by the US. While a ban on producing new petrol and diesel cars remains in effect from 2030, manufacturers will now have more flexibility on annual targets and face reduced fines. The government aims to balance its commitment to phasing out petrol and diesel cars with practical reforms to support the industry. The US is a major export market for the UK motor industry, and the tariffs have prompted concerns about the sector's competitiveness.</p>

The Institute of Museum and Library Services has been gutted, affecting services such as internet access and summer reading programs, with the most intense losses in rural communities.

          <p>New global data reveals that a woman dies every two minutes due to failures in maternal healthcare, with 260,000 maternal deaths recorded in 2023. The WHO has warned that the global target for reducing maternal deaths will be missed by more than twice the amount. Leading health organizations have expressed concern that recent cuts to international aid by the US and the UK will reverse progress made in cutting maternal deaths. Half of all maternal deaths in 2023 were recorded in Nigeria, India, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Pakistan.</p>

          <p>Pam Bondi, President Trump's attorney general, suggested that the president would "probably" leave office after his second term is completed. While leaving the door open to the possibility of him serving another four years, she acknowledged that changing the Constitution to allow Trump to serve a third term would be a "heavy lift." Meanwhile, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the revocation of all visas to South Sudanese passport holders due to the failure of South Sudan's transitional government to accept the return of its repatriated citizens in a timely manner.</p>

          <p>This article explores the cultural obsession with longevity and the biohacking practices promising extended life, while cautioning against misinformation and unproven theories. Timothy Caulfield, a health law expert, discusses the blurring lines between wellness, longevity, and biohacking, emphasizing the importance of science-informed decisions. He highlights the potential for "science-ploitation" in marketing and the need to focus on sustainable, healthy habits rather than quick fixes. The pursuit of longevity often reflects deeper desires for control, optimization, and societal well-being, emphasizing the need for community and balanced perspectives.</p>

          <p>American shop owners are feeling the impact of the global trade war as President Trump's tariffs on all imports increase costs. Business owners are considering raising prices, shrinking selections, and freezing hiring to survive. One key argument in favor of tariffs is that they would jump-start American manufacturing, forcing more companies to source their products domestically. However, many business owners have found that U.S.-made products can cost three to four times more than imported alternatives.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is set to hold a final hearing on a landmark NCAA settlement that could revolutionize college sports. The settlement proposes allowing schools to share revenue with student-athletes, imposing roster limits, and establishing a third-party clearinghouse for marketing deals. If approved, the settlement would pave the way for schools to directly pay athletes, a significant shift from the tradition of amateurism. The settlement has faced objections from current students and others who believe it doesn't fairly compensate them.</p>
