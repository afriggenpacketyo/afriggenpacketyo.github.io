          <p>The direct-action group Palestine Action is set to be proscribed as a terrorist organization in the United Kingdom after a High Court judge rejected its last-minute bid to block the ban. The ruling means that supporting the group, known for its disruptive protests and property damage against companies linked to Israel's arms trade, will become a criminal offense punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The government pursued the ban following significant damages caused by the group's activities, arguing it was necessary for public safety, while the group's lawyers called the move an authoritarian abuse of power against a civil disobedience organization.</p>

          <p>A rapid and complex legal battle unfolded over the fate of eight migrants, as one federal judge issued a temporary stay on their deportation only for another to deny a restraining order hours later. This cleared the way for the Trump administration to remove the men, who have U.S. criminal convictions, to South Sudan, a nation with which they have no ties and which is experiencing a civil war. The case highlights the administration's policy of deporting individuals to third-party countries, a practice contested by rights groups over concerns of potential torture and harm.</p>

          <p>At the Chester Zoo in the United Kingdom, a same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins named Scampi and Flounder are successfully raising a chick. The chick is one of ten that hatched at the zoo this year, a significant event for the conservation of the vulnerable species. To improve the chances of survival, zoo experts distributed eggs laid by another penguin pair between the two nests. This instance highlights a behavior that is not uncommon in the penguin world and showcases the shared parenting duties within the species, contributing positively to the zoo's breeding program.</p>

          <p>Hamas has delivered what it termed a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-backed proposal for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release. A senior Palestinian official indicated that while the group accepts the general framework, it is requesting key amendments, including a U.S. guarantee that hostilities will not resume if permanent ceasefire talks fail. This diplomatic development occurred as Israeli military strikes continued across Gaza, reportedly killing over 138 Palestinians in a 24-hour period. In Tel Aviv, families of the remaining hostages held a rally urging all parties to finalize a deal.</p>

          <p>The initial public offering (IPO) market is showing signs of a long-awaited recovery, fueled by the strong performance of recently listed tech companies like crypto firm Circle. After its debut, Circle's stock surged over 500%, generating significant returns for its venture capital backers and sparking optimism that a multi-year drought for tech IPOs may be ending. The market had been largely dormant since early 2022 due to economic pressures, creating a major liquidity backlog for startups and their investors. This recent activity suggests the window for public offerings may be reopening. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Intelligence services from the Netherlands and Germany have concluded that Russia is escalating its use of prohibited chemical weapons in Ukraine, making it a "standardized and commonplace" tactic. The report states that Russian forces are deploying substances like the WWI-era poison gas chloropicrin and riot control agents against Ukrainian soldiers in trenches. This forces them into the open where they can be targeted by conventional fire. Dutch officials condemned the practice as a violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention and called for further sanctions against Moscow.</p>

As of Friday, the fire was only 10% contained, with hundreds of personnel, air tankers, and helicopters deployed to combat its spread.

          <p>During a speech in Iowa, President Trump used the word "shylocks" to describe some lenders, a term that is widely recognized as an offensive antisemitic trope. The word references a greedy Jewish moneylender character from Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice." When questioned by reporters, Trump claimed he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations and believed it simply meant a moneylender who charges high rates. The Anti-Defamation League and other critics condemned the president's language as irresponsible and dangerous, calling it a blatant use of antisemitism.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, acclaimed documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as one of the most important events in world history because it introduced the novel concept of a "citizen." He argued that before America's independence, people were merely subjects ruled by others, and the Declaration of Independence set in motion centuries of global movements for equality and unalienable rights. Burns emphasized that the greatness of America comes from telling its complicated stories, including the struggles of marginalized groups who were not initially included but were inspired by the document's powerful words.</p>

          <p>A trial has begun for two brothers accused of assaulting three police officers at Manchester Airport last summer. Prosecutors allege the incident began when one brother, Mohammed Fahir Amaaz, headbutted and punched another man during a confrontation at a Starbucks in the terminal. When armed police located the brothers at a car park payment area to make an arrest, both men allegedly resisted violently, resulting in injuries to the officers, including a broken nose for one. The defendants claim they were acting in self-defense, but the prosecution states that CCTV footage captured the events.</p>

          <p>A key provision in the newly passed federal budget package creates a tax deduction for tipped income, effectively eliminating the federal income tax burden on those earnings. The measure is aimed at workers in industries like hospitality, where tips constitute a significant portion of income. However, the specifics, including income caps for eligibility and the maximum deductible amount, vary between the House and Senate versions of the bill. Critics note the tax break is temporary, expiring in 2028, and may not benefit the lowest-income workers who already have no federal tax liability. (not investment advice)</p>

During a speech in Iowa, Trump floated the idea of building a temporary venue for 20,000 to 25,000 people for the event on July 4, 2026. He stated that UFC CEO Dana White, a vocal supporter, would be involved in organizing the proposed fight. The White House has never hosted a professional sporting event of this nature on its grounds before, making the proposal highly unusual.</p>

This warning was delivered to the EU's trade commissioner during negotiations in Washington, escalating trade tensions between the two economic powers. The proposed tariffs would affect a wide range of popular European exports, from Belgian chocolate to Italian olive oil. The threat is part of an aggressive negotiating strategy as the administration approaches a self-imposed deadline to finalize new trade deals with dozens of countries, with the EU now preparing for a potential trade war.
