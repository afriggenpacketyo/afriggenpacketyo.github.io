        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed a historic free trade agreement, aiming to boost the British economy by an estimated £4.8 billion annually. The deal will lower tariffs on UK exports like cars and whisky to India, while Indian goods such as textiles will become cheaper in the UK. This agreement, which took three years to negotiate, also includes provisions for enhanced cooperation on defense, security, and tackling illegal migration. While the deal promises significant economic benefits and job creation, it still requires ratification by the UK parliament before coming into effect.</p>

          <p>In a significant technological achievement, a fleet of 16 drones in China successfully transported 180 tonnes of steel and concrete up a mountain to build three electricity transmission towers. The operation, which took only three days, demonstrated a tenfold increase in efficiency compared to the traditional month-long process of building cableways. The drones operated autonomously along pre-programmed routes to deliver the materials with high precision to altitudes of up to 1,650 meters. This feat highlights the growing labor-saving benefits and advanced capabilities of unmanned aerial systems in complex construction projects.</p>

          <p>A Russian An-24 passenger plane carrying 43 passengers and six crew members has crashed in the country's far eastern Amur region. The aircraft disappeared from radar while on a flight from Blagoveshchensk to the town of Tynda. According to Russia's federal aviation agency, a search and rescue helicopter discovered the burning fuselage of the plane. Emergency services have been deployed to the crash site, but the status of the passengers and crew remains unconfirmed as the situation develops, with more than 50 personnel involved in the search efforts.</p>

          <p>Violent military clashes have erupted between Thailand and Cambodia along their disputed border, resulting in the deaths of at least twelve people, primarily Thai civilians. Both nations have accused each other of initiating the conflict, which escalated with gunfire, rockets, and Thai air strikes on Cambodian military targets. The dispute, rooted in a century-old border demarcation, has led to border closures and the evacuation of tens of thousands of civilians. The conflict represents a significant deterioration in relations, with leaders from both countries expressing a desire for peaceful resolution while asserting their right to respond to aggression.</p>

          <p>New data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reveals that approximately one in eight women, or 12.8%, were victims of sexual assault, domestic abuse, or stalking in England and Wales over the last year. These figures are part of the government's effort to monitor its goal of halving violence against women and girls. The survey estimates that 5.2 million people overall experienced these crimes, with women being disproportionately affected compared to men. While the statistics provide a crucial overview, charities like Women's Aid note that they may underestimate the gendered nature of these crimes, particularly regarding repeat victimization.</p>

The survey also highlights a drop in confidence about the program's future, even as 96% of Americans consider it important.

Prosecutors argued she was a vital participant who identified, groomed, and abused teenage girls, enabling Epstein's crimes.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how large, high-rise apartment complexes, known as 'apateu,' have become the dominant and most desirable form of housing in South Korea, a stark contrast to the American ideal of a single-family home. Driven by government policies to address a housing crisis decades ago, these standardized complexes now house 64% of the population and offer integrated amenities that create miniature towns. While this model has efficiently housed millions, it has also led to criticism of a homogenized culture and sterile cityscape. Despite these issues and a current affordability crisis, the convenience and status of apartment living remain deeply ingrained in South Korean society.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that broad economic sanctions, primarily imposed by the U.S., are a form of deadly warfare that kills hundreds of thousands of innocent people annually, disproportionately affecting children. Citing a recent study, the author compares the death toll from sanctions to that of armed conflict, stating they devastate essential services like food and healthcare systems. The article posits that sanctions are used because their destructive impact is less visible than military action, though they constitute collective punishment and violate international law. The author calls for an end to this form of economic violence by increasing public awareness of its human cost.</p>

The article emphasizes that these children are among the most vulnerable and that investing in their early development through proven programs like Head Start is crucial for the nation's future well-being.

          <p>A student protest movement in Serbia, initially united in demanding accountability for a deadly infrastructure collapse, is now grappling with internal ideological divisions. The movement, which began with a focus on non-partisanship and justice, has seen a rise in nationalist symbols and rhetoric at its demonstrations. This has led to criticism that the protests are being co-opted by right-wing interests. Despite these tensions, research suggests the movement has positively impacted youth attitudes towards democracy, highlighting the fragile balance between maintaining broad-based unity and navigating deep-seated political and national questions within Serbian society.</p>

This policy aims to ease the financial burden on families, stimulate consumption in the growing "silver economy," and strengthen the social safety net.

The EU has become increasingly concerned about China's export of excess industrial goods, leading to tariffs on Chinese EVs and subsequent anti-dumping probes from Beijing.
