          <h2>Letter from Titanic Survivor Sells for Record Price at Auction</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-27 00:29:55 EDT</div>

          <p>A letter penned by Colonel Archibald Gracie, a survivor of the Titanic disaster, fetched a staggering £300,000 at auction, far exceeding its initial estimate. Dated April 10, 1912, just five days before the ship's sinking, the letter reveals Col. Gracie's anticipation for his voyage and his positive impression of the "fine ship." The letter's prophetic nature lies in Col. Gracie stating that he would "await my journey's end" before passing judgment on the Titanic, unknowingly foreshadowing the tragic events that would soon unfold in the North Atlantic. The anonymous buyer acquired the letter at Henry Aldridge and Son auction house in Wiltshire, marking a significant piece of Titanic history.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers snapped a three-game losing streak in dramatic fashion, overcoming the Pittsburgh Pirates with a late-inning surge fueled by home runs from Teoscar Hernández and Kiké Hernández. Teoscar Hernández's leadoff blast in the eighth put the Dodgers ahead, while Kiké Hernández's pinch-hit, three-run shot sealed the 8-4 victory at Dodger Stadium. Shohei Ohtani also contributed significantly with two doubles and a triple, signaling a potential return to form after a recent slump. Rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki, making his sixth start, showed improved velocity, further contributing to the Dodgers' positive momentum.</p>

          <p>A recent ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll indicates that Donald Trump's job approval rating has plummeted to its lowest point in 80 years, with only 39% of respondents approving of his performance. The poll reveals widespread disapproval of Trump's policies and growing economic anxiety, with 72% believing his policies will likely trigger a recession. Furthermore, a significant majority of voters express concerns about rising prices and the impact of tariffs, challenging Trump's promise of an economic turnaround. Despite these negative assessments, Trump maintains an edge over congressional Democrats in terms of trust to address the nation's key issues.</p>

          <p>Romania is grappling with a surge of online disinformation ahead of its presidential election redo, including claims of imminent war with Russia. The campaign, attributed to anti-government and pro-Russian actors, highlights the exploitation of social media platforms to sow distrust and spread anti-Western narratives. The EU Commission has launched a probe into TikTok for potentially violating the Digital Services Act in failing to address risks to Romania's election.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Europe's pharmaceutical industry is bracing for potential disruptions as President Trump threatens to impose higher tariffs on pharmaceuticals imported from the European Union. This move could significantly impact the flow of essential medicines like insulin, heart treatments, and antibiotics, which have traditionally been exempt from tariffs to ensure affordability. Pharmaceutical products and chemicals constitute the EU's top export to the United States, including blockbuster drugs like Ozempic and various cancer treatments. The imposition of tariffs could have serious consequences for drug availability and pricing in the American market, given its high prices and large consumer base.</p>

          <p>Australia, once a prime destination for international students, is now considering capping their numbers due to a growing housing affordability crisis. Politicians are proposing this measure to reduce demand for rentals and starter homes, aiming to alleviate pressure on prices. This marks a significant shift for Australia, which previously viewed international education as a key economic driver. However, some argue that a blanket ban or limiting the number of students may not be the best approach, suggesting a focus on improving selection criteria instead. The situation highlights the complex interplay between economic growth, immigration, and social issues.</p>

          <p>Despite a recent market rebound, some Wall Street analysts remain skeptical, citing concerns about the long-term economic impact of the ongoing trade war. Michael Mullaney of Boston Partners is closely monitoring economic data, including shipping volumes and consumer spending, which he believes indicate early signs of damage from the tariffs. While others are relieved by signals of easing tensions from the White House, Mullaney is holding cash, fearing that the trade war's fallout may be too entrenched to avert significant economic consequences. This cautious stance highlights the uncertainty and varying perspectives surrounding the trade situation's potential effects on the market.</p>
