          <p>China's industrial profits dropped by 9.1% in May year-over-year, marking the most significant decline in seven months. The National Bureau of Statistics cited insufficient domestic demand and falling industrial product prices as primary causes for the slump. This downturn comes amid a mixed economic landscape, where strong retail sales contrast with weaker-than-expected industrial output and investment. Economists are now debating whether these figures will prompt Beijing to introduce further stimulus measures, especially with the upcoming Politburo meeting in July. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has launched an investigation following a crane collapse at SpaceX's Starbase facility in Texas. The incident, captured on a livestream, has raised further questions about the company's workplace safety record, which has previously been reported as exceeding the industry average. The article notes that this event comes after a Musk-led government initiative reduced OSHA's resources, potentially limiting its enforcement capabilities. The collapse adds to a series of recent setbacks for SpaceX, including issues with its Starship vehicle and ongoing environmental concerns.</p>

          <p>The British government is reportedly preparing to scale back its proposed welfare reforms following significant opposition from within the Labour party. In a major concession, planned cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health element of Universal Credit will now apply only to future claimants, protecting existing recipients. This change comes after more than 100 Labour MPs threatened to vote against the flagship bill, forcing the government to avoid a potential defeat in the Commons. The move is being widely viewed as a substantial U-turn and a challenge to the prime minister's authority.</p>

          <p>A northern West Virginia region is once again facing severe flash flooding, less than two weeks after a deadly storm system resulted in nine fatalities. Heavy rainfall on Thursday caused local creeks to overflow, inundating streets and homes in the Wheeling area, many of which were still being repaired from the previous flood. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning, noting that up to two inches of rain had fallen rapidly. This event highlights the ongoing vulnerability of the community, which is still grappling with the aftermath of the recent tragedy.</p>

          <p>House Oversight Committee Republicans have issued a subpoena to Anthony Bernal, a former senior aide to Jill Biden, compelling his testimony in their investigation into former President Joe Biden's mental fitness. The probe, which Democrats have labeled a partisan exercise, seeks to determine if there was an effort to conceal the former president's condition from the public. This move follows the committee's interviews with other ex-staffers and comes after President Trump waived executive privilege for eight former Biden administration officials, including Bernal. The investigation is part of a broader Republican effort to scrutinize the previous administration's actions.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President William Lai is facing criticism from opposition lawmakers after a recent speech in which he compared Taiwan's democratic progress to forging steel by removing "all impurities." Critics have interpreted this rhetoric as a veiled threat and an attempt to justify a purge of political dissent. The opposition claims these remarks are linked to the ruling party's efforts to recall dozens of Kuomintang (KMT) legislators. They have accused Lai of promoting extreme ideological purity and have called on the public to reject what they term a move toward "dictatorship."</p>

Prosecutors argued that Combs coerced the women into sexual encounters with male escorts, using physical abuse and threats of releasing explicit videos to ensure their compliance.

          <p>Sportswear giant Nike has stated that US tariffs could increase its costs by approximately $1 billion this year, prompting the company to shift production out of China. The company's CFO announced plans to reduce the percentage of US-bound goods manufactured in China from 16% to the "high single-digit" range by May 2026. This comes as the White House faces a July 9 deadline for its 90-day pause on higher reciprocal tariffs, with officials suggesting an extension is possible. Despite the tariff-related headwinds, Nike's stock rose after it forecasted better-than-expected quarterly revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

The proposed legislation, which extends tax cuts from his first term and increases funding for immigration enforcement, has been heavily criticized by Democrats.

Following the session, Republican senators largely supported President Trump's claim that the sites were "obliterated," with Lindsey Graham stating the strikes set Iran's program back for years. Conversely, leading Democrats like Chuck Schumer and Chris Murphy argued the briefing revealed no coherent long-term strategy and accused the administration of misleading the public.
