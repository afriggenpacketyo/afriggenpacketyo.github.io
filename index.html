          <p>Former "Empire" actor Jussie Smollett has settled a lawsuit filed against him by the city of Chicago by agreeing to donate $50,000 to a local charity, the Building Brighter Futures Center for the Arts.

The article highlights the contrast between Trump's narrative and the experiences of Black South Africans who have also been victims of crime and violence.

          <p>Following a decision by China’s major banks to reduce one-year deposit rates below 1%, Chinese households are struggling to find secure investment alternatives.

The decline in deposit yields exacerbates financial uncertainty for families already facing weak income prospects and economic challenges.
