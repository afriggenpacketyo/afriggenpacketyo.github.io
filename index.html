            <p>Chinese museums are being directed to promote ethnic unity and counter "wrong historical views," according to Pan Yue, director of the National Ethnic Affairs Commission. Museums should avoid portraying the Han ethnicity in confrontational contexts with ethnic minorities and focus on telling the "China story" using archaeological findings. This initiative aims to cultivate a "sense of community" within the country, representing China as diverse but unified. Museums are expected to place every cultural relic and historical narrative within a system of overall development of the Chinese nation.</p>

            <p>US air strikes on the Ras Isa oil terminal in Yemen, controlled by the Houthi movement, have reportedly killed at least 74 people and wounded 171, according to the Houthi-run health ministry. The US military stated the strikes aimed to degrade the Houthis' economic power and restrict their access to fuel and revenue. The Houthi-led government condemned the strikes as a "war crime," claiming the terminal was a civilian facility. Thousands of Houthi supporters rallied in Sanaa to protest the US action, while Iran's foreign ministry also strongly condemned the strikes.</p>

            <p>President Trump shared an image on Truth Social that he claimed showed a hand with an MS-13 tattoo, alleging it belonged to Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man deported to El Salvador. The image has been questioned by many as potentially being digitally altered, with users pointing out inconsistencies. Abrego Garcia's deportation has been controversial, as courts have ordered his return to the U.S., while the administration insists he is a gang member, despite initial claims his deportation was an administrative error. Senator Chris Van Hollen has also been involved, visiting Abrego Garcia in El Salvador.</p>

            <p>Gov. Gavin Newsom has granted clemency to 25 felons, including Sithy Bin, a Cambodian immigrant facing deportation, in a series of pardons and commutations issued before Easter.

            <p>A divided panel of judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily paused an effort to investigate whether the Trump administration engaged in criminal contempt by refusing to turn around deportation flights. The order does not rule on the merits of the inquiry, but gives the petitioners a deadline to reply to the government. The inquiry was launched after the administration defied an order to return the deportation flights, despite a Supreme Court ruling allowing the deportations to resume.</p>

            <p>Investors are closely monitoring US bond markets due to volatility stemming from trade tariff uncertainties. A rare rise in US government bond rates suggests a loss of investor confidence in the US economy. Higher government borrowing costs can impact public spending and raise rates for mortgages and loans, potentially hindering economic growth. This bond market reaction has been compared to the UK's mini-Budget of 2022, prompting concerns about an emerging risk premium in US Treasury bonds. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A new study reveals that major rice-producing countries in South and Southeast Asia are facing severe cadmium contamination in their fertile regions. This pollution affects up to 1.4 billion people worldwide and contaminates 17% of arable land, posing risks of kidney damage, bone disorders, and respiratory diseases. Cadmium, a carcinogen, is prevalent in rice-growing areas in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, and Thailand. The findings raise concerns about global food safety and the need for mitigation strategies.</p>

While some see it as a victory for common sense, others view it as devastating for trans rights. The ruling aims to provide clarity on the definition of "woman" under the Equality Act, but raises questions about the practical implications for single-sex spaces and the rights of transgender individuals. The EHRC is expected to issue detailed guidance to clarify the changes.</p>
