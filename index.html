          <p>SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son has declared his company is "all in" on OpenAI, viewing it as a cornerstone for his vision of creating "artificial superintelligence" (ASI). Son revealed he had wanted to be OpenAI's primary backer before Microsoft, expressing a belief that the AI firm will eventually become the world's most valuable company. Despite potential friction between OpenAI and Microsoft, Son plans to deepen SoftBank's relationship with the AI leader. This commitment is part of a broader strategy to position SoftBank, alongside its chip company Arm, at the forefront of the ASI era within the next decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's car production experienced a dramatic decline in May, falling to its lowest point for that month in 76 years, excluding the pandemic. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, output dropped by nearly a third to just 49,810 units, largely due to US tariffs that halved exports to the American market. Major manufacturers like Jaguar Land Rover had to halt shipments after the Trump administration imposed a 25% tariff. However, there is some optimism as a new agreement is set to reduce these tariffs, which may alleviate the constraints on production. (not investment advice)</p>

Employers and economists warn that mass deportations and stricter policies could limit economic growth, fuel inflation, and create widespread disruption for millions who have lived and worked in the US for years.

One resident recounted the harrowing experience of saving his family just as their house was washed away.

          <p>China's industrial profits plunged by 9.1% in May compared to the previous year, marking the most significant drop since last October and signaling that stimulus measures are failing to boost corporate earnings. The National Bureau of Statistics attributed the sharp decline to insufficient domestic demand and falling prices for industrial goods amid a fierce price war. For the first five months of 2025, cumulative profits fell 1.1%, with state-owned firms seeing a 7.4% drop. Despite a recovery in retail sales, depressed price levels have prevented businesses from translating increased foot traffic into higher profits. (not investment advice)</p>

Without naming former President Trump, Kennedy's remarks addressed the rise in threats against judges and the need for their protection.

          <p>As UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer approaches his first anniversary in office, his tenure has been defined by a series of crises and a short-lived political honeymoon. After a landslide election victory, his Labour government quickly faced challenges, including domestic riots, controversial budget decisions like means-testing winter fuel payments, and internal party tensions. While Starmer has earned praise on the world stage for his pragmatic diplomacy, particularly with the US and in support of Ukraine, his government has struggled to establish a clear domestic narrative. Recent poor local election results and a major rebellion over welfare reform have plunged his leadership into its gravest crisis yet.</p>

This marks the third major policy reversal in less than a year for the government, which holds a large majority.

Signed in 1975 between West Germany and Brazil's military dictatorship, the treaty has been controversial from the start and has long been a target for termination by Germany's Green Party. The deal has resulted in only one operational power plant, Angra-2, which is plagued by safety concerns. With Germany having phased out its own nuclear power, critics argue the outdated agreement should be replaced with partnerships focused on renewable energy, a move the current SPD party supports.</p>

          <p>Japan has carried out its first execution since 2022, hanging Takahiro Shiraishi, who was convicted of murdering and dismembering nine people in 2017. Shiraishi, dubbed the "Twitter killer," contacted his victims, aged 15 to 26, on social media after they expressed suicidal thoughts, luring them to his apartment where he killed them. The execution, authorized by the Justice Minister, occurs amid growing calls from human rights groups to abolish capital punishment in Japan. However, public support for the practice remains high in the country, which is one of the few major industrialized democracies to retain the death penalty.</p>

          <p>Lynne Tracy, the first woman to serve as the U.S. ambassador to Russia, is leaving her post after a tenure that spanned one of the most difficult periods in bilateral relations. A career diplomat, Tracy represented the U.S. in Moscow since January 2023, navigating the fallout from Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Her departure comes as relations remain tense, despite discussions of a potential reset under the Trump administration. Tracy was notably involved in efforts to secure the release of jailed Americans and expressed her pride in representing her country during such a challenging time.</p>

          <p>A Japanese court has handed down a three-year suspended prison sentence to a 23-year-old South Korean student for a hammer attack at a university campus in suburban Tokyo.

According to consulting firm Deloitte, the increased activity reflects the success of regulatory efforts to restore market confidence and improve the quality of new listings.

          <p>NATO has officially adopted a new commercial space strategy, aiming to better integrate private sector capabilities into the alliance's defense framework. This comes alongside a new pledge for member nations to more than double defense spending to 5% of their GDP by 2035, a move strongly advocated by U.S. President Donald Trump. These initiatives are set to create significant opportunities for defense and space companies, particularly in areas like communication, surveillance, and intelligence. The developments also fuel the ongoing debate in Europe about reducing reliance on commercial services like SpaceX's Starlink for critical infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

While they champion the ecological benefits of beavers, such as flood mitigation and water purification, the National Farmers Union has condemned the illegal releases as irresponsible.
