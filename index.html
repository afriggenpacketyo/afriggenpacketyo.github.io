          <p>Tens of thousands gathered in Arizona to memorialize conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot on September 10. Prominent conservative figures, including Donald Trump and JD Vance, eulogized Kirk as a "martyr" and "warrior" for their movement, vowing that his work would continue. In an emotional address, Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, announced that she forgives the alleged shooter and will take over as CEO of his organization, Turning Point USA. Trump closed the service with remarks that mixed praise for Kirk with his own political grievances, stating he "hates" his opponents.</p>

          <p>The People's Bank of China has kept its key lending rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, despite a recent interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The one-year loan prime rate (LPR) remains at 3.0%, and the five-year LPR, which influences mortgage pricing, stays at 3.5%. This decision was widely expected by economists, who believe Chinese authorities are holding off on major stimulus measures for now, even as economic data indicates signs of slowing. Policymakers are still anticipated to introduce some marginal monetary easing later this year to help meet the government's annual growth target.</p>

          <p>A shooting at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, resulted in one death and two injuries during a Saturday evening event. Authorities arrested 23-year-old Hunter Nadeau, a former employee of the club, and charged him with second-degree murder. The deceased victim was identified as 59-year-old Robert Steven DeCesare, who was dining at the club's restaurant. Officials stated that there is no known connection between the suspect and the victims, and they are still investigating the motive for the attack, which witnesses say was stopped in part by patrons who intervened.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandez-Santana, has been taken into FBI custody after allegedly firing multiple rounds at the ABC10 television station building in Sacramento. The incident, which occurred on Friday afternoon, caused property damage but resulted in no injuries. Sacramento police initially arrested the suspect on local charges related to a drive-by shooting before he was re-arrested by the FBI on a federal charge of interfering with a radio communications station. The motive for the shooting remains under investigation, and the event has drawn condemnation from public officials as an attack on journalism and democracy.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people with terminal illnesses are creating personal music playlists to provide comfort and connection during their final days. This practice leverages the therapeutic benefits of music, which neurologically and emotionally can reduce anxiety and evoke powerful memories for both the patient and their loved ones. Palliative care experts note that hearing is often the last sense to go, allowing music to reach even unconscious individuals and provide a sense of peace.

          <p>German and Swedish fighter jets were scrambled on Sunday to intercept a Russian IL-20M reconnaissance aircraft flying without a transponder or radio contact in neutral airspace over the Baltic Sea. The interception is the latest in a series of recent incursions by Russian military aircraft into or near NATO airspace, which have heightened regional tensions. In separate incidents this month, Russian aircraft and drones have violated the airspace of Estonia, Poland, and Romania, prompting these nations to invoke NATO's Article 4 for consultations. NATO officials view these actions as Russian provocations intended to distract Western allies from their support for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>At Charlie Kirk's memorial service, Vice President JD Vance positioned himself as a central figure in the conservative movement, emphasizing Christian faith and his personal connection to the slain activist. Vance, who escorted Kirk's casket to Arizona, delivered a speech framing Kirk as a martyr and spoke more openly about his own faith, resonating with the evangelical audience. Political analysts view these actions as part of a "soft launch" for a potential 2028 presidential campaign, aiming to inherit Kirk's influence among young conservatives and solidify his standing as Donald Trump's successor. His strategic moves position him as a formidable force in the future of the Republican party.</p>

While acknowledging Kirk's desire to "love" his opponents, Trump stated, "That’s where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponents." The remarks came after Kirk's widow, Erika, had offered forgiveness to the alleged shooter. Trump also veered into other topics, including a future announcement on autism and his grievances, which struck an unusual tone for a memorial service attended by tens of thousands of mourners in Arizona.</p>

The announcement drew a sharp rebuke from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a "huge reward to terror" and vowed that a Palestinian state would not be established.

          <p>A study of over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that children with exceptional social skills are often raised by parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. These practices include talking openly about emotions, demonstrating empathy in daily life, and allowing children to attempt tasks and even fail, which builds authentic confidence. Instead of rushing to solve every conflict, these parents provide a safe environment for children to practice problem-solving and learn how to repair relationships after disagreements. By validating feelings and listening more than lecturing, parents teach crucial lessons in emotional intelligence and respectful communication.</p>

Led by MIT's Kevin Esvelt, the "Mice Against Ticks" project aims to introduce a gene that would make the mice, the primary carriers of the Lyme bacteria, immune to the disease. This heritable immunity would be passed down through generations, breaking the cycle of infection where ticks feed on infected mice and then transmit the illness to humans. The project is being developed in close consultation with the local community to address ecological and ethical concerns before any potential release.</p>

          <p>The monarch butterfly population that migrates from the U.S. and Canada to a specific forest in Mexico represents a unique "super generation." These butterflies live up to nine times longer than typical monarchs, suppressing their reproductive hormones to conserve energy for the 3,000-mile journey. Scientists are still studying the mysteries of their navigation and why they return to the same remote mountains each year. However, the monarch population has declined by 70% in the last 30 years due to habitat loss, particularly the eradication of milkweed plants in the U.S. Conservation efforts are underway to support this remarkable natural phenomenon.</p>

He argued that while pursuing a trade deal is important, the UK government should not hesitate to "call out" actions by the Trump administration that conflict with British values, such as its lukewarm stance on NATO.

          <p>Saks Global, the parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, is reportedly negotiating the sale of a 49% stake in the luxury retailer Bergdorf Goodman. The potential deal is valued at approximately $1 billion and has attracted interest from at least four bidders, including sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East. According to the Wall Street Journal, the proceeds from the sale would be used to pay down debt incurred from Saks Global's acquisition of Neiman Marcus last year. A deal could potentially be finalized early next year, marking a significant strategic move for the luxury retail conglomerate.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are expected to be part of an investment group seeking to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as likely participants in the deal, describing them as "American patriots." The sale is mandated by a 2024 law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. arm over national security concerns regarding user data. The White House has signaled that a deal is imminent, which would place control of the popular social media app in the hands of prominent U.S. investors.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to announce a potential link between the use of acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, during pregnancy and the development of autism. According to reports, federal health officials will warn pregnant women against using the painkiller unless necessary for a fever and may also highlight a form of folate as a potential treatment. The maker of Tylenol, Kenvue, has strongly refuted any causal link, citing over a decade of research and stating that such claims could pose a health risk to expecting mothers with few safe alternatives for fever reduction. President Trump hinted at a major announcement on Monday.</p>

          <p>In the wake of the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and a separate deadly shootout involving police in his state, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has called for a universal condemnation of political violence. Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," Shapiro stated that the nation is at an "inflection point" and must choose healing and commonality over division. He referenced his own experience with political violence, including a firebombing at the governor's mansion in April, to emphasize that such acts leave lasting scars. Shapiro distinguished between protected political speech and illicit incitement to violence, urging Americans to reject the latter.</p>

Later, in the ninth, he made a leaping grab at the wall to take away a potential game-tying home run from Francisco Álvarez.

In an interview with the BBC, Lee described a freeze as a "feasible, realistic alternative" and an "interim emergency measure" to halt the North's current production of 15-20 new nuclear weapons annually. This marks a pragmatic shift in policy, acknowledging that complete denuclearization is not currently achievable. President Lee hopes that Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un can resume the nuclear talks that broke down during Trump's first term.</p>

DRPLA causes symptoms like seizures, memory loss, and impaired motor control, with no known cure. Parents are sharing their experiences of their children's deteriorating health and the difficulty in getting a diagnosis, hoping to improve access to genetic testing and support for affected families as they navigate the devastating illness.</p>

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion, privately-financed plan to bring London Gatwick Airport's northern runway into regular use, effectively creating a second runway. The project is intended to boost economic growth, increase the airport's flight capacity from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 per year, and raise passenger numbers to 80 million annually. The approval comes after the airport agreed to stricter noise controls and traffic mitigation measures to address concerns from planning inspectors. However, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups worried about the impact of increased air traffic and climate emissions.</p>
