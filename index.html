          <p>In celebration of National Adopt a Shelter Pet Day, NPR compiled stories from readers about how adopting shelter pets has impacted their lives. These stories range from animals saving their owners' lives by detecting cancer or interrupting seizures, to providing companionship through difficult times like divorce or the loss of a spouse. Many owners emphasized the unconditional love and joy their pets brought into their lives, and the unexpected ways these animals helped them heal and grow. The collection also highlights the value of adopting adult dogs and rabbits, challenging breed perceptions, and advocating for animal rights.</p>

Iranian authorities are investigating the cause of the explosion, which occurred amidst ongoing talks with the US regarding Tehran's nuclear program.

          <p>Vietnam is preparing to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, a pivotal event that unified the country under communist rule. While the official designation remains "The Liberation of the South and National Reunification Day," there's a growing preference for the more neutral term "Reunification Day." This shift reflects an effort to reconcile with Vietnamese citizens abroad and improve relations with the United States. The article explores how Vietnam's evolving geopolitical landscape influences the language used to describe its past, balancing relationships with both China and the U.S.</p>

          <p>The San Jacinto Tunnel, a 13-mile-long aqueduct that delivers water to Southern California, was recently opened for a rare glimpse during its annual maintenance shutdown. Built in the 1930s, this engineering marvel transports up to 1 billion gallons of Colorado River water per day. The tunnel is usually inaccessible when filled, but the shutdown allowed a view of the constant stream of groundwater seeping from the mountain.

          <p>A New York Times investigation reveals that a combination of errors contributed to a deadly collision between an Army Black Hawk helicopter and an American Airlines regional jet near Ronald Reagan National Airport. The investigation found that the Black Hawk crew failed to effectively execute a common aviation practice, known as flying under see and avoid rules. The practice requires pilots to visually identify and avoid other air traffic, often without air traffic controller assistance. The investigation highlights how the modern aviation system's redundancies collapsed, leading to the tragic accident.</p>
