          <p>The Trump administration has revoked the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials, a move announced by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. Gabbard accused these individuals of politicizing intelligence, failing to safeguard classified information, and engaging in other detrimental conduct, but the memo provided no supporting evidence. Many targeted officials had worked on issues, including the 2016 Russian election interference assessment, that have long drawn President Trump's ire. Critics assert that this action, previously used against figures like former President Joe Biden, risks suppressing diverse viewpoints within the intelligence community.</p>

Although not expected to make direct U.S. landfall, coastal flooding has prompted evacuation orders for North Carolina's Outer Banks. The storm, downgraded to a Category 2, is still large, with hurricane-force winds extending up to 80 miles from its center.

The company, known for its "blind box" marketing strategy, saw significant growth in Asia-Pacific and the Americas. Despite the impressive financial results and stock rally, analysts express concern about the long-term longevity of its intellectual properties and the inherent business risks, suggesting shares may be overpriced.

These groups will include land, maritime, air defense, and missile defense units, alongside information warfare and strategic strike groups. Advanced early warning aircraft, fighter jets, bombers, and transport aircraft are expected to participate, with some "star" weaponry making its public debut.

          <p>Five veteran FBI agents, including high-ranking officials like former acting director Brian Driscoll and Washington field office head Steven Jensen, were abruptly fired earlier this month without clear explanation. Sources close to the agents suggest the dismissals were politically motivated, possibly linked to their involvement in investigations concerning former President Trump or January 6. Whistleblower attorneys are preparing to sue, alleging unlawful and unconstitutional actions that deviate from established policies. Critics, including Democratic senators, warn that purging agents for non-partisan work weakens national security and risks chilling independent law enforcement.</p>

Meanwhile, China maintained its key lending rates steady for the third consecutive month, aligning with market forecasts. The broader market downturn also impacted major tech firms like SoftBank Group, whose shares plunged significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is increasingly using tariffs as a political weapon rather than a traditional diplomatic tool, a shift from previous bipartisan efforts to deepen international ties. This approach is evident in the escalated tariffs threatened against India, linked to its continued purchase of Russian oil, and against Canada for its stance on Palestinian statehood. Experts argue that these "national security tariffs" are aimed at compelling loyalty to the U.S. and reasserting global leadership, rather than purely economic protection. Critics warn this strategy risks alienating allies and diminishing America's diplomatic influence.</p>

          <p>An outbreak of leptospirosis, a kidney disease, is significantly affecting California sea lion populations, particularly in Central and Northern California, and poses a risk to humans and pets. The Marine Mammal Center reports over 200 affected sea lions since early July, with a high mortality rate. Humans can contract the bacterial illness through contaminated water or soil, experiencing symptoms like fever and muscle aches, though it is treatable with antibiotics. Experts advise keeping dogs leashed near shorelines and avoiding marine mammals, noting that historical outbreaks have become more frequent since 2018.</p>

          <p>China's FH-97, a single-engine, ground-attack uncrewed aircraft, is emerging as potentially the country's first combat-ready stealth drone, designed for coordinated aerial warfare alongside crewed jets. Leaked photos from rehearsals for China's September 3 military parade suggest the FH-97 will make its official debut. If confirmed, this would position China as the first nation to field such a "loyal wingman" drone ready for combat. Developed by a subsidiary of the state-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the drone signifies a significant advancement in China's military capabilities.</p>

          <p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK has recommended a significant overhaul of type 2 diabetes care, advocating for a more personalized approach and increased access to newer medicines, including weight-loss drugs. This "biggest shake-up" in a decade aims to prevent severe complications like heart disease and kidney damage, reduce NHS costs, and potentially save lives. The guidance suggests making SGLT-2 inhibitors a first-choice treatment for many, and offering GLP-1 agonists (weight-loss jab drugs) to more patients. The changes are expected to particularly benefit those in poorer areas and ethnic minorities.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports experienced their steepest decline in over four years in July, dropping 2.6% year-over-year, worse than anticipated, primarily due to reduced shipments to its largest markets, the United States and China. Exports to the U.S., especially automobiles, saw a significant fall, despite a recent reduction in U.S. tariffs on Japanese autos from 25% to 15%. While the full impact of these tariffs won't be seen until August data, analysts warn of potential recession risks for the Japanese economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has released new COVID-19 vaccine recommendations that, for the first time in 30 years, diverge from U.S. government advice. The AAP "strongly recommends" COVID-19 shots for children aged 6 months to 2 years, while advising them for older children at parents' discretion. In contrast, the CDC, under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., does not recommend the shots for healthy children of any age, suggesting consultation with physicians instead. This highlights a notable split in public health guidance, with the AAP emphasizing science-rooted recommendations for child health.</p>

          <p>Silicon Valley is witnessing a trend where major tech companies like Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon acquire AI talent from startups through high-priced licensing deals, effectively creating "zombie startups." This strategy allows tech giants to skirt regulatory scrutiny while gaining top AI researchers and founders, often leaving investors and remaining employees in limbo. These deals, exemplified by Meta's investment in Scale AI and Microsoft's acquisition of Inflection AI talent, disrupt the traditional venture capital model. Critics express concern that this practice could stifle innovation as founders increasingly abandon their ambitious projects for larger corporations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's recent comments on the Russia-Ukraine war suggests he has internalized pro-Moscow talking points, despite his stated aim to be a "peace president." During a Fox News interview, Trump appeared to blame past administrations for the conflict, echoing the Kremlin's narrative that the war began due to Crimea and NATO expansion. He characterized Ukraine as the aggressor for refusing to cede land and described mass deaths as if from a natural disaster. Critics argue his remarks betray a fundamental misunderstanding of the conflict and align with Russian justifications for its aggression.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly accused Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of "betraying Israel" and abandoning Australia's Jewish community, escalating diplomatic tensions between the two nations. This strong condemnation follows Australia's decision to bar a far-right Israeli politician from entry and its recent announcement to recognize a Palestinian state. Israel retaliated by revoking visas for Australian representatives to the Palestinian Authority. Opposition leaders in Israel criticized Netanyahu's remarks, suggesting they inadvertently strengthen Albanese by creating a confrontation with a "politically toxic leader."</p>

Other conflicts, such as Rwanda-DR Congo, continue to see fighting despite agreements. His claims regarding Egypt-Ethiopia and Serbia-Kosovo are disputed, as those were not active wars.</p>
