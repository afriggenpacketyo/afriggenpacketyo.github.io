          <p>This article provides an overview of current interest rates for savings accounts, highlighting the significant difference between the national average and the rates offered by high-yield savings accounts. It explains that while the average rate is quite low, consumers can earn substantially more by choosing high-yield options, which are often available through online banks with lower overhead costs. The text advises savers to compare different accounts, considering not just interest rates but also fees, to maximize their earnings and effectively build an emergency fund.

          <p>As U.S. lawmakers return to Washington, they face a series of pressing issues, headlined by a fast-approaching government funding deadline of September 30, which risks a shutdown amid partisan disagreements. The agenda is further complicated by debates over Senate nomination rules, the confirmation of key economic officials, and President Trump's push for a new crime bill and extended federal control over Washington D.C.'s police. Additionally, there is a bipartisan effort to compel the Justice Department to release files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

          <p>The article outlines the current average interest rates for 15-year and 30-year mortgages and refinances, acknowledging the challenging market for borrowers due to higher rates compared to previous years. It suggests that potential relief may come if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes, but emphasizes proactive steps borrowers can take to secure better rates. Key recommendations include strengthening one's credit profile, paying bills on time, and comparing offers from multiple lenders to find the most favorable terms. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The interest rate on 30-year UK government bonds has reached its highest point since 1998, signaling increased borrowing costs and mounting fiscal pressure on Chancellor Rachel Reeves ahead of the next budget. This spike in bond yields reflects growing investor concern over the state of the UK's public finances, leading to speculation that the government may need to implement tax increases to adhere to its self-imposed financial rules. The situation is compounded by a weakening pound against the dollar, further complicating the economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has launched a campaign directly contacting tens of thousands of international students, warning them they face removal if they overstay their visas by claiming asylum. The government cites an "alarming" increase in students who arrive legally and then apply for asylum when their study visas expire, with data showing this group now accounts for a significant portion of total applications. While officials state some claims lack merit, refugee advocacy groups argue that circumstances in students' home countries can change, making their asylum claims genuine.</p>

          <p>The article explores deep concerns from human rights advocates and former officials regarding the Department of Homeland Security's aggressive campaign to hire 10,000 new ICE officers. Critics warn that lowered hiring standards, substantial recruitment bonuses, and shortened training periods could lead to a surge in misconduct and abuse, drawing parallels to a problematic expansion in the 2000s. The administration's rhetoric and tactics are fueling fears that the expanded force could operate with diminished accountability and a culture of violence.</p>

          <p>Office leasing in Manhattan is on pace to have its strongest year since 2019, with August's activity significantly surpassing the 10-year monthly average. This robust demand is being fueled by a strong return-to-office push, low unemployment, and a notable resurgence in leasing from the technology and legal sectors. The trend also reflects a "flight to quality," as availability in new and modern buildings has tightened, while office-to-residential conversions are simultaneously reducing the overall supply of available space.

Trump accused India of imposing excessively high tariffs on U.S. goods while benefiting from open access to the American market, deepening tensions that have already been strained by U.S. tariffs imposed on India for its continued purchases of Russian oil.</p>

Arnould stated she was "relieved" by the court's decision, which follows a lengthy process where the case was initially dropped before being reopened.

          <p>This article offers advice to parents who dislike their teenager's friends, cautioning against both outright prohibition and passive inaction. It argues that forbidding friendships can backfire due to psychological "reactance theory," which makes the forbidden relationships more attractive. Instead, parents are encouraged to strengthen the "gravitational pull of home" by consistently modeling their own core values and creating a welcoming environment. This long-term strategy helps parents maintain influence over their children's development without resorting to direct control over their social lives.</p>
