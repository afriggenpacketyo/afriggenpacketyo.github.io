            <p>Zhao Xintong put on a sensational display of snooker against Jak Jones, leaving Jones on the brink of an early exit from the World Snooker Championship. Zhao's impressive performance included a 142 clearance, the highest break of the tournament thus far, along with six half-centuries. Jones, who surprisingly reached last year's final, struggled against Zhao's scoring prowess. With a 7-2 lead, Zhao needs only three more frames to secure victory when the match resumes.</p>

            <p>A report highlights the impact of the Trump Administration's cuts to global health programs in Zambia, focusing on HIV-positive individuals now struggling to access medication. The closure of U.S.-funded clinics has resulted in chaos and confusion, with patients reporting inconsistent access to life-saving drugs. Stories include a 10-year-old girl and her mother, a house painter, and a teenager, all facing dire circumstances due to medication shortages. The Zambian government and U.S. State Department have not responded to inquiries about the situation.</p>

            <p>The current trade war between the United States and China, characterized by escalating tariffs, is likely to strengthen China's geopolitical position and weaken the U.S. economy. China's dominance in producing essential goods gives it an advantage, while the U.S. struggles to quickly shift production domestically or find alternative suppliers. China has prepared for this conflict by investing in key industries and diversifying its export markets. The U.S. could potentially win by uniting with allies, but current policies are undermining this strategy.</p>

            <p>Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has been indicted on federal charges, including murder with a firearm. His online activity, particularly his review of the Unabomber Manifesto, has drawn scrutiny. The manifesto's author, Ted Kaczynski, argued that humans are biologically maladapted to the modern world and advocated for the destruction of modern technology. Mangione's case has sparked controversy, with some seeing him as a vigilante acting against a flawed healthcare system, while others condemn his violent actions.</p>

A roughly six-meter-tall Evangelion Unit 01 statue made its appearance in Hamamatsu, central Japan, on Sunday as part of a local government tourism campaign through next February in the hope of cashing in on the city's connection to the popular anime film. The purple giant humanoid robot from the film "Evangelion: 3.0+1.0 Thrice Upon a Time" will tower over the lobby of Hamamatsu city hall in Shizuoka Prefecture until late January next year, including on weekends and public holidays.</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has fallen to its lowest point, fueled by widespread dissatisfaction with his handling of tariffs, inflation, and government spending. A recent CNBC survey reveals a decline in economic optimism and increasing pessimism about the stock market. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents express strong disapproval of his economic policies. The public also shows concerns about tariffs, inflation, and the possibility of a recession.</p>

Ukraine claims that Russian forces are attempting to create the impression of a ceasefire while continuing attacks in some areas. Russia accuses Ukraine of violating the ceasefire. Some observers view the truce as a PR effort to improve relations with the Trump administration, while others see it as a genuine attempt to de-escalate the conflict.</p>
