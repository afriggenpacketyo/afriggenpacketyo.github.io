          <p>US Vice-President JD Vance commented on Fox News that the war in Ukraine is unlikely to end soon, emphasizing the need for Russia and Ukraine to find middle ground to resolve the conflict. Vance's remarks followed a deal between Washington and Kyiv regarding the sharing of profits from Ukraine's rare earth minerals in exchange for future US security assistance. He questioned whether the continued loss of soldiers over territory was justifiable, while Trump suggested Ukraine might cede Crimea for a truce. Fighting continues, with recent drone attacks and accusations between the two countries, and Ukraine's foreign minister called for a 30-day ceasefire. Optimism score must be between 0 and 100 and be a multiple of 5.</p>

          <p>The memorial at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, honoring the victims of the 2022 massacre, was vandalized, causing renewed grief and anger in the community. White wooden crosses bearing the names of the 19 children and two teachers killed were damaged, prompting a police investigation. Uvalde Police Chief Homer Delgado condemned the act as cruel and senseless, vowing to hold those responsible accountable. The school, which has remained closed since the shooting, is considered a symbol of sorrow, resilience, and remembrance for the Uvalde community.

          <p>China's Commerce Ministry stated that it is evaluating US overtures to initiate trade negotiations, potentially opening discussions to resolve the ongoing trade war. However, China insists that the US must demonstrate sincerity by removing all unilateral tariffs, viewing it as a prerequisite for productive dialogue. Failure to do so would compromise mutual trust between the two nations, according to the statement. This announcement follows conflicting statements from both sides regarding the status of trade talks, with each seeking to avoid appearing to back down first.</p>

          <p>Marine biologists with the Tennessee Valley Authority are surveying fish populations in Douglas Lake for the first time since Hurricane Helene caused debris to cover East Tennessee waterways. The study aims to determine the hurricane's impact on sport fish populations by comparing current data with surveys from the last 30 years. Scientists are examining fish for defects, measuring, and weighing them after shocking the water to temporarily stun them. The findings will help assess any disruptions in shoreline habitat, which is crucial for fish spawning and feeding, and the cleanup on Douglas Lake is about 90% complete.</p>

          <p>The Senate approved a resolution to overturn an EPA rule designed to limit hazardous air pollutants from heavy industry, marking the first time Congress has moved to weaken the Clean Air Act. The rule, finalized by the Biden administration in 2024, required major sources of seven hazardous pollutants to maintain strict pollution controls. Republican lawmakers argued that the rule disincentivized companies from deploying new technology to reduce pollution, while environmental groups blasted the move, warning of increased risks to children's health. The vote is a major victory for the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries.</p>

          <p>Protesters rallied nationwide on May Day in support of workers’ and immigrants’ rights, demonstrating against Donald Trump and his administration. The protests, supported by hundreds of organizations, focused on rallying against the Trump administration and “billionaire profiteers.” Cities across the US saw major demonstrations, with protesters speaking out against attacks on workers, immigrants, and democratic norms. The focus on workers and immigrants comes as Trump has fired federal workers and his administration has ramped up deportations.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported slower than expected growth in its North American retail business, contributing to overall sales growth that was the slowest since the pandemic. The company's first-quarter results showed sales rising 9 percent, while profit increased 64 percent. Amazon added "tariff and trade policies" to the list of factors that could make its forecasts uncertain. CEO Andy Jassy said the company is focused on keeping prices down by purchasing extra inventory in advance of tariffs and helping sellers on Amazon's marketplace do the same. The cloud computing business grew 17 percent.</p>

          <p>Apple announced that most iPhones sold in the US will no longer be sourced from China, as the company tries to mitigate the impact of Donald Trump's tariffs. The tech giant will primarily source iPhones from India and iPads from Vietnam to avoid significant price increases for American consumers. CEO Tim Cook estimates that tariffs will add £677m in costs during the current quarter, assuming Trump's policies remain unchanged. Growing tensions between Washington and Beijing are also impacting Apple's sales in China, which fell 2.3% between January and March.</p>

It emphasizes the importance of aligning purpose, goal, and means in strategy, coupled with a deep understanding of the adversary. The author criticizes the lack of coherent purpose, goal, or strategy in Washington's approach to the trade conflict with China. The piece suggests that the US should focus on its own strengths and address its internal weaknesses rather than solely focusing on competition with China.</p>
