          <p>Elon Musk's xAI has partnered to integrate its Grok AI chatbot with the prediction market platforms Kalshi and Polymarket, where it will provide market summaries and context for wagers. Prediction markets are platforms where users bet real money on the outcomes of real-world events. The move has raised some concerns due to Grok's history of generating controversial and false information, though the companies involved have expressed excitement about the partnership. The integration highlights the growing intersection of AI, finance, and online gambling.</p>

          <p>Lori Vallow Daybell, known as the "doomsday mom," was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences in Arizona for conspiring to murder her fourth husband, Charles Vallow, and for the attempted murder of her niece's ex-husband. These sentences are in addition to the multiple life terms she is already serving in Idaho for murdering two of her children. Prosecutors argued her motives were money and a desire to be with her current husband, Chad Daybell, using twisted religious beliefs as justification for the killings. The judge described her actions as showing a "blatant disregard for humanity."</p>

          <p>The Department of Education has confirmed the release of approximately $6 billion in funding for educational programs that the Trump administration had previously frozen. The funds, which support English language acquisition, teacher development, and adult education, were paused for a review to determine if they were used to promote a "radical leftwing agenda." The decision to release the money follows significant pressure from Republican senators and a lawsuit filed by a coalition of school districts and advocacy groups.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military's role at the southern border has significantly expanded, with 7,600 troops now involved in deterring migrant crossings in a mission guided from a new command center in Arizona. Under new authority, troops in designated "militarized zones" can now apprehend individuals, a departure from the military's traditional supporting role for civilian law enforcement. This escalation, which includes armored vehicles and surveillance drones, is occurring even as data shows that the rate of illegal crossing apprehensions has fallen to a 60-year low.</p>

          <p>A collection of recent polls from sources like Gallup and Pew Research reveals growing public disapproval of President Donald Trump's aggressive immigration policies, especially his focus on mass deportations. The data indicates that a majority of Americans, including key independent and Latino voter demographics, favor creating legal pathways for undocumented immigrants over removal. This sentiment contrasts with the administration's actions, which have included a significant increase in detentions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and a push for more enforcement funding.</p>

Airlines are in the midst of a slow and costly fleet-wide transition to satellite service, with many smaller, regional jets still using the older technology. This technological patchwork is the primary reason passengers experience such inconsistent internet access from one flight to the next.</p>

          <p>A Venezuelan youth baseball team, the Cacique Mara Little League, will miss the Senior League Baseball World Series in South Carolina after being denied U.S. visas. The team, which had won the Latin American championship to qualify, traveled to the U.S. embassy in Bogotá, Colombia, for their visa applications. Little League International confirmed the denial and expressed its extreme disappointment for the young athletes, who will now be replaced in the tournament by the runner-up team from Mexico.</p>

          <p>This article explains the specific, technical criteria required for an official declaration of famine under the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), the system used by global aid organizations. A famine is declared only when three conditions are met: at least 20% of households face catastrophic food shortages, 30% of children are acutely malnourished, and the death rate from non-traumatic causes exceeds two per 10,000 people daily. Experts note that gathering this data in conflict zones like Gaza is extremely difficult, meaning people are often dying of starvation long before the formal declaration can be made.</p>

The case is highly contentious because Germany's parliament has officially recognized the 2014 atrocities committed by the "Islamic State" against the Yazidi religious minority as a genocide, making their forced return particularly problematic.</p>

Hong Kong and Sydney top the list, but five U.S. metropolitan areas also feature in the top ten: San Jose, Los Angeles, Honolulu, San Francisco, and San Diego. The report from Chapman University suggests that a major cause of these high prices is land-use policies that restrict urban growth and housing development on the periphery of cities.

This highly unusual strategy, encouraged by President Trump, is designed to give the GOP an advantage in the 2026 midterm elections. The move challenges long-standing political norms and is forcing Democrats to consider retaliatory measures, though they face significant legal and political obstacles in the states they control, including their own party's historical advocacy for independent commissions.</p>
