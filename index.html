The budget carrier has been struggling with adverse market conditions, including weak demand and a challenging pricing environment, just five months after emerging from bankruptcy. The company is now exploring the sale of assets to raise necessary funds and avoid defaulting on creditor agreements. (not investment advice)</p>

His mother argued that since her son's name has been used throughout the trial, the defendant's should be as well.

          <p>Health experts are highlighting a severe and underreported lung cancer crisis in sub-Saharan Africa, where the disease is often misdiagnosed as tuberculosis. This systemic undercounting means mortality rates do not reflect the true scale of the problem, which is worsened by rising smoking rates and a lack of resources for proper diagnosis and treatment. While South Africa has better diagnostic capabilities, most patients are still identified at a terminal stage, underscoring the urgent need for prevention and awareness campaigns across the continent.</p>

The extension provides more time for negotiations but also continues the climate of unpredictability for businesses affected by the fluctuating U.S. trade policy.</p>

          <p>Despite being approved by 58% of voters in a ballot initiative, a paid sick leave mandate in Missouri has been repealed by the state's Republican-led legislature and signed into law by the governor.

          <p>This article provides an overview of the planned meeting between the U.S. and Russian presidents in Alaska, addressing key questions about the event's purpose and context. The summit aims to find a path to end the war in Ukraine, though Ukrainian President Zelenskyy is not expected to attend, raising concerns about a deal being made without his country's input. The discussion outlines the motivations for both leaders, the historical significance of the Alaskan location, and the potential for controversial land-swapping proposals.</p>

          <h2>Imminent Glacial Outburst Flood Threat Prompts Disaster Declaration in Juneau, Alaska</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The governor of Alaska has issued a disaster declaration for the Juneau area due to the imminent threat of a catastrophic "glacial lake outburst flood." Monitoring has confirmed that Suicide Basin, a part of the Mendenhall Glacier, has filled with water to levels that have previously caused record flooding, and a release is expected at any time. This would be the third consecutive year of serious glacier-related flooding for the state capital, which has already seen homes and infrastructure destroyed in past events.</p>

          <p>Police in Spain have dismantled an organization that was running so-called "spiritual retreats," charging clients over $1,160 to consume dangerous substances like ayahuasca, San Pedro cactus, and Kambo frog venom. The investigation began after a complaint from a victim, leading to the arrest of the group's leaders on charges including drug trafficking and money laundering. Authorities warned that the substances offered can have unpredictable and dangerous effects, and the retreats were held without proper means to respond to medical emergencies.</p>

          <p>This article details the plight of families of soldiers killed in action in the Sahel region, who are often left without official information or support from the ruling military juntas in countries like Niger and Mali. Many families learn of their loved one's death through social media and struggle to receive even basic information or financial aid. Analysts suggest the regimes avoid communicating losses to maintain a facade of security and control, leaving bereaved families to cope with their grief and financial hardship alone.</p>

          <p>The China National Intellectual Property Administration has denied a trademark application from U.S. firm OpenAI for the term "GPT-5." This decision represents a setback for the artificial intelligence leader's efforts to protect its branding in the competitive Chinese market and is currently pending appeal. The rejection follows a similar denial in the U.S., where the patent office ruled that marks like "ChatGPT" and "GPT" were merely descriptive of the technology's function.</p>

          <p>Advocates report that federal cuts and staffing shortages at the Veterans Administration are causing severe delays and errors in the processing of GI Bill education benefits. These disruptions are creating significant financial hardship for student veterans, with some waiting months for tuition and housing checks, forcing them to drop out of college. College officials describe spending hours on the phone with the VA to resolve paperwork issues for students who are growing increasingly anxious and frustrated with the system.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department is experiencing a severe shortage of Black recruits, with the last two academy classes graduating without a single Black officer. This long-standing diversity challenge is being exacerbated by a national political movement against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, which some fear will further hinder hiring efforts. Internally, some Black officers point to a lack of support and the quiet closure of the department's DEI office as significant problems contributing to the recruitment and retention crisis.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques the Health and Human Services Secretary's decision to cancel $500 million in federal grants for mRNA vaccine research, arguing it is a dangerous move based on flawed data and anti-vaccine ideology. The author asserts that the decision ignores extensive evidence of the vaccines' safety and effectiveness in saving millions of lives and will ultimately hamstring American science. The cancellation is framed as a devastating blow to public health that cedes leadership in a vital medical technology to other nations.</p>

          <p>After being denied entry for two months, a group of Democratic Congress members finally gained access to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing center in Los Angeles. However, they found the facility, which has been the subject of complaints about overcrowding and poor conditions, to be almost empty, with only two detainees present. The representatives accused the government of deliberately sanitizing the center to obstruct congressional oversight and were left with more questions than answers about its operation.</p>

          <p>A summer leadership program in Southern California is teaching children from immigrant families about civic engagement by having them participate in mock city council meetings. The initiative has taken on a new urgency this year as recent immigration enforcement raids have directly impacted their communities, with friends and family members being detained or self-deporting out of fear. The program aims to empower these children, some as young as four, to understand how to advocate for solutions to the problems they see around them.</p>
