          <p>During a tense meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, Donald Trump claimed a "genocide" against white farmers was occurring in South Africa, a claim that Ramaphosa and South African courts have refuted. Trump's advisor Elon Musk has supported these allegations, while South African officials deny them, citing the high crime rate affects all races. The White House released a statement supporting Trump's claims, referencing articles from right-leaning media outlets. Trump has been criticized for prioritizing Afrikaners while restricting immigration from other nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston criticized the Trump administration for violating an order by deporting eight migrants with insufficient notice, potentially leading to criminal contempt penalties. The migrants, from various countries, were reportedly told they were being sent to South Sudan, but the flight landed in Djibouti. The Department of Homeland Security stated the men had committed violent crimes, but the judge is considering ordering interviews to assess their fear of being sent to a dangerous country. The private jet used for the deportation flight was previously used to transport Brittney Griner in a prisoner swap with Russia.</p>

The limited selection of Nike products previously available on Amazon was sold by third-party sellers, but Nike was a "gated" brand on Amazon, meaning it was highly restricted to prevent counterfeit and low-quality items.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump met with House Republican hard-liners to negotiate a budget bill, facing opposition from the House Freedom Caucus and moderate Republicans. The bill aims to extend tax cuts, increase defense spending, and cut healthcare programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would add $2.3 trillion to the national debt. Democrats uniformly oppose the legislation, making it challenging for Trump to pass it with a narrow Republican majority.</p>

          <p>The NFL has decided not to ban the "tush push" play, despite a proposal from the Green Bay Packers. The play, known as "The Brotherly Shove," is successfully executed by the Philadelphia Eagles. The vote was 22-10, failing to reach the required 75% majority. The Eagles celebrated the decision on social media. The Packers cited player safety as a reason for the ban, but the NFL has previously stated that no injuries have been reported on the play.</p>

The policy requires new clinical trial data for approval of new formulations for healthy individuals under 65. This shift has raised concerns among experts about the potential impact on pediatric vaccination. Prioritizing vaccination for those at highest risk of a particular disease, as the FDAâ€™s new policy would, is sensible.</p>
