            <p>US air strikes on a Houthi-controlled oil terminal in Yemen resulted in the deaths of at least 74 people and injuries to 171 others, according to the Houthi-run health ministry. The US military stated the strikes aimed to degrade the Houthis' economic power and restrict their access to fuel and revenue. The Houthi-led government condemned the strikes as a war crime, asserting the terminal was a civilian facility. Thousands of Houthi supporters rallied in Sanaa to protest the US actions, while Iran's foreign ministry also condemned the strikes. Relevant context: This action is part of an ongoing conflict related to Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping.</p>

            <p>A Somali film warning against clan revenge killings, 'Aano Qabiil,' has gained attention after one of its actors was killed in a clan-related feud. Guudey Mohamed Geedi, who played a character trying to prevent a clan killing, was shot dead in a similar real-life incident. The film highlights the futility of vendettas between rival clans and their devastating consequences. The director hopes the film will raise awareness about the humanitarian cost of clan violence in Somalia.</p>

            <p>Governor Gavin Newsom granted clemency to 25 felons, including Sithy Bin, a Cambodian immigrant facing deportation, before the Easter holiday. Bin, a former gang member, was sentenced in 2008 for shooting at a rival's home, injuring a bystander. He became a minister in prison and had his sentence reduced. Newsom's pardon follows efforts to assist immigrants targeted for deportation, restoring some rights to former felons.</p>

            <p>A divided panel of judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily paused an effort by District Court Judge James Boasberg to further investigate whether the Trump administration engaged in criminal contempt by refusing to turn around two flights of alleged Venezuelan gang members who were sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador last month. The order does not rule in either way on the merits of Boasberg’s inquiry, however, and merely gives the petitioners in the case a deadline of April 23 by 5 p.m. to file their reply to the government. The government is then required to file their own reply by noon on April 25.</p>

            <p>Investors are closely monitoring the US bond market after a rare rise in government bond rates, suggesting a loss of confidence in the US economy. Governments sell bonds to raise money, paying interest in return. Uncertainty over the impact of trade tariffs led investors to dump government bonds, increasing borrowing costs for the US government. This can affect public spending, household expenses (mortgages, credit cards, car loans), and business growth, potentially leading to job losses. (not investment advice)</p>
