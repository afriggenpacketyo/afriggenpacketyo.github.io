          <p>Mexico is considering an election to overhaul its courts, potentially leading to a justice system more controlled by the dominant Morena party. This news analysis suggests the proposed changes could undermine the independence of the judiciary, making it more susceptible to political influence. The overhaul aims to restructure the courts, but critics fear it may concentrate power within the ruling party, impacting the balance of power and democratic processes within the country. This move raises concerns about the future of judicial impartiality in Mexico and its implications for the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, commencing on Sunday, is expected to have a higher-than-usual number of storms, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Forecasters anticipate a 60% likelihood of 13 to 19 named storms, with six to ten developing into hurricanes, and three to five intensifying into major hurricanes. The article provides a list of the names designated for the 2025 hurricanes, which are rotated annually by the World Meteorological Organization, and explains the rationale behind naming storms to improve communication and preparedness. This year's list includes Andrea, Barry, Chantal, and other names, and the article also mentions the practice of retiring names of particularly devastating storms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Anti-poverty organizers Rev Dr Liz Theoharis and Noam Sandweiss-Back argue that amidst proposed legislative cuts targeting Medicaid and SNAP, a new social contract is needed to uplift those at the bottom of society. Drawing lessons from past poor people's movements, including the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), they emphasize the importance of grassroots organizing, solidarity, and addressing the root causes of poverty. The authors highlight the NWRO's innovative projects of survival and their demand for a guaranteed adequate income as a precursor to the expanded child tax credit. They advocate for the Johnnie Tillmon model, which recognizes the transformational power of the poor when united and supported, and suggest that this approach is crucial for preventing democratic decline and overcoming bigotry.</p>

          <p>Relations between the Czech Republic and Slovakia have significantly deteriorated since Robert Fico became Slovakia's prime minister in October 2023, due to differing views on Ukraine and other issues. The Czech government canceled joint meetings with Slovakia's government, citing considerable differences in foreign policy. Fico halted military aid to Ukraine and re-established relations with Moscow, leading to accusations of warmongering from the Czech side. This cooling of relations is impacting societal attitudes, with Slovakia dropping in popularity among Czech citizens, and highlighting the growing divide between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's policies are raising concerns about potential disruptions to the upcoming summer travel season, including visa denials, tariff policies, and cuts to essential services. Travel industry executives express worries that these issues could deter international tourists and negatively impact the U.S. tourism sector. Concerns extend to potential anemic attendance at future major events like the World Cup and Olympics, with officials and experts urging the administration to address these challenges to ensure a smooth and welcoming experience for visitors. The administration's focus on border enforcement and government efficiency may inadvertently undermine the tourism industry and related economic benefits.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) faces challenges due to its reliance on an aging fleet of fire engines, with well over half of the engines operating beyond their recommended lifespans. This issue has led to increased reliance on reserve engines and difficult repairs, exacerbated by long-term funding challenges and rising costs of new equipment. While the city has allocated funds to purchase new vehicles, the wait times are lengthy, potentially worsening the situation. The condition of the fleet has come under scrutiny following a destructive fire, highlighting the need for sustained investment in modernizing the LAFD's equipment.</p>

          <p>Many top U.S. universities have been torn with strife for the last decade, but the Trump administrationâ€™s campaign to defund research, hike endowment taxes, and dictate admissions and faculty appointments has united fractious faculties, student bodies, donor populations and alumni groups. This unlikely alliance is driven by a shared concern over federal overreach and the potential damage to higher education.

          <p>The Trump administration is facing legal challenges over its practice of deporting individuals to countries other than their home countries, arguing that their home countries won't accept them. Immigration lawyers are suing to stop these deportations, particularly to politically unstable countries like South Sudan and Libya, asserting that deportees are not given adequate time to contest their removal. The administration defends its actions by stating that these individuals have criminal records and pose a threat to public safety. A federal judge has ruled that migrants need more time to contest their deportation to third countries, raising questions about due process and the rights of deportees.</p>

          <p>An established axiom of American elections, "The Republicans should pray for rain", is being challenged as stricter voting laws no longer provide an advantage to the Republican party. While historically lower voter turnout has benefited Republicans, recent trends indicate that stricter voting laws are not as effective in suppressing turnout among Democratic-leaning voters. The changing demographics and increased mobilization efforts by Democrats have altered the electoral landscape, and the article suggests that Republicans may need to reconsider their strategies for voter engagement.</p>
