The court clarified that those subject to removal are entitled to judicial review. This decision follows rising tensions between the president and the judiciary. Justice Sotomayor issued a scathing dissent, accusing the Trump administration of ignoring its obligations to the rule of law. </p>

            <p>President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants has sparked a legal battle. The Supreme Court cleared the way for the administration to resume deportations using the law, but said that individuals subject to removal are entitled to judicial review. The law has been invoked three other times in U.S. history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II. The Neighbors Not Enemies Act is a proposed law that would repeal the Alien Enemies Act.</p>

Musk refuted this, stating that Tesla has the most American-made cars.

Musk's opposition to tariffs stems from self-interest, Tesla is better positioned than most automakers to withstand potential disruptions.</p>
