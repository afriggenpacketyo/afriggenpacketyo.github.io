          <p>Australian stocks experienced a downturn after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a second consecutive term, signaling Australians' preference for stable policies amidst global macroeconomic uncertainties.

          <p>President Trump has directed the Bureau of Prisons to reopen and significantly expand Alcatraz prison, citing a need to house America's most violent offenders and to serve as a "symbol of law, order, and justice." The prison, closed in 1963 due to high operating costs, would be rebuilt to accommodate more inmates. This decision follows Trump's previous controversial policies of sending alleged gang members to prisons in El Salvador and discussions about sending domestic criminals to foreign prisons. Alcatraz, originally a naval defense fort, housed notorious gangsters like Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly.</p>

          <p>George Simion, a right-wing nationalist who has promised to “Make Romania Great Again,” won the first round of Romania’s presidential election, contrasting the trend of voters rejecting candidates aligned with President Trump. Simion garnered over 40 percent of the vote, securing a spot in a runoff against centrist Nicusor Dan. This election is a rerun after the previous results were annulled due to concerns over Russian interference. Simion's platform includes hostility to the European Union and opposition to military aid for Ukraine.</p>
