          <p>Google's Chrome browser chief, Parisa Tabriz, testified that only Google can effectively run Chrome due to its deep integration with other Google services. Tabriz argued that Chrome's features rely on shared Google infrastructure, making it difficult for another company to replicate its functionality. The Justice Department is seeking to force Google to sell Chrome as part of an antitrust case, but Google contends that such a divestiture would be technically unfeasible. The hearing explores potential remedies to Google's alleged illegal monopolization of the search market.</p>
