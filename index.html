          <h2>Chinese Experts Doubt US Strikes Eliminated Iran's Nuclear Capabilities</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese defense experts are skeptical of claims that US strikes completely destroyed Iran's nuclear facilities, citing discrepancies between Trump's statements and intelligence assessments. The experts point to the depth of Iran's underground facilities and potential removal of enriched uranium before the attacks as reasons for the limited effectiveness of the strikes. One expert noted the Fordow facility's depth exceeds the penetration capabilities of the bombs used, suggesting the US may not have achieved its intended operational goal. The article highlights the ongoing uncertainty surrounding the extent of damage to Iran's nuclear program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's car sales in Europe have declined for the fifth consecutive month, with a nearly 28% drop in May, as European consumers increasingly opt for cheaper Chinese electric vehicles. This decrease has resulted in a reduction of Tesla's European market share, falling from 1.8% to 1.2%. Factors contributing to Tesla's struggles include rising competition from both traditional automakers and Chinese EV companies like BYD, coupled with brand damage linked to CEO Elon Musk's controversial rhetoric and political activities. Despite the introduction of the revamped Model Y SUV, Tesla continues to face significant challenges in the European market.</p>

          <p>After decades of wanting to strike Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is claiming a "historic victory" after 12 days of strikes on Iran and a subsequent ceasefire. The shift in strategy involved recruiting the U.S. to join in the attacks, a move made possible by changing geopolitical dynamics and a perceived weakening of threats from groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. Netanyahu's focus on Iran has also served to distract from domestic political issues and the unresolved conflict with the Palestinians. However, a spat with President Trump over the timing of attacks and the subsequent ceasefire underscores the complexities of the situation.</p>

          <p>Thomas Robinson, a fraudster known as Tam O' Braan, has been sentenced to three-and-a-half years in jail for selling foreign tea falsely marketed as "Scottish-grown."

He also deceived aspiring tea growers by selling them ordinary plants misrepresented as specially engineered for Scotland's climate. The scam, which spanned five years, involved Robinson creating an elaborate backstory and falsely claiming expertise in various fields to gain credibility with his customers.</p>

          <p>A preliminary intelligence assessment indicates that recent US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have set back Tehran's nuclear program by only a few months. The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, found that entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities were sealed off, but the enrichment infrastructure remained largely intact. The report suggests some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes. Differing opinions exist, with the White House dismissing the assessment as inaccurate and Israeli officials claiming a more significant setback.</p>

          <p>Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU) in China has announced the successful test flight of its Feitian 2 hypersonic vehicle, marking the first successful acquisition of real-flight data for a rocket-based combined cycle (RBCC) engine using kerosene-hydrogen peroxide propellant. The test demonstrated key capabilities such as variable-geometry intake operation, thrust-varying acceleration, and autonomous flight with variable angle of attack. This project, led by NPU, follows a previous flight test of the Feitian 1 prototype, showcasing the engine's ability to achieve stable transitions at different speeds. NPU is subject to US sanctions, requiring specific approval to purchase sensitive US-made equipment.</p>
