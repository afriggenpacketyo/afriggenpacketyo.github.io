        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones. The diagnosis, characterized by a Gleason score of 9, came after Biden experienced urinary symptoms, leading doctors to discover a prostate nodule. While the cancer is aggressive, it appears to be hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management, and Biden is reviewing treatment options with his physicians. The news has prompted messages of support from across the political spectrum, including from former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris.</p>

          <p>Israel has announced it will permit a "basic amount of food" into Gaza after a 10-week blockade, citing the need to prevent a starvation crisis. This decision follows increasing international pressure and warnings from aid agencies about famine among Gaza's population. The move coincides with Israel's launch of "extensive ground operations" against Hamas, named Operation Gideon's Chariot, and an evacuation order for several areas. Meanwhile, negotiations for a ceasefire continue in Qatar, with Hamas proposing a full Israeli withdrawal and prisoner exchange, while Israel seeks a temporary truce for hostage release.</p>

Dan campaigned as a moderate conservative committed to the European Union and NATO, appealing to voters seeking a middle path between polarized political camps.</p>

The department met with families of crash victims to discuss a potential pretrial resolution involving dismissing the fraud charge. Boeing avoided prosecution in 2021 with a $2.5 billion settlement but was later accused of violating the agreement. A judge rejected a plea deal in December, citing concerns about DEI policies.

The two will compete in a runoff, where Trzaskowski faces an uphill battle given the combined vote share of right-wing candidates. The election is crucial as the president has veto powers that can hinder Prime Minister Donald Tusk's agenda.</p>
