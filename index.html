          <p>Joseph Kling, 19, faces arson charges related to the wildfire in Ocean County, N.J. Authorities say the wildfire was caused by a bonfire that wasn't properly extinguished. The wildfire is about 50% contained after spreading across roughly 15,250 acres. The fire forced thousands in the Forked River community to flee their homes. The volume of smoke from the large wildfire has prompted an air quality alert in New York City.</p>
