        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the state of Colorado and the city of Denver, challenging their "sanctuary" policies. The suit claims that these policies interfere with federal immigration enforcement efforts and violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, particularly regarding the deportation of individuals residing in the country without legal authorization. The lawsuit specifically references an apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado, that President Trump previously asserted was under the control of a Venezuelan gang due to the state's sanctuary policies. Local officials have acknowledged the complex faced issues but dispute the extent of the gang's control. The lawsuit seeks to invalidate state and local laws that hinder cooperation with federal immigration authorities.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan reveals that approximately 60% of Japanese citizens believe that the spread of unverified information on social media platforms during elections should be regulated by law. This sentiment arises amidst growing concerns about partisan online posts influencing election outcomes, such as the Hyogo gubernatorial election. The survey also highlights divided opinions on revising Article 9 of the Constitution, which renounces war, with equal proportions supporting and opposing the change. Additionally, the survey indicates significant support for allowing married couples to keep separate surnames and recognizing same-sex marriage.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to reduce staffing at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) by 1,200 positions, with additional cuts expected at other intelligence agencies like the National Security Agency (NSA). The CIA stated that these changes are intended to align the agency with President Trump's national security priorities. The cuts will be implemented over several years, partly through reduced hiring. The administration has also eliminated diversity, equity, and inclusion programs at intelligence agencies, though some terminations related to these programs have been temporarily blocked by a judge.</p>

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of the Labor Party and opposition leader Peter Dutton are vying for leadership. Recent polls suggest Albanese's party is headed for a second term. Voters' top concerns are economic issues, but both parties have offered only small-scale solutions. The election is also marked by a shift away from major parties toward independent candidates.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled against President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie, deeming it unconstitutional and an attack on the legal system. Judge Beryl Howell stated that the order imposed punitive measures on the firm for representing clients that Trump dislikes. The ruling permanently blocks the executive order, which had suspended security clearances and barred attorneys from accessing government buildings. Perkins Coie welcomed the ruling, affirming core constitutional freedoms.</p>

Factors contributing to the increase include changes in diagnostic criteria, greater awareness, and better identification of autism in women and adults. The definition of autism has broadened over time, encompassing a wider range of individuals, including those with higher functioning and those who were previously misdiagnosed with other conditions. This has led to a greater diversity of autistic people being recognized and supported.</p>
