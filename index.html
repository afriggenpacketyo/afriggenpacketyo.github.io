        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the first quarter of 2025, a larger drop than economists had anticipated, marking the first quarterly contraction in a year. This contraction, equivalent to an annualized decrease of 0.7%, arrives during ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S., with the Bank of Japan having cautioned about the potential impact of trade policies on the country's economic outlook. Despite these concerns, the central bank is considering further policy rate increases, buoyed by inflation rates that have exceeded their 2% target for three consecutive years. While some board members advocate for continued rate hikes if economic and price targets are met, others caution about uncertainties and the need for flexible monetary policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A committee of MPs is advocating for a year-long postponement of the government's proposed changes to farm inheritance tax, citing inadequate consultation and potential harm to small family businesses. The planned reforms, which would tax inherited agricultural assets worth over Â£1 million at a 20% rate, have sparked protests across the UK. The committee argues that the delay would allow farmers more time to seek professional advice and for alternative schemes to be considered. The report also criticized the government's abrupt closure of the Sustainable Farming Incentive, leading to distrust and financial uncertainty for many farmers.</p>

          <p>In Georgia, a brain-dead pregnant woman is being kept on life support to allow her fetus to develop, a decision her family claims was mandated by the state's strict abortion laws. The family is upset that they have no say in whether she remains on life support, as the state's law restricts abortion once cardiac activity is detected. The article highlights the ethical and legal complexities arising from abortion bans, especially in cases involving medically compromised pregnant individuals. The situation raises questions about fetal rights versus the autonomy and wishes of the patient and their family.</p>

          <p>For the second time, a federal judge has dismissed former Sheriff Alex Villanueva's $25 million lawsuit against Los Angeles County, which alleged defamation and violation of rights after his personnel file was flagged as "do not rehire."

The judge ruled that Villanueva did not provide sufficient evidence to prove he had been harmed by the county's actions.

          <p>In the Sean 'Diddy' Combs sexual assault trial, Cassie Ventura faced a rigorous six-hour cross-examination, with defense attorneys challenging her credibility and suggesting she willingly participated in sexual activities with Combs. Defense lawyers presented text messages to argue that Ventura was eager to engage in Combs' lifestyle of drug-fueled orgies, countering her claims of sexual trafficking and coercion. The messages also revealed mutual affection and jealousy within their relationship, with both parties expressing anger about each other's infidelity. Ventura acknowledged loving Combs for over a decade and hoping for a future together, but testified that his behavior later turned violent and controlling.</p>

          <p>The California Assembly unanimously passed legislation aimed at strengthening criminal penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds for sex, following a period of political turbulence. The bill, initially intended to target perpetrators, faced controversy when Democrats removed a felony provision for offenders soliciting older teens. Amid public pressure, the penalties were adjusted to apply only to offenders more than three years older than the victim. The legislation, now heading to the State Senate, seeks to increase protections for victims while also addressing concerns about potential disproportionate enforcement against minorities and the poor.</p>

          <p>A 9Â½-month-old boy, KJ, has become the first patient to receive a custom gene-editing treatment for a rare genetic disorder, CPS1 deficiency. Doctors at Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Philadelphia used CRISPR technology to fix the mutation. The treatment, designed to correct a single incorrect DNA letter, has shown promising initial results. This approach offers a new path for developing personalized treatments for rare genetic diseases, potentially transforming healthcare and making such treatments more affordable.</p>
