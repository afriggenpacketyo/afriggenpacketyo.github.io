        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has rejected Donald Trump's attempt to challenge a $5 million judgment awarded to writer E. Jean Carroll. The jury initially found Trump liable for battery and defamation in 2023, stemming from an incident in the 1990s. Trump sought a rehearing before the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit after a three-judge panel declined to overturn the initial judgment. Carroll's attorney expressed satisfaction with the court's decision, emphasizing that Trump remains liable for sexual assault and defamation, while Trump's team indicated they would appeal to the Supreme Court. Optimism surrounding the case is muted given the legal back-and-forth and the seriousness of the charges.</p>

          <p>Archer Aviation's stock experienced a decline after the company announced the sale of $850 million worth of shares. The electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle (eVTOL) company intends to use the funds to support new infrastructure, an AI-based aviation software platform, and its Launch Edition program, including a partnership for air taxi services during the 2028 Olympics. This funding round provides Archer with a pro forma liquidity position of approximately $2 billion. The stock offering follows President Trump's executive order creating a pilot program to support eVTOL vehicle development and deployment, but the market's reaction was ultimately negative.

The proposal also allows for claims related to increased atmospheric testing and adds uranium mine workers from 1971-1990 to the list of those eligible for benefits.

          <p>Fifteen individuals, including former Tory MP Craig Williams, appeared in court to face charges related to betting offenses linked to the timing of last year's general election. The charges stem from an investigation by the Gambling Commission into alleged betting on the election date. Williams and two other defendants did not indicate a plea, while twelve others, including Russell George, indicated they would deny the charges. The defendants are scheduled to appear again at Southwark Crown Court in July.</p>

          <p>Scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have released a public declaration, known as the “Bethesda Declaration,” condemning the Trump administration’s cuts to biomedical research. The declaration, signed by current and former NIH staff, alleges political interference, abrupt grant terminations, and undermining of the agency’s mission. It accuses leadership of prioritizing political pressure over scientific integrity, citing the termination of over 2,100 research grants and suspension of contracts worth $2.6 billion. The letter comes amid broader tensions within federal science agencies and proposed budget cuts for fiscal year 2026.</p>

While a deal is not yet signed, an agreement is expected to be reached between Saracens and Racing to facilitate Farrell's move this summer. Farrell spent 16 seasons with Saracens, winning multiple Premiership titles and European Cups, and took a break from international rugby after the 2023 Rugby World Cup.

          <p>A federal judge has halted additional provisions of President Trump's executive order related to voting. The ruling paused a requirement for people to provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote using the national form. The judge also blocked a provision aimed at barring states from counting mail ballots postmarked by Election Day but received after, citing the Constitution. The decision follows a previous ruling that paused another part of the order, and numerous voting officials have expressed alarm at what they see as federal overreach.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals how young women, mainly from Africa, are being exploited in Russia's war factories. Recruited with promises of well-paid careers, many end up assembling cheap drones under poor conditions in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone. The women report being exposed to dangerous chemicals and working long hours, with limited ability to leave the country. Interpol is investigating the program in Botswana, while some countries have become more aware of the risks and have launched investigations.</p>
