          <p>A CBS News investigation reveals that a new high-security immigration detention center in Florida, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," is holding individuals without criminal records, including DACA recipients. This contradicts the Trump administration's claims that the facility is for "the worst of the worst" criminals. One DACA recipient, detained after a traffic stop, alleges that ICE officials told him the program was canceled, despite his active status. The report highlights a discrepancy between official rhetoric and the reality of immigration enforcement, as nearly half of all ICE detainees nationwide lack a criminal record.</p>

          <p>AI startup Perplexity has submitted a surprise $34.5 billion bid to purchase the Google Chrome web browser from its parent company, Alphabet. The offer comes as Google faces a significant antitrust ruling that could potentially force the divestiture of its dominant browser. Perplexity stated its intention to maintain Google as the default search engine while committing to user safety and the open web. However, analysts express skepticism about the bid's success, noting the offer is likely far below Chrome's actual market value and contingent on an uncertain legal outcome.</p>

          <p>An annual global human rights report from the U.S. State Department has asserted that the human rights situation in the United Kingdom has "worsened" over the last year. The report specifically criticizes the UK for what it describes as restrictions on freedom of expression and threats of violence motivated by antisemitism. It cites the government's response to the 2024 Southport riots and the implementation of "buffer zones" around abortion clinics as examples of chilling free speech. A UK government spokesperson defended its record, stating it upholds freedoms while ensuring citizen safety.</p>

          <p>Rapper and popular streamer DDG was briefly detained by Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies in what appears to have been a "swatting" incident. The artist described being surrounded by multiple police cars and having weapons drawn on him at a paintball tournament without explanation. "Swatting" involves making a false emergency report to provoke a large, armed law enforcement response to a victim's location. DDG stated he was held for about 20 minutes before being released, after explaining to deputies that he believed he was a target of this dangerous prank.</p>

          <p>Kim Keon Hee, the wife of South Korea's impeached former president Yoon Suk Yeol, has been arrested, a first for a former first lady in the country's history. She faces serious allegations including stock fraud, bribery, and influence peddling, which she has denied. Prosecutors sought her arrest over concerns she might destroy evidence related to the investigation. The charges stem from multiple incidents, including accepting luxury items as bribes and failing to disclose a valuable pendant. Her husband, former President Yoon, also faces a trial for insurrection after an alleged attempt to impose martial law.</p>

A coastguard spokesperson described their actions as professional and legal, vowing to continue law enforcement activities to protect national sovereignty. Experts suggest the incident will likely prompt China to increase its maritime presence and enhance coordination between its navy and coastguard to project power in the region.</p>

          <p>United Launch Alliance has successfully launched its first operational Vulcan rocket, marking a significant milestone for the company and the U.S. Space Force. The powerful new launcher, which lifted off from Cape Canaveral, carried two military satellites into a high geosynchronous orbit. This flight was the first to be certified by the Space Force for carrying critical national security payloads. The Vulcan rocket is designed to replace ULA's legacy Atlas V and Delta rockets, ending the reliance on Russian-made engines for U.S. military and NASA launches.</p>

The President can control the D.C. police for up to 30 days in an emergency under the Home Rule Act, with the DEA Administrator overseeing daily operations. While D.C.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine. The location is historically significant as the U.S. purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867. The summit follows Trump's efforts to broker a peace deal, including setting a deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire, which passed without an agreement. The White House has framed the meeting as a "listening exercise" and a "feel-out meeting," downplaying expectations for an immediate breakthrough, while Ukraine is not expected to attend in person.</p>

The governor plans to ask voters to approve a new map designed to create five more Democratic-leaning seats in California.

Researchers found that while 10-year survival for cancers like melanoma and breast cancer has risen dramatically, rates for pancreatic, esophageal, stomach, and lung cancer remain below 20%. Experts attribute the overall progress to advances in treatment and earlier detection. However, they warn that the rate of improvement has slowed and are calling for a renewed focus on research for the most lethal forms of the disease.</p>

          <p>European Union leaders have publicly appealed to President Trump to defend Europe's security interests during his upcoming meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding the war in Ukraine. Expressing concern about being sidelined, the leaders emphasized that a just peace cannot be decided without Ukraine's involvement and must respect its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Their plea comes amid fears that Trump might agree to a deal that includes territorial concessions from Ukraine, a move that could embolden Russia and undermine regional stability. The joint statement was endorsed by all EU leaders except Hungary's Viktor Orbán.</p>

          <p>The risk of infection from Vibrio vulnificus, a "flesh-eating" bacteria, is growing as rising ocean temperatures allow it to thrive in new regions. The bacteria, which enters the body through open wounds or consumption of raw seafood, can be deadly, killing one in five infected individuals. While common in warm waters like the Gulf of Mexico, cases are now being reported further north in the Carolinas, Connecticut, and New York. A microbiologist from the University of South Florida confirmed that warming waters are expanding the bacteria's habitat, heightening the danger, especially during hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines' stock price plunged nearly 40% after the company issued a warning about its ability to continue as a "going concern" over the next year. The budget carrier, which recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy, cited persistent "adverse market conditions," including weak demand for domestic leisure travel. Despite cost-cutting measures like pilot furloughs, the airline stated it faces significant uncertainties and needs to secure more liquidity to sustain operations. The company is now considering selling aircraft and real estate to raise necessary funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California's peach harvest is down by as much as 30% this year, a problem farmers attribute to warmer winter temperatures caused by climate change. Stone fruit trees require a specific number of "chill hours" below 45 degrees to regulate their growth and nutrient cycles, but inconsistent cold has disrupted this process. The reduced crop is already affecting consumers, with prices for peaches rising. The article highlights the Masumoto Family Farm, where older groves and traditional irrigation methods have helped mitigate some of the damage, but the broader trend poses a significant threat to the state's fruit growers.</p>

          <p>Police have arrested a suspect in the violent assault of a 70-year-old Sikh man who was beaten with a golf club in North Hollywood and remains in critical condition. While authorities have arrested a 44-year-old unhoused man for the attack, they are not currently investigating it as a hate crime, believing it was motivated by a property dispute. The victim's family and organizations like the Sikh Coalition are questioning this conclusion, urging a more thorough investigation into bias as a potential motive. They note that elderly Sikh men are frequent targets of violence due to their articles of faith.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order demanding that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) immediately fix "horrifying" conditions at a holding facility in Manhattan. The order responds to a lawsuit from migrants who described filthy, severely overcrowded rooms, a lack of basic hygiene products, and inedible food. The judge mandated that ICE reduce capacity to provide more space per person, clean the cells three times daily, and provide sleeping mats and hygiene supplies. The ruling was hailed as a rebuke of the administration's immigration policies by rights groups and local officials.</p>

          <p>Residents in parts of Juneau, Alaska, are being urged to evacuate as a "glacial outburst" flood from the Mendenhall River threatens the area. The flooding occurs when an ice dam on the Mendenhall Glacier collapses, releasing massive amounts of water from the Suicide Basin lake behind it. This phenomenon, which has caused significant damage in recent years, is being exacerbated by climate change, which is causing the glacier to melt faster. Authorities have issued a preemptive disaster declaration and hope that recently installed emergency barriers will hold back the waters from the densely populated Mendenhall Valley.</p>

While the final decision remains with individual forces, the move is intended to create more consistency.

          <p>The United Kingdom's car industry is at a critical juncture, with vehicle production in the first half of 2025 falling to its lowest point since 1953. The decline is attributed to a combination of factors, including factory closures, the long-term impacts of Brexit, supply chain disruptions, and high energy and labor costs. Experts warn that the industry is approaching a point where it may lose the "critical mass" needed to sustain its entire ecosystem of suppliers and skilled labor. While some new investments in electric vehicle production offer a glimmer of hope, many are concerned it may be too late to reverse the decline. (not investment advice)</p>
