          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass announced a curfew for downtown Los Angeles effective Tuesday night, lasting until Wednesday morning, due to ongoing anti-ICE protests. The curfew, encompassing a one-square-mile area, aims to prevent vandalism and looting, with exemptions for residents, workers, credentialed media, and the homeless. The protests, triggered by recent immigration raids, have led to numerous arrests and reports of looting, prompting the deployment of National Guard troops and U.S. Marines. California Governor Gavin Newsom has criticized President Trump's handling of the situation, accusing him of escalating tensions and deploying troops without consultation. Optimism is tempered by the ongoing unrest and political clashes.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read trial, the defense presented its final witness, Dr. Andrew Rentschler, a biomechanist, who cast doubt on the prosecution's theory that Read's SUV fatally struck John O'Keefe. Rentschler's testimony aligns with previous defense arguments suggesting O'Keefe's injuries were inconsistent with a vehicle collision. The defense posits that O'Keefe's injuries were instead caused by a fall and a possible dog bite. Karen Read has stated she will not testify in her own defense, concluding the defense's case.</p>

          <p>US representative Mikie Sherrill won the Democratic primary in New Jersey’s race for governor, emerging from a crowded field of experienced rivals on the strength of her biography as a navy pilot and former prosecutor who has been a vocal critic of Donald Trump. She will face the Republican nominee, Jack Ciattarelli, in the November general election. A win in November would give New Jersey its second female governor after Christine Todd Whitman held the office for two terms as a Republican.</p>

          <p>China's J-20 stealth fighter has reportedly tripled its radar detection range, thanks to advancements in semiconductor technology led by scientist Xu Xiangang. The silicon-carbide semiconductor material developed by Xu's team has powered a threefold increase in the detection range of phased array radar systems, allowing Chinese radars to swiftly detect enemies and gain the first-mover advantage, the university said on its social media page. The J-20, also known as the Mighty Dragon, is a twin-engine stealth fighter viewed as China’s answer to America’s F-22 “Raptor”.</p>
