          <p>Emma Raducanu advanced to the quarter-finals at Queen's Club, securing her return to the British number one ranking for the first time in two years after a decisive victory against Rebecca Sramkova. Raducanu's performance marked a significant comeback after a period of inconsistent form and injuries, surpassing Katie Boulter in the rankings. Other British players, Katie Boulter and Heather Watson, were eliminated in the last 16, leaving Raducanu as the sole Briton remaining in the tournament. Raducanu will face either Zheng Qinwen or McCartney Kessler in the next round, and displayed good sportsmanship by writing a supportive message to Boulter on the camera lens after her victory.</p>

          <p>This article examines the growing influence of far-right political parties in various European countries, highlighting their varying degrees of success and policy platforms. In the Netherlands, the Party for Freedom (PVV) led to a coalition collapse due to disagreements over migration policies. Poland's Law and Justice party (PiS) lost the parliamentary elections but still holds the presidency, enabling them to influence government policy. Hungary's Fidesz, led by Viktor Orban, is described as the most successful far-right party in Europe, while Slovakia's Smer party, led by Robert Fico, has taken a hardline stance against immigration and criticized the EU's sanctions against Russia. The article also touches on the presence and influence of Vox in Spain and the Danish People's Party in Denmark, illustrating the diverse landscape of far-right politics in Europe.</p>

          <p>Following three days of violent disorder in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, families hid in attics and wardrobes, according to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) Chief Constable. The violence, described as "racist thuggery," targeted ethnic minorities and law enforcement, resulting in injuries to 41 officers and 15 arrests. The unrest began after a peaceful protest regarding an alleged sexual assault, with police and fire services assisting families in need. The PSNI has requested additional support from Police Scotland and is working to identify and prosecute those responsible for the violence, with community leaders condemning the racism and calling for an end to the disorder.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced plans to weaken power plant pollution standards, claiming it will save the US around $1 billion annually, but experts argue the benefits will primarily go to power plant operators while harming public health. The EPA is proposing to remove restrictions on planet-heating emissions and weaken regulations on harmful toxins, such as mercury, from power plants. Critics argue this decision favors fossil fuel interests at the expense of American citizens, who will face dirtier air and increased health risks. The EPA contends that these rollbacks will bolster the economy and save money for households. </p>

          <p>Despite concerns, President Donald Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted inflation, with recent data on consumer and producer prices remaining stable. Several factors have contributed to this, including companies stockpiling imported goods before tariff announcements, the time lag for tariffs to affect the economy, and limited pricing power due to cautious consumer spending. Economists believe the impact of tariffs will likely materialize in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

Washington, D.C., residents spend the most on dining out, averaging $10,291 per year, while Illinois has seen the largest increase in dining expenditures since 2000.

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has formally declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years, citing Iran's failure to fully cooperate with the agency. The resolution, backed by the US, UK, France, and Germany, expresses concern about Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium. Iran condemned the resolution as "political" and announced plans to establish a new uranium enrichment facility and replace existing centrifuges with more advanced models. The issue could now be referred to the UN Security Council, potentially leading to the reinstatement of sanctions. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed a lawsuit against New York state, challenging policies that prevent immigration officials from arresting individuals at or near state courthouses. The lawsuit targets the Protect Our Courts Act, which the DOJ claims shields dangerous individuals from lawful detention. Attorney General Pam Bondi accused New York of employing similar policies to California in protecting undocumented immigrants. The lawsuit comes amid ongoing protests against the Trump administration's immigration policies and congressional hearings questioning Democratic governors about their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. </p>
