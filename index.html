          <p>Lowe's reported strong fiscal second-quarter results, exceeding Wall Street's expectations for both earnings and revenue, largely due to a resurgence in demand for home improvement projects. The company further announced a significant $8.8 billion deal to acquire Foundation Building Materials, a key distributor of building products for large residential and commercial professionals. This acquisition is part of Lowe's broader strategy to expand its business-to-business segment and has led to an upward revision of its full-year sales outlook. Despite a slight adjustment to earnings per share guidance, the core business performance remains robust, signaling confidence in future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Target has announced Michael Fiddelke, a long-serving insider and former CFO, as its new CEO, effective February 1, succeeding Brian Cornell. Fiddelke steps into the role during a critical period, as the retailer grapples with a prolonged sales slump and a significant stock decline, with annual sales remaining flat for the past four years. He outlined key priorities including re-establishing Target's brand for unique items, improving customer experience, and utilizing technology more effectively to drive profitable growth. Despite some investor preference for an external leader, the board selected Fiddelke for his deep company insight and "fresh eyes" approach to turnaround the business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Syria is grappling with escalating intercommunal violence, exemplified by the abduction of White Helmets aid worker Hamza al-Amareen and deadly clashes in Sweida, which resulted in nearly 1,700 fatalities. Investigations by Syria's interim government and the UN's Independent International Commission of Inquiry reveal widespread abuses and wrongdoing by various armed groups and even some civilians. Experts attribute the chaos to decades of deep-seated distrust, the proliferation of weapons post-Assad, and the interim government's struggle to establish a monopoly on violence. The situation is further complicated by rampant misinformation, making accountability and a path to peace increasingly challenging.</p>

          <p>Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, also known as Mo Chara from the Irish rap group Kneecap, has appeared in Westminster Magistrates' Court in London to face a terror charge. The charge stems from allegations that he displayed a flag supporting Hezbollah, a proscribed organization in the UK, at a London concert last year. Ó hAnnaidh denies the accusation, asserting the case is politically motivated and an attempt to silence his group. His court appearance was met by a large gathering of supporters, many waving Palestinian and Irish flags, highlighting the ongoing controversy surrounding the band's provocative activism and its recent legal battles.</p>

          <p>UK inflation, measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), unexpectedly rose to 3.8% in July, marking its highest point since January 2024 and remaining significantly above the Bank of England's 2% target. The surge was predominantly driven by a substantial 30.2% increase in air fares, likely influenced by the timing of school holidays, and a continued rise in food and non-alcoholic beverage prices, which hit 4.9%. This persistent inflationary pressure complicates the Bank of England's monetary policy decisions, especially after a recent interest rate cut, as it navigates between curbing inflation and stimulating a struggling economy.

          <p>Israel has granted final approval for a contentious plan to construct nearly 3,500 new homes in the E1 area of the occupied West Bank, aiming to expand the Maale Adumim settlement. This decision, announced by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, is widely condemned by international bodies like the UN for potentially fragmenting the West Bank and rendering a two-state solution unfeasible. Concurrently, Israel's Defense Ministry has approved a preliminary plan to take over Gaza City, mobilizing tens of thousands of reservists for an offensive targeting Hamas. This dual development signals heightened tensions and raises significant humanitarian concerns for the region.</p>

          <p>German football continues to grapple with incidents of racism, highlighted by a recent German Cup match where a Black player was racially abused, leading to a temporary halt in play. FIFA President Gianni Infantino and DFB President Bernd Neuendorf have strongly condemned these "unacceptable" events, emphasizing the sport's stance against discrimination. The DFB has launched investigations and employs a three-step procedure for in-match racist incidents, including potential match abandonment. Despite these measures and ongoing efforts by fan groups, accurately tracking and eliminating racism remains a challenge, as evidenced by reports of hundreds of incidents annually across various levels of German football.</p>

          <p>Six severed human heads were discovered along a road connecting the states of Puebla and Tlaxcala in central Mexico, a region where such extreme violence is typically rare. Prosecutors have launched an investigation into the crime, which local media suggest is linked to a brutal settling of scores between rival gangs involved in fuel theft. This horrifying discovery adds to a disturbing pattern of extreme violence, including decapitations and dismemberments, increasingly seen across Mexico as drug cartels escalate their territorial conflicts.

The Home Office expresses concern that this ruling could significantly impede its ability to accommodate the 32,000 asylum seekers currently in hotels and potentially incite further violent demonstrations.

          <p>A comprehensive new data analysis from the UCLA Williams Institute reveals that over 2.8 million people in the US, including an estimated 724,000 youth, identify as transgender. This study, the largest to date, utilizes federal surveys to map the trans population across all states, directly countering political efforts to deny the existence of trans minors. Researchers emphasize that younger generations are significantly more likely to identify as trans due to increasingly accepting social attitudes, not a "social contagion." However, the report warns that the current administration's removal of trans identity questions from vital federal surveys will create severe data gaps, hindering future understanding and policy.</p>

This approach addresses the high conversion costs of plumbing and floor plate depth in office buildings, offering a valuable stepping stone for various demographics and potentially mitigating homelessness.</p>

          <p>Southern California is bracing for a "trio of impactful hazards" this week, encompassing an extreme heat wave, elevated fire risk, and potential monsoonal thunderstorms. Forecasts predict near-record temperatures ranging from 95 to 110 degrees, posing serious health threats and creating conditions for rapid wildfire growth. The additional threat of thunderstorms could introduce lightning, sparking new fires, and localized flooding. Officials are issuing widespread warnings, urging residents to prepare by accessing cooling centers and rescheduling outdoor activities, as these combined conditions present significant dangers to public safety and infrastructure across the region.</p>

          <p>A study in the journal Cell reveals that brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) designed to help paralyzed individuals speak can also inadvertently decode their inner monologue. While this could enhance communication speed and ease for users, it raises significant ethical questions about mental privacy. Researchers found that imagined speech produces signals similar to, though fainter than, attempted speech, which AI can translate. Although safeguards like "wake phrases" were tested, experts warn that the boundary between public and private thought may become increasingly blurred with advancing BCI technology, especially for future consumer devices.</p>

The driver, 46-year-old Jason Lee Beach, was later located and arrested, facing multiple charges including felony DWI with serious injury. Fortunately, no civilians were present in the building during the explosion, and emergency services successfully contained the gas leak and fire.</p>

          <p>A peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels, recently brokered by Qatar, shows signs of faltering as M23 representatives failed to attend the latest round of talks. The M23 movement insists on the full implementation of the Doha Declaration, including the release of prisoners, before re-engaging. This diplomatic setback is compounded by new reports from Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, which allege that M23 rebels were responsible for the deaths of nearly 140 people and widespread sexual abuses in eastern Congo in July. The ongoing lack of trust and significant demands from both sides threaten to escalate the conflict further.</p>

The planned military operation aims to eliminate Hamas's presence and retrieve remaining hostages, but it has sparked profound concerns about exacerbating the already catastrophic humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

          <p>A large sinkhole that emerged six months ago on Godstone High Street in Surrey has been linked by engineers to an initial burst water main. The complexity of the repair work is significantly heightened by an extensive network of 19th-century sand mines underlying the village, which are difficult to map. The prolonged road closure has severely disrupted local businesses, with some experiencing substantial drops in trade. Despite the challenges posed by hidden caverns and existing underground utilities, authorities are committed to completing the repairs by December, highlighting the unique and intricate nature of this ongoing infrastructure problem.</p>

While Trump ruled out deploying US troops, he indicated potential US "air support" if European allies committed ground forces as part of a ceasefire or peace agreement.
