          <p>Liverpool has agreed to a deal with Crystal Palace to sign England defender Marc Guehi, pending final clearance. The 25-year-old is set to become Liverpool's second major deadline-day signing after the club also secured striker Alexander Isak in a separate deal. The transfer, part of a record-breaking summer spending spree for the club totaling over £450 million, aims to bolster a defense that has appeared vulnerable early in the season. However, Crystal Palace has not yet formally sanctioned the transfer as they struggle to find a replacement.</p>

          <p>Houthi rebels in Yemen have detained at least 11 United Nations personnel in raids on UN offices in Sanaa, escalating a crackdown on international organizations. This action follows a recent Israeli airstrike that killed several Houthi government officials, prompting vows of revenge and heightened security measures. Analysts suggest the detentions are a recurring tactic for the Houthis, who use aid workers as bargaining chips and accuse international groups of espionage. The UN and human rights organizations have condemned the abductions, highlighting a pattern of forced disappearances in Houthi-controlled areas.</p>

          <p>Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani was seriously injured in a car accident in New Hampshire after stopping to assist a domestic violence victim. A spokesman for the 81-year-old stated the crash was not a targeted attack, urging the public to respect his privacy and refrain from speculation. Giuliani was a passenger in a rental vehicle that was struck from behind at high speed, resulting in multiple injuries including a fractured thoracic vertebra. New Hampshire State Police are investigating the incident, and Giuliani is expected to be discharged from the hospital in a few days.</p>

In a New York Times op-ed, the bipartisan group criticized Kennedy's recent decisions, including the firing of the new CDC director, canceling mRNA vaccine research, and replacing a key vaccine advisory committee with his own appointees. The former directors warn that these moves dismantle the nation's public health infrastructure, leaving the U.S. vulnerable to future pandemics and health threats, and they are calling for congressional oversight.</p>

          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake in eastern Afghanistan has left a trail of devastation, with survivors describing entire villages being destroyed and families being lost. The quake struck a remote, mountainous region in Kunar province, making rescue efforts extremely difficult and reliant on helicopters. Eyewitnesses report scenes of shock and despair, with many people trapped under the rubble of their collapsed mud-brick homes while awaiting aid.

          <p>Following Congress's decision to eliminate $1.1 billion in federal funding, public radio and television stations across the U.S. are grappling with significant budget shortfalls. Stations like KSPS in Spokane and LPTV in Minnesota are facing job cuts and programming reductions, with many launching emergency fundraising drives to survive. While listener donations have been strong in some areas, many smaller, rural stations are at risk of closure. National networks like NPR and PBS are reducing dues for member stations, and philanthropic efforts are underway to support the hardest-hit outlets, but the long-term future for many remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>An American man has died following a collision between a vessel and a jet ski in the waters off Paradise Island in the Bahamas, prompting a police investigation. The incident highlights ongoing safety issues in the region, with police also investigating a recent sexual assault of a U.S. national at a resort and another non-fatal jet ski crash. In April, the U.S. Embassy in Nassau issued a security alert warning citizens about the risks of renting jet skis, citing previous reports of sexual assaults by operators. The alert specifically prohibits U.S. government employees from using jet skis in the area.</p>

          <p>Celebrated author Margaret Atwood has responded to an Alberta-wide school book ban, which affects her novel "The Handmaid's Tale," by releasing a satirical short story. The new rules, ordered by the province's education ministry, require the removal of materials with "explicit sexual content" from school libraries. In her story, Atwood criticizes the policy and Premier Danielle Smith by describing "very good children" who grow up without any knowledge of biology or sex. This is part of a broader trend of book challenges, originating in the U.S., that is now impacting Canadian schools and classic literature.</p>

          <p>A new study from the University of Montpellier reveals a significant divergence in the body size of wild and domestic animals starting in the Middle Ages, driven by human activity. Researchers analyzed over 225,000 animal bones from the past 8,000 years in southern France. They found that as human settlements expanded and hunting intensified, wild species like foxes and deer became smaller. In contrast, domesticated species such as sheep, cattle, and chickens grew larger due to increased human control and selective breeding, illustrating humanity's profound and lasting impact on the natural world.</p>

          <p>Rome Ramirez, who for 15 years served as the frontman for the band Sublime with Rome, is launching a solo career with a new EP titled "Gemini." After stepping into the role of the late Bradley Nowell in 2009, Ramirez toured globally but found the position eventually felt more like a job. The pandemic provided a break and an opportunity to write personal music, leading to his decision to leave the band and forge his own path. His new sound blends the West Coast reggae and hip-hop influences of his past with a new focus on soul music, reflecting his journey from a teenage fan to a solo artist.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump exceeded his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose sweeping tariffs on most of the country's trading partners. The court found it unlikely that Congress intended to grant the president unlimited authority to set tariffs by declaring national emergencies over trade deficits. While the ruling is a significant legal setback for one of the president's key economic policies, the court has allowed the tariffs to remain in effect temporarily to give the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A shallow 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck a mountainous region of eastern Afghanistan, causing hundreds of deaths and widespread destruction. The quake's location in remote Nangarhar and Kunar provinces, coupled with landslides blocking roads, is severely hampering rescue operations. The country's vulnerability is compounded by buildings made of non-resistant materials like mud and timber. Since the Taliban's takeover in 2021, Afghanistan has faced economic collapse and the suspension of most foreign aid, leaving its healthcare system and disaster response capabilities critically weakened and overwhelmed by the scale of the crisis.</p>

According to media reports citing a diplomatic cable, U.S. consular officers have been instructed to refuse visas for purposes such as business, study, or medical treatment to almost all Palestinian applicants. This move represents a significant tightening of U.S. policy, expanding on a recent pause for visitors from Gaza and the denial of visas to dozens of Palestinian officials. The State Department has not explicitly confirmed the policy but stated it is taking steps in compliance with U.S. law and national security.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "The Haydn Expedition," showcases the unique democratic structure and artistic excellence of The Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen (DKB). Founded by music students in 1980, the orchestra operates with a grassroots approach where all musicians have a say in artistic and operational decisions, from selecting conductors to choosing repertoire. The film follows the orchestra, led by conductor Paavo Järvi, as they tackle Joseph Haydn's London Symphonies, drawing a parallel between the composer's liberation as a freelance artist and the orchestra's own independent spirit. The DKB is presented as a successful model for combining artistic virtuosity with democratic principles.</p>

Climate scientists at the Met Office state that a summer this hot is now 70 times more likely due to human-induced climate change. The heat was accompanied by below-average rainfall for most of the country, leading to hosepipe bans in many parts of England.</p>

The plan, developed by Israeli figures linked to a criticized humanitarian foundation, would be financed by private investment and claims it would increase Gaza's value by over $300 billion.

A study from the Bay Area Economic Institute and UC Merced estimates the state could lose up to $278 billion in GDP if mass deportations are combined with other restrictive policies. Industries such as agriculture, construction, and hospitality, which rely heavily on the state's 10.6 million immigrants, including a large undocumented workforce, would be hit hardest. The report argues that immigrant workers are essential for sustaining the state's economy amid declining birthrates and an aging population.</p>
