          <p>President Trump declared the U.S. would cease bombing Yemen, claiming the Houthis pledged to halt attacks on American ships in the Red Sea, though the Houthis have not confirmed this agreement and will first 'evaluate' the proposal. The announcement follows weeks of U.S. airstrikes against Houthi targets, which began in March, and substantial losses of military equipment, including seven Reaper drones and a fighter jet. The U.S. military has conducted over 800 strikes in Yemen since March 15, with one strike on April 18 resulting in significant casualties. Israeli forces have also conducted strikes on Yemen, targeting key infrastructure in response to Houthi attacks on Israel. </p>

          <p>Palantir's stock experienced a 12% drop despite reporting strong revenue growth and raising its full-year revenue guidance, with CEO Alex Karp defending the company's performance. Analysts attribute the decline to slowing international revenue growth and high expectations embedded in the company's software multiple. Palantir reported adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share on $884 million in revenues, exceeding expectations and increasing revenues by 39% year-over-year. The company's full-year revenue outlook is now projected to be between $3.89 billion and $3.90 billion.</p>

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee is eliminating a direct line of communication between U.S. diplomats in Jerusalem working on Palestinian affairs and agencies in Washington, a move that effectively ends the special status of the Office of Palestinian Affairs at the embassy. The office, located in the old Jerusalem consulate building, maintains contact with Palestinian officials and reports on Palestinian issues, sending cables directly to Washington without prior approval from embassy leaders. The State Department spokesperson stated that Secretary of State Marco Rubio decided to merge the responsibilities of the Palestinian Affairs office fully into the embassy, with Huckabee overseeing the merger.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has permitted the Trump administration to implement its policy barring transgender individuals from serving in the military while legal challenges continue.

The policy, stemming from an executive order signed in January, targets active-duty and prospective service members with gender dysphoria, citing concerns about military readiness and cohesion.

The legislation also includes a state grant program to support prosecution in human trafficking and sex trafficking cases, funded by increased fines for businesses that aid in human trafficking.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang cautioned that being excluded from China's AI market, projected to reach $50 billion in the next few years, would be a 'tremendous loss' for the company. He stated that selling into China would generate revenue, taxes, and jobs in the United States. The Trump administration recently restricted shipments of Nvidia's H20 chips to China without a license, leading Nvidia to anticipate a $5.5 billion quarterly charge. Huang acknowledged Huawei as a formidable technology company and emphasized the importance of getting American AI technology to the forefront globally.</p>

          <p>MrDeepFakes, a notorious AI-generated pornography site, has shut down after losing a critical service provider, citing data loss that makes continued operation impossible. The site was known for hosting nonconsensual, digitally altered, explicit sexual content, often featuring celebrities and, in some cases, private individuals. The motivations behind these deepfake videos included sexual gratification and the degradation of targets, according to research. The U.S. House of Representatives recently voted in support of the TAKE IT DOWN Act, which aims to establish penalties for publishing intimate visual depictions without consent.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is challenging the White House's attempt to deport a 20-year-old Venezuelan asylum seeker, arguing he was wrongly expelled to El Salvador. The judge has ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return, citing violations of a previous court settlement designed to protect young migrants with pending asylum cases. The Justice Department is contesting the order, claiming the man is a terrorist and therefore ineligible for asylum, although evidence beyond the State Department's designation of Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization has not been disclosed. This case highlights the administration's aggressive approach to immigration enforcement and its increasing defiance of judicial orders.</p>
