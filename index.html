          <p>Omer Shachar, a co-leader of Run for Their Lives in Boulder, Colorado, described the "panic" he felt when a man threw a Molotov cocktail at his group during a pro-Israel demonstration. Shachar recounted how friends were set on fire, and he attempted to extinguish the flames and confront the attacker. Passersby aided in putting out the blaze with water bottles. The suspect, Mohamed Soliman, was apprehended and allegedly stated his desire to kill all Zionist people, claiming the attack was related to the killings of people on his land in Palestine.

          <p>President Trump is intensifying his criticism of Republican senators who may impede the passage of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which is aimed at advancing his legislative agenda. He specifically targeted Senator Rand Paul for publicly criticizing the bill's debt ceiling increase, which Paul believes would lead to excessive deficits. Trump is actively engaging with senators through phone calls and meetings to garner support for the legislation, which includes extending his 2017 tax cuts and increasing spending on military and border security, but also entails some cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. The White House press secretary echoed Trump's sentiments, suggesting that Republican senators who oppose the bill will face consequences from their voters. Optimism surrounding this bill is waning due to the divisions within the Republican party. </p>

          <p>Democrats are debating whether to prioritize fighting corporate power or reducing regulatory red tape, following Kamala Harrisâ€™s defeat. A new poll from Demand Progress suggests voters prefer a candidate focused on curbing corporate power over one emphasizing deregulation to boost production. However, the article argues that Democrats do not need to choose between these approaches, as abundance reforms can complement populist goals. The political case for abundance policies rests on their material benefits, not their rhetorical appeal, and there is no inherent tension between enforcing antitrust laws and relaxing restrictions on multifamily housing construction.</p>

          <p>House Democrats, led by Representatives Nadler and Raskin, are urging House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan to condemn the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for allegedly handcuffing a staff member in Rep. Jerry Nadlerâ€™s office. They dispute DHS's claim that agents were conducting a "security check," stating that video footage reveals agents demanding access to "non-public areas" without regard for staff safety. The Democrats are requesting that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem testify before the House Judiciary Committee to address the incident. DHS stated that officers were responding to reports of protesters inside Nadler's office, and that the staffer became verbally confrontational and physically blocked access. </p>

The think tank cited the UK's "very thin" buffer in public finances and called on Chancellor Rachel Reeves to increase tax revenue and reduce spending. The OECD suggested Reeves should adopt a "balanced approach" of targeted spending cuts and tax increases, including closing tax loopholes and re-evaluating council tax bands.
