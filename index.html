The blast occurred on a Friday morning in a parking lot of the Special Enforcement Bureau at the Biscailuz Center Academy. Federal agents have been deployed to the scene to investigate the cause of the explosion, which remains unclear. California Governor Gavin Newsom and other local officials are monitoring the situation and have offered state assistance in the response to the tragic incident.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Delta and United Airlines Gaining Dominance in the US Airline Industry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 12:25:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delta and United Airlines are increasingly outperforming their competitors, capturing over 86% of the profits among the seven largest U.S. airlines last year. Analysts attribute their success to strong brand loyalty, extensive networks, and a strategic focus on premium travel and international routes, which helps them navigate market challenges like falling domestic airfares. While other carriers struggle with overcapacity and price sensitivity in the coach class market, Delta and United are leveraging their premium cabins and loyalty programs to maintain profitability. This trend suggests a growing consolidation of market power between these two major carriers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK has imposed sanctions on three Russian military intelligence units and 18 officers for conducting a sustained campaign of malicious cyber activities. The Foreign Office stated that Russia's GRU espionage agency targeted UK media, infrastructure, and political institutions as part of a broader effort to destabilize Europe, linked to the UK's support for Ukraine. These measures coincide with the EU announcing its 18th round of sanctions against Russia, including a ban on transactions related to the Nord Stream pipeline. The actions aim to increase pressure on the Kremlin over the ongoing war.</p>

          <p>Joseph Lawson, one of three men convicted in the 2015 disappearance and murder of Kentucky mother Crystal Rogers, is requesting a new trial. His lawyers argue that being tried alongside Rogers' boyfriend, Brooks Houck, unfairly prejudiced the jury against him due to evidence presented that was primarily related to Houck. The motion claims this "spillover effect" denied Lawson a fair determination of his own culpability, especially since Houck did not testify, preventing any cross-examination. A jury recommended a 25-year sentence for Lawson and life in prison for Houck.</p>

          <p>An opinion article posits that the Democratic Party is facing a structural crisis, evidenced by historically low approval ratings and the collapse of the political coalition that brought Barack Obama to power. The author contends that the party's focus on "woke grievances" and "intersectional obsessions" on issues like race, gender, and crime has alienated a large portion of the American electorate. The rise of figures like New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, described as a communist, is presented as proof that the party is moving further left, which the author believes will lead to continued political decline.</p>

          <p>The University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers for July indicates a significant drop in inflation expectations, with both one-year and five-year outlooks falling to their lowest levels since February, before recent tariff announcements.

Despite this improvement, the survey director noted that consumers still perceive a substantial risk of future inflation, as the figures remain above pre-2025 levels.

While the Trump administration has pushed for a strong, centralized Syrian government under new president Ahmed al-Sharaa, Israel remains wary of Sharaa's jihadist past and has supported local rivals like the Druze community. This divergence was exposed when Sharaa's forces moved into the Druze stronghold of Sweida, leading to a bloody clash and subsequent Israeli airstrikes on Damascus.

The review praises the film for its nasty, cynical, but eerily accurate portrayal of how online life bled into reality during that period.

          <p>The recent failure to elect law professor Frauke Brosius-Gersdorf to Germany's Federal Constitutional Court has sparked controversy over the influence of right-wing social media. A political consultancy analyzed 40,000 posts and concluded that a targeted campaign, led by outlets like Nius, used disinformation and aggressive rhetoric to portray the respected academic as a "left-wing radical." This campaign is believed to have swayed conservative politicians to withdraw their support, derailing the election. The incident has raised serious concerns about the vulnerability of Germany's democratic institutions to manipulative online campaigns and political polarization.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced that "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" will conclude its run in May 2026, and the network will retire "The Late Show" franchise entirely. The network described the move as a "purely a financial decision" amid a challenging late-night television landscape and stated it was not related to the show's content or performance. Colbert, who has hosted since 2015 and has been number one in late night for nine seasons, informed his audience of the decision, expressing his gratitude to the network, his staff, and his viewers. The show's cancellation has prompted speculation about its potential connection to political criticism.</p>

The company's global affairs chief, Joel Kaplan, stated that the code introduces legal uncertainties and goes "far beyond the scope of the AI Act" passed last year. While other major tech firms like OpenAI have committed to the code, which aims to improve AI transparency and safety, Meta joins a chorus of businesses concerned that the regulations will throttle the development of frontier AI models in Europe.</p>

The violence, which has reportedly killed nearly 600 people in sectarian clashes between Druze and Bedouin communities, has displaced thousands and blocked humanitarian aid.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees who are "house rich but cash poor," a reverse mortgage can serve as a financial tool to supplement Social Security benefits. The article outlines three primary ways this can work: by converting home equity into a steady monthly income stream to cover daily expenses, by providing access to a lump sum or line of credit for unexpected costs like healthcare, or by enabling a homeowner to delay claiming Social Security to allow their future benefits to grow. This strategy allows homeowners aged 62 and older to utilize their home's value without having to move. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's production of asparagus and strawberries has fallen to its lowest levels in decades, according to the Federal Statistical Office. Farmers are planting less of these crops as rising costs, particularly for labor, make them increasingly unprofitable. The asparagus harvest hit a 15-year low, while the strawberry harvest was the lowest in 30 years. As a result, Germany's self-sufficiency in strawberries has dropped significantly, and the prices for both seasonal delicacies are rising, turning them into luxury items for many consumers.</p>
