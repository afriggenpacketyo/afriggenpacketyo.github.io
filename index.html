          <p>As President Donald Trump undertakes a state visit to the United Kingdom, the event casts a spotlight on his own family's immigrant story. His mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, was a native Gaelic speaker from the Isle of Lewis in Scotland who emigrated to the United States in the early 20th century. This background presents a notable contrast to his administration's hardline stance on what it terms "chain migration," the very process that allowed his maternal family to establish roots in America. The article explores the culture of emigration from the economically challenged Scottish island and the "rags to riches" trajectory of Trump's mother.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing US-China trade tensions, Hong Kong's government-run tech incubator, Cyberport, is considering incorporating Chinese-made graphics processing units (GPUs) into its new Artificial Intelligence Supercomputing Centre. The move is a strategic effort to decrease its reliance on chips from the American firm Nvidia, which currently powers its entire 3,000 petaflop system. Cyberport's CEO confirmed they are testing GPUs from four different mainland Chinese manufacturers, stating that depending solely on Nvidia is no longer a viable option given the strained geopolitical climate. The final decision on which Chinese GPUs to procure will be based on performance and cost. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is significantly expanding its cooperation with Central Asian nations to secure access to critical minerals and rare earths, creating a wider gap with the United States in the race for these strategic resources. Recent agreements, such as one between China National Gold Group and Uzbekistan, highlight Beijing's proactive, region-wide strategy to invest in geological exploration and mining infrastructure. These moves are seen as an effort to counter China's dependency on other sources and limit the influence of Western actors in a region rich with materials vital for high-tech industries. The article suggests that China's approach is more adaptive to the strategic needs of each Central Asian country.</p>

Observers expect limited breakthroughs, but a possible extension of the deadline for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its US operations may be discussed.</p>

          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent victim of the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has publicly stated that Lord Mandelson should never have been appointed as the UK's ambassador to the United States. In an interview, Giuffre's brother criticized the appointment as evidence of "deep corruption" within governmental systems. This condemnation follows Lord Mandelson's recent dismissal by the Prime Minister after emails revealed the extent of his relationship with Epstein, including encouraging the financier to seek early release from a previous conviction. The family argues that accountability is lacking and that powerful individuals connected to Epstein have been allowed to retain their status without consequence.</p>

The patrol follows Beijing's recent announcement of plans to create a national nature reserve at the contested Scarborough Shoal.

          <p>A thriving, multi-billion dollar parallel economy operates within the world's prison systems, involving governments, private corporations, and inmates themselves. Governments spend vast sums on incarceration, with an increasing portion being outsourced to private firms that profit from services like food, healthcare, and telecommunications, often at highly inflated prices. Inside prison walls, organized crime syndicates manage lucrative contraband markets, while inmates engage in an informal economy where items like instant noodles serve as currency. This system is further complicated by prison labor programs that pay inmates mere cents per hour, highlighting a complex web of profit and survival behind bars.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that cannabis use can be detrimental to female fertility by disrupting the development and genetic stability of egg cells. Researchers found that women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) with detectable levels of THC, the active ingredient in cannabis, had a significantly lower rate of genetically healthy embryos. Laboratory experiments on human eggs also showed that THC exposure led to more errors in chromosome distribution and defects in the egg cell's structure. While some experts call for further research considering factors like age and consumption levels, the study concludes that women trying to conceive should consider refraining from cannabis use.</p>

While Turkey's NATO membership and superior military might offer some protection, the strike on a close U.S. ally like Qatar has raised anxieties in Ankara.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Donald Trump's "strongman" image belies a fundamental weakness in foreign policy, which has emboldened adversaries like Russia's Vladimir Putin and complicated alliances with partners like Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu. The author contends that Trump's appeasement and inability to take decisive action have allowed both the Ukraine and Gaza conflicts to escalate, citing recent Russian drone incursions into Poland and Israel's reckless strike in Qatar as evidence. The piece criticizes Trump for failing to lead and calls on European and other democratic nations to unite and act decisively to halt the aggression, warning of a descent into global anarchy.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's state visit to the UK will feature a significant "royal charm offensive," with the British government hoping to leverage his admiration for the monarchy to advance its diplomatic goals. The meticulously planned visit will immerse the president in royal pageantry, including a lavish banquet and events with King Charles III and other senior royals. This strategy aims to create a positive atmosphere for discussing sensitive topics like trade and the war in Ukraine. Analysts note that while the King and Trump hold divergent views on many issues, the monarch's experience and Trump's fascination with royalty could serve as a unique diplomatic tool for the UK.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the mysterious disappearance of George Smith, a 26-year-old man who vanished from his honeymoon cruise in 2005, with his case remaining unsolved despite a lengthy FBI investigation. Suspicion initially fell on his new wife but later shifted to a group of young men who were the last to see him alive in his cabin. The investigation uncovered conflicting accounts, a provocative video made by the men after the disappearance, and evidence of a struggle, including a significant bloodstain on a lifeboat canopy below his balcony. Despite the family's decade-long fight for answers, the FBI officially closed the case in 2015 due to insufficient evidence.</p>

          <p>Ahead of high-level trade talks in Spain, China has publicly stated that progress in negotiations is contingent on the fair treatment of its companies, specifically citing the continued operation of TikTok in the United States. A commentary in the Communist Party's official newspaper, People's Daily, emphasized that while Beijing is open to dialogue, Washington must ensure a non-discriminatory environment for Chinese enterprises. The article warns that if the US continues to undermine the interests of Chinese firms, China is prepared to take necessary measures to protect its national and corporate rights. This positions the fate of the popular video-sharing app as a key issue in the broader economic discussions.</p>

          <p>Despite rampant optimism and strategists repeatedly raising their targets for the S&P 500, a number of significant risks threaten the current US stock market rally. While the market continues to set records, potential dangers include a faltering of the artificial intelligence investment theme, negative impacts from ongoing trade disputes, and concerns over swelling government debt. Another key risk is a potential weakening of the US labor market, which could undermine the economic stability that has supported corporate profits. With stock valuations at their highest levels in years, investors are aware of these issues but are largely maintaining their bullish outlook for now. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a crucial 13-7 victory over the San Francisco Giants, overcoming an early three-run deficit with a powerful offensive display. After struggling in high-leverage situations recently, the team's bats came alive in a decisive six-run fifth inning, turning the game around. The rally was highlighted by a bases-clearing double from Teoscar Hernández, which gave the Dodgers a lead they would not relinquish. The win provided a much-needed boost for the team's inconsistent offense and helped maintain their 2.5-game lead in the National League West division standings.</p>

          <p>A major diplomatic dispute has erupted between Ethiopia and Egypt following the inauguration of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, a US$5 billion project on the Blue Nile. Egypt has condemned the dam's launch as an "unlawful unilateral act," fearing it will threaten its vital downstream water supply, and has protested to the UN Security Council. Ethiopia, however, views the dam as a symbol of national achievement and crucial for its energy needs. As the conflict escalates, observers have noted that China, which maintains strong ties with both nations, is uniquely positioned to mediate, though Beijing has so far refrained from taking sides.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has announced an initial investment of AU$12 billion (US$8 billion) to upgrade the Henderson shipyard near Perth into a facility capable of maintaining a future fleet of nuclear-powered submarines. This major expenditure is a key component of the AUKUS security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, which aims to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific. The upgraded shipyard will be crucial for servicing the Virginia-class submarines Australia is set to acquire from the US and the new AUKUS-class submarines to be built with the UK. The facility will also be available for use by the US Navy.</p>
