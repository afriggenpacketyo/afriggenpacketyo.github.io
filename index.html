          <p>Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told CNBC he prefers only one rate cut this year due to concerns about upward pressures on inflation, partially driven by tariffs. He noted that consumer sentiment surveys show Americans are worried about the potential of tariffs to push inflation higher. Bostic emphasized his concern about inflation expectations moving in a troublesome way, which would make the Fed's job harder. While the Fed projected two quarter-point rate cuts in March, Bostic believes it will take longer for the situation to sort out. </p>

          <p>According to a New York Times article, stocks, bonds, and the dollar experienced turbulent trading after Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating, citing concerns about the cost of President Trumpâ€™s policies and the health of the economy. The S&P 500 index fell, bond yields jumped, and the dollar slipped, suggesting investors are losing confidence in the U.S. economy. The downgrade was influenced by a bill in Congress to make President Trumpâ€™s 2017 tax cuts permanent, which could significantly increase federal debt. The U.S. has now lost its triple-A credit rating from all three major rating agencies. </p>

Moody's was the last of the three major credit rating agencies to downgrade the nation's government debt.

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. told employees at its Oppama plant, near Tokyo, that reports of its planned closure were not definitive. The struggling Japanese automaker was reported to be considering shuttering the plant in Yokosuka and the Shonan plant of its unit, Nissan Shatai Co., in Hiratsuka. The country's third-biggest automaker by volume said last week that it will shut seven vehicle plants and cut 20,000 jobs globally after logging a net loss for fiscal 2024.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin said Monday that the phone call between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump would start at 5 p.m. Moscow time (14:00 UTC). Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin's spokesperson, said Russia "highly valued" Trump's efforts for peace. Trump said when he first announced the call would take place, he would also speak with NATO leaders and Zelenskyy afterward. The call comes after the first direct talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations in three years last week, although their meetings in Istanbul ended without a commitment to a ceasefire.</p>

The IRNA news agency said the British charge d'affaire was asked on Sunday to give an explanation for what it said was "unjustified" and "politically motivated" arrests. On Monday, the Foreign Office responded by summoning Tehran's ambassador to the UK following the charges. Three Iranian men were arrested on 3 May and appeared in court in London on Saturday charged with spying for the Islamic republic.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer's big bet is that nobody really cares any more about Brexit. In the press conference with EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa, the prime minister talked about moving on from the "stale old debates" of the Brexit years. The view at the top of government is that there is no public clamour to reopen the biggest questions of Brexit â€“ membership of the single market and customs union â€“ but that making the relationship smoother within those parameters is mere pragmatic common sense.</p>

          <p>Health officials are making a renewed call for vigilance against bird flu, but some experts are puzzling over why reports of new human cases have stopped appearing in the US. The H5N1 bird flu has been spreading widely among wild birds, poultry and other animals around the world for several years, and starting early last year became a problem in people and cows in the U.S. In the last 14 months, infections have been reported in 70 people in the U.S. â€” most of them workers on dairy and poultry farms, and mostly with mild symptoms.</p>

          <p>A theoretical proposal published in the journal Reports on Progress in Physics is challenging our previous understanding of quantum physics. The proposal suggests scrapping almost everything we think we know about gravity, as Live Science explains. Instead, the authors touch up the theory to match known and observable physics, something they call unified gravity. This new model is an attempt to skip all that. It offers physicists a bold new trail to blaze in the long-running search to unite quantum physics with the theory of gravity.</p>
