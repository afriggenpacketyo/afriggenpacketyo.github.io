        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key witness in a collapsed UK espionage case involving China stated he removed the word "enemy" from his statement because it did not align with the Conservative government's policy at the time. This revelation comes amid scrutiny of why charges were dropped, with the Crown Prosecution Service citing a lack of evidence from the government defining China as a national security threat. The letter from deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins suggests the difficulty in prosecuting under the Official Secrets Act was present before the current Labour government took power, shifting focus back to the previous administration's stance and the CPS's decision-making process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Mississippi has struck down a Biden-era rule that extended federal anti-discrimination protections in healthcare to include gender identity. The ruling, from Judge Louis Guirola Jr., stated that the Department of Health and Human Services overstepped its authority by redefining sex discrimination under Title IX. This decision came after a lawsuit from 15 Republican-led states, which argued the rule would force states to cover gender-affirming care through Medicaid and intruded on their authority to regulate healthcare. The court determined that "sex" in the original 1972 law referred to biological sex, blocking the federal agency's reinterpretation.</p>

          <p>During a protest against a planned immigration enforcement surge in the San Francisco Bay Area, officers fired upon a U-Haul truck that was reversing towards a line of law enforcement at the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda. The driver reportedly fled after the shooting but later returned and abandoned the vehicle. The protest began in response to the base being designated as a staging area for Border Patrol agents, though President Trump later announced the San Francisco operation was canceled. The day-long standoff also saw the use of flash bangs and smoke grenades, with at least one protester reporting an injury.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines experienced a significant, system-wide IT outage that prompted a nationwide ground stop for its flights and those of its regional carrier, Horizon Air. The airline has since restored its systems and lifted the ground stop, but the disruption resulted in over 229 flight cancellations. The company is now working to reposition its aircraft and crews to resume normal operations as quickly as possible. Passengers are advised to check their flight status before heading to the airport, as further delays and cancellations are likely while the network recovers from the widespread technical failure.</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by strong performance in its beauty and grooming divisions. Despite this, the company's overall sales volume remained flat, indicating that some consumers are pulling back on purchases due to inflation. Specifically, the health care and fabric and home care segments saw a 2% decline in volume. P&G maintained its full-year sales and earnings forecast, signaling confidence in navigating a challenging consumer and geopolitical environment, but the results highlight waning demand for certain household staples.

          <p>Indian refining giant Reliance Industries is reportedly set to stop purchasing Russian crude oil following new U.S. sanctions against Russian energy firms Rosneft and Lukoil. Reliance has become a major buyer of discounted Russian oil, which now constitutes a significant portion of India's total crude imports. A halt in these purchases could impact Reliance's profit margins, as it would need to source more expensive crude from other regions like the Middle East or the Americas. This potential shift highlights the ripple effects of U.S. foreign policy on global energy markets and corporate strategies in major importing nations. (not investment advice)</p>

Additionally, Meta is accused of not offering users simple ways to report illegal content or effectively challenge moderation decisions.

What was once a simple role has evolved into an 18-month, multi-thousand-dollar affair, including destination bachelorette parties and numerous other expenses. A recent study found that the typical cost of attending just one bachelorette party and wedding is over $2,000, forcing many young people to make financial sacrifices. The author argues that this trend, coupled with increasingly large bridal parties, is straining friendships and finances, questioning why brides are placing such heavy burdens on their closest friends.</p>

The piece contrasts this "dreamy little crime," where no one was hurt, with more violent robberies, suggesting the real offense was the museum's two-day closure.

The meeting was part of a broader effort to gather input from non-Communist Party figures and other sectors of society for the upcoming plan. The remarks underscore Beijing's strategy of prioritizing internal stability and development regardless of international pressures or shifts in global dynamics.</p>

          <p>Scientists have confirmed the discovery of the Jinlin crater in China's Guangdong province, identifying it as the result of an asteroid impact that occurred approximately 10,000 years ago. This is the first impact crater to be identified in southern China and only the fifth in the entire country. Researchers estimate that the energy released by the impact was equivalent to about 600,000 tonnes of TNT, or roughly 40 atomic bombs. The discovery provides new insights into the Earth's geological history and the potential for significant cosmic events to shape the landscape in different regions of the world.</p>

They have also lowered their average expected portfolio return for 2025 to 5%, down from 11% in 2024. Concerns over the depreciation of the U.S. dollar and a slowdown in private equity exits are key factors driving this move toward increased liquidity and risk mitigation. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reviews the new Bruce Springsteen biopic, "Deliver Me From Nowhere," arguing that the film falls short of capturing the artistic depth of his 1982 album, *Nebraska*. The movie, starring Jeremy Allen White, frames the album's creation almost entirely as a response to Springsteen's troubled relationship with his father. The reviewer contends that this narrow autobiographical focus overlooks the album's broader engagement with American musical traditions, iconography, and its unique, punk-like spirit. While the film may satisfy as a Great Man narrative, it ultimately simplifies the majesty and complexity of one of Springsteen's most celebrated and unconventional works.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has demolished the historic East Wing of the White House to clear the site for a planned $300 million ballroom. The sudden action, largely unannounced, has sparked questions about its legality, as it proceeded without clear approval from federal commissions that typically oversee such changes, which are currently closed due to the government shutdown. The project is reportedly being funded by private donations, including from major tech companies and crypto investors, raising ethical concerns about potential influence over the administration. Critics view the move as another step in transforming the historic residence to mirror the aesthetic of Trump's private clubs.</p>

          <p>The Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru has achieved a stunning victory in the Caerphilly by-election, taking a Senedd seat that has been a Labour stronghold for over a century. The result is a significant blow to the Labour Party, which finished in a distant third place, and a setback for the Reform UK party, which came in second despite a strong campaign. Plaid Cymru's success is attributed to positioning itself as the primary vehicle for change against both the UK and Welsh Labour governments, while downplaying the divisive issue of independence. The outcome raises serious questions about Labour's standing in Wales ahead of the full Senedd election.</p>

This forecast is based on the belief that its scarcity, decentralized nature, and first-mover advantage will establish it as a digital alternative to gold and a hedge against inflation. Ark's base case predicts a price of $1.2 million, while even a bear case scenario sees it rising to $500,000.

The incidents occurred in the northern Akita region and the central Toyama region. This year, nine people have been killed by bears, surpassing the previous record, as the animals increasingly venture into populated areas.

          <p>This article analyzes Philip Pullman's new *Book of Dust* trilogy as a commentary on censorship and the power of dangerous ideas, reflecting the very controversies his original *His Dark Materials* series once sparked. The new books feature a conflict driven by philosophical texts that cause people to become estranged from their souls, ironically echoing the claims made by religious critics against Pullman's work in the 2000s. The author suggests that while Pullman's new series doesn't call for censorship, it affirms his belief that certain ideas can be harmful. This theme is particularly relevant amid the current wave of politically motivated book-banning campaigns in the U.S.</p>

          <p>A court in Turkey has thrown out a corruption case filed against the country's main opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), ruling that the lawsuit was without merit. The case had sought to invalidate the party's 2023 congress, where a new leader was elected, alleging procedural violations and vote-buying. The CHP has consistently denied the accusations, framing the legal action as a politically motivated attempt by President Erdoğan's government to undermine the opposition. This ruling is seen as a positive development for the CHP, which has faced a sustained legal crackdown, including the ongoing detention of Istanbul's mayor.</p>

While the immediate impact is felt by furloughed federal workers, a prolonged shutdown could sap broader consumer strength, especially if food assistance programs are affected. Some experts warn of a "vicious cycle" where uncertainty chills economic activity, potentially leading to a contraction if the impasse lasts for months. However, other economists downplay the risk, arguing the shutdown affects a relatively small portion of the economy, which has otherwise shown resilience. (not investment advice)</p>
