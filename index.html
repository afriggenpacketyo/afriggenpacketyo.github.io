          <h2>Chinese Exports Decline Amid U.S. Tariffs, Shifting Trade Patterns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 16:55:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop in April due to tariffs imposed by the U.S., making it more expensive for American retailers to import goods from China. In response, Chinese exports to Southeast Asian countries have surged, indicating a shift in trade patterns. Despite President Trump suggesting a potential reduction in tariffs, businesses remain cautious, and retailers are rethinking their supply chains to reduce reliance on China. Analysts anticipate that U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will eventually settle around 34% as both sides engage in trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>New York lawmakers passed a $254 billion state budget that includes benefits for various groups, including themselves. The budget delays enforcement of an outside income cap for legislators and alters campaign finance rules to favor incumbents.

          <p>President Trump's firing of Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden, the first woman and African American to hold the position, has intensified concerns about the upheaval of U.S. cultural institutions.

          <p>Simon Mann, a former British Army officer and mercenary involved in a failed coup attempt in Equatorial Guinea in 2004, has died of a heart attack at 72. Mann made millions protecting businesses in conflict zones before his involvement in the coup, for which he was sentenced to 34 years in prison. He claimed to be the "manager, not the architect" of the scheme and was pardoned and released in 2009. The plot aimed to overthrow President Teodoro Obiang Nguema and install an exiled opposition leader.</p>

          <p>With home equity levels high, HELOCs can be a valuable financing source, but paying them back strategically is crucial. Homeowners should consider taking advantage of the interest-only payment period by paying more than just interest, monitoring the interest rate climate for opportunities to make larger payments, and using the HELOC for select home repairs and renovations to potentially benefit from tax deductions. Understanding early payment penalties and consulting with a lending expert can help create a personalized repayment strategy.</p>
