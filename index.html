          <p>Enrique Anaya, a constitutional lawyer and vocal critic of El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, has been arrested on charges of "money laundering." Anaya has described Bukele as a "dictator." Human rights organizations have condemned the arrest, suggesting it is an attempt to silence government critics. Bukele's hardline approach to gangs has made him popular, but has also raised concerns about civil liberties. The optimism score is low, reflecting concerns about freedom of speech and political repression. </p>
