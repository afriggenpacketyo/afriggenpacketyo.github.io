          <h2>Stephen Miller Says Trump Administration Considering Suspending Habeas Corpus</h2>

          <p>White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller stated that the Trump administration is actively considering suspending the writ of habeas corpus, a right that protects individuals from unlawful detention by the government. Miller indicated that this option is being explored in response to the issue of illegal immigration, particularly if the courts do not align with the administration's stance on deporting undocumented immigrants. The writ of habeas corpus, rooted in the Magna Carta, ensures the right to challenge the legality of one's imprisonment. This announcement signals a potential escalation in the administration's approach to immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), citing concerns that her detention could stifle free speech among non-citizens. Ozturk, a doctoral student from Turkey, was detained after writing an essay critical of Israel in a student newspaper. The judge emphasized that there was no evidence to suggest Ozturk posed a threat to American foreign policy interests, and that her detention could deter non-citizens from exercising their First Amendment rights. Ozturk testified about experiencing asthma attacks in detention due to poor conditions.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for allegedly trespassing at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention center in Newark, New Jersey. According to the interim U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, Baraka ignored multiple warnings from Department of Homeland Security officials to leave the facility. Baraka, a Democrat running for governor of New Jersey, had previously filed a lawsuit to block the opening of the detention center, arguing that its operators failed to obtain proper permits and violated city code.

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco appears poised to temporarily block the Trump administration's sweeping overhaul of the federal government. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston indicated that the President must seek Congressional approval for significant government restructuring. The lawsuit, filed by labor unions, nonprofits, and local governments, argues that the overhaul violates the Constitution. The plaintiffs are seeking a temporary restraining order to halt mass layoffs and program closures, arguing that agencies are acting under the President's executive order without independent analysis or reasoned decision-making.</p>

          <p>The Department of Agriculture (USDA) is demanding states provide personal data of food assistance recipients, including Social Security numbers and addresses, following a request by federal auditors. The request follows an executive order by President Trump calling for agencies to ensure the federal government has access to comprehensive data from all state programs that receive federal funding. Concerns have been raised about the potential misuse of this data for deportation and mass surveillance efforts. Advocates warn the data collection could violate the Privacy Act and enable exaggerated allegations of fraud, while the USDA insists all personally identifiable information will comply with privacy laws.</p>

          <p>Individuals can collect Social Security benefits while receiving annuity payments, providing a stronger financial foundation for retirement. Social Security benefits do not have restrictions that would prevent receiving income from an annuity. However, claiming Social Security before full retirement age results in a smaller monthly check, while annuity income begins based on contract terms. Social Security benefits may become taxable depending on total income, including annuity payments, so retirees should consult with a retirement income specialist to structure their annuity and Social Security timing effectively.</p>

Escalation could result in the dismantling of Pakistan, impacting China's investments in the Gwadar Port, and President Trump has offered to help the countries find a resolution.

The resentencing hearing follows renewed interest in the case due to recent Netflix shows and social media campaigns advocating for their release.

          <p>With home equity levels high, a HELOC can be a valuable financing source, but paying it back is critical. Homeowners should consider taking advantage of the interest-only payment period by paying more than just interest, monitoring the interest rate climate for opportunities to make larger payments, and using the HELOC for select home repairs and renovations to potentially benefit from tax deductions. Understanding potential early payment penalties is also essential. A personalized repayment strategy, possibly with the help of a lending expert, will be most effective for each borrower's budget.</p>
