        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to launch a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting economic growth by lowering energy costs for businesses. The plan includes the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme, which will cut energy costs by up to Â£40 per megawatt-hour for over 7,000 manufacturing firms starting in 2027, and an increase to a 90% discount on network charges from 2026 for the most energy-intensive firms. Other measures in the strategy involve upskilling Britons, attracting global talent, streamlining planning processes, and boosting research and development spending, with a focus on eight specific sectors. While some business groups and unions welcome the plan, others express disappointment over the exclusion of sectors like retail and leisure. Optimism surrounding the plan is tempered by recent figures showing a contraction in the UK economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An advice column explores the ethical dilemmas faced by educators regarding the use of AI in humanities education. The author argues that the true value of humanities lies in the formation of human character, rather than simply producing academic outputs. With AI threatening to remove cognitive friction from learning, the author suggests incorporating reflection pieces alongside AI-assisted assignments to encourage critical thinking. The goal is to help students develop practical wisdom, enabling them to make informed choices about technology's role in their lives. </p>

          <p>A regulation implemented in 2021, intended to improve the performance of Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs), has led to a surge in pancreas harvesting for research. The regulation allowed OPOs to count pancreata used for research towards their certification, leading to a threefold increase in research pancreata. However, the fate and actual use of these pancreata remain largely unknown, with some potentially going unused or being disposed of. Critics argue that the "pancreas loophole" undermines the goal of increasing organ transplants for those in need. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece argues that military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities will not end its nuclear ambitions and could lead to worse outcomes. The author contends that nationalism, rather than theocracy, is the driving force behind Iranian politics, and a new regime, even a democratic one, would likely continue or surpass the current regime's belligerence. The author suggests that the attacks have convinced many Iranians that nuclear restraint is national suicide, as Iranians are uniting in the face of what they perceive as foreign aggression. The piece emphasizes the need for diplomacy and dialogue to achieve lasting peace and security. </p>

          <p>Iran's parliament has approved a measure to potentially close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for global oil transit, in response to U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Experts warn that this action could alienate Iran's neighbors and trade partners, particularly China, which is a major customer for Iranian oil. Closing the strait could also provoke hostilities and negatively impact Iran's own economy, with analysts suggesting that oil prices could surge if the strait is closed. The final decision rests with Iran's national security council. (not investment advice)</p>
