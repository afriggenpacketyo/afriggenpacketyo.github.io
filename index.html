          <p>The Trump administration is actively working to arrange a summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which would be their first direct meeting since the war began. This diplomatic effort follows a series of high-level meetings at the White House involving U.S. and European leaders. Budapest is among the locations being considered for the potential talks, with the White House aiming to finalize a date and location soon. Discussions also include security guarantees for Ukraine, which would be coordinated with European allies but would not involve U.S. ground troops.</p>

          <p>Stocks tied to the cryptocurrency industry experienced a significant downturn as investors shifted away from technology and other risk-heavy assets. Major crypto exchanges like Coinbase and Robinhood saw their shares fall by over 5%, while the price of Bitcoin dropped nearly 3%. This sell-off in crypto assets mirrored a broader decline in the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index. The market's movement comes as investors cautiously await signals on future monetary policy from the Federal Reserve's upcoming economic symposium. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of artificial intelligence software provider Palantir fell more than 9%, marking the fifth consecutive day of declines and a continued retreat from its recent all-time highs. This slump, which coincides with a wider market downturn, has erased over 15% of the stock's value in the last week. Despite this pullback, Palantir remains one of the top-performing stocks in the S&P 500 for the year, having more than doubled in value due to strong investor enthusiasm for AI and its success in securing major government contracts.

          <p>Authorities in Colorado are conducting a large-scale manhunt for a suspect who stabbed a park ranger at Staunton State Park, located southwest of Denver. Following the midday attack, the suspect fled on foot, prompting the immediate closure and evacuation of the nearly 4,000-acre park. The injured ranger was transported to a hospital for treatment, though their condition has not been publicly released. The motive for the stabbing remains unknown as heavily armed officers continue to search the area for the assailant.</p>

This inquiry follows President Trump's recent decision to federalize the city's police force to address a persistent crime wave. The D.C. Police Union had previously claimed that high-ranking officers were pressuring members to downgrade the classification of serious crimes, such as shootings and carjackings, to lesser offenses in official reports.</p>

          <p>Israel is insisting on the release of all 50 hostages held in Gaza, a position that is creating significant doubt about the viability of a new 60-day ceasefire proposal that Hamas has agreed to. The plan, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, involves the release of approximately half the hostages in exchange for a truce. An Israeli government spokesperson stated that the country is not interested in "partial deals," signaling that Israel may reject the current terms or seek to renegotiate, despite ongoing international efforts to end the conflict.</p>

However, S&P issued a warning that the rating could be lowered in the future if high government deficits continue to increase or if political developments weaken U.S. institutions.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled that a public university's ban on drag shows violates the First Amendment right to free speech. The case stemmed from a decision by the president of West Texas A&M University to cancel a planned on-campus drag performance organized by a student LGBTQ+ group. While the ruling affirmed constitutional protections for this form of artistic expression, the article notes that the legal process took over two years, effectively denying the students involved their rights for a significant portion of their college careers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While annuities are often promoted for providing a secure income stream in retirement, they possess several significant disadvantages that warrant careful consideration. These financial products are frequently criticized for their high fees, which can substantially reduce investment returns over time. Additionally, they often come with steep surrender charges that penalize investors for withdrawing funds early, creating a lack of liquidity that can be problematic during financial emergencies. The complexity of annuity contracts can also obscure their true costs and limitations. (not investment advice)</p>

Apple's expansion in India is part of its long-term strategy to diversify its supply chain beyond China, but the timing places the company's operations at the center of a complex geopolitical and trade dispute.</p>
