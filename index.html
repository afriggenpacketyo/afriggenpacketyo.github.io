          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has voiced concerns that the upcoming Trump-Putin summit in Alaska will yield "stillborn decisions" if Ukraine is not included in peace negotiations. Kyiv fears that the U.S. and Russian leaders might dictate Ukraine's future without its direct participation. Despite these apprehensions, recent discussions between Zelenskyy, Trump, and European leaders found consensus on key Ukrainian demands, including that territorial concessions must be decided by Ukraine and tied to binding security guarantees. Trump has warned of "severe consequences" for Russia if a ceasefire is not agreed upon.</p>

          <p>A second contestant has been edited out of the current MasterChef series following requests not to be included, in the wake of misconduct allegations against hosts Gregg Wallace and John Torode. The BBC decided to broadcast the series, filmed before the hosts were dismissed, to support the participating chefs. However, this decision has drawn criticism from some women who made claims and from the broadcast union Bectu. The production company's report upheld multiple complaints against Wallace, including unwelcome physical contact, while a racist term allegation was upheld against Torode.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's decision to federalize Washington, D.C.'s police force and deploy National Guard members is based on his assertion of an "out of control" crime problem. However, federal data indicates that violent crime in the District has actually fallen to its lowest level in three decades, reversing a spike seen in 2023. This disparity reveals a significant gap between public perception, often influenced by political rhetoric, and the statistical reality of crime rates. Mayor Muriel Bowser and crime data analysts emphasize that policy decisions should be data-driven, while also addressing public feelings of insecurity.</p>

Amfo also cited feeling 'completely satiated' by the job and a desire to avoid it becoming a 'chore' as contributing factors.

          <p>Olympic 1500m bronze medallist Georgia Hunter Bell is weighing an ambitious double attempt at the World Championships in Tokyo, considering competing in both the 800m and 1500m. Her recent strong performances in the 800m have raised the prospect of a showdown with training partner and Olympic champion Keely Hodgkinson. Hunter Bell, who previously quit the sport for five years, has sought advice from Dame Kelly Holmes, one of only four women to medal in both events at a single World Championships. Her decision will be finalized after upcoming races, balancing personal ambition with strategic considerations.</p>

          <p>The Monterey Car Week auctions, a major event for classic car collectors, are projected to see a third consecutive year of sales declines, with expectations ranging from $367 million to $409 million. The high-end market is particularly weak, with fewer multi-million dollar cars on offer than in over a decade. Experts attribute this slowdown to a generational shift, as Baby Boomers downsize and younger collectors, like millennials and Gen Z, prefer newer, more affordable, and practical post-1980s supercars. This trend is driving more private sales to avoid public price reductions for older, high-value vehicles.</p>

          <p>U.S. universities face an unprecedented challenge as President Donald Trump's administration targets billions in federal research funding, jeopardizing the long-standing agreement of government support for basic science. This creates an urgent need for new financial models, as abrupt cuts can lead to researcher layoffs, halted clinical trials, and talent drain. States are now exploring emergency funds and incentives for corporations, investors, and philanthropists to bridge the funding gap. Massachusetts is leading this effort with proposed legislation to inject $400 million into university research, recognizing the economic returns generated by academic R&D.</p>

          <p>The plant-based meat industry is undergoing strategic shifts to address stagnant sales and consumer criticisms regarding product processing and health.

In contrast, Impossible Foods is doubling down on 'meatier' products, maintaining its heme ingredient and focusing on taste. Both companies are betting on different approaches to attract consumers, with industry success crucial for reducing animal suffering and environmental impact, yet facing a complex discourse where 'processed' is often unfairly demonized compared to conventional meat.</p>

While the exact long-term impact on employment is still being assessed, initial evidence suggests labor demand hits in AI-exposed industries, particularly for entry-level and manual tasks.

          <p>California Democrats are preparing a major redistricting effort to counteract Republican attempts in Texas to redraw congressional districts for political advantage. Governor Gavin Newsom has vowed California will respond if Texas Republicans proceed with plans to alter five Democratic-held seats to favor the GOP. While redrawing districts typically follows the decennial census, this mid-decade battle could significantly impact the next midterm elections and the remainder of President Trump's second term. California's effort, however, faces a more complex process due to its independent citizens redistricting commission, potentially requiring a state constitutional amendment.</p>

          <p>England's NHS waiting list saw a slight increase to 7.37 million patients at the end of June, prompting concerns from experts that hospitals are not treating enough patients to keep pace with demand. Internal documents suggest that a significant factor in previous reductions was the removal of patients from the list without treatment, through legitimate means like private care or recovery, but also potentially through computing errors. While 'validation' efforts aim to improve efficiency, critics argue that the NHS is still treating fewer patients than are being referred, highlighting underlying systemic pressures.</p>

          <p>Over 120 education scholars have vehemently condemned Harvard University's publisher for canceling an entire issue of the Harvard Educational Review dedicated to Palestine, labeling it an act of "censorship." The special issue aimed to examine the education of Palestinians and related debates amid the destruction of Gaza's educational infrastructure. Authors and editors rejected the publisher's explanation of inadequate review, asserting it sets a dangerous precedent and exemplifies the 'Palestine exception' to academic freedom. The scholars pledged to boycott the publisher until an apology is issued, a new issue commissioned, and editorial independence safeguards are implemented.</p>

Trump, on the other hand, desires to be seen as a global peacemaker and aims to achieve progress towards ending the conflict, possibly through 'land-swapping' proposals.

While many tip Liverpool to defend their crown, bolstered by new signings, Arsenal is seen as a strong contender with their tactical blueprint and new striker. Manchester City is expected to improve after a 'reset,' despite squad changes. Chelsea, having won the Club World Cup, are also anticipated to compete strongly, with their young squad and new manager Enzo Maresca.
