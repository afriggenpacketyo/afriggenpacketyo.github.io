          <p>A survivalist expert is advising hikers and outdoorsmen to avoid the Ozarks region of Arkansas due to the ongoing search for escaped convict Grant Hardin, a former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks." Hardin, who was serving time for murder and sexual assault, escaped from a medium-security prison and is considered armed and dangerous. The expert suggests Hardin's survival hinges on avoiding injury or illness, and warns that anyone in the woods could be seen as an opportunity for supplies. Authorities believe Hardin, familiar with the Ozark Mountain region, may be hiding in caves or rugged terrain.</p>

          <p>India's central bank exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softened inflation and slower growth as reasons for the move. This marks the third consecutive rate cut since February, despite better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. While the RBI maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, it also shifted its monetary policy stance to "neutral" due to limited room for further easing, emphasizing a data-driven approach to balance growth and inflation.

          <p>Four individuals, including an official from the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) cricket team, have been arrested in India following a deadly stampede during a victory celebration.

          <p>The government has announced a ban on bonuses for senior executives at six water companies failing to meet environmental and consumer standards. The new measures, under the Water Act, apply to firms that do not meet environmental and consumer standards, lack financial resilience, or have criminal convictions. This action follows growing public outrage over sewage spills and rising bills, while water companies have awarded £112m in bonuses to executives over the past decade. The regulator, Ofwat, can now claw back bonuses or take enforcement action, aiming to rebuild trust between the companies and their customers.</p>

          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is causing producer prices to remain in deflationary territory, leading to a surge of cheap exports into global markets. While steep tariffs deter Chinese exports to the U.S., other economies, particularly in Asia, are concerned about being overwhelmed by these low-cost goods. However, for economies struggling with inflation, this influx of cheap Chinese imports could provide some relief for consumers. Economists suggest that this situation may allow central banks to consider further rate cuts, balancing the need to lower living costs with the challenges of rising trade tensions.

          <p>Israeli forces conducted airstrikes on southern Beirut, targeting what they claimed was a Hezbollah unit producing drones, despite a ceasefire being in effect. The attack, occurring on the eve of Eid Al Adha, prompted evacuation warnings and caused widespread traffic gridlock. Lebanese officials condemned the strikes as a violation of international accords, while the UN emphasized the need for diplomacy. Israel's defense minister praised the military's execution, holding the Lebanese government responsible for preventing violations of the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>A new poll reveals that many Europeans believe their societies are broken and in decline, with negative sentiment growing across major economies. Economic concerns contribute to populist sentiment, with many believing their economies are rigged to favor the wealthy. In Great Britain, there is significant support for a "strong leader who breaks the rules" to address these problems. This reflects a broader dissatisfaction with the status quo and a desire for change, even if it means unconventional leadership.</p>

          <p>Democrats are facing internal discussions about their aging leadership, especially after electoral defeats and health concerns.

          <p>President Trump's latest travel ban has been implemented amidst a series of restrictive immigration policies. This ban, targeting foreign nationals from 19 countries, is part of a broader effort to tighten immigration controls. The administration has also ended temporary legal residency for various groups, restricted student visas, and increased vetting for international scholars. Experts suggest that these measures have created widespread chaos within the immigration system, normalizing restrictive practices.</p>

          <p>Despite a US port fee targeting ships linked to China, major shipping companies like Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) are continuing to order vessels from Chinese shipyards. MSC cites the competitiveness and capabilities of Chinese shipyards as difficult to match in the short term. The decision reflects the industry's need for new vessels to meet decarbonization goals, with China currently leading in shipbuilding competence. The industry's focus on decarbonization and the limitations of other shipbuilding sectors are influencing procurement decisions.</p>
