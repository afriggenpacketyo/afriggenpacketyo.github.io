        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Toyota Industries Corp. experienced a significant drop in shares, marking the steepest fall in 10 months, after the announcement of a $33 billion buyout deal by Toyota Group. This move occurs amid growing pressure on Japanese firms to dissolve long-standing cross-shareholding ties, a practice Toyota used to shield itself from acquisition threats. The deal involves a tender offer for Toyota Industries' shares at a price lower than the previous day's closing, with financing supported by loans from major banking corporations. The article suggests this event could signal a broader trend of unwinding cross-shareholdings within the Toyota Group. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has increased tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum to 50%, citing the need to bolster the U.S. industry.

The deal includes a "golden share" for the federal government, but details are scarce.

          <p>Bernie Sanders argues that the Democratic party lacks a compelling message for working-class Americans, criticizing their reluctance to challenge the billionaire class and advocate for policies like universal healthcare and free college tuition. He believes Trumpism appeals to working-class people because it acknowledges the system's failures, even though Trump's solutions are inadequate. Sanders emphasizes the need for Democrats to address economic inequality and offer concrete solutions to improve the lives of ordinary Americans. He suggests that the Democrats' focus on simply opposing Trump is insufficient to win over working-class voters.</p>

          <p>The Danish government's decision to exclude the question of Palestinian statehood from national school elections has ignited controversy, with critics arguing it undermines freedom of expression and civic education. The government claims the issue is too sensitive for classroom discussions, but critics suggest the real reason is to avoid exposing the government's own failures in addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This decision highlights a double standard in Denmark's approach to controversial issues, prioritizing sensitivities over free speech when it comes to Israel and Palestine. The controversy offers students a valuable lesson about the limits of democratic participation and the power of those in authority.</p>

The absence of Read's testimony leaves the prosecution's version of events unchallenged, potentially influencing the jury's verdict.</p>

          <p>China's Tiandu-1 satellite has entered a 3:1 resonant orbit synchronized with Earth and moon motion, which China claims is a first for any spacecraft. However, U.S. and Canadian experts challenge this, citing NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) probe which entered a similar orbit in 2011. The 3:1 resonant orbit is considered a breakthrough for lunar infrastructure, potentially enabling a BeiDou-like guidance system for interplanetary missions.

          <p>A Mexican family in Los Angeles has been granted humanitarian parole to remain in the United States so that their 4-year-old daughter can receive life-saving treatment. The family's emergency visa had been revoked, putting them at risk of deportation, but U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has now granted a one-year extension. The girl is being treated for a rare condition, and her medical team has stated that the necessary equipment is not available outside of the U.S. This decision allows the child to continue receiving critical care.</p>
