          <p>Financial experts recommend strategic steps to escape the payday loan debt cycle, which traps many in expensive debt. Negotiation with lenders for structured repayment plans is advised, alongside consulting credit counseling agencies or debt solutions companies. Alternatives to high-interest loans include personal loans, reduced credit card interest rates, debt transfers, family assistance, and selling unused items. Building a small emergency buffer through side gigs and exploring debt consolidation options can also help, but experts caution against debt management plans that may harm credit scores.

          <p>President Trump has delayed the imposition of 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9, providing an opportunity for renewed trade negotiations.

Despite the delay, significant obstacles remain, and the EU is preparing retaliatory tariffs on American imports.

          <p>In California, gardeners are increasingly planting native species in parks to help prevent the spread of wildfires. This initiative involves the cultivation of plants like lacy phacelia and elegant clarkias, which are well-suited to the local environment and less prone to fueling fires. Many individuals are finding purpose in care and stewardship, especially those transitioning from the struggling film and TV industry. The community engagement provides a productive outlet for energy and contributes to the overall resilience of the ecosystem. </p>
