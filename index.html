          <p>The House Oversight Committee has formally subpoenaed the Department of Justice for all documents related to its investigations into Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Committee Chair James Comer stated the move is essential for congressional oversight of federal sex trafficking law enforcement. This action risks a political clash with the White House, which has been managing fallout from the case, including President Trump's push to release related grand jury testimony. The subpoena sets an August 19 deadline for the DOJ to produce the requested files.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services, under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has terminated 22 contracts for mRNA vaccine development, valued at approximately $500 million. Kennedy explained the decision was based on a review concluding that mRNA vaccines are not sufficiently effective against upper respiratory viruses like COVID and the flu. The funding will be redirected towards what the department considers safer and broader vaccine platforms, such as whole virus vaccines. This move does not affect all government mRNA research, as some late-stage projects and NIH studies will continue.</p>

          <p>An extensive manhunt is underway in Montana for Michael Paul Brown, a former U.S. soldier suspected of killing four people at a bar in Anaconda. Governor Greg Gianforte has declared the search the state's highest priority, authorizing additional resources for the more than three dozen law enforcement agencies involved. Brown, who family members say has a history of mental illness, fled the scene and is considered armed and extremely dangerous. The shooting has deeply affected the small community, with authorities closing a 22-square-mile area of national forest to aid the search.</p>

While revenue of $7.69 billion surpassed expectations, adjusted earnings per share were one cent below the forecast. The company's AI business revenue was impacted by U.S. export restrictions to China, although its data center and client segments saw significant year-over-year growth. AMD provided a positive sales outlook for the current quarter, projecting revenue to reach $8.7 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

The Quad, an alliance including the U.S., India, Japan, and Australia, is a key component of the Indo-Pacific strategy aimed at countering China's influence.

          <p>Snap's stock value fell sharply after its second-quarter earnings report revealed that its global average revenue per user (ARPU) missed Wall Street expectations. The company attributed the weaker-than-expected topline growth to a flawed advertising platform update, the timing of Ramadan, and changes in trade policy. Despite daily active users exceeding forecasts at 469 million, the ARPU figure indicated challenges in monetizing its user base. Snap did, however, provide a third-quarter revenue forecast that was ahead of analyst estimates, suggesting potential for recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. is making a significant push to reduce its dependency on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for electronics, defense technology, and green energy. A central part of this strategy involves reviving California's Mountain Pass mine, a site with a history of operational and financial struggles. The Department of Defence is investing heavily to re-establish a domestic supply chain, an effort that gained urgency under the Trump administration. This initiative reflects a broader geopolitical and economic competition as the U.S. seeks to secure its own source of these critical minerals.</p>

          <p>A high-stakes political battle is unfolding in Texas over gerrymandering, the practice of drawing electoral maps to favor one political party. The state's Republican majority aims to approve new congressional maps that could grant them up to five additional seats, prompting Democratic legislators to flee the state to deny a voting quorum. This article explains that while gerrymandering for partisan advantage is legal, racial gerrymandering is not, though the distinction can be blurry.

          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) plans to negotiate with federal agencies after the Trump administration froze approximately $339 million in research grants. The freeze affects hundreds of grants for science and medical research from the NIH, NSF, and Department of Energy. The administration has accused UCLA of various violations, including allowing antisemitism on campus, which the university disputes as justification for halting research funding. While senior administrators are hopeful for a solution, faculty are demanding a more aggressive defense, and the university has not ruled out future legal action.</p>

          <h2>DOJ to Seek Hate Crime Charges in Killing of Israeli Embassy Staffers</h2>

          <p>The Department of Justice is preparing to seek hate crime charges and potentially the death penalty against the gunman who allegedly killed two Israeli embassy staffers in Washington, D.C. Prosecutors are expected to ask a grand jury to indict Elias Rodriguez on these charges for the May 21st shooting of Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim. Rodriguez allegedly shouted pro-Palestinian slogans during the attack and told police he "did it for Palestine." To secure a hate crime conviction, prosecutors must prove his actions were motivated by antisemitism, not just political opposition to Israel.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent comments have influenced prediction markets, with Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh now seen as front-runners to become the next Federal Reserve chair. In a CNBC interview, Trump spoke favorably of "both Kevins," while noting that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is no longer in contention. Following the interview, wagers on the prediction market Kalshi gave both Hassett and Warsh a 35% chance of being nominated. Both candidates have previously advocated for lower interest rates, aligning with Trump's frequent criticism of current Chair Jerome Powell's policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Texas Senator John Cornyn Asks FBI to Help Locate Democratic Lawmakers Who Fled State</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 16:14:11 EDT</div>

          <p>The political standoff in Texas has escalated significantly, with Republican Senator John Cornyn requesting FBI assistance to locate Democratic state lawmakers who fled to prevent a vote on a contentious redistricting plan. The Democrats left the state to deny a legislative quorum, effectively blocking a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps in a way that could secure them five additional seats. This move sets up a potential confrontation between federal law enforcement and other states, like Illinois, where the lawmakers have sought refuge and been offered protection.</p>
