            <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping, during a visit to Hanoi, urged China and Vietnam to collaborate against what he termed as U.S. “unilateral bullying,” aiming to stabilize regional ties amid disruptions from the Trump administration. Xi emphasized the mutual benefits of economic globalization and called for joint efforts to safeguard global free trade and maintain supply chain stability. He also advocated for strengthening strategic cooperation to oppose hegemonism, unilateralism, and protectionism, coinciding with a pause in U.S. tariffs on countries like Vietnam amid ongoing trade tensions between Beijing and Washington.</p>

            <p>Harvard University has declined to accept conditions proposed by the Trump administration for continued federal funding, citing the university's commitment to its independence and constitutional rights. In response, the administration announced a freeze on $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $60 million in multi-year contracts to Harvard. The administration's conditions included leadership reforms, an end to diversity, equity, and inclusion policies, and disciplinary action for students involved in pro-Palestinian protests, which Harvard President Alan Garber deemed an overreach of federal power.</p>

            <p>Senior advisers within President Trump's inner circle privately cautioned that proposed tariff policies could destabilize global financial markets and negatively impact the U.S. economy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick voiced concerns over broad tariffs, predicting market turmoil and potential global disaster. Despite these warnings, trade advisor Peter Navarro advocated for aggressive tariffs, leading to internal disagreements. Following the announcement of tariffs, financial markets experienced significant losses, prompting Trump to temporarily pause some tariffs after input from Bessent and Lutnick.

            <p>A severe sandstorm swept across central and southern Iraq, leading to over a thousand people being hospitalized with breathing difficulties. The storm, characterized by a thick orange haze, reduced visibility to less than one kilometer, causing power cuts and flight suspensions in several regions. Health officials reported at least 700 cases of suffocation in Muthanna province alone, with hospitals in other provinces also treating numerous patients, including children. Experts suggest that these dust storms are becoming more frequent due to the effects of climate change.</p>

            <p>This article is a political cartoon by Fiona Katauskas commenting on the perceived silence of world leaders regarding the situation in Gaza. It implies a critique of the lack of outspokenness from global leaders on the ongoing conflict and humanitarian crisis in the region. The cartoon likely aims to provoke thought and discussion about the responsibilities of international leaders in addressing the situation.</p>

Harvard President Alan Garber argued that the demands infringed on academic freedom and university self-governance. The administration responded by freezing the funds, asserting that federal investment requires adherence to civil rights laws. Harvard maintains that its reforms address antisemitism and that the government's demands are a political ploy.</p>

            <p>Research indicates a significant decline in the number of plays and musicals staged by the UK's main subsidized theaters, with a nearly one-third decrease compared to a decade earlier. Funding cuts, rising costs, and the aftermath of the pandemic are blamed for the reduction. Some venues are now co-producing more shows or focusing on larger-scale productions to offset costs, potentially squeezing out smaller-scale and riskier projects. The decline has also raised concerns about opportunities for young talent and the stability of the theater workforce.</p>

            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey reveals that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to result in a significant reshoring of manufacturing to the United States. Companies surveyed indicated that the cost of bringing back supply chains could double, leading them to seek lower-tariffed countries instead. The survey also found that most respondents believe the Trump administration is bullying corporate America. Furthermore, automation is expected to dominate if manufacturing returns to the U.S., with layoffs being an immediate concern for many firms. (not investment advice)</p>
