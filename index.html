          <p>Israel's Supreme Court has ordered the state to provide sufficient food to Palestinian prisoners, overturning a policy implemented by far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. The ruling came after a civil rights group argued that ration cuts had led to malnutrition and starvation among detainees. The minister criticized the court's decision, accusing it of protecting terrorists. This legal development highlights the contentious issue of prisoner conditions within the Israeli justice system amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has issued what he described as his "last warning" to Hamas, demanding the group accept a ceasefire agreement that would secure the release of hostages from Gaza. In a statement, Trump claimed that Israel has already accepted his terms and that Hamas must now follow suit or face unspecified consequences. This intervention occurs as Israel continues its major military offensive in Gaza City. Hamas has indicated a readiness to negotiate based on what it called "ideas from the American side."</p>

          <p>Israel's Defense Minister, Israel Katz, has issued a stark ultimatum to Hamas, threatening the total destruction of Gaza City if the militant group does not release all hostages and surrender its arms. This "last warning" comes as Israel expands its military offensive, having already issued evacuation orders to residents in parts of the city. The statement underscores the escalating intensity of the conflict, which has resulted in over 64,000 Palestinian deaths, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, a figure the UN considers reliable.</p>

          <p>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has announced a ban preventing ships and planes carrying weapons destined for Israel from using Spanish ports. The embargo also extends to vessels transporting fuel for Israel's military, a move intended to pressure the Netanyahu government over its military conduct in Gaza. This action reflects increasing international pressure on Israel from some European nations, with Spain also banning entry to individuals who have participated in what Sanchez termed a "genocide." The decision marks a significant diplomatic step amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>A shooting attack at the Ramot Junction in Jerusalem has resulted in the deaths of at least four people, with multiple others injured, according to Israel's emergency services. The incident involved two attackers who reportedly opened fire on a bus before being "neutralized" by police shortly after the assault began. This event occurs within the broader context of the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict and adds to the recent surge in violence in the region. The identities of the attackers and any group affiliation have not yet been formally confirmed.</p>

          <p>The board of Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur has issued a statement confirming that its majority owner, ENIC, has "unequivocally rejected" two separate preliminary expressions of interest in a takeover. This announcement comes shortly after the departure of Daniel Levy, the league's longest-serving chairman, which had fueled speculation that the club might be open to a sale. The board's definitive statement asserts that Tottenham is not for sale and that ENIC has no intention of accepting any acquisition offers.</p>

          <p>Following Germany's 3-1 victory over Northern Ireland, German coach Julian Nagelsmann sparked controversy with his post-match comments, describing Northern Ireland's style of play as not "brilliant to watch" and reliant on long balls. His remarks were met with criticism from pundits and former players, who labeled them as disrespectful. They argued that Germany also employed long-ball tactics during the game and suggested Nagelsmann's comments were a way to deflect from his own team's less-than-dominant performance against a lower-ranked opponent.</p>

          <p>China's export growth slowed to its weakest pace in six months in August, with customs data revealing a sharp 33% year-on-year plunge in shipments to the United States. This significant drop is attributed to a U.S. crackdown on transshipments—where goods are rerouted through third countries to avoid tariffs—and the fading impact of previous front-loading of exports. While China has increased exports to other regions like Southeast Asia and Africa, the slowdown in its largest single-country market highlights ongoing trade pressures. (not investment advice)</p>
