        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Ian Goldin, a professor of globalisation at the University of Oxford, globalisation is not dead but is instead flourishing and becoming more centered in Asia. He asserts that the region's rapid economic growth and poverty reduction are direct results of its integration into the global economy. Goldin notes that while the process is becoming more fragmented and regional, with the U.S. partially withdrawing, Asia's continued success demonstrates its vitality. The professor also warns that the risks of globalisation, such as pandemics, are growing alongside its benefits.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump attended the U.S. Open men's final, marking his first appearance at the event in a decade and his first since becoming president. Situated in a luxury suite, he was met with a combination of cheers and boos from the crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium. The U.S. Tennis Association reportedly asked broadcasters to avoid showcasing off-court disruptions related to his presence. The visit caused significant security lines, which delayed the start of the championship match between Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner by half an hour.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz delivered a dominant performance to win his second US Open title, defeating rival and defending champion Jannik Sinner in four sets. The victory returns the 22-year-old to the world No. 1 ranking and marks his sixth career Grand Slam title, making him the second-youngest man in the Open era to achieve this feat. The article highlights Alcaraz's versatile and commanding gameplay, which kept Sinner off balance throughout the match. The event was also notable for the logistical disruptions and heightened security caused by the attendance of President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>A California state bill aimed at establishing secure, overnight parking programs for homeless community college students is unlikely to pass this legislative session. The proposed law, AB 90, intended to provide a safe place for the significant number of students living in their vehicles due to high housing costs. Despite surveys indicating that one in four community college students in the state has experienced homelessness, the bill stalled in committee. Opposition from some college districts cited concerns about the high costs and feasibility of implementing such programs.</p>

          <p>In what Ukraine's air force described as a record aerial assault, a Russian attack has damaged the main government building in Kyiv for the first time since the full-scale invasion began. The overnight barrage involved over 800 drones and missiles launched across the country, killing at least four people, including a baby. The strike on the cabinet of ministers building in the heavily defended city center marks a significant escalation. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack as a deliberate crime intended to prolong the war.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas defended the performance of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., stating he was chosen by President Trump to be a "disrupter" at the CDC. In an interview, Marshall expressed distrust in the CDC stemming from its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and argued for a more individualized approach to vaccination rather than universal mandates. He questioned the necessity of certain vaccines for all children, such as the Hepatitis B shot for newborns, advocating for decisions to be made by parents and doctors.</p>

          <p>Major UK trade unions are warning the government not to weaken its promised Employment Rights Bill, which is expected to become law soon. Leaders from unions like Unison have voiced concerns that a recent cabinet reshuffle, which saw key proponents of the bill moved, signals a wavering commitment to implementing it in full. The proposed legislation would introduce significant new protections for workers, including a ban on exploitative zero-hours contracts. Unions are vowing to campaign fiercely against any attempt to water down the bill's provisions.</p>

          <p>Thirteen, an upscale Houston restaurant owned by NBA star James Harden, has been shut down after a lockout notice was posted on its door.

The Ukrainian leader expressed regret that his country was not involved and reiterated his belief that ending the war requires more significant economic and diplomatic pressure on Russia from the United States and its allies.</p>

          <p>According to the Universal Postal Union (UPU), postal traffic to the United States has dropped by more than 80% following the Trump administration's suspension of the "de minimis" trade exemption. This rule had allowed packages valued under $800 to enter the country tariff-free. The administration ended the exemption to combat illegal goods like fentanyl and counterfeits, but the move has caused a near-halt in the global mail network, with dozens of national postal operators suspending services to the U.S. until a technical solution for compliance is found.

          <p>This Guardian editorial argues that the Trump administration's recent use of military force against alleged drug traffickers represents a dangerous escalation of a failed policy. The article condemns the extrajudicial killings as a violation of due process that sets a harmful international precedent, similar to the overreach seen during the "war on terror." It contends that such strikes are counterproductive, risk civilian casualties, and alienate potential allies like Mexico. The authors conclude that a more effective approach requires addressing domestic demand and stemming the flow of U.S. arms to cartels.</p>
