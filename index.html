          <p>Sam Rivers, the founding bassist for the popular nu-metal band Limp Bizkit, has passed away at the age of 48. The band confirmed his death in a statement, remembering him as "pure magic" and the "soul in the sound." Rivers had previously taken a hiatus from the band in 2015 due to liver disease, for which he received a transplant, before rejoining in 2018. Fellow band members, including frontman Fred Durst, shared heartfelt tributes recalling Rivers' immense talent and foundational role in the group's formation and success during their peak in the 1990s.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Officials in Boston are exploring the possibility of opening city-owned grocery stores to improve access to fresh and affordable food, an idea gaining traction in other U.S. cities like New York and already implemented in Atlanta. Proponents argue such initiatives can serve communities underserved by private grocers, citing early success in Atlanta. However, the proposal faces significant skepticism from economists and conservative think tanks, who warn that government-run stores are often inefficient, require substantial taxpayer subsidies to compete, and could ultimately harm the private grocery market by operating on artificially low margins.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa midfielder Emiliano Buendia, who missed an entire year with an ACL injury, scored a decisive winning goal in a 2-1 victory over Tottenham. His recent form, with three goals in his last four appearances, marks a significant turnaround after a challenging recovery period. Buendia, once the club's record signing, was nearly transferred but chose to stay and fight for his place in the team. The victory is Aston Villa's third consecutive league win, signaling a recovery from a poor start to the season and moving the team up the Premier League table.</p>

          <p>A fragile ceasefire in Gaza was tested as Israel launched air and artillery strikes, stating that its forces were targeted by Hamas with a rocket-propelled grenade and sniper fire. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu directed the military to take "strong action," resulting in dozens of strikes on what Israel called Hamas targets and halting aid transfers into Gaza. Hamas denied involvement in the clashes, reaffirming its commitment to the ceasefire agreement. The violence has reportedly killed at least 38 people in Gaza, jeopardizing ongoing negotiations for the next phase of the peace plan.</p>

          <p>Kenya held a state funeral for veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga, who passed away at age 80 while receiving medical treatment in India. Thousands of mourners gathered at his rural home for the ceremony, which included full military honors, a rare tribute for a non-president. Odinga was a revered figure for his decades-long fight against autocratic rule, which included imprisonment and exile. His recent political pact with President William Ruto had helped stabilize the country after violent protests, and its future is now uncertain following Odinga's death, leaving a significant void in Kenyan politics.</p>

          <p>Multiple prominent universities are rejecting a Trump administration proposal that would tie federal benefits to a commitment to the president's priorities. The nine-page compact asks schools to pledge to freeze tuition, cap international enrollment, require standardized testing, and abstain from using race or sex in admissions. It also includes a controversial clause for employees to refrain from political speech, which critics argue infringes on constitutional rights and academic freedom. University faculty members have expressed concern that the proposal rewards loyalty over merit and could undermine the pursuit of truth in research and education.</p>

          <p>European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde described the global economy as being in a state of "transformation," primarily influenced by trade tariffs and artificial intelligence. She stated that the full impact of U.S. tariffs has yet to be felt by consumers, as exporters and importers are currently absorbing most of the costs by squeezing their profit margins. Lagarde also noted that the U.S. dollar's status as the ultimate safe-haven currency is showing signs of erosion, citing the rise of cryptocurrency and a more than 50% increase in the price of gold this year as indicators of shifting investor trust.</p>

Conversely, Republicans, including Senator Katie Britt, argue that the government must be reopened first before any discussions on healthcare can occur.

          <p>The United States has significantly increased its military presence in the Caribbean, deploying approximately 10,000 forces and conducting bomber flyovers near Venezuela. This buildup accompanies a series of six maritime strikes by U.S. Special Operations forces against alleged drug traffickers, resulting in 29 fatalities since September. Democratic Senator Mark Kelly expressed concern over the escalation, questioning the legal authority for military action in what is traditionally a law enforcement domain. He warned that the administration's actions are raising fears of a potential move toward regime change, a strategy he noted has historically proven unsuccessful for the U.S.</p>

Her opening monologue directly referenced the controversy surrounding her album cover for "Man’s Best Friend," which some critics deemed regressive. Carpenter's performance served as a commentary on the scrutiny faced by young female artists, particularly former Disney stars, who embrace a more adult and sexualized persona.</p>

The question was met with what sources described as "stunned awkwardness" from a team that views its coverage as nonpartisan. Since taking the role, Weiss has also been involved in booking right-leaning figures like Benjamin Netanyahu and Jared Kushner, signaling a potential shift in the news division's direction.</p>

The perpetrators used a mobile freight elevator to access a second-floor window of the Apollo gallery just before the museum opened to the public. They then used an angle grinder to smash two display cases containing jewels that once belonged to Emperor Napoleon and his wife, escaping on motorcycles in an operation that lasted approximately seven minutes.

While critics argue such a tax could drive wealthy individuals out of the country and penalize investment, Polanski stated its primary goal is reducing inequality rather than funding public services.

          <p>A leak of bigoted messages from a private chat group has intensified infighting within the Young Republican National Federation (YRNF).

The scandal has divided state chapters, with some condemning the remarks and others remaining silent or questioning the context of the leaks. The controversy highlights a long-standing and bitter internal power struggle, with some members concerned that the discord could damage the organization's effectiveness in future elections.</p>

          <p>A gang of thieves conducted a highly organized raid on the Louvre Museum in Paris, targeting France's priceless crown jewels housed in the Galerie d'Apollon. The suspects used a mechanical ladder to enter a first-floor window shortly after the museum opened, then smashed display cases with power tools before escaping on mopeds. At least nine items of what officials describe as "immeasurable heritage value" were stolen. One item, reportedly the 19th-century crown of Empress Eugenie, was found dropped nearby. The incident prompted a full evacuation and closure of the world's most visited museum as a manhunt began.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of protesters, including naturalist Chris Packham and singer Feargal Sharkey, gathered at the London Aquarium to demand the release of 15 gentoo penguins. The demonstration, organized by Freedom For Animals, argued that the penguins are being held in a basement enclosure without natural sunlight or fresh air. Campaigners contend that since gentoo penguins are not an endangered species, there is no conservation justification for keeping them in captivity. The aquarium, owned by Merlin Entertainments, responded that the habitat was designed with specialist veterinary advice and allows the penguins to exhibit their normal behaviors.</p>

The event, which drew large crowds, highlights the environmental benefits of grazing, such as clearing flammable undergrowth to reduce wildfire risks. This year's festival carried extra significance following Spain's destructive wildfire season. As part of the tradition, organizers paid a symbolic fee of 50 medieval coins to city officials for the animals' safe passage, a custom dating back to a 1418 agreement between shepherds and the city.</p>

The agreement, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, aims to establish mechanisms for lasting peace after the worst clashes since the Taliban's return to power in 2021. The conflict escalated after Islamabad accused the Taliban of harboring armed groups that attack Pakistan, a charge the Taliban denies. Both sides have reported heavy casualties, and under the new agreement, they have committed to ending hostile actions and refraining from targeting each other.</p>
