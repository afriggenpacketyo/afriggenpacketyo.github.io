          <p>A shooting at Evergreen High School in Colorado has left three students critically injured with gunshot wounds. The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office is conducting a room-by-room search of the school, but authorities have not yet identified or located any suspects, stating they are uncertain if there was one or multiple shooters. The incident prompted a large-scale law enforcement response, lockdowns at nearby schools, and the establishment of a reunification center for parents and students. Colorado Governor Jared Polis issued a statement praying for the victims and the community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Freight trade into the United States is experiencing an unusual slowdown during what is typically its peak season ahead of the holidays. This decline is largely driven by a sharp, sustained drop in imports from China, which have fallen 27% year-over-year for three consecutive weeks. Analysts note that a traditional late-September shipping rush is unlikely to occur, as retailers who front-loaded inventory to get ahead of tariffs now report high inventory levels. This trend, affecting products from furniture to electronics, signals a cooling trade environment and a potentially pessimistic economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Widespread "Block Everything" protests have erupted across France, leading to hundreds of arrests as demonstrators shut down roads, set fires, and clashed with police. The demonstrations are a response to government budget cuts and the recent appointment of a new prime minister following a no-confidence vote. In Paris, police used tear gas to disperse crowds attempting to block the city's beltway, while major disruptions were reported in cities like Marseille, Lyon, and Rennes. The French government deployed approximately 80,000 police officers to manage the nationwide unrest, which was organized through social media.</p>

          <p>The pace of inflation in the U.S. is increasing again, remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% target and causing financial strain for many American families. Consumers report that stubbornly high prices for essentials like groceries and home maintenance are making it challenging to manage household budgets. Economists anticipate the upcoming Consumer Price Index report will show an annualized inflation rate of 2.9% for August, with some attributing the rise to tariffs. This trend complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision as it weighs inflationary pressures against a stalled labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after its release, former Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour has given her review of the 2006 film "The Devil Wears Prada," which was based on her leadership style.

She recalled that while many in the fashion industry were worried about her portrayal, she found the film ultimately well-done. The comments come as a sequel to the film is in production, with a planned release in May 2026.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) may be hesitant to renew them. However, financial experts suggest that renewing could be a prudent strategy. Current CD rates remain competitive, often around 4.50%, which is significantly higher than rates for standard savings accounts. Furthermore, many banks may have already factored the anticipated rate cut into their current offers, and locking in a rate now will protect savings from potential future cuts later in the year, ensuring a stable return on investment.

          <p>An Israeli strike in Doha that killed several Hamas political figures has raised questions about a potential military escalation between Israel and Qatar, though analysts believe it is unlikely. While Qatar's emir condemned the attack, experts suggest the response will likely be limited to diplomatic and economic pressure rather than military action. Qatar is a strategic U.S. ally hosting America's largest regional military base, which complicates any potential for direct conflict. The incident underscores a redefinition of regional alliances, but a full rupture is considered improbable due to deep-seated security and economic partnerships.</p>

          <p>Boeing has reached a tentative five-year labor agreement with the union representing over 3,000 of its striking defense workers. The deal, which includes improved wages and a restored signing bonus, will be voted on by members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union this Friday. The employees, who are primarily based in St. Louis and work on F-15 fighter jets and missile systems, have been on strike since the beginning of August. The strike was the first at the facility in nearly 30 years.</p>

          <p>Two significant international incidents in less than 24 hours are posing major challenges to the Trump administration's foreign policy. Israel's airstrike against Hamas leaders in Doha, Qatar, has potentially wrecked the delicate Gaza diplomacy that the White House was pursuing. Simultaneously, a Russian drone incursion deep into the airspace of Poland, a NATO ally, is testing the alliance's resolve and President Trump's commitment. This article argues that both events, orchestrated by leaders Trump considers allies, represent direct affronts to his authority and complicate his stated goals of achieving swift resolutions in both regions.</p>

          <p>A former champion of the British game show "Countdown" stabbed a rival player during a fan club tournament in Blackpool, a court has heard. John Cowen, 31, allegedly ran across the venue with a knife and attacked Thomas Carey, who sustained a wound to his bicep. The court was told that Cowen, a Cambridge maths graduate, had previously expressed feeling "cheated" by other competitors using an app to practice online. A jury, tasked with determining the facts of the case after Cowen was ruled unfit for trial, found that he did commit the assault.</p>

          <p>A new study by the China-Brazil Business Council reveals that imports from China supported 5.2 million jobs in Brazil, more than double the number linked to Brazilian exports to China. The report highlights the profound and growing economic interdependence between the two nations, with bilateral commerce increasing nearly fivefold in two decades. While exports to China are concentrated in a few sectors like soybeans and iron ore, the impact of imports is more broadly distributed. The findings also underscore the economic risks for Brazil in relying so heavily on a single trade partner. (not investment advice)</p>

The leading causes of death remained heart disease, cancer, and unintentional injuries, with deaths from the first two actually increasing slightly compared to 2023.

          <p>President Donald Trump is appealing a federal judge's ruling that temporarily blocked him from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. A U.S. District Court judge had granted an injunction, stating that Cook's reinstatement was in the public interest to maintain the Federal Reserve's independence. The judge also noted that Cook had shown a strong likelihood of proving her removal violated the legal requirement for "cause." Trump announced he was firing Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies.</p>

The stock's nearly 40% jump was fueled by a report showing a massive backlog of contracted revenue, largely from AI-related cloud services. Catz, who has been CEO since 2014 and is one of the world's richest self-made women, now has an estimated net worth of $3.4 billion. She is credited with steering the company's aggressive and successful acquisitions strategy, which has helped propel Oracle to its current record-high valuation.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has ordered the entire population of Gaza City, estimated at up to one million people, to evacuate as its forces prepare for a ground assault on what it calls Hamas's "last important stronghold." Despite ongoing airstrikes, many residents say they either cannot afford to leave or refuse to abandon their land. Israel is directing civilians to humanitarian zones further south and constructing new aid distribution sites, but aid organizations warn these areas are already overcrowded and unequipped to handle such a large influx of people. This article highlights the dire humanitarian situation and defiance of the population.</p>

          <p>Three former senior FBI officials, including former acting Director Brian Driscoll, have filed a lawsuit against FBI Director Kash Patel and the Trump administration, alleging they were fired as part of a "campaign of retribution." The lawsuit claims Patel purged officials who were perceived as disloyal to President Trump or had worked on investigations involving him. According to the complaint, Patel admitted the firings were likely illegal but necessary to protect his own job. The plaintiffs are seeking reinstatement and back pay, arguing their removal was unconstitutional and degraded national security.</p>
