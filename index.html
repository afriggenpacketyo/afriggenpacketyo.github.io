            <p>NBA legend Phil Jackson publicly criticized the league for scheduling games on Catholic holidays, including Easter Sunday. Jackson, an 11-time NBA champion coach, expressed his disapproval in a social media post, highlighting the conflict between sports entertainment and religious observances. He also alluded to his previous criticism of the NBA's embrace of social justice messages, stating that the league was catering to a certain audience, and not being neutral in its public messaging. This stance reflects a broader debate about the intersection of sports, culture, and values.</p>

            <p>China's commerce ministry issued a warning against trade deals that harm its interests, as the Trump administration negotiates trade agreements with other countries. The ministry stated that it respects efforts to resolve trade disputes with the U.S. through consultation but will take "corresponding countermeasures" if deals are struck at China's expense. This comes amid escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, with both countries imposing high tariffs on each other's goods, and China is signaling that it is not afraid to retaliate.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump intensified his pressure on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, labeling him a "major loser" and warning of a potential economic slowdown if interest rates are not lowered immediately. Trump claimed there is virtually no inflation and that costs for energy and other goods are declining. This attack comes as Trump's team explores the legality of firing Powell before his term expires, which analysts warn could trigger a steep sell-off in U.S. equity markets. The President's administration appears to be actively trying to undermine the authority of the central bank.</p>

            <p>Enterprises are increasingly using the yuan for international payments, as the safety and credibility of US assets are questioned, according to a survey by Renmin University's International Monetary Institute. Economists believe that the weakening of the US dollar's dominance, particularly due to policies from the new US administration, has created a favorable opportunity for the yuan's internationalization. The recent volatility in the US Treasury market, driven by concerns over Donald Trump's tariff plan, has further fueled this trend, with global capital not flowing to the US as it has in the past.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump's economic approval rating has dropped to its lowest point, driven by discontent over his handling of tariffs, inflation, and government spending, according to a CNBC survey.

The survey reveals declining support among Democrats, independents, and blue-collar workers. Tariffs are a significant factor in the public's disapproval, with majorities believing they negatively impact workers, inflation, and the economy.</p>
