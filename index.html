          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has rebuked US officials' criticisms of its rare earth export controls, stating the measures are not targeted "against the world." Beijing claims it is approving compliant applications and even considering a "green channel" to expedite the process, accusing Washington of distorting its intentions and creating unnecessary panic. The ministry asserted that the US's own trade restrictions, particularly on semiconductors, are the primary cause of global supply chain instability. This exchange escalates trade tensions following expanded US blacklists and threats of further tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

This marks its first fundraising since 2021, as the company has been cash-flow positive for the last three years and has seen its annualized revenue surpass $1 billion. Upgrade has expanded from personal loans into a broader suite of financial services, including credit cards and BNPL offerings, competing with firms like SoFi and Affirm. Laplanche indicated the new capital will bolster the company's balance sheet and provide employee liquidity ahead of a potential IPO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Tom Frieden, who led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2009 to 2017, warns that the agency is "flying blind" following significant staff layoffs and the dismantling of key departments. In an interview, he explained that the loss of personnel and data collection capabilities severely hampers the nation's ability to track and respond to public health threats. Frieden also lamented the takeover of the agency by "ideologues," which has eroded public trust in critical health information, such as vaccination guidance. He argues that rebuilding this trust will require tangible public health wins and a renewed commitment to scientific evidence.</p>

          <p>A judge in Belfast Crown Court has rejected a defense application to dismiss the case against "Soldier F," a former British paratrooper accused of two murders and five attempted murders on Bloody Sunday in 1972. The defense had argued that key witness evidence was unreliable, but the judge upheld a previous ruling that the statements were admissible. Soldier F, who cannot be named due to an anonymity order, has pleaded not guilty to all charges and will not be testifying in his own defense. The trial, which is being heard by a judge without a jury, will now continue.</p>

          <p>According to a large-scale public questionnaire, a significant portion of the BBC's audience is concerned about political interference in the broadcaster's operations. Director General Tim Davie acknowledged these worries, noting that fewer than half of respondents felt the BBC was effective at being independent from the government. Despite this perception, Davie asserted that the corporation's editorial independence is "absolutely sacrosanct" and that he is rarely contacted by ministers on editorial matters. The results highlight a trust gap that the BBC must address, especially following recent controversies involving government figures and appointments to its board.</p>

          <p>German prosecutors have charged a 21-year-old man, known online as "White Tiger," with murder and over 200 other crimes related to a sadistic online abuse network called "764."

He allegedly targeted and groomed vulnerable children worldwide, manipulating them into producing pornographic content and performing acts of self-harm. The case has raised questions about why German authorities, who were alerted to the suspect's activities in 2021 by a U.S. organization, did not act sooner.</p>

The article explores the complexities of online age verification, which is proving difficult to implement effectively and raises privacy and free speech concerns. While creating a safer internet for kids is a bipartisan goal, the strategy of segmenting the internet by age presents significant technical and civil liberties challenges.</p>

Cuomo, a moderate Democrat, is attempting a political comeback after resigning amid scandal, while Sliwa aims to capture votes from those wary of Mamdani's policies.

Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged an initial €29 million for immediate aid and committed to a much larger, nine-figure sum for rebuilding, though he has ruled out sending German soldiers for any stabilization mission. Germany, alongside Egypt, is set to co-host a donor conference to raise funds for the estimated $53 billion reconstruction cost. The ceasefire has also reignited debate within Germany over the resumption of arms deliveries to Israel, which were partially halted during the conflict.</p>

          <p>Switzerland has reduced its 2026 economic growth forecast from 1.2% to 0.9%, attributing the downgrade to the significant negative impact of punitive U.S. tariffs. Officials stated that the 39% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are a "heavy burden" on the country's export-driven economy, particularly affecting its pharmaceutical and luxury goods sectors. The government warned that Swiss exporters are at a competitive disadvantage, as other U.S. trading partners face lower rates. The rising value of the Swiss franc, a safe-haven currency, is further compounding economic challenges by creating deflationary pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

The law permits a healthcare professional to assist in ending the life of a mentally competent adult suffering from an incurable illness that causes "unbearable suffering," without requiring a terminal diagnosis. This move reinforces Uruguay's reputation as one of the region's most socially liberal nations, having previously legalized recreational marijuana, same-sex marriage, and abortion.

          <p>The British Library has posthumously reissued a reader's card to acclaimed Irish writer Oscar Wilde, 130 years after it was revoked following his 1895 conviction for "gross indecency." At the time, homosexual relationships were criminalized, and Wilde was sentenced to two years of hard labor, leading to the cancellation of his library privileges. The new card, intended to "acknowledge the injustices and immense suffering" he faced, was collected by his grandson, Merlin Holland, on what would have been Wilde's 171st birthday. Holland called the new card a "lovely gesture of forgiveness," celebrating the legacy of the author of works like "The Importance of Being Ernest."</p>

          <p>Despite a ceasefire, the complete disarmament of Hamas in Gaza, a key goal of the US-brokered peace plan, appears unlikely in the short term. Hamas, which still commands around 40,000 fighters, is reasserting control and clashing with rival clans like Doghmush and Abu Shabab, whom it accuses of collaboration with Israel. Analysts suggest that Hamas views its weapons as essential for its political and military survival and will not disarm without significant political concessions. The question of who will manage Gaza's internal security remains unresolved, with proposals for international or Palestinian Authority forces facing potential obstacles from Israel.</p>

Paxos confirmed that there was no security breach and that customer funds remained safe.

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat have collapsed to under $1 after the company finalized a debt-reduction deal that involves issuing up to 326 million new shares. This move, which significantly dilutes the value for existing stockholders, was driven by declining sales as consumer tastes have shifted back towards animal proteins. Once an investor favorite with shares peaking near $235, the company has struggled with profitability and competition, with sales falling from a 2021 peak of $465 million. The company plans a comeback through cost reductions and new product offerings aimed at countering consumer perceptions of its products as overly processed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's immigration enforcement operation in Chicago has created a starkly divided reality in the city. While life continues as normal in many areas, predominantly Latino neighborhoods like Little Village and Albany Park are living under a state of siege, with residents fearful of raids by federal agents. The article contrasts scenes from the Chicago Marathon, where tourists felt safe, with simultaneous events where ICE agents used tear gas on residents protesting detentions. Local business owners report a sharp decline in customers, and teachers note that children are being kept home from school as families fear being targeted by immigration authorities.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the current U.S. government shutdown is merely the most visible part of a wider, year-long effort by the Trump administration to dismantle federal agencies. The author claims that since taking office, the administration has systematically weakened departments responsible for education, public health, and foreign aid through mass firings and budget cuts, disregarding federal law. The article points to the exodus of an estimated 300,000 federal workers and the politicization of scientific bodies like the CDC as evidence of this de facto shutdown. It suggests Democrats are right to hold firm, as the standoff highlights the administration's ongoing degradation of government functions.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a bill designed to fast-track the study of psychedelic drugs for treating conditions like PTSD and depression, a move strongly supported by veterans' advocacy groups. The new law, AB 1103, streamlines the approval process within the state's Research Advisory Panel, allowing FDA-approved studies of Schedule 1 drugs like ibogaine and psilocybin to proceed more quickly. Proponents, including former Navy SEAL Marcus Capone, argue that these therapies show immense promise for veterans suffering from wartime trauma, citing observational studies where participants saw significant reductions in PTSD and depression symptoms after treatment.</p>

Experts emphasize that this is the safest action, as studies from past quakes show that moving or running outside increases the risk of injury from falling debris. The article also provides other preparedness tips, such as securing heavy furniture, retrofitting older homes to prevent foundation collapse, and knowing if you are in a tsunami hazard zone.

          <p>French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu has survived two parliamentary no-confidence votes, narrowly avoiding the collapse of his government. The votes were triggered by President Emmanuel Macron's controversial pension reform, which Lecornu has now promised to suspend until after the 2027 presidential election. This concession helped secure enough support to defeat the motions, but it highlights the fragility of Macron's administration in a deeply divided National Assembly where his centrist alliance lacks a majority. The government now faces debates on a new austerity budget, with unions already calling for protests in November.</p>

          <p>An official report from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has found that the OceanGate Titan submersible imploded due to an "inadequate" engineering process and a failure to conduct proper testing. The investigation concluded that the vessel, which failed during a 2023 dive to the Titanic wreck, did not meet strength and durability requirements, killing all five people aboard. The NTSB also highlighted a poor safety culture at OceanGate, where design concerns were reportedly ignored by CEO Stockton Rush, who was piloting the craft on its final voyage. The report recommends that the U.S. Coast Guard update regulations for passenger-carrying submersibles.</p>

The Office for National Statistics also revised its figure for July downward, from zero growth to a 0.1% contraction, underscoring the economy's sluggish state. Economists predict this weak trend will continue as households and businesses await Chancellor Rachel Reeves' upcoming Budget. There is widespread speculation that the government will need to implement tax increases or spending cuts to meet its self-imposed borrowing rules and stabilize public finances.

          <p>A leaked preview of Germany's "IQB Education Trend 2024" report reveals a decline in student performance in math and science subjects. According to the findings, ninth-grade students are meeting core educational standards less frequently and failing to meet minimum benchmarks more often compared to previous years. In 2024, nearly 9% of ninth graders did not meet the minimum math standard for a lower secondary school certificate, while 34% missed the benchmark for the intermediate level. The negative trend was observed across all four assessed STEM subjects: math, physics, chemistry, and biology, indicating a growing challenge for the German education system.</p>
