            <p>Republican Representative Elise Stefanik is reportedly considering a run for New York governor in 2026, potentially challenging incumbent Governor Kathy Hochul. Stefanik, a prominent ally of Donald Trump, previously withdrew her nomination for UN ambassador to remain in Congress. Her possible candidacy has already drawn criticism from New York State Democrats, who dismiss her as a Trump loyalist. Stefanik has gained prominence for her conservative stances and role in addressing antisemitism on college campuses. The political landscape in New York has been shifting, with voters showing increased support for Republican candidates in recent elections.</p>

            <p>The PGA Tour has suspended golfer Wesley Bryan indefinitely for participating in LIV Golf's "The Duels: Miami," a tournament featuring golf content creators. Bryan, known for his "Bryan Bros" YouTube channel, participated in the event despite potential disciplinary action from the PGA Tour. The suspension has raised questions about the PGA Tour's stance on golfers engaging with LIV Golf-related activities, even those aimed at growing the game. Bryan intends to appeal the suspension, expressing gratitude for his time on the PGA Tour while also supporting the growth of golf through YouTube content creation.</p>

            <p>The escalating trade battle between the United States and China is leading to the fragmentation of global supply chains, as companies seek ways to navigate increasing tariff rates. With tariffs on some Chinese goods reaching triple digits, manufacturers are exploring off-the-books workarounds, including grey routes and proxy factories. This trend raises questions about the extent of decoupling between the two economies. The White House claims China faces tariffs up to 245% on imports to the US due to retaliatory actions.</p>

            <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now serving as Health and Human Services Secretary, has declared autism a rapidly growing "epidemic" and vowed to identify the "environmental toxin" he believes is responsible. He highlighted the increase in autism incidence in the U.S. and contrasted his approach with past research focused on genetic causes. However, researchers and advocates have pushed back, emphasizing the complex interplay of genetic, biological, and environmental factors. Kennedy's past statements linking autism with vaccines have been widely refuted, and his recent remarks have been criticized as stigmatizing and inaccurate.</p>

            <p>Nick Carter of the Backstreet Boys is facing a fourth sexual assault lawsuit, with the accuser, Lauren Penly, alleging that he raped her twice in 2005 and infected her with sexually transmitted diseases, including HPV, which led to a cervical cancer diagnosis. Penly is seeking at least $15,000 in damages for medical expenses and emotional distress. Carter's legal team denies the allegations, stating that he does not recall ever meeting Penly. The lawsuit echoes similar allegations made by other women against Carter in recent years.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is planning to overhaul the Endangered Species Act to make it easier to build in areas inhabited by endangered species. This move aligns with Trump's view that environmental protections impede economic growth. The administration is considering repealing the definition of 'harm,' which would remove habitat protections for endangered species. Environmentalists are concerned about the potential consequences for wildlife and plan to challenge the changes in court.</p>

            <p>The city of Berkeley, California, is implementing new wildfire safety rules that require residents in high-fire-risk areas to remove plants and flammable materials close to their homes. The regulations aim to create defensible space around homes and slow the spread of wildfires, applying to approximately 1,000 homes in the Berkeley Hills. The proposal follows deadly wildfires in Los Angeles and is driven by increasing wildfire frequency and intensity due to climate change. While some residents have expressed concerns, experts emphasize the importance of limiting fuel to prevent the spread of fires.</p>

            <p>California has become the first state to sue the Trump administration over tariffs, challenging the emergency power Trump cited to enact them. Governor Gavin Newsom argues that California has been disproportionately affected by the tariffs, which are 10% on most countries and 145% on China. The lawsuit challenges Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, arguing that such powers rest with the US Congress. The White House has dismissed the lawsuit and stated that it will continue to address the national emergency of persistent trade deficits.</p>
