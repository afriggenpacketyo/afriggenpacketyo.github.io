          <p>Customs and Border Protection officers at the Los Angeles/Long Beach Seaport seized approximately 150,000 illegally imported cigarettes from a couple arriving from Ensenada, Mexico. The cigarettes, stored in 749 cartons across 10 pieces of luggage, were estimated to be worth nearly $60,000. The individuals were unable to produce permits for transporting such a large quantity of tobacco products, leading to the seizure and potential penalties for violating import laws. CBP officials emphasized their commitment to enforcing U.S. import laws and protecting the American public from schemes that evade revenue and potentially harm consumers.</p>

          <p>Forty years after the MOVE bombing in Philadelphia, the city grapples with its legacy as some feel not enough has been done to remember the 11 victims, including five children. On May 13, 1985, Philadelphia police dropped a bomb on a rowhome occupied by MOVE, a Black liberation group, leading to a fire that destroyed dozens of homes. The MOVE Commission report described the decision to bomb the home as "unconscionable", and while there is a historical marker, some, like Mike Africa, believe it doesn't adequately capture the trauma and grief. Linn Washington, a Temple University professor, argues the city needs to address systemic inequities highlighted by the event, and no one was ever criminally charged in connection with the bombing.</p>

          <p>In honor of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, this article explores the history of the Great Wall Film Company, one of the first Chinese American film studios in the U.S., founded in Brooklyn in the 1920s. Frustrated by demeaning portrayals of Chinese people in early Hollywood films, Harold Lee and Lee Kee Do established the studio to create more authentic representations. The studio later moved to Shanghai, producing about two dozen films, but eventually closed due to the Great Depression; however, the Lee family's impact continued with the New York Chinese Film Exchange, and their descendants remain active in the film industry today.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades. The brothers, convicted of the 1989 killings of their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez, claimed they acted in self-defense due to years of alleged abuse. The decision by Judge Michael Jesic to strike the special circumstance of the original sentence was praised by their attorney, Mark Geragos, who believes the criminal justice system has evolved. Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposed the resentencing but acknowledged the significant implications of the decision, and the state parole board is set to conduct separate hearings in June before sending final reports to the governor.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers in Missouri have approved a new referendum aimed at repealing an abortion-rights amendment that voters approved last year. The proposed constitutional amendment would ban most abortions, with exceptions only for rape, incest, medical emergencies, or fetal anomalies up to 12 weeks of pregnancy. The measure, which passed the Republican-led House and Senate, will go back to voters in November 2026, or sooner if the governor calls a special election. This action comes after Missouri voters narrowly approved an amendment in November guaranteeing a right to abortion until fetal viability.</p>

          <p>A recent phenomenon of birds falling dead in a Bay Area neighborhood, initially reported as 'exploding' birds, has been investigated by authorities. Residents suspected electrocution from power lines, but PG&E found the birds were not electrocuted. The Department of Fish and Wildlife determined the injuries were consistent with trauma possibly caused by a pellet gun, BB gun, or slingshot. The investigation into the bird deaths is ongoing, and officials suspect foul play.</p>

          <p>A British maritime authority report found that last year’s Bayesian superyacht tragedy, which killed seven, was likely caused by intense wind gusts and a design flaw involving its towering single mast. The New York Times article explains that the mast made the boat vulnerable to capsizing in high winds, and a deckhand’s delay in alerting the captain exacerbated the situation. The report noted that the boat’s stability was questionable, with an angle of vanishing stability of 70.6 degrees, and a fuller picture will emerge after the Bayesian is lifted from its resting place off the coast of Sicily.</p>

          <p>Nearly half a million people in Gaza face starvation due to a ten-week Israeli blockade halting humanitarian aid. The Israeli government claims to be pressuring Hamas to release hostages, but the United Nations says hundreds of truckloads of life-saving supplies are waiting at the border. Inside Gaza, food is scarce, and humanitarian groups have exhausted basic staples. Everyday Palestinians are grinding up pasta and lentils to make flour for bread, with wheat flour selling for $10 a pound, highlighting the dire conditions and lack of access to essential resources.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin will not be attending peace talks on the war in Ukraine in Istanbul on Thursday, despite Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's call for him to attend. Russia's delegation will instead be headed by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky, with Putin and Zelensky not having met in person since December 2019. The article also mentions that Donald Trump floated the possibility of joining the meeting himself if Putin did, and that the US is expected to send a high-level delegation to the talks.</p>
