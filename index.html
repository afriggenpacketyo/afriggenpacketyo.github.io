          <p>Chinese autonomous-driving company Pony.ai announced its plans to expand its robotaxi services globally, citing lower production costs due to China's automotive industry leadership. Pony.ai's robotaxis are reportedly 20-30% cheaper than Waymo's, according to CEO James Peng, who highlighted the company's integrated supply chain and ecosystem. The company unveiled its seventh-generation autonomous-driving system and three robotaxi models developed with Toyota, BAIC Group, and GAC, with mass production slated to begin in Q3 of this year, with a 70% reduction in production costs compared to previous models.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly has initiated legal action against four telehealth companies—Mochi Health, Fella Health, Willow Health, and Henry Meds—for allegedly selling compounded versions of its weight loss drug Zepbound and diabetes treatment Mounjaro. Lilly accuses these sites of misleading consumers with "untested, unapproved drugs" and diverting them from Lilly's FDA-approved medications. The company claims the telehealth providers are mass-marketing slightly altered versions of Lilly's drugs to circumvent FDA regulations, including selling unstudied formulations like oral tablets and drops.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A hidden religious divide is emerging in American politics, particularly among young, white men who are increasingly drawn to conservative politics and traditional religions like Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. This trend is driven by a search for community and answers, with many converts disillusioned by modern values such as feminism and racial equality. These converts often seek a return to traditionalism, combining conservative views on gender and sexuality with concerns about immigration and multiculturalism. This has led to a "cradle" vs. "convert" divide within these religious communities, accelerating the political polarization of American religion.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Star Wars franchise suggests that its focus on "chosen one" heroes, particularly the revelation of Darth Vader as Luke Skywalker's father, has influenced pop culture's emphasis on inherited destiny rather than egalitarian rebellion. The article contrasts this with the original Star Wars film's theme of ordinary rebels challenging a dictator, arguing that waiting for a messiah is less inspirational than collective action. The author suggests that the series' later emphasis on saviors promotes a passive attitude toward societal change.</p>

Despite admitting to giving Ogorodnikova an FBI document, Miller argued he was acting as a double agent. His trial exposed questions about the FBI's decision to retain an agent widely considered incompetent, and highlighted his vulnerability to enemy overtures.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that almost half of Americans are exposed to unsafe levels of air pollutants, a figure that has increased from the previous year.
