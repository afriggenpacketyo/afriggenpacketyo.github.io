          <p>Despite Russia and Iran's strategic partnership, the Kremlin is unlikely to provide military aid to Iran in its conflict with Israel, even after ratifying the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. While Putin has publicly condemned Israel's actions and expressed condolences to Iran, analysts believe Russia prefers to avoid uncontrollable chaos in the Middle East. The treaty does not establish a mutual defense pact, and Russia is reportedly trying to improve relations with Washington. Experts suggest Putin may be sincere in offering to mediate between Iran and its opponents, possibly serving as a communication channel. </p>

          <p>President Trump stated he would not contact Minnesota Governor Tim Walz following the targeted shootings of two state lawmakers, one of whom died, stating it would be a "waste of time" due to his perception of Walz as "whacked out." Trump acknowledged the tragedy but expressed his low opinion of the Democratic governor, who had previously criticized Trump during the 2024 campaign. Vice President JD Vance, however, contacted Walz to express appreciation for law enforcement coordination. Vance Boelter faces charges in connection with the shootings, which claimed the life of Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, while wounding state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette. The article highlights the political divide influencing even responses to tragedies. </p>

Ministers are urging France to tighten border security, while the Labour government has scrapped the previous administration's plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda.

          <p>The domestic deployment of active-duty U.S. military, as seen recently in Los Angeles, is rare and fraught with risk. The article draws parallels to the period from 1957 to 1968, when military forces patrolled U.S. soil on eight separate occasions, enforcing desegregation orders and quelling riots. While those deployments resulted in few fatalities, the norms that fostered such restraint have weakened today. The current deployment differs from past practices, as marines are deployed without accompanying military police trained in crowd control, raising concerns about potential escalation. </p>

          <p>The baby of a brain-dead woman in Georgia has been delivered via caesarean section, according to the woman's mother, April Newkirk. The woman, a 31-year-old nurse, was declared brain-dead after suffering blood clots in her brain, prompting a legal battle over whether to keep her on life support due to Georgia's abortion laws. The baby, weighing 1lb 13oz, is in the neonatal intensive care unit and is expected to be okay. The woman's mother expressed her grief and frustration that the decision to keep her daughter on life support was not left to the family. </p>

Choosing shorter-term CDs can provide better rates, while longer-term CDs offer protection against future rate drops. It's crucial to understand the risks, such as early withdrawal penalties, and to have an emergency fund available. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One parent, Caron Morse, decided to get her daughter a landline instead of a smartphone, aiming to provide independence without the downsides of social media and excessive screen time. Morse encouraged other families in her neighborhood to do the same, creating a "retro bubble" where kids can easily call friends. The landline has helped children become better listeners and more empathetic communicators. While not a perfect solution, it provides an alternative to smartphones and allows parents to postpone the introduction of smartphones for as long as possible. </p>
