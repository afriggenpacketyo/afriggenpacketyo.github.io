The lawmakers call for increased interagency cooperation, expanded inspections, and stronger law enforcement efforts against straw purchases and gun dealers.

These changes signal a departure from the dream of broad-scale debt relief and friendlier student loans, creating a challenging landscape for students and borrowers.
