          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 22:37:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to hold its policy interest rate steady at 2.5%, choosing to monitor the effects of recent government measures aimed at cooling Seoul's overheated housing market. This decision prioritizes financial stability over growth concerns, as authorities grapple with a significant acceleration in housing prices and rapidly expanding household debt. The central bank noted that the unique "jeonse" rental deposit system contributes to high household debt levels, which can weaken consumer spending power. This policy hold comes after a rate cut in May, but rising risks in the housing sector now take precedence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Contrasting Outcomes in New Mexico and Texas Floods Highlight Importance of Preparedness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 22:34:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent major floods in New Mexico and Texas yielded starkly different results, underscoring the impact of community preparedness. In Ruidoso, New Mexico, where wildfires had previously increased flood risks, officials and residents were prepared, resulting in three fatalities despite the deluge. Conversely, a few days earlier in Texas, the ferocity of the flooding caught officials by surprise, leading to at least 119 deaths. Experts note that recent experience with natural disasters often informs a community's response, as seen in Ruidoso, which was aware of its vulnerability due to post-wildfire "burn scars" that repel water.</p>

          <p>President Trump has named Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy as the temporary head of NASA, following the withdrawal of his previous nominee, Jared Isaacman. The change in leadership comes after the President cited Isaacman's past political donations to Democrats and his professional relationship with Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX holds major NASA contracts. Duffy's appointment places another administration official in a dual-hatted role during a critical period for the space agency, which is focused on its lunar and Martian exploration programs. The move also occurred amid a public disagreement between Trump and Musk over a major spending bill.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will impose a 50% tariff on copper imports, effective August 1, following a national security assessment. President Trump stated the metal is critical for numerous defense and technology applications, including semiconductors, military hardware, and data centers. The announcement caused a significant spike in U.S. copper prices, extending a rally from the previous day. This move is part of a broader strategy to protect domestic industries, with experts noting it aligns with similar tariffs on steel and aluminum aimed at reshoring critical production.

This ambiguity is a direct blow to the strategy of using countries in the ASEAN region to continue exporting goods to the American market.

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose a 50% tariff on copper imports is expected to raise costs for a wide array of consumer goods, according to economists and industry experts. Copper is a crucial component in electrical wiring, plumbing, appliances, electronics, and electric vehicles, meaning the tariff could trigger inflation and higher prices for home repairs and cars. The administration argues the tariff is necessary for national security and to incentivize domestic production of the vital metal. However, analysts warn that ramping up U.S. copper production would be a multi-year process, leaving consumers to bear the immediate cost increases. (not investment advice)</p>

The incident in Butler, Pennsylvania, resulted in the death of a firefighter and prompted an independent review that found the Secret Service had become "complacent and static."

          <p>The European Union has expressed hope for finalizing an outline of a trade deal with the United States within days, even as the Trump administration escalates its global trade war. President Trump recently announced a 50% tariff on copper and has threatened new levies on numerous countries, including a 50% tariff on Brazil and duties on six other nations. EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic stated that good progress has been made on a framework agreement, aiming for a conclusion before the extended August 1 deadline. This diplomatic push occurs against a backdrop of increasing economic uncertainty caused by the U.S. tariff strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During the deadly flash floods in Kerr County, Texas, some emergency alerts were reportedly delayed as dispatchers waited for supervisory approval, according to a former county official and radio traffic recordings. The county's CodeRED alert system, designed to warn residents of imminent danger, was not activated until well after the flooding began, despite a firefighter's request. While the National Weather Service issued 22 warnings, including a "PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION" alert, many residents said they received no local warnings. The delay raises serious questions about the effectiveness of the local emergency response protocol during the disaster.</p>

          <p>The United States has confirmed 1,288 measles cases so far this year, marking the highest number of infections recorded in 33 years and surpassing the total from the 2019 outbreak.

Health experts attribute the surge to declining MMR vaccination rates, which have fallen below the 95% threshold required for herd immunity in many areas. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to recommend the MMR vaccine as the most effective protection against the highly contagious virus.</p>

In an unsigned opinion, the high court stated the government was likely to succeed in its argument that the executive order was lawful.

The proposed three-year contract includes 3% annual raises and a one-time bonus, a figure significantly lower than the union's initial demands. First-term Mayor Cherelle Parker stood firm during negotiations, insisting that any deal must be fiscally responsible for the city, and workers began returning to their jobs immediately.</p>
