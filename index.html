          <p>The leaders of the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) have regained control of their headquarters following a judge's ruling that deemed the previous Trump administration's takeover as unlawful. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell's decision invalidated the actions of DOGE, a cost-cutting team, who had seized the building in March after President Trump declared USIP "unnecessary" and terminated its leadership. Acting President George Moose emphasized the importance of USIP as a symbol of American peacemaking efforts, while the Justice Department has not yet indicated plans to appeal the ruling. USIP, established 41 years ago, focuses on providing analysis and resources for global peace initiatives and conflict resolution. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has strongly criticized the Trump administration for violating an order that prevented officials from deporting individuals to countries not their own without sufficient notice. Lawyers for the migrants stated they were told they were being sent to South Sudan, but the flight landed in Djibouti. Judge Brian E. Murphy expressed concern over the lack of due process and indicated potential criminal contempt penalties. The article details the flight's path from Texas to Djibouti and includes an interactive map, while also describing the deportees as citizens of Cuba, Laos, Mexico, South Sudan, Burma, and Vietnam, convicted of serious crimes.</p>

          <p>Dominic Garcia, a 23-year-old Utah man, has been arrested on multiple felony charges for allegedly holding his pregnant girlfriend and her family hostage for six months by falsely claiming they were being pursued by a cartel. Garcia reportedly moved in with the family in December and soon after asserted his family had ties to a dangerous cartel, forcing the family to comply with his demands under threat of death. He allegedly controlled their movements, checked their phones, and subjected them to extreme physical exercises.

          <p>Following a tornado that killed five people in St. Louis, Mayor Cara Spencer has placed the city’s emergency manager on administrative leave due to the failure to activate tornado warning sirens. The city's emergency management agency did not sound the alarms, and a backup system operated by the Fire Department was broken. The National Weather Service issued a tornado warning nine minutes before the tornado was confirmed, and the emergency manager was not at the office where the activation button was located.

          <p>David Sacks, President Trump's crypto and AI advisor, believes the stablecoin legislation moving through the Senate will garner bipartisan support and unlock trillions of dollars for U.S. Treasuries. Sacks stated that providing legal clarity for the already $200 billion stablecoin market could rapidly increase demand for Treasuries. The GENIUS Act, regulating stablecoins, passed a key Senate procedural vote, indicating sufficient support to avoid a filibuster. While Sacks expects the bill to pass, he did not address concerns about potential conflicts of interest for the president and his family.</p>

          <p>Republicans are struggling to unite behind President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, as deep divisions emerge between the party's conservative wing and more moderate members. Conservatives seek deeper spending cuts, while swing-district Republicans fear the impact on their constituents, and lawmakers from New York and California demand a more generous deduction for state and local taxes (SALT). Despite Trump's plea for unity, some holdouts remain, and Democrats are united in opposition, criticizing the bill as favoring the rich.

          <p>Researchers are proposing a novel approach to combat malaria by treating mosquitoes with drugs to clear their infection, preventing them from spreading the disease. A team at Harvard University has identified a drug combination that can effectively eliminate malaria parasites from mosquitoes when absorbed through their legs. The long-term goal is to coat bed nets with this drug cocktail, offering a new method to combat malaria as mosquitoes develop resistance to existing insecticides. This strategy focuses on curing mosquitoes rather than killing them, aiming to disrupt the malaria transmission cycle.</p>

They emphasize that Whites remain economically strong in South Africa, and racial motives are not generally a factor in the country's high crime rate.

          <p>Researchers are advocating for the UK's NHS to provide additional scans to women with very dense breasts to improve cancer detection rates and save lives. A study led by Cambridge University found that alternative scanning methods, such as enhanced mammograms and fast MRI scans, could significantly increase cancer detection compared to traditional mammograms in women with dense breasts. These alternative techniques use injections to enhance blood vessel visibility, making tumors easier to spot. The study estimates that implementing these methods could identify 3,500 extra cancers per year and potentially save 700 lives.</p>

The future of the series hinges on the number of automatic qualifiers guaranteed to the Big Ten, with USC officials wary of committing long-term without assurances they won't be penalized for scheduling a marquee nonconference matchup. Notre Dame seeks a long-term extension, but USC is hesitant due to Big Ten travel demands and potential annual matchups with the SEC. The article suggests the decision rests with USC's athletic director.</p>

          <p>Documents obtained by The New York Times reveal a fierce debate among officials in the State, Justice, and Homeland Security Departments over the deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, despite a judge's order prohibiting it. D.H.S. officials considered portraying Mr. Abrego Garcia as an MS-13 leader, even without evidence, and sought to downplay the danger he might face in a Salvadoran prison. A Justice Department lawyer, Erez Reuveni, who advocated for bringing Mr. Abrego Garcia back to the U.S., was fired. The case has become a major test of President Trump's mass deportation effort.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with conservative holdouts to the budget package, aiming to secure its passage despite opposition from both fiscal conservatives and blue-state Republicans. House Speaker Mike Johnson remains committed to moving forward with the bill, which faces hurdles in the Rules Committee before a floor vote. Conservatives are pushing for deeper spending cuts and changes to Medicaid, while blue-state Republicans seek revisions to the state and local tax deduction (SALT). Democrats are expected to oppose the bill, leaving Johnson with little room for defections within his own party.</p>

          <p>States and cities are facing hurricane and wildfire seasons with uncertainty as the Trump administration's efforts to downsize the government threaten essential functions related to disaster preparedness and response. Significant cuts at FEMA and NOAA, along with the Department of Government Efficiency's cost-cutting measures, are causing concerns about less accurate weather forecasts, reduced coordination, and less financial aid. Local officials fear that they will have to rely less on federal assistance and devote more resources to their own firefighting efforts. The administration's actions have raised alarms about the country's ability to effectively respond to and recover from natural disasters.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced its withdrawal from federal oversight plans for the Minneapolis Police Department, drawing dismay from officials and residents. The announcement came during the week of the five-year anniversary of George Floyd's killing, which many in the city found insensitive. The agreement included policies aimed at overhauling police training, monitoring, and accountability, but the Justice Department now believes such agreements are ineffectual. Minneapolis officials oppose the withdrawal and remain committed to the changes outlined in the agreement.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has ended efforts to push for reform in Minneapolis, Louisville, and several other cities, raising questions about the effectiveness of federal involvement in policing. Consent decrees, agreements that place police departments under strict federal oversight, are seen as the government's most powerful tool for overhauling troubled departments. While some argue that these agreements are too broad and restrictive, others believe they bring necessary change and restore trust in the police. The Trump administration has been critical of consent decrees, arguing they are based on unrealistic expectations and micromanage local police departments.</p>

While Democrats view the bill as a positive step, some abortion-rights allies have raised doubts about its potential impact.
