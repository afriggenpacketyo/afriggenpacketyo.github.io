        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the article, Ukrainian and Russian delegations have arrived in Turkey for potential talks aimed at ending the war, but there was initial confusion about whether the meeting would even occur. Reporters gathered outside Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul, the site of previous talks in March 2022, but it remained unclear if negotiations would proceed or if the Ukrainian delegation was even present in the city. The article highlights the gamesmanship and uncertainty that has characterized the lead-up to these potential discussions, with no confirmation on President Putin's attendance. The situation is further complicated by ongoing tensions and mistrust between the two sides, making the prospect of a breakthrough uncertain.</p>

          <p>The article reports that the Eurovision Song Contest in Basel is facing political tensions, particularly due to Israel's participation. Protests involving Palestinian flags and accusations of complicity in genocide occurred during the opening ceremony, with some booing the Israeli artist. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) has implemented a code of conduct to prevent political statements, but some former participants and musicians have called for Israel's exclusion, citing double standards compared to Russia's ban in 2022. Other controversies include complaints about an Estonian rapper's song and adjustments to staging and song titles due to sexual connotations, all amid the usual speculation about front-runners and potential winners.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is considering increasing the release of stockpiled rice to about 600,000 tons in an effort to control rising rice prices, which have been near record highs due to a supply shortfall. The government plans to release an additional 300,000 tons over three months through July, supplementing the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. This action would reduce the government's rice reserves to approximately 300,000 tons, raising concerns about the ability to respond to future poor harvests or natural disasters. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries is also considering relaxing buyback requirements for distributors to encourage greater participation in auctions.</p>

          <p>According to the article, Ukrainian and Russian representatives are meeting in Istanbul for the first time since the early weeks of the conflict. However, neither President Putin nor President Trump will be attending, despite Trump's efforts to broker a ceasefire. The return to Istanbul is symbolic, as it was the site of previous diplomatic efforts, including the Istanbul CommuniquÃ© in March 2022. While Trump hopes for progress, analysts remain skeptical of an immediate breakthrough, with both sides maneuvering to avoid blame for potential failures in the talks. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that there is no military solution to the conflict and that a diplomatic resolution is necessary.</p>

Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted that the UK economy grew faster than the US, Canada, France, Italy, and Germany during this period.

The Kosovar Association of the Deaf (KAD) emphasizes the importance of sign language, but misconceptions and stigma prevent many parents from embracing it.

Critics argue that this gift highlights Trump's global pursuit of wealth and potential conflicts of interest. The article points out the hypocrisy of Trump, who has previously criticized Qatar for funding terrorist groups, accepting such a lavish gift. The backlash has prompted questions from both Republicans and Democrats, with many noting the potential for corruption and self-enrichment through the presidency.

          <p>Three Maori MPs in New Zealand are facing suspension from parliament for performing a protest haka during a parliamentary session last year. The parliamentary committee ruled that the haka could have "intimidated" other lawmakers. The MPs were protesting a controversial bill to redefine the country's founding treaty. The Maori Party has criticized the recommendations as a "warning shot to all of us to fall in line". Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, who is Maori, has called the trio "out-of-control MPs who flout the rules and intimidate others with outrageous hakas".</p>

Experts explain that nature provides a "softer" form of attention that requires fewer mental resources, allowing the brain to restore and promoting emotional well-being, which can positively impact physical recovery.</p>

          <p>A medieval text held in Harvard Law School's library for 80 years, once believed to be a copy, has been identified as one of seven original versions of the Magna Carta dating from 1300. Two British academics discovered the manuscript, purchased for $27.50 after World War II, is an authentic 1300 version issued by King Edward I. The document, which binds rulers to act within the law, resurfaced at a time when Harvard faces pressure from the Trump administration. Researchers authenticated the text using ultraviolet light and spectral imaging, comparing it with six other known originals from 1300.</p>

          <p>The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), a group of 21 economies including the U.S. and China, has warned of a potential sharp slowdown in their collective growth due to trade tensions and policy uncertainty. APEC forecasts growth to drop to 2.6% in 2025, down from 3.6% in the prior year. The uncertainty is weighing on business confidence, causing firms to delay investments. Restoring confidence in trade requires easing tensions, strengthening supply chain resilience, and improving transparency of trade rules, according to APEC officials.</p>

          <p>The Alabama Legislature has approved legislation providing enhanced legal protections for police officers, setting legal standards for the use of force and providing for an immunity hearing. Republicans argue the bill provides a clear legal framework for officers, while Democrats fear it could embolden misconduct and lead to more killings of Black people. The bill allows for an immunity hearing where a judge will decide if a case can proceed based on whether the officer acted recklessly outside the scope of law enforcement duties. The governor has stated she will sign the bill into law.</p>

          <p>The article discusses Denmark's economic growth, which has been driven by a surge in pharmaceutical exports, particularly from Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications. While the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Denmark's economic growth to moderate in the coming years, it notes that the country is largely protected from potential U.S. tariffs on pharmaceutical imports. This is because Danish drugmakers rely on a "merchanting and processing" system where most of the value is in intellectual property, and manufacturing is contracted to other countries. The IMF predicts medium-term growth of around 1.5% due to a maturing pharmaceutical sector and a declining working-age population.</p>

          <p>A version of the Magna Carta held by Harvard University has been confirmed as an original from 1300, rather than a copy. The "Great Charter" is seen as a precursor to constitutions and legal systems worldwide.

The discovery comes as Harvard University has been barred from receiving new federal grants by the Trump administration, which many critics see as violating some of the key principles enshrined in the Magna Carta.</p>

          <p>Argentina's President Javier Milei has issued a decree curbing immigration to the country, tightening restrictions on citizenship and making it easier to deport migrants. The move has drawn comparisons to the immigration policies of the Trump administration. The decree requires immigrants to spend two uninterrupted years in Argentina or make a significant financial investment to secure citizenship. It also mandates that all travelers to the country hold health insurance and allows universities to introduce fees for foreign studies. Critics worry that the new rules will challenge Argentina's tradition of openness to immigrants.</p>

This is a recurring theme, with Betts consistently making teams regret their decision to avoid pitching to Ohtani. The Athletics' decision to intentionally walk Ohtani to face Betts backfired as Betts delivered a clutch hit. Manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the logic behind the strategy but noted that Betts seems to thrive when taking things personally.
