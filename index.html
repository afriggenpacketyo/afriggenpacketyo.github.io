        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Illinois and Chicago have filed a lawsuit to prevent the federal government from deploying the National Guard, arguing that it violates the Posse Comitatus Act and targets the state unfairly because its leadership is not in favor with the president. The lawsuit claims there is no insurrection or rebellion in Illinois that justifies federal intervention, and accuses the president of using Democratic-led cities as training grounds for the military. The complaint cites the president's social media posts about sending militarized law enforcement to Chicago, including a post referencing deportations. The state is seeking a court order to block any state's National Guard from being federalized and deployed to Illinois. The lawsuit raises concerns about the erosion of the principle separating the military from domestic affairs, citing the potential threat to the American people. The tone of the article is neutral, focusing on the legal arguments and the context of the lawsuit. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nike's prices have risen across core apparel and footwear categories as CEO Elliott Hill approaches his one-year turnaround plan amidst rising tariffs. Data analysis shows footwear prices increased by 17%, apparel by 14%, and equipment by 18% from September 2024 to September 2025. Nike's CFO cited tariffs as a headwind, expecting a $1.5 billion impact and a 1.2 percentage point hit to gross margin in fiscal year 2026. The company has been cutting down on promotions as part of the turnaround plan, aiming for a full-price model in its online business, though organic traffic continues to decline. The article suggests that Nike is selectively raising prices, protecting its strongest products while assessing where higher prices can be sustained without demand loss. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has challenged Speaker Mike Johnson to a live, primetime debate on the government shutdown, but Johnson dismissed the request as a desperate attempt for attention. Jeffries argued that a debate would provide transparency given the Republican refusal to negotiate a bipartisan agreement. Johnson countered that lawmakers had already debated on the House floor before passing a Republican stopgap funding measure. The House is currently out of session this week, and the shutdown continues with no resolution in sight. The article frames the situation as a political standoff with both sides digging in. </p>

          <h2>Mortgage Interest Rate Forecast for October 2025</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts predict little change in mortgage interest rates for October 2025, despite a previous rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September. Mortgage rates tend to follow the 10-year Treasury yield rather than the federal funds rate, so anticipation of future rate cuts may already be factored in. Economic data, including inflation and employment figures, also influence mortgage rates, but delays due to a government shutdown make it difficult to assess current trends. Experts advise prospective homebuyers to consider their individual goals and situations when deciding whether to lock in a rate now or wait for further drops. The article provides context by discussing the various factors that influence mortgage interest rates and the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

Officers responding to the scene discovered the man, believed to be in his 30s or 40s, with injuries apparently caused by a dog. Miami-Dade Animal Services confiscated 11 dogs from the property, though it remains unclear whether they were involved in the man's death. The medical examiner's office will determine the cause of death and whether the dog-related injuries occurred before or after the man's death. The investigation is ongoing. </p>

For higher earners, there's an itemized charitable deduction floor and a cap on the benefit for those in the top 37% income tax bracket, also beginning in 2026.

          <p>Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones anticipates a significant rally in stock prices before the bull market reaches its peak. He compares today's market to the lead-up to the dotcom bubble burst in 1999, noting dramatic rallies in technology shares and heightened speculative behavior. Jones highlights the difference between now and 1999 is the U.S. fiscal and monetary policy, with the Federal Reserve having just begun a new easing cycle, and the U.S. running a 6% budget deficit. He recommends owning a combination of gold, cryptocurrencies, and Nasdaq tech stocks to capitalize on the rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) convicted former militia leader Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman for war crimes committed during the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region over two decades ago. Abd-Al-Rahman, a senior commander in the Janjaweed militias, was found guilty on 27 counts, including sexual assault, murder, and persecution. The Janjaweed militias, loyal to then-President Omar al-Bashir, played a major role in atrocities during the government's scorched-earth campaign against the region's ethnic central and sub-Saharan African community. Abd-Al-Rahman faces a maximum penalty of life in prison. </p>

          <p>Venezuela's National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez said that Washington had been warned of a "false flag operation" by "extremist sectors of the local Venezuelan right" to plant explosives at the U.S. Embassy in Caracas.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court declined to revive a controversial Missouri gun law that bans police from enforcing some federal firearm laws. Lower courts found the 2019 law violated the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The measure imposed fines on officers who knowingly enforced federal laws lacking an equivalent state law. The conflict disrupted a law-enforcement partnership dedicated to combatting violent crime after the state crime lab refused to process evidence for federal firearms prosecutions. </p>

          <p>A top Vatican cardinal sharply criticized Israel's "ongoing massacre" in Gaza, calling it one of the Catholic Church's strongest condemnations of Israel's war against Hamas. Cardinal Pietro Parolin urged Hamas to release remaining hostages and stated that legitimate defense must respect proportionality. He said the war waged by the Israeli army disregards the fact that it is targeting a largely defenceless population. Parolin also questioned the legitimacy of continuing to supply weapons used against civilians. </p>

A preliminary design shared by a U.S. Treasurer includes Trump's profile on one side and a depiction of him with a U.S. flag on the other. While federal law prohibits issuing currency with the image of a living president, there may be more leeway with commemorative coins.
