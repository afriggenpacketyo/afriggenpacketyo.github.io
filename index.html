          <p>A Mexican Navy sailing ship, the CuauhtÃ©moc, on a goodwill tour, collided with the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday night, resulting in the deaths of two crew members and injuries to at least 22 others. The ship, carrying 277 people, reportedly lost power before the crash, causing it to drift into the bridge. The incident prompted a response from emergency services, and the National Transportation Safety Board is launching a full investigation to determine the cause of the accident, with authorities stating that the pilot assigned to navigate the ship experienced mechanical issues. The ship was supposed to head south to Iceland but was apparently headed in the wrong direction when it crashed.</p>
