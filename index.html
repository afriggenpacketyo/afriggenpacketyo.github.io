          <p>Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett defended the court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, stating the ruling did not outlaw abortion but returned the issue to the states' democratic processes. In her first televised interview since joining the court, she also addressed criticism that the conservative majority is politically motivated, asserting that the court's role is to decide legal questions without an agenda. Barrett spoke about personal threats she and her family have faced, highlighting the personal costs and need for a "stiff spine" in public service to withstand criticism from all sides.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a new record high, surpassing $3,600 per ounce, driven by investors seeking safe-haven assets amidst global economic uncertainty. Despite the significant climb of over 38% since the start of the year, some financial analysts believe there is still room for growth. Major investment banks like Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan forecast prices could reach $4,000 by mid-2026, citing factors like a weakening labor market and potential interest rate cuts. The article suggests gold remains a strategic asset for portfolio diversification and protection against market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has confirmed it is reviewing the immigration status of former Boston City Councilor Tania Fernandes Anderson, who previously stated she had been "undocumented." This probe follows her recent sentencing in a corruption case where she pleaded guilty to a kickback scheme involving a city hall staff member. The investigation comes as the Trump administration increases scrutiny of Boston's sanctuary city policies. Anderson, the first African immigrant elected to the council, was sentenced for a breach of public trust after admitting to the financial misconduct.</p>

The half marathon route runs through Newcastle and along the River Tyne, a region with a fierce football rivalry with Sunderland. Approximately 60,000 runners participated in the event and received the incorrect memorabilia. In a lighthearted statement, the Great Run Company called the items unique keepsakes and humorously promised to "brush up on our geography" for the next event, acknowledging the error was missed by many during the design approval process.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the Department of Education will soon release new guidance to protect the right to prayer in public schools, aiming to provide "total protection." Speaking at the Bible Museum, he criticized what he described as anti-religious propaganda in schools and the punishment of students for their beliefs. The president did not specify the details of the new guidance but framed the initiative as part of a broader effort to strengthen religious liberty. During the event, Trump also highlighted his administration's support for school choice and donated his family Bible to the museum.</p>

          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts has granted the Trump administration's request for an interim stay, allowing the president to remove Federal Trade Commission member Rebecca Kelly Slaughter for the time being. A lower court had previously blocked the firing, ruling it unlawful, but the administration sought emergency relief from the Supreme Court. The case centers on whether the president has the authority to remove members of independent agencies without cause, challenging a long-standing legal precedent. This decision follows similar rulings where the court has permitted Trump to remove appointees at other independent federal commissions.</p>

          <p>Shares of the online brokerage Robinhood surged more than 14% following the announcement that it will be added to the S&P 500 index. S&P Global confirmed that Robinhood will replace Caesars Entertainment in the benchmark U.S. market index before trading begins on September 22. Inclusion in the S&P 500 is highly sought after by companies as it often triggers significant stock purchases from passive index funds that track the index. After months of speculation, the addition marks a major milestone for the company, which has seen its stock price increase by over 210% year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Markus Söder, the State Premier of Bavaria, has issued a stark warning that the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party could destroy the country. Speaking at a folk festival, Söder accused the AfD of aiming to divide and weaken Germany and to establish a different form of democracy. His comments came as AfD co-leader Tino Chrupalla, also speaking at the event, expressed confidence that his party would win the 2029 federal election. The AfD has gained significant support by capitalizing on concerns over migration, becoming the largest opposition party in the German parliament.</p>

This move positions SpaceX to potentially launch its own mobile services, building on its existing partnership with T-Mobile.

          <p>The first-ever theatrical release of Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical "Hamilton" is being interpreted as a significant cultural counterpoint to the current political climate. This article argues that the film's diverse casting and its celebration of an immigrant's story offer a powerful rebuke to anti-immigrant and anti-DEI rhetoric. The show's famous line, "Immigrants, we get the job done," resonates strongly amid ongoing immigration debates and government efforts to scale back diversity initiatives. The big-screen adaptation amplifies the musical's message of inclusivity, making its story of America's founding accessible to a broader audience at a critical time.</p>

This article outlines several relief options available for federal student loan borrowers, such as enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan, which can lower monthly bills, sometimes to zero. Another option is applying for an Unemployment Deferment or Economic Hardship Deferment to temporarily pause payments, though interest may still accrue on some loans. Experts advise borrowers to proactively contact their loan servicers to explore these options and avoid default.</p>

          <p>Russia has significantly intensified its aerial strikes on Ukraine, recently launching the largest single-day assault of the war with over 800 drones and 13 missiles. This escalation, which began around June, is seen by analysts as a strategic shift to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses and induce panic among the civilian population. Experts suggest Russia is diversifying its attacks to be more cost-effective while targeting critical infrastructure and military enlistment offices to undermine Ukraine's war effort. The consistent increase in drone and missile attacks indicates that a ceasefire is unlikely in the near future.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates a growing partisan divide in American attitudes toward economic systems, with Democrats now viewing socialism more favorably than capitalism. While U.S. adults overall still prefer capitalism, only 42% of Democrats hold a positive view of it, compared to 66% who view socialism positively. This trend, developing over the past 15 years, reflects a decline in capitalism's popularity among younger Democrats and independents. The shift highlights internal tensions within the Democratic party as figures like Senator Bernie Sanders have brought criticisms of capitalism and democratic socialist ideas into the mainstream political discourse.</p>
