          <p>Language learning company Duolingo saw its stock price increase by over 30% after significantly raising its full-year revenue and bookings forecast. The company attributes this strong performance to a 40% jump in daily active users, now nearly 48 million, largely driven by the successful integration of AI features. To further expand its offerings, Duolingo has introduced new courses like chess and acquired music gaming startup NextBeat. This growth reflects the company's early-stage trajectory and successful implementation of new technologies to enhance user engagement and expand its product line beyond language learning.

          <p>Financial experts are weighing in on investment strategies as the Trump administration's tariffs create market volatility, including a new 100% tariff on imported semiconductor chips. While some advisors suggest long-term investors should ignore short-term fluctuations, others point to tactical opportunities in sectors less exposed to tariffs, such as financials and utilities. Strategists note that the S&P 500 has remained resilient, rising over 12% since April, reinforcing the principle that patience can be more effective than panic. For those seeking to be more strategic, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on areas like cryptocurrency and nuclear energy are seen as potential hedges against trade uncertainty.

          <p>A group of congressional Democrats, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal, has requested that the Trump administration stop transitioning employees from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) into permanent federal roles. In a letter to the Office of Personnel Management and the Office of Management and Budget, they expressed concern that these employees, influenced by Elon Musk's tenure, could "sabotage key functions from within." The lawmakers argue that embedding these political appointees into career positions could violate civil service laws and threaten the government's ability to serve the public. The Office of Personnel Management has refuted these claims, stating that no individuals have been unlawfully placed.</p>

          <p>In an era of increasing incivility, particularly online, being polite is not just a social grace but a key to personal well-being, this article argues. Research shows that both witnessing rudeness and being impolite can negatively impact happiness and increase anger, while courteous behavior, even towards AI bots, is linked to improved mood and prosocial actions. The author suggests three personal rules: making courtesy a habit in all interactions, renouncing snark, and responding to rudeness with dignity instead of retaliation. Practicing politeness is framed as a countercultural act of personal freedom that can lead to a greater sense of self-control and happiness in a coarse society.</p>

          <p>Texas Senator John Cornyn announced that FBI Director Kash Patel has granted his request for federal assistance in locating Texas House Democrats who left the state. The lawmakers fled to break quorum and prevent a vote on a Republican-led redistricting plan that could significantly increase the GOP's congressional seats. Cornyn thanked the FBI for its swift action, calling the Democrats' move an "irresponsible" stunt that avoids their constitutional duties. Meanwhile, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has also ordered state law enforcement to find and arrest the legislators, and President Trump suggested the FBI might need to get involved to resolve the political standoff.</p>

The facility, set to open on August 17, has the potential to expand to a capacity of 5,000, which would make it the largest immigration detention center in the country. According to ICE, the "soft-sided" facility will serve as a short-term processing center for individuals in removal proceedings and will be managed by ICE personnel with contracted support.

          <p>A startup named Neurable is commercializing headphones equipped with a brain-computer interface that uses EEG sensors to monitor the user's focus and cognitive state. The technology, currently available in a $700 pair of Master & Dynamic headphones, can detect when a user's attention wanes and prompt them to take a break. While the device does not read thoughts, it interprets brainwave frequencies to measure attention and is being developed to track broader brain health metrics, potentially detecting early signs of conditions like depression or Alzheimer's. This non-invasive approach represents a significant step in making neurotechnology accessible for everyday use, with potential applications in wellness, productivity, and medical diagnostics.</p>

The decision was narrowly passed after two votes, signaling that future cuts will be carefully considered amid concerns about rising inflation, which is now forecast to peak at 4%. While the cut will reduce mortgage costs for some homeowners, it may lead to lower returns for savers. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey stated that despite higher-than-target inflation, the move was necessary to support a struggling economy and a softening jobs market.

          <p>The belief in a secret "client list" detailing powerful individuals involved in Jeffrey Epstein's sex-trafficking network persists as a powerful conspiracy theory, despite no proof of its existence. This article explores why the idea remains compelling, citing the 2015 publication of Epstein's address book and President Trump's own vacillating statements on the matter. The author draws a parallel to the JFK assassination, where government secrecy and selective information release have fueled decades of speculation. Ultimately, the piece argues that the government's lack of full transparency, even for legitimate reasons like victim privacy, creates a fertile ground for such theories to thrive, making it nearly impossible to convince believers that the list isn't real.</p>

          <p>Using the James Webb Space Telescope, astronomers have detected a candidate gas giant planet orbiting Alpha Centauri A, the closest Sun-like star to Earth, located just 4.3 light years away. This real-world discovery echoes the fictional setting of the "Avatar" movies, where the moon Pandora orbits a gas giant in the same star system. The planet, which is roughly the size of Jupiter, appears to be in the star's habitable zone, where temperatures could potentially support life. While the planet's existence requires further confirmation, scientists speculate it could have moons, raising the tantalizing, though remote, possibility of a life-supporting environment similar to the one imagined in science fiction.</p>

          <h2>Comparing Annuities, Reverse Mortgages, and Social Security for Retirement Planning</h2>

          <p>This article provides an overview of three key financial tools for seniors: Social Security, annuities, and reverse mortgages, explaining how each can fit into a retirement strategy. Social Security is presented as a reliable foundation, but its benefits are often insufficient to cover all expenses alone. Annuities are highlighted as a tool for those seeking a guaranteed lifetime income stream, similar to a personal pension, to fill income gaps. Reverse mortgages are positioned as an option for house-rich, cash-poor seniors to tap into home equity without selling their property. The article concludes that the best approach often involves a blended strategy tailored to an individual's specific assets, needs, and goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its experimental daily obesity pill, orforglipron, helped patients achieve nearly 12% body weight loss in a late-stage trial, paving the way for regulatory submission. However, the company's shares dropped around 13% as the results fell slightly below some Wall Street expectations of 15% weight loss. While doctors praised the results as a significant advancement for an oral treatment, some noted that discontinuation rates due to side effects were higher than for existing injectable drugs. Despite the market reaction, the pill represents a major step toward a more convenient, needle-free alternative in the booming weight-loss drug market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are expressing deep concern over what they describe as a "multi-prong" effort by the Trump administration to exert political control and cut scientific research funding. An anonymous senior NIH official stated that recent moves, including a briefly proposed freeze on all outside funding and significant cuts to cancer research, are creating a state of chaos and uncertainty. Researchers fear these actions will devastate university labs, which receive the majority of NIH grants, and destroy the careers of many scientists. The cuts are seen by some as an attempt to undermine universities and will effectively shut down progress in critical areas.</p>

          <p>The global oil market is largely dismissing President Trump's threat to impose 100% "secondary tariffs" on countries that purchase Russian energy exports if a ceasefire in Ukraine is not reached. Oil prices closed lower, suggesting traders believe the threat is a negotiating tactic rather than a policy that will be fully implemented. Analysts note that a 25% tariff recently imposed on India, Russia's largest oil customer, was much lower than the threatened 100% and has a 21-day grace period. The market seems to believe that the administration will ultimately back down to avoid a significant spike in global energy prices, which would be counterproductive to its goals.

          <p>Indian garment exporters are facing intense pressure from U.S. clients like Gap and Kohl's to either absorb the cost of new American tariffs or move their manufacturing operations out of India. Following the imposition of a 50% tariff on Indian imports, companies are receiving panicked calls from buyers. Some manufacturers, like Pearl Global, are offering to shift production to their factories in other countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam to bypass the levies. The situation is a significant blow to India's apparel sector and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's "Make in India" initiative, forcing companies to consider relocating to less-established hubs to retain their U.S. business.</p>

          <p>A bull moose that had been lingering near a popular hiking trail in New York's Adirondack mountains since May was euthanized by environmental officials due to its severely deteriorating health. The Goodman Mountain trail had been closed since June because of the moose's unusual behavior. Wildlife biologists and a state veterinarian determined the animal was severely emaciated and suffering from an advanced disease, concluding that euthanasia was the most humane option. A necropsy will be performed to determine the cause of its illness, which will help officials better understand and manage threats to New York's growing moose population, currently estimated at around 700.</p>

He acknowledged potential issues with Australia's batting lineup but noted that England has not won a Test series in Australia since 2010-11. McGrath identified the battle between England's aggressive top-order batsmen, like Joe Root and Harry Brook, and Australia's bowlers as the key matchup that will likely decide the series.</p>

          <p>While initially appearing chaotic, President Trump's tariff policy now reveals a clearer, albeit risky, negotiating strategy, this article suggests. The approach involves using the threat of steep tariffs to pressure trading partners into bilateral deals that often include commitments to buy more U.S. goods or make investments. Countries that offer sufficient concessions, like the EU and Japan, receive more favorable tariff rates, while others face higher duties as leverage. However, this strategy is fraught with uncertainty, facing significant legal challenges that could see the tariffs overturned by courts, and economic risks, as a recent weak jobs report raises fears of a slowdown.</p>

While UAW President Shawn Fain has praised the administration for challenging "disastrous" trade deals, he has also qualified his support, opposing tariffs used for political games. The situation highlights a long-standing union belief that tariffs can protect American jobs, even as economists warn that Trump's broad and inconsistent approach could harm the working class it aims to help.</p>
