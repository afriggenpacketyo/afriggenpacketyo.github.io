          <p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $15 million in federal funding for research into "forever chemical" (PFAS) contamination on American farms. The studies, led by various universities, were aimed at understanding how these harmful chemicals move from soil into crops, livestock, and water sources. Public health advocates and scientists have condemned the decision, arguing it will hinder efforts to ensure food safety and protect farmers from exposure to substances linked to serious health issues like cancer.</p>

          <p>A diner in Georgia sparked a widespread online debate after sharing a receipt that included an 18% "living wage fee." The restaurant states the surcharge goes directly to staff payroll to provide a reliable income, distinct from pooled tips. The incident has divided opinions, with some customers feeling misled while others see it as a transparent alternative to raising menu prices or traditional tipping models. The controversy highlights ongoing discussions about fair compensation in the service industry.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's economy shrank unexpectedly by 0.1% in May, marking the second consecutive month of contraction after a decline in April. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called the figures disappointing, attributing the downturn to weak manufacturing and retail sectors. The data adds pressure on the new government, which has prioritized economic growth but now faces a fragile outlook, making an interest rate cut in August increasingly likely to stimulate the economy.

          <p>Nigeria's Foreign Minister, Yusuf Tuggar, has firmly stated that the country will not accept Venezuelan nationals being deported from the United States, some of whom are reportedly former prisoners. Tuggar cited Nigeria's own population of over 230 million and existing challenges as reasons for the refusal. The stance comes amid threats from the Trump administration of visa restrictions and tariffs against countries that do not comply with its deportation policies, highlighting growing diplomatic tensions.</p>

          <p>Police in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, have arrested a man for allegedly shooting and killing his 16-year-old daughter because she refused to delete her TikTok account. Investigators reported that the father killed his daughter "for honor," and the family initially attempted to present the death as a suicide. This incident is part of a disturbing pattern of "honor" killings in the country, where women are often subjected to violence for perceived breaches of strict social codes, including their online activities.</p>

          <p>A CBS News investigation into Thomas Crooks, the 20-year-old who attempted to assassinate Donald Trump, reveals a stark contrast between his public persona and his secret activities. To friends and family, he was a quiet, high-achieving student, but online records show an increasing obsession with firearms, explosives, and encrypted communication in the months leading up to the attack. The report details how Crooks meticulously planned the shooting, using a drone for reconnaissance and exploiting security gaps at the rally site.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses common health concerns about using microwave ovens, clarifying that they are generally safe for both people and food. The appliance uses non-ionizing radiation, which is far less powerful than ionizing radiation from nuclear reactions and does not make food radioactive or damage DNA. In fact, the shorter cooking times can help food retain more nutrients compared to methods like boiling. The primary risks are burns from hot containers and food, and the potential for chemicals to leach from unsafe plastic containers.</p>

          <p>The increasing use of AI chatbots like Grok and ChatGPT for information during events like the recent Texas floods is raising concerns about the spread of misinformation. These chatbots have been observed providing confident but inaccurate or contradictory answers, sometimes fabricating details or amplifying conspiracy theories before backtracking. Experts warn that because these AI models are trained on vast, often unvetted online data, they can 'hallucinate' and present falsehoods as facts, adding a new layer of confusion to fast-moving situations.</p>

The show frames Diamond's iconic song catalog within a therapy session, where the older musician reflects on his life and career, giving biographical context to hits like "Sweet Caroline" and "I Am... I Said." While the therapeutic framework can feel heavy-handed, the musical succeeds by keeping the focus on its primary goal: delivering a glorious and moving celebration of Diamond's music.</p>
