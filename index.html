          <p>Elon Musk has threatened to sue Apple, accusing the company of antitrust violations related to its App Store. Musk claims that Apple's practices make it impossible for any AI company other than OpenAI to achieve the top ranking, specifically citing the placement of his xAI's Grok chatbot. This follows a previous dispute where Musk criticized Apple's integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT at the operating system level, calling it a security risk. The threat adds to Apple's existing legal challenges, including a major antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their trade truce for an additional 90 days, narrowly avoiding a significant escalation in tariffs. This agreement suspends the planned implementation of triple-digit tariffs from both nations, maintaining the current rates of 30% on Chinese imports to the U.S. and 10% on U.S. goods to China. The extension provides more time for negotiations aimed at addressing trade imbalances, market access, and national security concerns. Despite the truce, trade volumes between the two economic giants have already seen a considerable decline this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani and his agent, Nez Balelo, are being sued by a real estate investor and broker over a luxury housing project in Hawaii. The plaintiffs allege they brought Ohtani into the $240 million development as a celebrity endorser but were subsequently forced out of the deal. According to the lawsuit, Balelo used Ohtani's celebrity leverage to demand concessions and ultimately pressured their business partner to terminate their involvement. The suit accuses Ohtani and Balelo of tortious interference, seeking to hold them accountable for allegedly abusing their influence for financial gain.</p>

The incident occurred Monday morning in a mechanical regulating room, leading to a large-scale emergency response from multiple fire and EMS departments. Officials confirmed one victim as 39-year-old Timothy Quinn, while the second has not yet been identified. The plant, the largest coke manufacturing facility in the U.S., has since been stabilized, and an investigation into the cause of the blasts is underway.</p>

She expresses regret over the handling of gender recognition legislation, admitting she should have paused to build consensus, particularly after the controversy involving a person convicted of two sexual assaults being sent to a women's prison. The book also details the emotional toll of the COVID-19 pandemic, the breakdown of her relationship with Alex Salmond, and personal struggles including a miscarriage and the end of her marriage. Sturgeon also describes the police investigation into SNP finances as the "worst day" of her life.</p>

          <p>An explosion at the U.S. Steel Clairton plant that killed two people has drawn attention to the facility's troubled history with safety and environmental issues. The plant, North America's largest coking operation, has faced scrutiny for pollution and had other major incidents in 2025, including a stack explosion and a malfunction of pollution control equipment. Advocacy groups have long raised concerns about the facility's impact on the surrounding community and its pattern of delayed or abandoned safety promises. The tragedy occurs as U.S. Steel finalizes a partnership with Japan's Nippon Steel, a deal that has also attracted political attention.</p>

          <p>Nigeria's military has announced that a joint air and ground operation in the northwestern state of Zamfara resulted in the deaths of more than 100 armed gang members. The operation was launched after intelligence indicated that a large group of "bandits," as they are locally known, were preparing to attack a village. These armed groups have been terrorizing communities in the region, engaging in kidnappings for ransom and other violent crimes. While the government frequently launches such operations, the violence has persisted, exacerbating a humanitarian crisis by displacing farmers and disrupting food supplies.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Federal Takeover of D.C. Police Represents a Test for Authoritarian Tactics</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to federalize the D.C. police and deploy the National Guard is being analyzed as a significant step toward authoritarianism, executed under the guise of a public relations stunt. The move bypasses the city's elected government and is based on misleading crime statistics, as violent crime in D.C. has actually been falling. Critics argue the action sets a dangerous precedent for deploying armed forces in American cities for political purposes, drawing comparisons to the tactics of autocratic leaders like El Salvador's Nayib Bukele. The deployment seems unlikely to impact crime but serves to project an image of strength and control.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reached an agreement with semiconductor firms Nvidia and AMD, allowing them to resume sales of certain chips to China in exchange for a 15% share of the resulting revenue for the U.S. government. This deal provides the companies with licenses to export chips that were previously restricted, a move that Nvidia's CEO had warned was costing U.S. industry access to a massive market. The arrangement is being described as another form of tariff, with the collected funds going directly to the U.S. Treasury. It represents a significant federal intervention in the business operations of major tech companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Colorado is contending with two major wildfires, including the Lee fire, which has grown to become the fifth largest in the state's history, burning over 130,000 acres. More than a thousand firefighters are deployed, facing challenging conditions of gusty winds, low humidity, and extremely dry fuels that are driving the blaze's growth. The fire, sparked by lightning, is only 7% contained, and evacuations are in place for several communities. This explosive fire season in North America, exacerbated by the climate crisis, has stretched firefighting resources thin across the continent.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's justification for federalizing the D.C. police force relies on false and misleading narratives about crime and homelessness in the city. While Trump cited 2023 homicide data, current statistics show violent crime in D.C. is at a 30-year low and has fallen dramatically in 2024 and 2025. Similarly, his portrayal of "caravans of mass youth rampage" is contradicted by data showing a decline in youth arrests. Experts also note that unhoused individuals are far more likely to be victims of crime than perpetrators, challenging the administration's linkage of homelessness to a need for a crackdown.</p>

          <p>Staff at the Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national center for AI, have warned that the organization is at risk of collapse in a whistleblowing complaint to the Charity Commission. The complaint alleges misuse of public funds and a "toxic internal culture," and comes after the UK's Technology Secretary threatened to withdraw funding unless the institute pivots its focus to defense and national security research. This has triggered what staff call a "crisis in governance," with a £100 million government grant now in jeopardy. The institute has been grappling with internal discontent and leadership challenges for months.</p>

          <p>England soccer player Jess Carter revealed she felt a "sigh of relief" when her white teammates also missed penalties in the Euro 2025 quarter-final shootout, fearing the "astronomical" racist abuse her Black teammate Lauren James would have otherwise faced alone. Carter, who was herself a target of online racism during the tournament, spoke about the devastating personal impact of the abuse, stating it made her feel small and scared to play. She said the psychological toll was so great that she was initially frightened when selected for the final, fearing the potential for more abuse if she made a mistake.</p>

          <p>The three-year-old mystery of missing Scottish cyclist Tony Parsons was solved after his killer, Alexander McKellar, confessed to his new girlfriend. McKellar admitted to a fatal hit-and-run and showed her where he and his brother had buried the body on a remote estate. The girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, secretly marked the location by dropping a Red Bull can and then alerted the police. This crucial act led to the recovery of Parsons's remains and the conviction of the McKellar brothers, bringing a long-awaited and difficult resolution to the victim's family.</p>
