          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 01:53:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has warned that the government's promises to reduce crime will be unattainable without significant additional funding for policing. In an article co-written with other chief constables, Rowley highlighted a decade of underinvestment, overstretched resources, and outdated technology within police forces. He emphasized that the upcoming spending review is crucial for addressing these structural inefficiencies and enabling the police to deliver on key government pledges such as halving knife crime and violence against women and girls. The Home Office maintains that it is committed to supporting the police with substantial funding increases and resources for neighborhood policing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department has temporarily halted scheduling new visa interviews for international students as it prepares to broaden its social media screening process for applicants. Secretary of State Marco Rubio signed a cable directing embassies to suspend additional student visa appointments until further guidance is issued on the expanded vetting process. This move follows other Trump administration actions targeting international students, including attempts to revoke Harvard University's ability to enroll them, which have faced legal challenges. The State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce affirmed the commitment to thoroughly vetting all visa applicants using every available resource.</p>

          <p>A former police chief, Grant Hardin, convicted of murder and sexual assault, escaped from a medium-security prison in Arkansas by impersonating a corrections officer. Hardin, known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," was able to walk out of the facility after a prison officer opened a secure gate for him. Law enforcement is conducting an extensive search in the rugged Ozark Mountains, using canines, drones, and helicopters, while the sister of one of Hardin's victims expressed alarm due to her family's involvement in his trial. The Arkansas Department of Corrections is investigating how Hardin obtained the disguise, which was not a standard inmate or correctional uniform.</p>

          <p>A United Nations report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) indicates a 70% chance that the average global warming from 2025 to 2029 will exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius benchmark set by the Paris climate accords. The report follows the two hottest years ever recorded and warns of growing negative impacts on economies, daily life, ecosystems, and the planet. Climate researchers predict a near certainty of surpassing the 1.5-degree threshold on a long-term basis in the coming years, with a possibility of exceeding 2 degrees of warming, a prospect described as "shocking" by a British Met Office scientist.</p>

These filings contribute to a significant surge in Hong Kong's IPO fundraising, which has already surpassed nearly 90% of last year's full-year proceeds in the first five months of 2025.

          <p>CNBC's UK Exchange newsletter reflects on Vodafone's recent performance, drawing parallels between the company's long-term disappointments and the overall state of corporate Britain. The newsletter highlights repeated claims by Vodafone's leadership of reaching an "inflexion point," which have consistently failed to materialize. Once the world's largest mobile operator, Vodafone's decline mirrors the UK's reduced global significance. The company's current strategy involves focusing on key markets and pursuing consolidation, such as its merger with Three UK, in an effort to improve investment returns.</p>

CPAC chairman Matt Schlapp framed the election as a battle against "globalists" and emphasized the importance of conservative victories worldwide.

          <p>A new COVID-19 variant, NB.1.8.1, is spreading across the United States after causing a surge in cases in Asia, though it is not yet tracked on federal variant dashboards. While LP.8.1 remains the dominant strain in the U.S., NB.1.8.1 has been detected in several states and is designated as a variant under monitoring by the World Health Organization (WHO). Although current data suggests it does not cause more severe illness than other variants, it appears to be more transmissible. Current COVID vaccines are expected to remain effective against this variant, but access to vaccines is being limited by recent policy changes.</p>

Higher Japanese government bond yields could trigger a wave of capital repatriation, with Japanese investors pulling funds from the U.S. This could potentially lead to a global financial market downturn, particularly affecting U.S. tech stocks and increasing borrowing costs. The steepening of Japan's yield curve is attributed to Japanese life insurance companies meeting their buying requirements and the Bank of Japan scaling back bond purchases.</p>

Skomer Island's isolation protects it from predators and human impact, contributing to the thriving seabird population.

To minimize disruption and trauma, Scottish police employ a "soft" approach when arresting suspected pedophiles, contrasting sharply with drug raids. This involves plainclothes detectives arriving in unmarked cars and conducting searches with sensitivity, aiming to protect the suspect's family and neighbors from the immediate shock of the arrest.

          <p>Onosato was promoted to sumo's highest rank of yokozuna on Wednesday, achieving the honor at a record pace after competing in just 13 professional tournaments. The 24-year-old from Ishikawa Prefecture became the 75th yokozuna and the first Japanese-born grand champion since his stablemaster Nishonoseki, the former Kisenosato, who won his promotion after the New Year meet in 2017. Onosato ensured his promotion by winning the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament with two days to spare on Friday, achieving the required benchmark of back-to-back championships as an ozeki, the second-highest rank. He joins 14-time winner Wajima as the only wrestler to become a grand champion after entering the professional ranks from university.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law requiring 300 to 400 major firms to participate in a carbon emissions trading system starting in fiscal year 2026. The law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually across industries like steel and car production, accounting for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Companies will be allotted maximum emission allowances, purchasing carbon credits for emissions exceeding that threshold from companies with surpluses. This system aims to incentivize emissions reduction, although companies may pass decarbonization costs to consumers through price hikes.</p>

Netanyahu has argued that Iranâ€™s vulnerability will not last long, and that the time is right for an attack.

          <p>Tyrese Haliburton delivered a sensational performance with 32 points, 15 assists, and 12 rebounds to lead the Indiana Pacers to a 130-121 victory over the New York Knicks, giving them a 3-1 lead in the Eastern Conference finals. Haliburton's flawless triple-double, combined with Pascal Siakam's 30 points, brought the Pacers within one win of their second NBA finals appearance. The Pacers have not lost consecutive games since March 10 and hold a strong historical advantage in playoff series where they lead 3-1. The Knicks, led by Jalen Brunson's 31 points, couldn't overcome another double-digit deficit.</p>
