          <p>World-renowned conservationist Dame Jane Goodall has passed away at 91, leaving behind an extraordinary legacy in science and environmental activism. Her groundbreaking discoveries, particularly observing tool use in chimpanzees and detailing their complex social lives, revolutionized understanding of primate behavior and challenged conventional scientific thinking. Goodall, who began her research in Tanzania without formal qualifications, became a tireless advocate for environmental protection and animal welfare, inspiring millions globally. Tributes from figures like Barack Obama and Leonardo DiCaprio underscore her profound impact, with her work continuing through the Jane Goodall Institute to protect chimpanzees, restore nature, and foster hope for a better world.</p>

          <p>London Mayor Sadiq Khan has expressed profound disgust regarding alleged misconduct by Metropolitan Police officers, stating that sexism, racism, misogyny, and excessive force have no place in the force. His comments follow a BBC exposé revealing serious behavioral issues within the Met, particularly at Charing Cross police station, which has significantly impacted public confidence and trust. Khan has met with the commissioner to discuss urgent changes, supporting efforts to remove wrongdoers, while the Home Secretary and Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) welcome investigations. Former police officials and politicians alike have condemned the findings, emphasizing the critical need for comprehensive reforms to restore public faith in the Metropolitan Police.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old girl, reportedly intoxicated, crashed a stolen Chevrolet Silverado on an Arizona highway with an 11-year-old passenger inside. Police responded to a report of a wrong-way driver, observing the vehicle speeding over 100 mph before it veered onto a guardrail, flipped multiple times, and struck a tree. Both occupants sustained non-life-threatening injuries, though the impact was severe enough to dislodge the steering wheel. The 13-year-old showed significant signs of intoxication, with a blood alcohol concentration more than twice the adult legal limit, and now faces DUI and additional charges for the stolen vehicle and reckless driving, prompting authorities to warn about juvenile joyriding and underage drinking.</p>

          <p>An Amtrak train traveling from Los Angeles to Seattle collided with a disabled semi-truck obstructing the track near Lompoc, California, resulting in four injuries and a significant fuel spill. The truck driver sustained major injuries, while three train passengers suffered minor injuries among the 218 passengers and crew aboard. The train remained upright, but the impact caused approximately 3,600 gallons of diesel fuel to spill, leading to the closure of Highway 1 between Main Street and Brown Road. Local law enforcement and Amtrak police are cooperating to investigate the incident, with passengers instructed to remain inside until alternative transport arrived.</p>

This trend highlights the enduring cultural importance of gold in wedding traditions, even as economic realities compel adjustments in consumer spending and expectations for such significant life events.

          <p>Raymond Cruz, known for his antagonist role in 'Breaking Bad,' will not face criminal charges following a car wash confrontation last month, prosecutors confirmed. The decision came after three women accused the actor of intentionally spraying them with water while he washed his car. Cruz's agent maintained that the actor had merely asked the women to move their vehicle a foot away to prevent them from getting wet, and any water splash was incidental as they began recording him. This outcome brings an end to the legal aspect of the dispute, which had seen Cruz held in police custody for five hours.</p>

The lawsuit, filed with the Institute for Justice, demands an end to what it calls "unconstitutional and illegal immigration enforcement tactics," alleging agents targeted Latino-looking workers without warrants or specific suspicion. Venegas, who repeatedly asserted his citizenship and showed a Real ID driver's license, was released after each detention but highlights a pattern of racial profiling. The Department of Homeland Security dismissed the suit as "race-baiting opportunism," stating arrests are based on "reasonable suspicion."</p>

          <p>Ecuador has significantly increased its anti-drug cartel operations, aligning with US President Donald Trump's declared war on drug cartels. As a transit country for drug networks, Ecuador is on Trump's list of troublesome nations and is receiving US resources and military aid, including plans for a US military base. Sky News observed police raids in Guayaquil, where officers targeted drug dealers, aiming to disrupt the chain from "small guys" upwards. This cooperation seeks to gather intelligence for the US to combat more significant figures, though it often involves distressing scenes for families caught in the raids.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order declaring that any armed attack against Qatar would be considered "a threat to the peace and security of the United States." This order promises that the U.S. would take all lawful and appropriate measures, including military action if necessary, to defend Qatar's interests. A Qatari official confirmed the move came after Israel bombed Qatar's capital, Doha, targeting Hamas leaders, prompting Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to express deep regret for the unintentional killing of a Qatari serviceman and violating sovereignty. The order solidifies Qatar's security relationship with the U.S., where it hosts the largest American military base in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>The US federal government began shutting down after lawmakers failed to agree on extending government funding, primarily due to disputes over health care tax credits. Republicans and Democrats remained at odds, with Democrats insisting on including health insurance subsidies in any funding measure, while Republicans pushed for a "clean" temporary extension. This stalemate led to hundreds of thousands of federal workers being furloughed without pay, though essential employees continue working. The shutdown, the first in nearly seven years, is expected to cause a permanent economic loss and highlights deep partisan divisions over spending priorities and policy.</p>

          <p>Huntington Beach, California, has declared itself a "non-sanctuary" city, a move that challenges the state's sanctuary policies and aligns with Mayor Pat Burns' support for President Trump's immigration stance. This status permits local police to assist federal law enforcement in detaining undocumented immigrants, contrasting with California's restrictions on such cooperation. Mayor Burns argues that the policy makes a statement and that law enforcement should be allowed to collaborate, despite federal attempts to withhold grants from sanctuary cities being struck down in courts. The city's decision highlights a growing divide between local and state approaches to immigration enforcement.</p>

While no citation was issued, the incident highlights ongoing challenges in navigating complex scenarios, despite Waymo's claims of significantly fewer serious injury crashes compared to human drivers. The company is investigating this event, alongside a recent illegal U-turn in San Francisco that also went uncited due to the lack of a human driver. Waymo operates in five cities with plans for expansion, but experts like former NTSB chair Robert Sumwalt argue for higher safety standards before widespread adoption.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders adopted a unique silent protest during a press conference after fellow first-year QB Dillon Gabriel was promoted to the team's starting quarterback, bypassing Sanders. When questioned about remaining the No. 3 QB, Sanders smiled broadly and pantomimed answers without uttering a word, a response believed to be a reaction to critical remarks by analyst Rex Ryan regarding his backup status. Sanders, a former college star for his father Deion Sanders, was drafted in the fifth round after Gabriel, leading to the current depth chart situation. This unconventional display highlights player frustration and the intense scrutiny faced by NFL rookies in a competitive environment.</p>

She also clarifies that modern margarines are healthy, unlike older versions with trans fats, and can reduce bad cholesterol. Forouhi advises using basic olive oil for shallow frying and vegetable or sunflower oil for deep frying, as they withstand higher temperatures better than extra virgin olive oil.</p>
