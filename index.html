          <p>A Japanese research team has discovered that a one-minute exposure to a specific sound frequency may prevent motion sickness. The sound, at 100 hertz, stimulates the inner ear, improving balance and reducing symptoms like nausea and lightheadedness. This finding could offer an alternative to medication, particularly as self-driving technology increases the risk of motion sickness for passengers. The study involved volunteers exposed to the sound before experiencing motion through swings, simulators, and car rides, with 70-80% reporting alleviated symptoms.</p>

          <p>China is taking a more assertive approach towards the Trump administration, responding to tariffs with countermeasures and attacking American "bullying." Unlike Trump's first term, where leader-level diplomacy was seen as essential, there is no apparent prospect of a meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi. This shift may reflect a hardening of attitudes in Beijing, possibly stemming from its experiences during Trump's first term. China is also seeking to rally international support for its position among its neighbors and traditional US allies.</p>

While Doge focuses on canceling contracts and tackling fraud, less than 40% of its claimed savings are broken down into individual savings. Experts also caution that the maximum contract figures used by Doge may overstate actual savings, as they represent projected spending over several years. Musk plans to reduce his work with Doge to focus on other companies such as Tesla.</p>
