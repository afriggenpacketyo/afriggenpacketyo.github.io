            <p>Newspaper front pages are dominated by the Supreme Court's unanimous ruling defining 'woman' by biological sex under equalities law, sparking celebrations and concerns. The ruling is expected to lead to changes across single-sex spaces like NHS wards and sports. Some papers highlight the victory for women and common sense, while others focus on the potential chaos for equality policies, requiring organizations to revisit their guidelines. One paper featured the mother of Jean Charles de Menezes forgiving the police officers who killed her son 20 years ago.</p>

            <p>Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers like BYD and Geely Auto face delays in building overseas production facilities due to security and geopolitical concerns raised by Beijing. Approvals for plants in Brazil and Mexico are stalled as authorities urge a more cautious approach to global expansion, considering trade and investment risks. This intervention reflects Beijing's desire for strategic decision-making, favoring countries with favorable geopolitical stances towards China. This cautious approach aligns with a broader trend of China influencing EV makers' investment decisions to mitigate tariff-related challenges.</p>

He requested a delay in payment until after the final judgement, but the judge asked him to file financial statements to prove his claims.

            <p>The Trump administration proposed a rule to redefine "harm" under the Endangered Species Act, limiting it to direct actions that kill or injure protected species, excluding habitat destruction. This change could significantly reduce the Act's reach and impact conservation efforts, potentially harming vulnerable plants and animals. Conservationists argue this move contradicts a 1995 Supreme Court ruling and would allow activities like logging old-growth forests without concern for endangered species. The proposal is part of a broader push for development and resource extraction on public lands.</p>

            <p>Jim Cramer argues that consumer companies will need to cut prices to move goods, despite tariffs pushing them to do the opposite. He believes consumers are already resistant to high prices, and most companies are unprepared for the tariff-laden economic landscape. He points to LVMH's sales decline as evidence that high-end retailers will struggle to maintain prices. Cramer suggests that mergers could be the only alternative to declining gross margins for these companies. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Following allegations that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) may have improperly accessed sensitive data from the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), DOGE is assigning staffers to work at the agency. This move comes shortly after a whistleblower raised concerns about DOGE's access to NLRB systems. The NLRB employees expressed panic over the data and the presence of DOGE, who will be working remotely. The chairman and acting general counsel stated that the representatives have asked for agency operations information but have requested the removal of personally identifiable information from documents.</p>

            <p>The Chinese embassy in Chile accused the US of "hegemonism" after the US President's nominee for ambassador to Chile suggested restricting China's access to Chilean resources. The embassy argued that Washington's actions were an attempt to interfere in Chile's right to choose its international partners. The dispute centers on a collaborative astronomy project between China and Chile. The embassy voiced strong opposition to the remarks, stating it obstructs normal technological cooperation between China and Chile.</p>

The Vera Institute of Justice believes it was targeted because rightwing media outlets attack its approach to criminal justice reform.

            <p>NPR CEO Katherine Maher addressed the Trump administration's intent to eliminate nearly all federal funding for public media. She stated that the biggest impact would be on the NPR network, particularly rural stations, which rely heavily on federal funding. Loss of federal funding could jeopardize the ability of NPR to thrive as a national network, potentially leading to cuts in services and the disappearance of some stations. Maher defended public broadcasting as a vital service that reaches communities with limited access to other news sources.</p>
