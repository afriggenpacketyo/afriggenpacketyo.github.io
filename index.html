            <h2>Bond Market Reacts to Trump's Tariff Pause with Volatility</h2>

            <p>Global bond markets experienced a tumultuous week, marked by significant reversals sparked by President Trump's recent tariff pause announcement. U.S. Treasury yields initially cooled after Trump acknowledged concerns about the bond market's reaction to his tariff policies, which were widely considered inflationary. The U.K. bond market also saw a rally following the tariff pause, providing relief to investors concerned about the country's fiscal outlook. Market analysts speculate that China's potential selling of U.S. assets may have contributed to the bond yield movements, adding another layer of complexity to the situation.

            <p>Researchers and public health workers are raising concerns that aggressive deportation tactics under the Trump administration are obstructing efforts to prevent a potential bird flu pandemic. Farmworkers, who are crucial to the nation's bird flu strategy, are reportedly terrified to seek testing or healthcare due to fear of deportation. This chilling effect has led to a decrease in vaccinations and testing, potentially allowing the virus to spread undetected and evolve into a more dangerous form. Public health officials emphasize that protecting farmworkers, regardless of immigration status, is essential to preventing a widespread outbreak.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Inflation experienced a slowdown in March, primarily due to lower gasoline prices; however, economists caution that tariffs implemented by the Trump administration could reverse this trend in the coming months. While the consumer price index (CPI) and core CPI both decreased, indicating a deceleration in inflation, concerns remain regarding rising grocery prices. Economists emphasize that tariffs, being a tax on U.S. importers, will likely be passed on to consumers, potentially pushing the inflation rate to around 4% by the end of 2025. Despite these concerns, housing disinflation is expected to continue its gradual decline. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump announced a 90-day pause in higher tariffs for most countries, while maintaining a 10% baseline tariff, prompting the EU to halt its retaliatory measures. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent attributed the pause to Trump's "courage" and reiterated that countries that did not retaliate would be rewarded. However, the pause does not apply to China, as Trump increased tariffs on Chinese goods due to a perceived unwillingness to negotiate. The total tariff rate on China now stands at 145%, according to the White House.</p>

The administration is also planning to fine illegal immigrants who fail to comply with deportation orders, further incentivizing self-deportation. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has released a flyer outlining the benefits of self-deportation, including the ability to retain earned money and potentially return legally in the future.</p>

The resolution was adopted in a 216-214 vote, with two Republicans joining all Democrats in opposition. House conservatives ultimately flipped their opposition after receiving assurances from leaders that the Senate would pursue at least $1.5 trillion in savings. Approving the budget plan is the first step in the reconciliation process, allowing Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate.</p>

            <p>Manchester United legend Eric Cantona has voiced strong criticism of Sir Jim Ratcliffe's co-ownership of the club, stating that it is being "destroyed" under his leadership. Cantona questioned the wisdom of Ratcliffe's plans to build a new stadium instead of redeveloping Old Trafford, which he considers iconic. He also expressed concern over the treatment of club staff and the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson as a global ambassador. Cantona believes that United "needs to find its soul again" and that the current management is not respecting the club's history and traditions.</p>

            <p>Fintech stocks experienced a pullback after a strong rally fueled by President Trump's tariff pause announcement. Affirm, which had led the rebound, saw its shares decline, though an upbeat analyst note continues to support the stock. Analysts warn that higher import duties could compress margins for companies reliant on foreign-made checkout terminals and merchant-side infrastructure. Despite short-term relief from the tariff reprieve, longer-term pressures from margin pressure, rate volatility, and geopolitical risk persist. (not investment advice)</p>

Mahdi's lawyers have argued to the US supreme court that state courts have erred in upholding his death sentence, failing to acknowledge that his counsel was deficient whey they presented “barely half an hour” of “mitigating evidence”.</p>
