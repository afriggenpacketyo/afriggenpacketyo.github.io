          <p>An aid boat carrying Greta Thunberg and other activists, organized by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, was intercepted by Israeli forces while attempting to reach Gaza.

          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the ban on destructive bottom trawling in English waters, increasing the protected area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2.

The plan is subject to a 12-week consultation with the marine and fishing industry. Pressure is also mounting for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty to protect ocean areas. </p>

          <p>Nurses in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland will vote on a 3.6% pay increase, with the possibility of strike action looming. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has criticized the pay award as insufficient, arguing that nursing staff have endured over a decade of pay erosion. Resident doctors in England are already being balloted on strike action. The vote's outcome will determine the next steps in the pay dispute. </p>

Ocean Winds, for example, was paid £72,000 not to generate power from its wind farms. The current system, built for coal and gas plants, struggles to handle the new renewable electricity. This has led to rising energy bills and questions about the government's net-zero promises. </p>
