          <p>President Donald Trump and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva held a phone call aimed at mending relations following disputes over U.S. tariffs and the prosecution of former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro. Trump had previously imposed a 40% tariff on key Brazilian exports and publicly condemned Bolsonaro's conviction as a politically motivated "witch hunt." The conversation signals a potential de-escalation in diplomatic friction, with both leaders agreeing to hold further discussions and future meetings to improve cooperation between the two nations.</p>

          <p>During a White House visit from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Donald Trump characterized the U.S.-Canada relationship as having both "mutual love" and "natural conflict," especially concerning trade. While Trump noted progress in discussions, he offered no specific concessions on steep U.S. tariffs and suggested the USMCA free trade agreement could be renegotiated. The meeting took place amid ongoing diplomatic tensions, with Canada seeking relief from tariffs and facing significant uncertainty over the future of the critical trade pact.</p>

          <p>A large-scale rescue operation has successfully guided 580 hikers to safety after they were stranded by an unexpected and severe blizzard on the eastern slopes of Mount Everest. The trekkers, along with 300 local support staff, were trapped at high altitudes by heavy snowfall during a peak tourist season known as Golden Week. The effort, which involved police, firefighters, and hundreds of local Tibetan volunteers, managed to evacuate the groups who were facing risks of hypothermia and being buried in deep snow.</p>

          <h2>Top Rugby Nations to Ban Players Joining Proposed R360 League from International Play</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The world's foremost rugby nations, including England, New Zealand, South Africa, and Australia, have issued a joint declaration that they will make players who join the proposed breakaway R360 league ineligible for international selection. This unified front represents a major setback for the new globe-trotting tournament, which had marketed itself on a schedule that would allow players to continue their Test careers. The national unions cited concerns that the for-profit R360 model could fragment the sport and undermine investment in its foundational pathways.</p>

          <p>Data compiled after two years of the Israel-Hamas war illustrates the catastrophic impact on Gaza's 2.1 million inhabitants. The statistics show that approximately one in every ten people has been killed or injured, while nine in ten have been displaced from their homes, the vast majority of which are now destroyed or severely damaged. This conflict has precipitated a severe humanitarian crisis marked by widespread famine, a collapsed healthcare system, and thousands of orphaned children, painting a grim picture of the devastation across the territory.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Orlando Bravo, the co-founder of private equity firm Thoma Bravo, has stated that valuations within the artificial intelligence sector are currently "at a bubble," drawing parallels to the dot-com era of the late 1990s. He argued that it is unsustainable to value a company with $50 million in annual recurring revenue at $10 billion. However, Bravo also highlighted a crucial distinction from the dot-com crash: the current AI boom is being substantially financed by large, established corporations with healthy balance sheets, providing a more stable financial foundation.

          <p>Robert Preston Morris, the founder of the prominent Gateway Church, has pleaded guilty to five counts of lewd acts with a child, decades after the abuse took place. The case gained national attention after a Christian watchdog blog, The Wartburg Watch, published the story of survivor Cindy Clemishire, which encouraged other victims to come forward and ultimately led to a criminal investigation. Morris received a 10-year suspended sentence that includes six months in jail, highlighting the increasing role of independent media in uncovering abuse within evangelical institutions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering denying back pay to some furloughed federal employees when the current government shutdown concludes, despite a 2019 law designed to guarantee such compensation. A draft White House memo argues that Congress must pass new legislation to specifically appropriate the funds, a legal interpretation that contradicts previous guidance and the plain text of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act. This move is widely viewed as a tactic to increase political pressure on Democrats to approve a government funding bill.</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a drastic increase in tariffs on imported steel, a decision the UK steel industry has warned could provoke its "biggest crisis" ever. The plan involves cutting the amount of steel that can be imported into the EU tariff-free by nearly half, after which a new 50% tariff will be applied. This protectionist measure is intended to combat cheap imports from countries like China and Turkey but poses an existential threat to the UK's industry, for which the EU represents its largest and most critical export market.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has accused Russia of using its "shadow fleet" of oil tankers for purposes beyond circumventing sanctions, alleging that the vessels are also engaged in intelligence gathering and sabotage operations in Europe. Based on a briefing from his foreign intelligence chief, Zelenskyy asserted that Ukraine is collaborating with its international partners to actively counter this emerging threat. The accusation suggests that Russia is leveraging its commercial shipping network as a tool for hybrid warfare activities designed to destabilize the region.</p>

          <p>The ongoing U.S. government shutdown is causing significant air travel disruptions, with numerous Federal Aviation Administration facilities reporting staffing shortages due to an increase in sick calls from air traffic controllers. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has warned that the situation may deteriorate, potentially leading to more delays and cancellations to maintain safety as controllers are required to work without pay. The disruptions expose the fragility of the national aviation system, which already contends with long-standing controller shortages, and intensify pressure on lawmakers to resolve the funding impasse.</p>

Stephen's mother, Baroness Doreen Lawrence, strongly opposed his release, arguing that he remains a danger to the public and has not shown true remorse by failing to disclose the full truth.</p>
