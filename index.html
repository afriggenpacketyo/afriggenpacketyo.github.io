          <p>Tesla announced a 12% increase in its third-quarter revenue, reaching $28.10 billion and marking a return to growth after two consecutive quarters of decline. This figure surpassed analysts' estimates, which had projected revenue of $26.37 billion. Despite the positive revenue report, the company's adjusted earnings per share came in at 50 cents, missing the 54 cents anticipated by LSEG analysts. The revenue growth was partly driven by a 6% increase in the automotive sector, potentially influenced by consumers rushing to purchase vehicles before the expiration of federal electric vehicle tax credits under a new presidential spending bill.

          <p>President Donald Trump recently hosted a White House dinner for News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch, despite an active $10 billion defamation lawsuit Trump filed against him. The lawsuit stems from a Wall Street Journal report about a risqué letter allegedly sent by Trump to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday. The dinner, attended by Murdoch's wife and key executives from his media companies, occurred just days before Trump's legal team filed a response opposing Murdoch's motion to dismiss the case. This event highlights the complex and often contradictory relationship between the president and Murdoch's influential conservative media empire, which includes frequent allies like Fox News and the New York Post.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 16:13:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers may face higher costs for their Thanksgiving centerpiece this year, as wholesale prices for frozen turkeys have surged to $1.32 per pound, a 40% increase from 2024. The price hike is primarily attributed to a shrinking supply, caused by long-term declines in turkey farming and recent outbreaks of avian flu that have affected over three million birds this year alone. In response, major retailers like Walmart and Aldi are offering competitive deals on turkeys, using them as "loss leaders" to attract shoppers. While wholesale prices are up significantly, food economists suggest that the increase for consumers at the grocery store will likely be smaller, as retailers absorb some of the cost to remain competitive.</p>

          <h2>Israeli Parliament Advances West Bank Annexation Bills Despite U.S. Opposition</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's stated opposition to Israeli annexation of the West Bank, lawmakers in Israel's Knesset have advanced two bills proposing such a move. The preliminary vote occurred during a visit from U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who is in the region to support a fragile Gaza ceasefire. One bill proposes annexing the large Israeli settlement of Maale Adumim, while the other calls for annexing the entire territory. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly urged his party members to abstain, framing the vote as a provocation by the opposition. The move was condemned by Palestinian and Jordanian officials as a violation of international law and a threat to the two-state solution.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has confirmed that U.S. forces conducted a strike on a vessel in the Pacific Ocean believed to be transporting drugs, resulting in the deaths of two individuals on board. This marks the eighth such operation against suspected drug boats since early September but the first to occur in the Pacific. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated the vessel was known to U.S. intelligence and was operating in a known trafficking route in international waters. The Trump administration has defined its actions as part of a "non-international armed conflict" with drug-trafficking organizations, a policy that has resulted in at least 34 fatalities in recent months and has increased tensions with regional allies like Colombia.</p>

          <h2>Economic Analysis Suggests Americans Could Receive Larger Tax Refunds in 2026</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 16:10:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis from Oxford Economics projects that many American taxpayers could see larger tax refunds in 2026 due to retroactive provisions in the Republicans' recently enacted tax law. The law extends previous tax cuts and introduces new breaks, such as eliminating taxes on some overtime income and raising the cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions. Because the IRS has not yet updated its withholding tables to reflect these changes, many employees are likely overpaying taxes this year. This overpayment could result in an additional $50 billion in total taxpayer savings, though the report notes that a disproportionate share of these benefits will likely accrue to upper-income households.

          <p>An American missionary, who has worked in Niger since 2010, was reportedly abducted from his home in the capital city of Niamey by three armed men. The kidnapping occurred in a highly secured district, merely 100 yards from the presidential palace where the nation's ousted president has been held since a 2023 coup. The U.S. Embassy has issued a security alert, acknowledging a heightened risk of kidnapping for American citizens and implementing stricter safety protocols for its personnel. Regional security officials speculate that the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, an ISIS affiliate active in the region, may be responsible for the abduction, as the victim's phone was briefly tracked to an area they control.</p>

Speaking to French senators, she revealed that the museum's perimeter CCTV system was "aging" and "very unsatisfactory," with the only camera near the entry point facing the wrong direction. This lapse allowed the gang to approach undetected with a lorry and ladder to access a first-floor gallery. Des Cars stated, "We failed these jewels," and highlighted long-standing budget challenges and obsolete equipment as contributing factors. While a damaged 19th-century crown was recovered, a major hunt is still underway for the four thieves and the eight priceless pieces they escaped with.</p>

Despite a promising start and reducing Australia to 68-4, England was unable to capitalize, as a powerful 180-run partnership between Annabel Sutherland and Ash Gardner secured a commanding victory for the Australians. The match highlighted Australia's depth, as different players consistently step up to rescue the team from difficult situations. In contrast, England's middle order appeared less reliable, struggling against Australia's disciplined bowling and ultimately falling short in a crucial encounter between the historic rivals.</p>

          <p>Atlantic Container Line (ACL), a U.S.-based ocean carrier, has been hit with an unexpected $34 million annual tariff bill due to last-minute changes in new port fees enacted by the Trump administration.

ACL's CEO, Andrew Abbott, expressed shock, stating the company has always been considered a container vessel and that the new classification is a bureaucratic oversight. He warned that the substantial cost could force the company to cease U.S. operations, disrupting supply chains for American manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CBS News poll reveals that support for California's Proposition 50, a state redistricting measure, is heavily influenced by national politics and opposition to President Trump. Voters who view the proposition as a national issue are overwhelmingly in favor, citing it as a way to oppose the Trump administration, which many feel treats California unfairly. Conversely, those who see it as a state-level issue tend to oppose it, fearing a power shift from rural areas to cities. This national sentiment in the heavily-Democratic state is currently giving the "yes" campaign a majority lead. The poll also indicates that a majority of Californians oppose the president's deportation program and feel his policies are making them financially worse off.</p>

This contrasts with past acquisition strategies that prioritized retaining startup culture and talent.

          <p>Police in Fullerton, California, discovered the bodies of four individuals inside an apartment after receiving a call from a friend who reported they had overdosed and were not breathing. Authorities have launched a death investigation but have not yet confirmed the cause of death or the identities of the deceased. While police stated there is no immediate threat to the public, the incident occurs amid growing concern over drug use in Orange County. According to the county's Health Care Agency, the death rate from opioid overdoses nearly tripled between 2017 and 2021, highlighting a significant public health crisis in the region.</p>

          <p>A White House official has confirmed that the "entirety of the East Wing will be modernized" to accommodate President Trump's new $250 million ballroom, a project far more extensive than initially described. Previously, the president stated the ballroom would be built near the East Wing but not touch it. However, recent photographs show widespread demolition of the structure, which housed offices for the first lady and other staff. The White House defended the project as a "bold, necessary addition," comparing it to historic renovations by past presidents. The move has drawn criticism from historic preservation groups and former officials, who are concerned about the scale of the demolition and lack of public review.</p>

          <p>The United States and Qatar have jointly demanded that the European Union roll back new climate and human rights regulations, calling them an "existential threat" that could hinder imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG). In a letter, the major gas exporters warned that the EU's directive, which requires suppliers to report on emissions and human rights protections, could jeopardize investments and trade agreements. This move is part of a broader Trump administration effort to boost fossil fuel use globally, which includes approving a controversial new LNG export terminal in Louisiana. Environmental groups have condemned the pressure, highlighting that LNG can be more harmful to the climate than coal when transportation is factored in.</p>

          <h2>Homebuyers Weigh Pros and Cons of Locking Mortgage Rates Ahead of Expected Fed Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 14:55:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates again in October and December, homebuyers are debating whether to lock in current mortgage rates or wait for potentially lower ones. Locking a rate now provides certainty for budgeting and protects against unexpected market spikes, a real possibility given recent volatility. However, with rate cuts looking highly probable, waiting could lead to significant savings on a long-term loan. A key consideration is that lenders may charge a "float down" fee to switch to a lower rate after locking, which could negate some of the potential benefits of waiting for further rate reductions.

          <p>Gold prices continued to fall on Wednesday, dropping over 1% after a sharp 5.7% decline on Tuesday, which was the metal's worst single-day performance since 2013. The selloff follows a weeks-long rally that saw gold futures hit a record high of nearly $4,400 per ounce on Monday. According to analysts at UBS, the pullback is not driven by macroeconomic events but is largely a technical correction as speculative investors take profits amid slowing price momentum. Despite the recent drop, analysts believe the fundamental drivers for gold, including inflation and political instability, persist, suggesting it is premature to turn negative on the precious metal.

          <p>A migrant who was removed to France under the UK's new "one in, one out" removal scheme has reportedly returned to the UK on a small boat less than a month later. The Iranian national, who was the third person sent to France under the pilot program, claimed he came back because he feared for his life at the hands of smuggling gangs. The Home Office confirmed a migrant had been detained and their removal was being sought. The incident highlights challenges for the new policy, which is intended to deter Channel crossings by returning some migrants to France in exchange for the UK accepting recognized refugees who have not made the illegal journey.</p>

          <p>Andrzej Poczobut, a Belarusian journalist and outspoken critic of leader Alexander Lukashenko, has been awarded the 2025 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought by the European Parliament. Poczobut, a correspondent for a Polish newspaper, was arrested in 2021 and sentenced to eight years in a penal colony on charges of harming national security and inciting hatred. Despite offers of freedom if he agreed to leave Belarus, he has refused to submit to the regime. His colleague believes Lukashenko is personally offended by Poczobut's reporting and symbolism. The prestigious human rights award recognizes his courage, though it is uncertain if it will improve his situation, as international pressure has often led Lukashenko to intensify his autocratic rule.</p>

Vecchione assured analysts that the bank has since reverified titles and liens on all large loans in its portfolio and found no other irregularities. The reassurance helped calm markets, but analysts suggest the incident has left a lasting mark on the regional banking sector, with investors remaining wary of potential hidden risks.

Set during a single drunken party in 1950s England, the film sharpens the original's rage, portraying Hedda as a clever but violently bored newlywed who unleashes her frustrations on those around her. The review praises DaCosta for smartly tightening the narrative and layering in modern themes of race and sexuality, including gender-swapping a key character. Thompson is lauded for her confident and menacing portrayal of the complex antihero, capturing her feverish mood shifts and destructive impulses in a performance deemed divine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For married retirees facing financial pressure from inflation, a reverse mortgage can provide access to home equity, but the process involves specific rules for couples. To qualify for the most common type, a HECM, both spouses must typically be at least 62 years old and be listed as co-borrowers to ensure both can remain in the home. The loan amount is calculated based on the age of the younger spouse, which may result in a smaller sum than if based on the older partner's age. This article explains that while these loans can eliminate existing mortgage payments and supplement income, couples must carefully consider the long-term implications before proceeding.

          <p>President Trump has attempted to frame the government shutdown as a political weapon that harms only "Democrat things," while taking steps to protect his supporters. He has repurposed funds to pay troops and federal law enforcement and maintain certain nutrition programs. However, this analysis argues that the strategy is failing, as key Trump constituencies like farmers are already being hurt by the halt in agricultural aid and the closure of small-business lending programs. As the shutdown continues, the negative impacts are spreading to rural communities and Trump-friendly states with high numbers of federal workers, undermining the president's claim that he can selectively shield his base from the consequences.</p>
