            <p>A Trump-appointed judge rejected the White House's request to delay restoring the Associated Press's access to the White House press pool. Judge Trevor McFadden stated that the White House cherry-picked testimony and misconstrued facts in its effort to seek a stay of his order. McFadden reiterated his finding that the Trump White House retaliated against the Associated Press in violation of its First Amendment rights. The judge also scolded the Justice Department for changing its legal arguments, stating that the First Amendment outweighs separation-of-powers concerns.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump underwent his annual physical at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, his first such exam of his second term. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the president's physician will provide an update on the report in the effort of transparency, adding as many results as possible, and as soon as we possibly can. In 2018, Trump appeared to be in "excellent" cardiovascular shape for his age, according to then-White House physician Dr. Ronny Jackson. On July 13, gunfire erupted at a Trump campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, killing a Trump supporter and wounding Trump and six others, according to investigators.</p>

            <p>The article argues that the Trump administration's policies are jeopardizing American leadership in artificial intelligence. Despite outward support for AI, cuts to federal research funding and restrictions on immigration are undermining the foundations of scientific innovation.

It warns that the US risks falling behind other countries like Canada, Europe, and China in AI development, potentially leading to an AI oligopoly dominated by a few large companies.</p>

            <p>A U.S. judge has ruled that the Trump administration can deport Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate, over his involvement in pro-Palestinian protests. The ruling cites a Cold War-era immigration law, stating Khalil's presence in the U.S. is adverse to American foreign policy interests. Khalil, a legal permanent resident, claims his arrest is a direct consequence of speaking out for Palestinian rights. The ACLU criticized the decision as "pre-written," citing the government's reliance on a letter from Secretary of State Marco Rubio targeting Khalil's speech.</p>

            <p>A federal judge sided with the Trump administration, ruling that immigration agents can conduct enforcement operations at houses of worship. The ruling rejects a lawsuit filed by religious groups, who argued the policy violated their right to practice religion and caused attendance to decline. The judge found insufficient evidence that the decline was specifically linked to the church policy, as opposed to broader immigration enforcement actions. The ruling allows ICE to conduct operations in places of worship without a supervisor's approval.</p>
