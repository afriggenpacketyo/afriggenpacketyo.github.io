          <p>Danish jewelry brand Pandora is preparing for potential price increases across the affordable jewelry sector due to proposed U.S. tariff hikes. CEO Alexander Lacik stated that while current 10% tariffs are manageable, higher 'reciprocal' rates would significantly impact manufacturers who rely on Asian production. Pandora, heavily dependent on manufacturing in Thailand, Vietnam, India, and China, previously warned of a substantial revenue hit from tariffs announced in April. The company has modeled various scenarios to determine the final figure for potential consumer price rises, suggesting the increase will likely be industry-wide. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter results revealed earnings exceeding analyst expectations, but revenue fell short of anticipated growth, causing a 5% stock drop. Revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $11.53 billion, while net income rose to $1.78 billion, a significant improvement from the previous year's net loss. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi anticipates gross bookings between $45.75 billion and $47.25 billion for the current quarter. The company faces an FTC lawsuit over 'deceptive billing and cancellation practices' related to its Uber One subscription service, which Khosrowshahi disputes. Uber is also expanding its autonomous vehicle initiatives with partnerships and has reached an annual run-rate of 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips.</p>

The victim was discovered by police and relatives, with zip ties around his neck and injuries to his head and face.

          <p>A new approach to fighting respiratory diseases, called 'far-UVC,' is showing promise. This type of ultraviolet light can kill airborne pathogens without harming human skin or eyes. Imagine placing lamps in schools, hospitals, and offices to eliminate the majority of airborne diseases. New advancements in solid-state lamps and secondary harmonics are making far-UVC disinfection cheaper and more accessible. Research is also tentatively suggesting that the ozone effects of far-UVC are not concerningly large, particularly when lamps are placed on the ceiling to minimize exposure.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed an electronic warfare device capable of creating the illusion of a fleet of warships from a single vessel. This technology, detailed in the Journal of Systems Engineering and Electronics, uses networked 1-bit jammers to send signals that deceive enemy radar. The intention is to trick incoming missiles into targeting these 'ghost' fleets, allowing real warships to evade detection. The anti-ship missile targets a fleet of eight Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army warships showing on its radar.</p>

          <p>The National Trust for Historic Preservation has released its 2025 list of America's 11 most endangered historic places, highlighting sites at risk from various threats such as natural disasters, neglect, and lack of awareness. This year's list includes not only buildings, but entire communities, such as a smattering of islands off Florida's northwest coast. The list aims to raise awareness and encourage preservation efforts, inviting communities to rebuild and develop plans that support their cultural heritage and resilience. The group has been issuing an annual list of U.S. sites at risk since 1988.</p>

          <p>This article explores the history of romantic advice columns, from The Athenian Mercury in the 17th century to modern online forums. Early columns, often framed as 'ladies issues,' addressed timeless dilemmas of love and relationships, reflecting evolving gender politics. Prominent 20th-century columnists like Dorothy Dix and Elsie Robinson offered progressive views on women's rights, while others reinforced traditional gender roles. Today, crowdsourced advice online is more democratic but also more diffuse, reflecting both greater autonomy and confusion in navigating modern relationships.</p>

          <p>The buildings along Tuna Street on Terminal Island, remnants of a once-thriving Japanese American fishing village, have been designated as one of America's 11 most endangered historic places. The designation aims to highlight the significance of the site, which serves as a reminder of the forced removal and incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II. The Port of Los Angeles is considering demolishing the buildings to expand container storage, but preservationists advocate for their protection and reuse as community-serving establishments that commemorate the history of the area.</p>

          <p>Many Afghans residing in the U.S., including those who aided U.S. forces, are living in fear of being deported back to Afghanistan, where they risk torture or death. President Trump's administration is ending the CBP One function for new applicants and declining to renew Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghans, putting them at risk of deportation. Immigration attorneys advise Afghans without citizenship to avoid expressing negative opinions about the administration to minimize their risk of being targeted. While some Republicans urge the administration to prioritize the safety of Afghans who helped U.S. troops, the situation remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Following India's airstrikes on alleged militant positions in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, tensions have risen between the two nations. Pakistan has condemned the strikes as 'unprovoked' and claims to have shot down five Indian aircraft, which India has not confirmed. Experts believe a retaliation from Pakistan is inevitable, potentially escalating the conflict. Diplomacy is expected to play a crucial role in managing the situation and preventing further escalation, with concerns that the situation could spiral into a broader conflict.</p>

This comes after the 1990 World Cup, when the rule was changed to benefit the striker. Wenger believes that the use of VAR has eliminated the previous advantage given to the striker, leading to frustration. He proposes the new rule to restore some of that advantage.</p>
