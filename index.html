          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a new record high for the third consecutive day, driven by optimism surrounding ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S., despite broader losses across other Asian markets. The index briefly touched an intraday high before stabilizing, while the small-cap Kosdaq saw a slight decline. This positive performance stood out against weaker trends in regions like Hong Kong, Japan, and Australia, which were influenced by U.S. banking sector fears and escalating trade tensions. The article also noted Chinese automaker BYD's stock fall due to a major vehicle recall, illustrating diverse market pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peru's interim government announced a state of emergency in the capital, Lima, following clashes between anti-government protesters and police that turned deadly. For weeks, youth-led demonstrations have voiced grievances over low wages, corruption, and organized crime, culminating in one protester's death and over 180 injuries among demonstrators and police. Interim President Jose Jeri, who replaced the ousted Dina Doluarte, has refused to step down, emphasizing his commitment to national stability and seeking legislative authority on public safety issues.

          <p>An immigration barrister, Chowdhury Rahman, faces a potential disciplinary probe after a judge ruled he used AI tools like ChatGPT, citing "entirely fictitious" or "wholly irrelevant" cases in an asylum appeal. The judge, Mark Blundell, found Mr. Rahman attempted to conceal this, wasting tribunal time while representing two Honduran sisters. The original asylum claim was dismissed, and Mr. Rahman's subsequent appeal was also rejected due to his flawed research. Judge Blundell concluded it was "overwhelmingly likely" Mr. Rahman used generative AI to formulate appeal grounds, leading to misleading submissions and a possible report to the Bar Standards Board.</p>

          <p>The UK Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, condemned the decision to prevent Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending their Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham, calling it "the wrong decision." The city's Safety Advisory Group, supported by West Midlands Police, advised the ban due to a "high-risk" classification and concerns over potential protests and violent clashes, referencing previous incidents between Maccabi Tel Aviv and Ajax fans. Opposition leaders and the Jewish Leadership Council also criticized the move, with some calling it a "national disgrace" and urging a reversal, highlighting broader concerns about antisemitism and safety for Jewish communities in Britain.</p>

          <p>AC Milan's 17-year-old striker, Francesco Camarda, is generating significant buzz as a potential future star for Italy, having already broken several records in his precocious career. He became the youngest player to score a Serie A goal for Lecce and the youngest to debut for AC Milan and in the Champions League, where a goal was disallowed by VAR. Camarda, who has scored over 500 goals in youth football, recently netted a Panenka penalty on his Italy Under-21s debut, showcasing composure and ruthlessness. Despite high expectations, he remains focused on his development, with Milan securing him on a contract until 2028 to fend off interest from top European clubs.</p>

          <p>Micron plans to cease supplying server chips to data centers in China, sources indicate, after its business failed to recover from a 2023 government ban on its products in critical Chinese infrastructure. This strategic exit follows Beijing's retaliatory actions against U.S. tech curbs, significantly impacting Micron's revenue from mainland China. While the company will continue sales to specific Chinese customers with data center operations outside China and to the auto and mobile phone sectors, it has largely missed out on China's booming data center expansion, benefiting rivals like Samsung and SK Hynix amidst escalating U.S.-Sino trade tensions.

          <p>Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney expressed skepticism regarding Marcus Rashford's recent claim that an "inconsistent environment" was responsible for his fluctuating performance at the club. Rashford, who scored 30 goals in the 2022-23 season but later fell out of favor and was loaned to Aston Villa, is now thriving at Barcelona. Rooney, while acknowledging environmental factors, suggested that a player's application and effort are ultimately their own responsibility. He argued that aspects like running more are unrelated to the environment, implying Rashford's explanation might be an "easy one to throw at people" rather than a true reflection of his own accountability.</p>

The U.S. asserts these strikes target suspected drug traffickers, a claim disputed by Venezuela and some U.S. Democrats who question their legality.

          <p>New York City mayoral candidates Zohran Mamdani, Andrew Cuomo, and Curtis Sliwa clashed in their debate, with President Donald Trump's influence on the city a major theme. Mamdani and Cuomo attacked each other's qualifications, with Mamdani touting integrity and lived experience against Cuomo's executive background, while Cuomo questioned Mamdani's inexperience. Tensions also rose over Israel and the ceasefire in Gaza, with Mamdani clarifying his stance and Cuomo facing scrutiny for past actions. Sliwa, the Republican, positioned himself as an outsider, criticizing both opponents while none of the candidates endorsed Governor Kathy Hochul's re-election.</p>

          <h2>China Leverages Rare Earth Export Curbs as Key Advantage in Trade War with U.S.</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has introduced sweeping new curbs on rare earth exports, a strategic move tightening its near-monopoly on critical minerals and giving it significant leverage in the trade war with the U.S. The article explains that foreign companies now require Chinese government approval for exporting products containing even tiny amounts of rare earths, along with declaring their intended use. This action, which prompted threats of increased tariffs from President Trump, is seen by analysts as designed to "shock the system" and secure an upper hand for China in upcoming trade negotiations, despite rare earths making up a small part of China's economy.

          <p>The first long-acting injection to prevent HIV, cabotegravir (CAB-LA), has been approved for use on the NHS in England and Wales, aligning with Scotland's policy. This injection, administered six times a year, offers an alternative to daily pills for HIV-negative individuals at high risk, aiming to enhance convenience and discretion. Experts hope this "game-changing" treatment will significantly contribute to the UK's goal of ending new HIV cases by 2030, particularly benefiting vulnerable populations for whom oral PrEP is challenging. The article notes the NHS has secured a discount for the treatment, which will be available in sexual health clinics.</p>

          <p>A Black police sergeant, Tracey Reid, alleges racial discrimination at a Georgia Chick-fil-A after his white colleagues were offered complimentary meals while he was asked to pay. The incident occurred during a work trip, with all officers in uniform, leading Reid to feel "humiliated and embarrassed." He subsequently wrote a letter to Chick-fil-A corporate, demanding employee retraining and stronger civil rights compliance policies. The restaurant's owner-operator apologized for the "unintentional impact," attributing it to an "honest oversight." However, Reid and his colleagues maintain it was a clear racial issue, not merely a perception, highlighting systemic concerns.</p>

          <p>The latest U.S. military strike against a suspected drug vessel in the Caribbean has reportedly yielded survivors, marking a first for these operations and raising new questions about aid and custody. Prior strikes had resulted in at least 27 deaths with no survivors, drawing criticism from legal experts and Democratic lawmakers over adherence to laws of war. The Trump administration justifies these actions by labeling targets as "narcoterrorists," a stance challenged by Venezuela. This development occurs amidst a U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean and follows the surprise announcement of the Southern Command admiral's early retirement, adding to regional tensions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court panel denied the Trump administration's request to lift an order blocking the president from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals found the deployment a "likely violation" of the Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers to the states. The court also determined the administration was "unlikely to succeed" in proving a "rebellion" against the U.S. government or an inability to execute law with regular forces, despite Trump's claims of crime prevention in Chicago. The decision maintains the block on federalized Guardsmen within Illinois, asserting that "political opposition is not rebellion."</p>
