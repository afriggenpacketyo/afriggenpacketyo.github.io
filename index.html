            <p>Several Democratic members of Congress are working to bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a deportee and accused MS-13 member, back to the U.S. from El Salvador.

            <p>The UK government has introduced a temporary ban on individuals bringing cheese and certain meats from the EU into Great Britain to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease. This ban applies to pork, beef, lamb, milk, and dairy products, regardless of packaging, but excludes poultry. The measure targets travelers from the EU, not commercial importers who face stricter standards. While harmless to humans, foot and mouth disease is highly contagious among livestock, leading to potential economic consequences.</p>

            <p>A large-scale blind taste test conducted by NECTAR compared 122 plant-based meat products to their animal meat counterparts. While animal meats received higher overall scores, some plant-based products, particularly those from Impossible Foods, were rated equally or better than their animal-based versions by a significant portion of participants. The study suggests that negative perceptions of plant-based meat may be influenced by biases and preconceived expectations. To increase consumer adoption, the plant-based meat industry needs to improve not only taste and price but also address psychological and social factors.</p>

            <p>Intel could face significant revenue pressure in China due to Beijing's new tariffs targeting U.S.-made goods, according to Wells Fargo. China accounted for 29% of Intel's revenue in 2024, making the company particularly exposed. Companies like Qualcomm and AMD, which outsource chip production to TSMC, are being exempted, while chips produced in U.S.-based fabs are subject to tariffs of 84% or more. This could accelerate Intel's market share loss in China. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>American Express's affluent cardmembers show little sign of curbing spending despite tariff jitters, according to CFO Christophe Le Caillec. Billed business on AmEx cards rose 6% in the first quarter, driven by younger customers. This contrasts with warnings of a spending slowdown from Synchrony Financial, which caters to a different demographic. While some small businesses may be building inventory due to tariff concerns, AmEx's wealthier customer base appears insulated from broader economic anxieties. (not investment advice)</p>

He also criticized the letter for barely mentioning Hamas's role in the breakdown of hostage release negotiations.

            <p>Tax attorneys describe the IRS as a "zombie" due to staff cuts and halted audits of the wealthy. The IRS is expected to lose about a third of its staff, leading to fewer audits and reviews. Wealthy taxpayers may exploit aggressive tax-planning techniques that escape review. A Yale Budget Lab study projects a significant drop in tax revenue over the next decade due to these cuts, which will disproportionately impact collections from the wealthy.</p>

            <p>An essay discusses the contrast between French and American literature about work, noting the focus on blue-collar labor in recent French works. Claire Baglin’s debut novel, On the Clock, provides detailed insight into the realities of blue-collar labor, specifically working at a fast-food restaurant. The essay explores how work shapes identity and the challenges faced by working-class individuals. It also touches on the French "class defector" narrative, where authors critique both working-class and middle-class milieus.</p>

The plan involves launching hundreds of satellites to detect and track missiles, with a separate fleet for interception. SpaceX proposes a subscription service model, which could expedite deployment but raise concerns about long-term control and pricing. The initiative could mark a significant win for Silicon Valley in defense contracting.</p>

Google plans to appeal the decision, arguing that the government focused too narrowly on certain ads.</p>
