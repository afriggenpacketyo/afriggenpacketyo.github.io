        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva has voiced frustration over Premier League scheduling, claiming his team was at an "unfair advantage" against Arsenal. City had only 66 hours to recover from a Champions League match before facing Arsenal, who had significantly more rest time after their European game. Silva, supported by manager Pep Guardiola, argued that such tight turnarounds for crucial matches are not right and impact players' physical condition, calling for more common sense in fixture planning.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines, which has filed for bankruptcy twice this year, is furloughing about one-third of its flight attendant workforce, affecting approximately 1,800 employees. The move, effective December 1, is part of a broader restructuring effort to align staffing with reduced flight capacity and cut costs. The airline has cited low demand for domestic leisure travel and a shift in consumer preference toward premium experiences as key drivers of its financial difficulties.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has allowed Danish energy company Orsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind farm, overturning a stop-work order issued by the Trump administration. The project, located off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut, is 80% complete and is expected to power over 350,000 homes. This ruling represents a significant setback for the administration's efforts to halt the development of the offshore wind industry in the United States, which officials have described as too expensive and unreliable.</p>

          <p>Parents across the United States are contending with mixed messages regarding childhood vaccinations from both federal and state authorities, leading to confusion and uncertainty. Recent changes include a CDC advisory panel delaying a vote on the hepatitis B shot at birth and stopping a universal recommendation for the COVID-19 vaccine. This divergence in guidance is causing concern among pediatricians, who worry that decisions are being influenced more by politics than by established medical science, potentially leading to an increase in preventable childhood illnesses.</p>

The suspension followed pressure from the Trump administration after Kimmel criticized the conservative response to the assassination of activist Charlie Kirk. The letter, signed by stars like Tom Hanks and Lin-Manuel Miranda, condemns the government's actions as a threat to free speech, likening the current climate to a "modern McCarthy era."</p>

          <p>A Guardian editorial argues that Donald Trump's recent admission that he hates his opponents exemplifies a dangerous approach to politics that weaponizes speech and state power. The article contends that his administration is creating a climate of reprisal where dissent is treated as a security threat, blurring the line between truth and lies for political gain. This strategy inverts the American model of free speech by selectively punishing critics while degrading the conditions for honest debate, ultimately subverting the principles of self-government.</p>

          <p>Newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran has made a case for significant cuts to the central bank's benchmark interest rate, arguing it is currently far too high. Miran contends that policy changes in taxes, immigration, and deregulation, along with cooling rental costs, have created an economic environment that allows for substantial rate reductions. His view, however, places him in dissent with the majority of the Federal Open Market Committee, which currently favors a more cautious, gradual approach to lowering rates.

          <p>With gold prices surging to a record high above $3,700 per ounce, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty. Experts suggest that rather than buying physical gold bars or coins, the most efficient way to gain exposure is through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of bullion. Financial advisors generally recommend limiting gold allocation to a small percentage of a diversified portfolio, despite its recent strong performance. (not investment advice)</p>
