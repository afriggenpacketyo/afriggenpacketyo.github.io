The investigation revealed that Pegg had undeclared debts, making her vulnerable to corruption and blackmail, and she communicated with Saunderson via a burner phone. Saunderson, who is currently serving a 35-year sentence, used aliases from popular television shows during his criminal activities.</p>

          <p>A vote on a significant bill aimed at advancing President Donald Trump's agenda failed in the House Budget Committee due to objections from Republican hard-liners, causing a setback for Speaker Mike Johnson. Representatives Andrew Clyde, Josh Brecheen, Lloyd Smucker, Ralph Norman, and Chip Roy voted against the bill, citing concerns that the savings would not take effect until after Trump leaves office. House Republican leaders will continue negotiations to resolve the issue, but the ordeal has tested Johnson's speakership as he tries to unite the various factions of his conference. Despite the delay, there is still a possibility that the bill could pass before the Memorial Day recess.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An increasing number of retirees are claiming Social Security benefits earlier than planned, driven by anxieties about the economy and potential changes to the Social Security Administration under the Trump administration. According to the Urban Institute, claims have risen by 13% this fiscal year, with agency officials acknowledging that fear-mongering has influenced this decision. While claiming early may provide immediate relief, it results in a substantially lower lifetime payment compared to waiting until full retirement age or later. Financial planners advise viewing Social Security as longevity insurance, as delaying benefits can provide a better return than private annuities, especially for those who anticipate a longer lifespan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis suggests that the Republican tax plan, while potentially offering modest gains to everyday workers, could disproportionately benefit the wealthy and leave some low-income taxpayers worse off. The Penn Wharton Budget Model found that many Americans earning less than $51,000 annually could see their after-tax income decrease beginning in 2026 due to proposed spending cuts in programs like Medicaid and food stamps. Conversely, the top 0.1 percent of earners could gain significantly, benefiting from tax cuts for the wealthy and favorable changes for businesses. While Republicans argue the plan will stimulate economic growth, critics contend that the benefits are skewed toward higher-income individuals.</p>

Piastri headed Norris in both sessions, ending the day just 0.025 seconds quicker. Alpine's Pierre Gasly was a surprise third quickest, ahead of the Mercedes of George Russell, Red Bull's Max Verstappen, and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. Although Ferrari appeared to be struggling for speed over a single qualifying lap, Leclerc and Hamilton both appeared to be mixing it with the McLarens for race pace later in the session.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill faced a significant setback when conservatives blocked it from advancing out of the House Budget Committee. Republicans have yet to resolve several disputes that have threatened to derail what Mr. Trump calls his "big, beautiful bill" as more conservative members and blue-state Republicans dig in on their demands. Five Republicans voted against advancing the legislation, citing that the bill does not go far enough to slash federal spending. House Speaker Mike Johnson remains committed to putting the legislation on the floor before Memorial Day despite the disagreements.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump accused former FBI Director James Comey of calling for his assassination through a coded social media post. Comey posted a photo of seashells arranged to spell the numbers "8647", which some in Trump's orbit interpreted as a call to "86," or get rid of, the 47th president. Trump claimed Comey knew exactly what the numbers meant and that it was a clear call for assassination. Comey has denied that his Instagram post was a threat to Trump, saying he didn't realize some folks associate those numbers with violence and that he opposes violence of any kind.</p>

          <p>U.S. consumer sentiment has dropped to its second-lowest level on record, according to a University of Michigan survey, as concerns about tariffs leading to higher inflation intensify. The index of consumer sentiment fell to 50.8 in May, driven by tariffs mentioned by nearly three-quarters of consumers. Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 7.3%, while long-term inflation expectations increased to 4.6%. The survey was largely completed before the U.S. and China announced a 90-day pause on most tariffs, and economists generally agree that tariffs could cause a short-term increase in prices.</p>

As these communities rebuild, past disasters like Hurricane Katrina tell a story of permanent displacement for some, since wealthier homeowners are far more likely to ultimately return than poorer ones, and investors are more likely to buy the less expensive properties.</p>
