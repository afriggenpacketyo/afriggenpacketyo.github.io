            <p>An inquiry by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has found that 'professional failures,' including an 'operational misunderstanding' and a 'breach of orders,' led to the deaths of 15 emergency workers in Gaza last month. The incident occurred when a convoy of ambulances, a UN car, and a fire truck came under fire by Israeli troops who believed they were facing a threat from enemy forces. The IDF maintains that six of the casualties were Hamas members, a claim disputed by the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS). The deputy commander involved has been dismissed, and another officer will be reprimanded following the investigation.</p>

            <p>Both Ukraine and Russia accused each other of violating the one-day Easter ceasefire announced by President Vladimir Putin. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported numerous instances of Russian shelling and drone strikes, while Russia's Defense Ministry claimed Ukrainian forces launched attacks in the Donetsk region and sent drones into Russian territory. Despite the mutual accusations, Zelenskyy noted a decrease in air raid sirens, calling it a "good thing." The apparent failure of the ceasefire follows President Trump's assertion that negotiations between the two countries are nearing a critical point.</p>

            <p>Downtown Los Angeles experienced a significant blow to its urban canopy as vandals used chainsaws to cut down numerous shade trees along South Grand Street and other areas.

            <p>A draft executive order from the Trump administration proposes significant changes to the U.S. State Department, including the closure of American embassies in Southern Africa and the elimination of bureaus focused on democracy, human rights, and international organizations. The order aims to "streamline mission delivery, project American strength abroad, cut waste, fraud, abuse and align the Department with an American First Strategic Doctrine." The order also suggests changes to the hiring practices, favoring candidates who show "alignment with the president's foreign policy vision."</p>

            <p>The felling of a 500-year-old oak tree in Enfield, London, by Toby Carvery has sparked outrage and grief among local residents. The tree, located in Whitewebbs Park, was felled after the restaurant chain claimed it received advice that the tree was dead and posed a safety risk. Locals have expressed disbelief at the tree's condition, questioning the decision and demanding answers about the use of the felled wood. Protests have been held, and the incident has reignited concerns about the park's future development.</p>

Van Hollen said of the Salvadoran government, "they go to great lengths to deceive people," outlining how drinks were brought to the table as photos were taken during his meeting with Abrego Garcia, adding that "no one touched them."</p>

Trump also called for its tax-exempt status to be revoked, a potentially illegal move, against the world-famous college in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>

            <p>President Donald Trump’s Justice Department is defending the Affordable Care Act before the Supreme Court – a notable contrast to his first term, when his administration sought to repeal the law in Congress and then refused to defend it in a major challenge brought by GOP-led states. The case is part of the latest wave of conservative legal attacks on the Affordable Care Act, but one that doesn’t threaten to take down the landmark health reform law, which has expanded health insurance coverage to tens of millions of Americans. The challengers argue that mandates are unconstitutional because, under Obamacare, they come from a task force whose membership hasn’t been Senate confirmed.</p>
