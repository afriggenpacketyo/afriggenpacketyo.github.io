          <h2>Palantir Shares Plunge Amid Analyst Concerns Over International Growth</h2>

          <p>Palantir's stock experienced a significant drop after analysts expressed worries about the company's international commercial revenue decline, despite overall revenue growth acceleration. William Blair analyst Louie DiPalma highlighted that Palantir's high software multiple makes it susceptible to compression as revenue growth potentially slows down. While the company exceeded revenue expectations and raised its revenue guidance for the year, investors seemed concerned about the sequential margin decline. CEO Alex Karp remained optimistic, stating that Palantir is "on fire" due to its investments and a cultural shift in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Senator Thom Tillis, a key Republican, announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin for U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, citing Martin's support for criminal defendants in the January 6th Capitol riot cases. Tillis's decision effectively dooms Martin's chances of Senate confirmation, as his lack of support means the nomination is unlikely to advance from the Senate Judiciary Committee. Martin is currently serving as interim U.S. Attorney for D.C., but his term is set to expire soon. Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley signaled the nomination's peril by not including it on the committee's agenda.</p>

          <p>Newark Liberty International Airport is experiencing significant delays and cancellations due to a combination of air traffic control staffing shortages, equipment malfunctions, and ongoing runway construction. System outages, including controllers' screens going dark, have exacerbated the problems, leading to ground delays and stops. The FAA has cited staffing levels in Philadelphia, where the air traffic control center overseeing Newark's airspace is based, as a contributing factor. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy visited the Philadelphia TRACON facility to address the situation, and United Airlines has reduced its Newark schedule in response to the challenges.</p>

          <p>Port Sudan, previously a haven for civilians fleeing Sudan's civil war, has been targeted by a series of drone attacks attributed to the Rapid Support Forces (R.S.F.). The attacks struck a fuel depot, the airport, and a hotel, causing large plumes of smoke and prompting the Sudanese military to sever diplomatic ties with the United Arab Emirates, accused of arming the R.S.F. The violence marks a significant escalation in the conflict, which has already resulted in an estimated 150,000 deaths and displaced millions.

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the White House amidst escalating tensions between the two nations. Relations have been strained due to Trump's tariffs and comments about potentially making Canada the 51st state. Carney has pledged to stand firm against Trump's policies and has stated that Canada will only engage in trade and security talks on its own terms. Trump has imposed import tariffs on Canadian goods, citing concerns about fentanyl and migrants entering the U.S., leading to retaliatory tariffs from Canada.</p>

The city argues that GEO Group began operating the facility without a valid certificate of occupancy, prompting a tense standoff.

          <p>A late payment can significantly damage your credit score, impacting loan rates, apartment rentals, and job opportunities. While it stays on your report for seven years, its impact lessens over time. Strategies to remove it include requesting a goodwill adjustment from the creditor with a written letter, disputing inaccuracies with credit bureaus by providing supporting documentation, or negotiating a "pay for delete" agreement with the creditor. If these fail, focus on consistently making on-time payments to rebuild your credit.</p>

Products at risk of becoming scarce include toys, down feathers, textiles, footwear, cutlery, glassware, furniture, and apparel.

The proposal aims to incentivize studios to conduct more production work in the U.S., reversing the trend of productions being shot in countries with tax incentives. Jon Voight, Trump's "special ambassador" to Hollywood, also discussed a federal policy with tax incentives to encourage domestic film production.

          <p>The UK and India have agreed on a trade deal after three years of negotiations, aiming to boost growth and trade between the two countries. The agreement will ease exports for UK firms, including whisky and cars, and cut taxes on Indian clothing and footwear exports. Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed the deal as a boost for British people and businesses. The deal does not include changes in immigration policy, including towards Indian students studying in the UK.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz's journey to becoming Germany's next chancellor was marked by an unexpected setback when he failed to win the job on the first parliamentary vote. Supporters describe him as well-prepared and thoughtful, while critics accuse him of lacking foresight and breaking promises. Despite the initial hurdle, he is expected to assume leadership at a crucial time for Germany's economy, security, and role in Europe. His inability to secure enough votes on the first attempt raises questions about his ability to wrangle lawmakers and address domestic and international crises.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced a plan to offer a $1,000 incentive to migrants who "self-deport" using the CBP Home App. The monetary incentive is pitched as a more cost-effective and "dignified" way to leave the country, given the administration's efforts to increase arrests, detentions, and removals. However, immigrant advocates are skeptical, questioning whether migrants will actually receive the incentive and be able to apply for legal status in the future. The administration has already used the incentive to transport someone from Chicago to Honduras.</p>

          <p>Three years into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, antiwar parents and teachers are finding ways to shield children from state-mandated patriotic education classes. Some schools are creating fake schedules, while others are home-schooling their children to avoid what they describe as a toxic atmosphere. The Kremlin's efforts to indoctrinate children have taken root in most schools, with activities like “Important Conversations” and discussions on Russia’s military glory. However, some teachers are quietly resisting by using the time for revision or homework.</p>

The petition calls for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to ensure that water deliveries do not exceed what is reasonably required for beneficial use. The groups highlight wasteful practices such as flood-irrigating farm fields to grow water-intensive crops like hay, some of which are exported. They suggest the government should also consider wasteful water use in cities and industries.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones predicts that the stock market will hit new lows even if President Trump reduces tariffs on China. Jones believes that Trump's focus on tariffs combined with the Federal Reserve's reluctance to cut rates is detrimental to the stock market. He anticipates that even a partial reduction in tariffs would still represent a significant tax increase, negatively impacting economic growth. Jones suggests that stocks have not yet reached their bottom and that deteriorating macroeconomic conditions will eventually force the Fed and Trump to take action. (not investment advice)</p>
