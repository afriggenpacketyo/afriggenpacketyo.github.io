          <p>Concerns over the potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz have led some tankers to alter their courses, reversing away from the vital trade chokepoint. Data indicates that at least six vessels, including crude carriers and chemical tankers, initially diverted from the strait following reported U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. However, the situation remains fluid, with some vessels later resuming their course toward the Strait of Hormuz. This event highlights the heightened sensitivity in the region, though overall vessel flow into the area appears to be sustained.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, President Trump hinted at the possibility of regime change in Iran, raising concerns about further escalation of the conflict. Israeli officials have also suggested that the military operations could lead to an uprising against Iran's theocratic rulers. The U.S. strikes targeted three nuclear sites, with initial assessments indicating severe damage. Meanwhile, Iran's foreign minister visited Russia to seek support, and the U.S. State Department issued a global alert for Americans traveling abroad.</p>

          <p>Uranium, a radioactive element, is naturally found in small amounts in the environment, including rocks, soil, water, and air. It has a silver-white-gray finish and is very dense, with a small cube weighing approximately 20 kilograms. Uranium can be enriched for use in nuclear power plants and weapons, or depleted for radiation shielding and armor-piercing projectiles. Exposure to high concentrations of uranium can cause cancer and organ damage, while most of the world's uranium production comes from Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. has entered the war between Israel and Iran, China's support for Iran is likely to be tempered by its limited influence over Israel and its strategic calculus regarding Washington's involvement. China has drawn closer to Iran in recent years, cooperating on military exercises and signing a 25-year strategic partnership. However, Beijing's rhetoric has shifted to become more measured, focused on brokering dialogue and a ceasefire rather than denouncing Israel. China may find value in the chaos in the Middle East, as it would pose a bigger distraction to Washington, while the country remains embrioled in a trade war with the U.S.</p>

          <h2>Trump Speculates About Regime Change in Iran After US Strikes</h2>

          <p>President Trump has raised the possibility of regime change in Iran following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. His remarks contrast with statements from other U.S. officials who emphasized that the aim of the military action was not to topple Iran's leaders. The strikes, which targeted three sites, were prompted by fears that Tehran was nearing the capacity to build a nuclear weapon. Iran has responded with threats of "everlasting consequences," and the U.S. Department of State has issued a global warning advising U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution.</p>

          <p>The deployment of national guard troops and U.S. marines to Los Angeles, initiated by President Trump to address what he termed "the enemy within," continues to spark controversy. The troops' role has been largely restricted to guarding federal buildings and accompanying immigration enforcement agents, yet the deployment has unnerved California's political leaders and raised concerns about the militarization of domestic law enforcement. Critics argue that the deployment violates constitutional limits on government power and risks destabilizing an already volatile situation. The Trump administration has vowed to keep the troops in place for at least 60 days.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has announced a proposal to allow non-domiciles (non-doms) to avoid some UK taxes by paying a Â£250,000 fee. Under the plan, non-doms would pay the fee for a "Britannia Card" and in return, would not be taxed on wealth, income, or capital gains earned abroad, nor would they be required to pay inheritance tax. The party estimates this policy would raise between Â£1.5bn to Â£2.5bn annually, which would be transferred tax-free to the lowest-paid 10% of full-time workers. Critics argue that the measure amounts to a "tax cut for foreign billionaires."</p>

          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, it has been discovered that parents who have an easy time getting their children to listen tend to avoid threats, bribes, and harsh consequences. Instead, they use language that encourages cooperation by respecting a child's autonomy while maintaining boundaries. Phrases like "Because I said so" and "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]" can trigger a child's defense mode. Shifting to language that validates emotions and invites problem-solving can create a more cooperative environment and strengthen the parent-child bond.</p>

          <p>The new live-action version of "How to Train Your Dragon" remained the top-grossing film at the North American box office, earning $37 million in its second weekend. Pixar's "Elio" had a difficult opening weekend, earning only $21 million, marking the worst premiere in Pixar's history. "28 Years Later" marked the return of another franchise, adding $30 million in 59 foreign markets. Next weekend is expected to be competitive with new releases including "F1" and "Megan 2.0".</p>
