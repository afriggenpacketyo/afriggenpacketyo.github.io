          <h2>NBA Sponsorship Revenue Surges Due to Jersey Patches and New Stadium</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 09:48:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NBA teams have experienced an 8% increase in sponsorship revenue this season, reaching $1.62 billion, a significant rise from $850 million five years ago, driven by the prevalence of sponsor patches on team jerseys and the opening of the Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome. The rise in jersey patch deals has more than doubled year-over-year, contributing significantly to the league's incremental revenue. The increase in revenue can be compared to adding three new teams to the league. Rakuten and JPMorgan Chase are identified as the top-spending brands in the league, reflecting the growing investment in NBA partnerships.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has announced a 25-basis-point interest rate cut, lowering the deposit facility rate to 2%, after euro zone inflation fell below the 2% target in May. The ECB has also revised its economic projections, anticipating inflation to average 2% in 2025, reflecting lower energy prices and a stronger euro. Despite the rate cut, the ECB acknowledges that the outlook for euro area inflation is more uncertain than usual, with economic growth remaining lackluster, as businesses and policymakers face increasing uncertainty due to rising geopolitical tensions and U.S. tariff policies. While the ECB left its growth forecast for 2025 unchanged at 0.9%, they noted that rising government investment in defense and infrastructure will increasingly support growth over the medium term.</p>

          <p>A recent report indicates that the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in China is expected to mitigate a potential labor shortage in the long term, but its near-term impact on deflationary pressures is debated. Some analysts believe that AI adoption could exacerbate deflationary pressures by disrupting the employment market, particularly among junior-level cognitive workers, leading to wage deceleration. However, other economists argue that AI development should not be hindered due to deflation concerns, as the main causes of deflation are overcapacity and sluggish domestic demand. They emphasize that AI is strategically important for China's economic future and that the focus should be on curbing overinvestment and excessive competition.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's decision to bar international students from attending Harvard University is being viewed as an aggressive act, following an earlier attempt to pressure the university, which was blocked by a federal judge. The move is seen as targeting Harvard's significant international student population, which comprises over a quarter of its 25,000 students, and could harm American research and innovation. The administration's actions raise concerns about a broader attempt to apply "America First" protectionist principles to higher education, potentially impacting universities beyond Harvard and undermining global cooperation. International students have played a crucial role in supporting American universities, especially after the Great Recession, and have contributed to the country's economic productivity and research.</p>

The call follows accusations from the Trump administration that Beijing has been slow-walking its pledge to approve the export of more critical minerals, a result of prior negotiations. China has also expressed frustration with new restrictions on Chinese student visas and accusations of undermining trade progress by issuing warnings against using Chinese semiconductors.

          <p>Students planning to enroll in the fall 2025 college semester are advised to maximize financial aid options, including grants and scholarships, before considering student loans. Federal student loans are generally recommended as the first loan option due to their generous benefits, but private student loans may be necessary to cover any remaining gaps. Obtaining a cosigner and improving credit scores and debt-to-income ratios can improve eligibility for private student loans. It's also important to shop around for the best loan terms and avoid borrowing more than needed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has reduced its key interest rate for the eighth time in just over a year, lowering it from 2.25% to 2%, while warning about the continuing pressure on the eurozone from Donald Trump's tariffs. The ECB said that trade uncertainty would weigh on business investment and exports, despite stronger-than-expected economic growth between January and March. ECB President Christine Lagarde noted that a great deal of uncertainty remains over the economy, largely due to trade policies, but expects the economy to gather pace in the medium term, boosted by European spending on defense and infrastructure. Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz is scheduled to meet with Trump to discuss tariffs and defense spending.</p>

AOC's endorsement is seen as a strategic move to consolidate support behind a single progressive candidate, as progressives failed to unite in the previous election, leading to a moderate Democrat's victory.

          <p>President Trump's tariff proposals could significantly increase the price of goods like clothing and shoes, with estimates showing potential price hikes of up to 90% on items made in China under the highest proposed duties. Retail consultancy group AlixPartners created pricing models illustrating how tariffs could affect the price of men's sweaters and shoes made in China and Vietnam. Retailers are using various strategies to offset the cost of tariffs, but the levies could still take a major toll on U.S. households if retailers pass along the full cost to consumers.</p>

Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said that 2.2 million people in Japan had entered the lottery to purchase the Switch 2 on launch day, which was "beyond" Nintendo's expectations and more than the company will be able to deliver to stores on Thursday. Analysts expect the Switch 2 to match the success of the original Switch, which has sold more than 152 million units.</p>

          <p>Older Americans are filing for Social Security benefits at a record rate this year, a surge that could reflect growing anxiety about the stability of the retirement system amid cutbacks under the Trump administration, experts say. The number of people claiming Social Security jumped 17% to 1.8 million this year through May compared with the same period a year ago, according to the most recent data from the Social Security Administration. The spike in early benefits claims comes as the Trump administration has slashed jobs and made other changes at the Social Security Administration, an agency already struggling to provide services to the nearly 70 million retirees, disabled people and survivors of deceased workers who rely on the program. Claiming Social Security benefits at 62 results in a permanently lower monthly benefit. (not investment advice)</p>

Short-term CDs often have higher interest rates than longer terms due to the inverted yield curve, making them a practical approach for long-term savings through laddering.
