        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Broadway icon Patti LuPone has issued a public apology after facing criticism from the Broadway community for her remarks directed at Kecia Lewis and Audra McDonald. The apology came in response to an open letter signed by over 500 Broadway performers, condemning LuPone's "inappropriate and unacceptable public comments." The controversy stemmed from an interview where LuPone disparaged Lewis's self-identification as a veteran and made dismissive remarks about McDonald, stemming from noise complaints during performances of "Hell's Kitchen." LuPone expressed regret for her words, acknowledging they were inappropriate and ran counter to the values of the theater community, and hoped to personally apologize to both Lewis and McDonald.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing an asset test for seniors seeking Medi-Cal healthcare benefits to address the state's soaring healthcare costs. The proposal would require applicants to have less than $2,000 in assets to qualify for the program, with assets including salary, bank accounts, and retirement funds. Newsom cites increased enrollment and rising pharmacy and managed care costs as reasons for the budget shortfall, and also suggested freezing new enrollment for adults in the country illegally as a way to cut Medi-Cal costs. Disability Rights California criticized the proposal, arguing it would harm vulnerable populations by demanding extreme poverty to receive healthcare, while Newsom defended the proposal as a necessary measure to balance the budget.

          <p>A Singapore-based quantum researcher, Alexander Miller, has warned that China's quantum satellite, Micius, could be vulnerable to hacking due to tiny delays between its onboard lasers. These delays could provide opportunities for eavesdroppers to exploit the system. Miller's analysis of communication data between a ground station and Micius revealed that the distribution of quantum keys from the satellite was insecure. Quantum communication relies on quantum physics-based cryptography to encode data, theoretically making it unhackable, but realistic devices can be vulnerable to side-channel attacks.</p>

US envoy Steve Witkoff described the response as "totally unacceptable," stating it only takes the process backward.

          <p>Hamas has responded to the U.S.-led proposal for a temporary ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, indicating it will seek amendments to the agreement, which Israeli officials have already approved. The militant group aims to achieve a permanent ceasefire, complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and the unimpeded flow of humanitarian aid. Hamas stated that the agreement would include the release of 10 living Israeli hostages and the remains of 18 hostages in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners. A senior Hamas official noted that there are some notes and amendments to some points, especially on the U.S. guarantees, the timing of hostage release, the delivery of aid and the withdrawal of Israeli forces.</p>
