          <p>Following Nico Iamaleava's controversial transfer from Tennessee to UCLA amid NIL disputes, Joey Aguilar, who initially joined UCLA through the winter portal, is now set to transfer to Tennessee. Iamaleava's departure stemmed from disagreements over a reported $4 million NIL deal, causing shockwaves in college football as he seemingly held out for a bigger payout, which his father denies. Aguilar, with one year of eligibility remaining, brings a strong track record of 6,760 passing yards and 56 touchdowns from Appalachian State. This quarterback 'trade' signifies the complex dynamics of NIL deals and player movement in modern college football.</p>

          <p>Mayor Karen Bass has proposed adding 227 positions to the Los Angeles Fire Department (LAFD) in her 2025-26 budget, a move that comes three months after a destructive wildfire exposed resource gaps. The proposal includes hiring additional firefighters, emergency medical technicians, and mechanics to address understaffing issues and equipment maintenance needs within the department. This decision reflects a shift in priorities, as many other agencies are facing layoffs, and aims to bolster the LAFD's ability to respond to emergencies, especially those related to homelessness, which have seen a significant increase in recent years. The city council will review the budget proposal before the end of May.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration in response to a freeze of $2.2 million in funding, escalating tensions between the Ivy League institution and the government. Harvard's president, Alan M. Garber, accused the administration of attempting to control academic decision-making, asserting that no government should dictate what private universities can teach or whom they can admit. The Trump administration's actions follow student activism related to the war in Gaza, with the administration characterizing campus protests as anti-American and the institutions as liberal and antisemitic. The lawsuit underscores the ongoing conflict between academic institutions and the government over issues of academic freedom and political influence.</p>

          <p>Chinese and French scientists have created a detailed map of the crab-eating macaque's claustrum, a brain region thought to be involved in consciousness. The map shows connections between nerve cells in the claustrum and other brain areas, potentially revealing how this region contributes to cognitive functions like memory and abstract thinking. The research also found structural and cellular differences between macaque and rodent claustrums, offering insights into the evolution of consciousness. This study contributes to the ongoing scientific exploration of how consciousness arises in the brain and why it differs across species.</p>

          <p>The European Space Agency (ESA) has launched an experiment to assess the feasibility of growing lab-grown food in space, aiming to reduce the high costs associated with feeding astronauts. The project involves growing protein, fat, and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats, with the goal of creating a small pilot food production plant on the International Space Station within two years. Researchers envision a future where astronauts can 3D-print customized meals in space using lab-grown ingredients, making long-term space missions more sustainable and cost-effective.

          <p>Harvard University has initiated legal action against the Trump administration, alleging that the administration unlawfully froze billions in federal funding. The lawsuit comes after the Trump administration announced an initial funding freeze of $2.2 billion and signaled intentions to suspend an additional $1 billion in grants. Harvard President Alan Garber claims these actions are part of a pressure campaign to force Harvard to submit to government control over its academic programs. The university argues that the funding halt violates Harvard's constitutional rights and impedes critical scientific and medical research.</p>

These tariffs aim to protect US solar manufacturing investments by addressing concerns about unfairly cheap goods flooding the market. The dumping duties range from 6.1% to 271.28%, while anti-subsidy countervailing duties are between 14.64% and 3,403.96%, depending on the company and country.</p>
