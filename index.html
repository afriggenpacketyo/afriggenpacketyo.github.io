        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's inflation rate slowed to 3.16% in April, marking the sixth consecutive month of decline, according to recent data. This figure is lower than both the previous month's reading of 3.34% and economists' expectations of 3.27%. The dip was largely influenced by a decrease in food inflation, which fell to 1.78% from 2.69% in March. Despite this positive trend, analysts anticipate a potential rise in core inflation due to increasing gold prices, driven by ongoing trade tensions impacting global markets.</p>

          <p>French actor GÃ©rard Depardieu has been found guilty by a Paris court on charges of sexually assaulting two women during the filming of a movie in 2021 and received an 18-month suspended sentence. The two women, a set decorator and an assistant director, testified that Depardieu touched them inappropriately while on set; the judge found their accounts to be consistent and credible. Depardieu denied the accusations, claiming he was not the person he has been portrayed as in the media and his lawyer announced that he would appeal the decision. The case has become a focal point in France's reckoning with the #MeToo movement.</p>

Police are also investigating a car fire on the same street as the Kentish Town property from the previous Thursday.

The antiquities, seized in separate investigations starting in 2022, were recovered through a collaborative effort involving Egypt's consulate in New York, the New York District Attorney's Office, and U.S. security agencies. The collection also features jewelry, a granite foot fragment, ivory figurines, and a rare gold coin from the reign of Ptolemy I.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite significant investments aimed at revitalizing American manufacturing, the sector is struggling to fill nearly half a million open jobs. Factors contributing to this shortage include a tight labor market, the need for specialized skills, and an aging workforce anticipating a wave of retirements. While some positions require college degrees, many in-demand roles, such as maintenance technicians and machine operators, do not. Experts suggest that higher wages, improved public perception of manufacturing jobs, and increased investment in apprenticeship programs could help address the workforce gap.</p>

          <p>Fears of stagflation, characterized by higher unemployment, higher inflation, and slower economic growth, are growing in the U.S. due to shifting tariff policies. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell acknowledged the increased risks of these factors, although stagflation has not yet materialized. Experts like Greg McBride of Bankrate emphasize that uncertainty related to tariffs can hinder economic growth as businesses delay hiring and investment decisions. Consumers can prepare by paying down high-interest debts and boosting emergency savings to mitigate the potential impact of stagflation.</p>

This initiative targets Medicare, Medicaid, and treatments covered by private health insurance, including slimming drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic.

This move follows a previous announcement of 9,000 job cuts in November, bringing the total number of layoffs to approximately 20,000. The decision is attributed to falling sales in key markets like China and the U.S., as well as the collapse of a proposed merger with Honda and Mitsubishi.

Business groups argue that the wage hike would make it difficult for hotels to compete with non-hotel restaurants and spur companies to look to other markets for new projects.

Assemblyman Matt Haney is pushing legislation to authorize local jurisdictions to channel up to a fourth of their state homelessness funds to residential programs that practice sobriety. This move comes as some proponents of 'housing first' recognize the need to support those seeking sobriety, and reconcile the two philosophical positions. The bill requires a harm reduction option to be available to anyone offered recovery housing, and relapse cannot be a cause for eviction.</p>
