          <p>Britain's homelessness minister, Rushanara Ali, is facing calls to resign after a report alleged she increased the rent on a London property she owns by £700 per month. The increase reportedly occurred shortly after the previous tenants' contract ended, with them having been given four months' notice. While a spokesperson stated all legal requirements were met and a source claimed the tenants chose to leave, critics argue the action is inappropriate for a minister in her role, especially with the government's Renters Rights Bill in its final stages.</p>

          <p>United Airlines flights across the United States were temporarily grounded due to a significant technology issue, leading to widespread passenger delays. The ground stop affected the airline's mainline flights at major hubs, including Chicago, Denver, and San Francisco, causing over 700 delays. The company confirmed the underlying technology problem was resolved later in the evening but warned of residual disruptions as normal operations were restored. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy noted that the glitch was internal to the airline and not related to the broader U.S. air traffic control system.</p>

          <p>A Kremlin aide has indicated that U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have agreed to meet in the near future, following a "highly productive" discussion between Putin and a U.S. envoy. Trump himself stated there is a "good prospect" for a three-way summit including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss ending the war. This development comes as a U.S.-imposed deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire approaches, with the threat of more extensive sanctions looming. Despite the talks, expectations for a settlement remain low as Russia's attacks on Ukraine continue.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has initiated its first detentions under a new "one in, one out" agreement with France, targeting migrants who cross the English Channel in small boats. The detentions began as the pilot scheme came into force, with individuals arriving in Dover being taken to immigration removal centers. Under the 11-month treaty, they will be held until they can be returned to France, while the UK will accept an equal number of vetted asylum seekers from France. The move aims to deter dangerous Channel crossings, which have already surpassed 25,000 this year.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new "reciprocal" tariffs have officially been implemented, imposing higher duties on exports from numerous U.S. trading partners. The tariffs vary widely, with steep rates such as 39% for Switzerland and 50% for Brazil, while partners like the EU and UK negotiated lower rates of 15% and 10% respectively. President Trump also targeted India with a 25% tariff over its purchases of Russian oil, which will bring its total rate to 50%. Analysts note that while some deals have been struck, the ongoing tariff strategy creates significant uncertainty for global economic growth and inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts are also questioning whether the tariff applies only to raw chips or to finished goods containing them, such as smartphones and cars. The ambiguity complicates strategies for companies navigating the complex global semiconductor supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A powerful roadside bomb has killed at least two police officers and wounded fourteen others in Wana, a city in Pakistan's northwestern South Waziristan district. The attack targeted a police vehicle in a region that is a former stronghold of the Pakistani Taliban (TTP). Although no group has claimed responsibility, the TTP is the primary suspect, as the group frequently targets security forces and has seen a resurgence in activity. The incident underscores the escalating militant violence in the area bordering Afghanistan, where many TTP fighters have reportedly found refuge.</p>

          <p>China's trade performance in July surpassed market expectations, with exports growing 7.2% and imports rising 4.1% year-over-year, the biggest jump in a year. The strong export data suggests resilience amid ongoing trade tensions and a ticking clock on a tariff truce with the U.S. However, exports to the U.S. continued to fall, a decline offset by increased shipments to alternative markets like Southeast Asia. The data also showed a significant recovery in imports, driven by increased purchases of soybeans and crude oil, indicating a potential rebound in domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to raise tariffs on Indian goods to 50% over its Russian oil trade could deliver a significant blow to India's economy. While only a small fraction of India's GDP is tied to U.S. exports, specific sectors like gems, jewellery, apparel, and textiles are highly vulnerable. Analysts note the new duties are set to take effect in 21 days, providing a window for negotiation. Key Indian export sectors such as IT services and pharmaceuticals are not currently targeted by these specific tariffs, which may insulate parts of the economy from the most severe impacts.

          <p>NASA astronaut Butch Wilmore is retiring after a 25-year career, less than five months after returning from a challenging nine-month mission in space. Wilmore co-piloted the first crewed flight of Boeing's Starliner, which was intended to be a short trip but was extended after the spacecraft experienced multiple technical issues. Due to safety concerns, he and his crewmate Suni Williams ultimately returned to Earth aboard a SpaceX capsule. NASA praised Wilmore's dedication and legacy of fortitude, which follows a pattern of test pilots retiring after completing such inaugural, high-risk missions.</p>

          <p>Some financial experts contend that China is making progress in controlling its significant local government debt risks through a sweeping restructuring campaign. This perspective contrasts with long-held international fears of a "ticking time bomb" of hidden Chinese debt. Finance professor Zhao Xijun argues that China's debt is primarily held at the local level, allowing the central government to manage it, whereas the U.S. faces a more concerning situation with its debt concentrated at the federal level. China's debt-swap initiatives have successfully extended repayment maturities, a sign of stabilization. (not investment advice)</p>

Russia's tactics reportedly include massive vote-buying schemes, paid protests, social media disinformation, and hacker attacks.

Edwards expresses surprise that the record still stands, suggesting it may not be a healthy sign for the sport given advances in science and training. He believes part of the reason is that track and field, particularly field events, does not offer the same financial rewards as other sports, deterring young talent. While proud of his achievement, which only seven other men have come within 29cm of, he reflects on its remarkable longevity.</p>

          <p>Recent developments suggest a potential shift in President Trump's efforts to end the war in Ukraine, a long-standing promise of his. Within hours, Trump's rhetoric moved from accusing Russia of being a security threat to suggesting a "good prospect" of meeting with Vladimir Putin soon. This followed what was described as "great progress" in talks between a U.S. envoy and the Russian president in Moscow. While the details of this progress remain unclear, the mere possibility of a summit involving Trump, Putin, and potentially Zelenskyy indicates a significant change in dynamics, nearly 200 days into his presidency.</p>

          <p>The UK's Environment Agency (EA) is introducing enhanced checks on tyre exports following a BBC investigation that revealed millions were being sent to illegal furnaces in India instead of being recycled. The EA acknowledged it is "highly likely" that UK tyres are being diverted to makeshift pyrolysis plants, which cause serious health and environmental damage. Starting October 1, exporters must prove that waste tyres are being managed in an environmentally sound manner. However, campaigners and industry bodies have criticized the new measures, arguing they do not go far enough to close loopholes exploited by criminals.</p>

These novel genes are believed to play a key role in advanced human traits like cognitive ability but may also act as "dormant bombs" that fuel cancer. The research, published in Cell Genomics, found that the expression of these genes was significantly higher in tumors. Furthermore, the study showed that deleting some of these specific genes could inhibit the growth of tumor cells, opening new avenues for understanding cancer.</p>

          <p>President Trump's threat of secondary sanctions against countries like India and China for purchasing Russian oil could have seismic effects on global energy markets and Moscow's war funding. India, which has massively increased its intake of discounted Russian crude since 2022, now faces an additional 25% U.S. tariff. If major buyers were forced to stop, the removal of Russia's oil from the market could cause a severe price spike and stoke global inflation.
