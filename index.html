        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has formally terminated its sanctions program against Syria through an executive order, fulfilling a promise made by the president in May. This move follows the collapse of the Assad regime and the establishment of a new transitional government, which has been advocating for sanctions relief to aid in reconstruction and stabilize the country. While the general sanctions are lifted to encourage new investment, specific sanctions will remain on former president Bashar al-Assad, his associates, and entities linked to human rights abuses, terrorism, and chemical weapons. This policy shift is supported by regional allies like Turkey and Saudi Arabia, who see an opportunity to realign Syria's foreign policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration, through the Department of Justice, has filed a lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles, claiming its sanctuary policies unlawfully obstruct federal immigration enforcement. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that such policies undermine law enforcement and prioritize undocumented immigrants over American citizens, linking them to recent chaos in the city. The lawsuit seeks to compel Los Angeles to comply with federal immigration authorities, specifically Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This legal action represents a significant escalation in the ongoing conflict between the federal government and cities with sanctuary policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dating app Tinder is now requiring users in California to verify their identity using a facial recognition feature called "Face Check" when creating a new profile. This pilot program aims to combat the rise of fraud and romance scams by ensuring users are real people and match their profile photos. The technology, powered by FaceTec, scans a short video selfie to confirm authenticity and prevent impersonation, awarding verified users a blue checkmark. While Tinder states the data is deleted after an account is closed, the move raises ongoing discussions about privacy and the use of biometric data in technology services.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized AT&T's service on social media, claiming the carrier's equipment failed during a conference call with faith leaders and urging its CEO to "get involved." The posts caused a temporary dip in AT&T's stock price. This criticism comes just weeks after the Trump Organization announced a licensing deal for a new wireless service called Trump Mobile, which will operate on all three major carrier networks, including AT&T. The timing highlights potential conflicts of interest as the president's political brand and family business ventures continue to intersect during his time in office.</p>

          <p>The latest version of the Republican-led domestic spending bill includes provisions that could significantly harm the U.S. clean energy industry. The draft legislation introduces a new tax on renewable energy projects that use components from foreign entities of concern, like China, and phases out key tax credits for wind and solar projects after 2027. Trade groups warn these measures could raise taxes on the industry by up to $7 billion, jeopardizing hundreds of thousands of construction jobs and potentially increasing electricity prices for consumers. The proposal has caused concern among investors and industry leaders, leading to a drop in stocks for several major renewable energy companies. (not investment advice)</p>

The judge, after consulting with both legal teams, opted to remind the entire jury of their obligations before they resumed their work. This development occurred after seven weeks of testimony in the high-profile case where Combs faces federal charges including racketeering and sex trafficking, which could result in a life sentence if convicted.

          <p>The Senate is moving forward with President Trump's sweeping tax and immigration bill, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," amid a marathon session of amendment votes. Democrats are using the "vote-a-rama" to highlight opposition to the bill's cuts to social programs like Medicaid and SNAP, while Republicans defend it as a fulfillment of campaign promises. The legislation's path has been contentious, narrowly passing a procedural vote after two Republican senators, Thom Tillis and Rand Paul, initially voted against it. The bill's fate remains uncertain as it requires near-unanimous Republican support to pass before heading back to the House for another difficult vote.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Health and Human Services has found that Harvard University violated the civil rights of its Jewish and Israeli students. An investigation by the department's Office for Civil Rights concluded that these students faced "severe, pervasive and objectively offensive harassment" following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack, and that the university's response amounted to "deliberate indifference." Harvard has been warned to achieve voluntary compliance or face a referral to the Department of Justice for a potential lawsuit. The university strongly disagrees with the findings, stating it has taken significant steps to combat antisemitism on campus.</p>

          <p>The UK's Work and Pensions Secretary, Liz Kendall, is facing pressure from fellow Labour MPs regarding planned changes to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) benefit. After a U-turn, the government announced that stricter eligibility criteria would only apply to new claimants after November 2026, not existing ones. However, many MPs are questioning the logic of setting new criteria before a planned review of the assessment process is completed in 2026. The debate highlights deep divisions over welfare reform and its financial and social impacts, though concessions were made to avert a backbench rebellion.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis is at the center of GOP infighting over the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which he opposes due to its cuts to Medicaid. After Tillis voted against advancing the bill, President Trump threatened to support a primary challenger, prompting Tillis to announce he would not seek reelection. In a fiery floor speech, Tillis argued the bill breaks Trump's promise not to touch the entitlement program and would devastate his home state of North Carolina. While his stance has been praised by Democrats, it remains unclear if he can persuade any of his Republican colleagues to join his opposition.</p>

          <p>The White House has declared that Canada "caved" to pressure from President Trump by revoking its planned digital services tax (DST). The reversal came after Trump threatened to terminate trade negotiations if the tax, which would have primarily affected U.S. tech companies, was implemented. A top economic aide suggested the U.S. will now push other countries to drop similar taxes. Canada stated the move was to advance broader trade negotiations, with both countries now aiming to reach a new trade deal by late July, demonstrating the Trump administration's aggressive use of trade leverage to influence foreign tax policy.</p>

A Quinnipiac poll found 55% of voters oppose the bill, while a Fox News poll showed 59% opposition. However, public opinion is more divided on specific provisions within the legislation. For instance, polls from Quinnipiac and the Pew Research Center found that Americans are nearly evenly split on the proposal to add work requirements for Medicaid recipients.

          <p>The wildfire season in Southern California has started intensely, with several fires breaking out across Riverside and San Bernardino counties. The largest, the Wolf fire near Banning, has grown to 1,400 acres and forced hundreds to evacuate. Experts warn this is just the beginning, as a below-average rainy season has left vegetation across much of the state dangerously dry and primed to burn. While temperatures are expected to cool slightly, the underlying drought conditions persist, and officials have issued air quality alerts and red flag warnings for other parts of the state due to the increased fire risk.</p>

          <p>A coalition of major Democratic groups, including the DNC, is launching a new "Organizing Summer" initiative to drive voter engagement and rebuild support following losses in the 2024 elections. With an initial six-figure investment, the program aims to mobilize thousands of volunteers to connect with voters in non-traditional settings and provide feedback to shape party strategy. The effort will focus on key 2025 races and 35 competitive GOP-held districts ahead of the 2026 midterms. This grassroots strategy is an attempt to counter Republican legislative momentum and address recent internal party divisions.</p>
