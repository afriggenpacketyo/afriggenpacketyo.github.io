          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom stated that the federal government intends to deploy the California National Guard in response to immigration protests in Los Angeles, which have involved clashes between demonstrators and authorities. Newsom criticized the move as inflammatory, asserting that local authorities are capable of managing the situation. Protests followed reports of immigration raids in Paramount and demonstrations against enforcement operations across the city, with federal agents raiding workplaces and detaining individuals. Federal and local officials have traded blame over the handling of the protests, with ICE criticizing local officials' response and the LAPD denying claims of delayed response, citing the deployment of irritants by federal agents. The situation remains tense as authorities seek to maintain order and address concerns over immigration enforcement. </p>

          <p>A national referendum in Italy proposes halving the time required to apply for citizenship from 10 years to five, aligning the country with most of Europe. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has announced she will boycott the vote, deeming the existing citizenship law "excellent" and "very open." The referendum aims to speed up the process for legal foreign workers, not to ease the strict criteria, which include knowledge of the Italian language and a clean criminal record. Supporters argue the reform would integrate long-term residents who contribute to Italian society, while opponents claim it could erode national identity. The vote has become a sensitive issue amid debates about immigration and national identity in Italy. </p>

          <p>Dr. Victoria McCloud, a trans former judge, expressed concerns that the Supreme Court's ruling on gender, which led to updated guidance about shared public spaces, puts trans people at risk. McCloud argued that the ruling, which defines a woman by biological sex under equalities law, could lead to dangerous situations for transgender individuals in gendered spaces. She plans to challenge the ruling at the European Court of Human Rights, citing a breach of her human rights. The ruling has sparked debate about the safety and inclusion of transgender individuals in public spaces. </p>
