          <p>Apple has raised the monthly subscription cost for its Apple TV+ streaming service in the United States from $9.99 to $12.99. The price change is effective immediately for new subscribers, while existing customers will see the increase applied 30 days after their next renewal date. This marks the second price hike in less than two years for the service, which features original content like "The Morning Show" and "Severance."

          <p>Shares for Cracker Barrel Old Country Store experienced a significant drop of about 10% following the unveiling of a new, simplified logo. The redesign, part of a broader brand revitalization effort, removed the iconic image of a man and the phrase "old country store." The change drew considerable criticism on social media, particularly from conservative commentators who suggested it was an attempt to distance the brand from its traditional American identity. The company maintains the refresh is intended to revitalize the brand while preserving its core values. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two senior House Democrats, Reps. Jamie Raskin and Frank Pallone, are investigating the $8 billion merger between Paramount and Skydance Media. They are examining whether the companies made concessions to former President Donald Trump to secure regulatory approval from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The probe was prompted by a $16 million settlement Paramount paid to Trump to resolve a lawsuit he filed against CBS News, which the lawmakers suggest could be an "illegal bribe." The investigation also scrutinizes reported commitments to alter CBS's editorial practices.</p>

          <p>A South Texas woman, Lizelle Gonzalez, who was charged with murder in 2022 after a self-managed abortion, has filed a lawsuit alleging her constitutional rights were violated by the local district attorney and sheriff. Although Texas law exempts a pregnant person from homicide charges for ending their own pregnancy, Gonzalez was indicted and jailed for three days before the charges were dropped amid public outcry. Her lawsuit presents new evidence, including text messages from the DA admitting a mistake, arguing that officials pursued the case despite knowing it was unlawful.</p>

          <p>A New York state appeals court has thrown out the massive monetary penalty, exceeding $500 million, imposed on former President Donald Trump and his company in a civil business fraud case. The court ruled that the fine violated the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibition against "excessive fines." However, the ruling upheld the original judge's finding that Trump and other defendants committed fraud by inflating asset values to secure better financial terms. The nonmonetary sanctions, designed to curb the company's business practices, were also upheld.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates a growing trend where nearly half of American adults are opting to order from restaurant kids' menus. The primary motivations cited for this behavior are saving money and preferring smaller portion sizes amid rising food costs. According to a survey by Lightspeed Commerce, 44% of adults have ordered children's meals, which are typically cheaper and simpler than standard adult menu items. This consumer shift comes as some restaurant chains report slowing sales, suggesting heightened economic pressure on diners.</p>

          <p>The rapid expansion of data centers, driven by AI and cloud computing, is creating a significant demand for skilled trade workers like electricians and HVAC technicians. However, the supply of these workers is shrinking as older generations retire and fewer young people enter the trades, leading to an estimated 400,000 unfilled positions in the U.S. This labor shortage poses a threat to the operational capacity of data centers and other industries competing for the same talent.

          <p>A commentary in The Atlantic argues that the Trump administration's foreign policy towards Europe is not isolationist but rather an interventionist strategy of "America Everywhere." The author posits that instead of withdrawing, the administration actively supports and promotes European political parties that share its nativist and populist ideology, while criticizing those that do not. This approach, exemplified by officials endorsing specific candidates in Germany and Poland, represents a shift from traditional transatlantic alliances to a transactional, partisan-driven foreign policy. The article suggests this change is reshaping the relationship between the U.S. and Europe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of existing homes in the U.S. rose by 2% in July compared to the previous month, defying analyst expectations of a decline. According to the National Association of Realtors, the increase was likely driven by a temporary dip in mortgage rates during May and June when the sales contracts were signed. Housing inventory also grew, reaching its highest level since May 2020, which is helping to ease pressure on prices. The median home price saw only a slight 0.2% year-over-year increase, suggesting the market may be at an inflection point. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One week after baby Emmanuel Haro was reported missing in Yucaipa, California, the investigation is grappling with inconsistencies and a reported lack of cooperation from the parents. The baby's mother, Rebecca Haro, initially claimed she was attacked and knocked unconscious before her son was taken, but authorities say she stopped speaking with them after being confronted with contradictions in her statement. While the family's attorney insists they are cooperating, the Sheriff's Department has served multiple search warrants on their home. The case remains shrouded in mystery, with authorities not ruling out foul play.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is being used by wealthy investors to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated assets held in taxable accounts. The process involves exchanging a diversified portfolio of stocks for shares in a new or existing exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it is launched to the public. This allows the investor to postpone the tax liability that would normally be triggered by selling the original assets. While the strategy can be effective, it is subject to strict diversification rules and can limit an investor's future flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A comprehensive new study analyzing millions of birdsong recordings from multiple continents has found that artificial light pollution is significantly altering birds' daily routines. On average, birds in light-polluted areas are starting to sing about 20 minutes earlier and stopping about 30 minutes later, effectively lengthening their day by almost an hour. The research noted that species with larger eyes, like American Robins, were most affected. While the long-term consequences are unknown, this disruption could interfere with sleep, foraging, and seasonal cycles.</p>
