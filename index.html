          <p>The Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District board has unanimously voted to release investigation records concerning the 2022 Robb Elementary School shooting. This decision follows a court ruling in favor of news outlets and comes after more than three years of public pressure and legal challenges from victims' families. Board members expressed remorse for the delay, with families present describing the vote as a crucial step toward transparency and healing after the tragedy that killed 19 children and two teachers.</p>

          <p>More than 5.2 million aboveground pools sold by major retailers since 2002 are being recalled due to a drowning hazard. The recall, issued by U.S. and Canadian safety regulators, involves pools from Bestway, Intex, and Polygroup that have external compression straps, which can act as a foothold for young children to access the water unsupervised. This design flaw is linked to the drowning deaths of nine children in the U.S. between 2007 and 2022. Consumers are advised to contact the manufacturers for a free repair kit.</p>

The project, with an estimated investment of $167 billion, is expected to have three times the capacity of the Three Gorges Dam. The announcement triggered a significant surge in the stock prices of Chinese infrastructure and hydropower companies, such as Power Construction Corporation of China. This development highlights a major push in China's energy and infrastructure sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

Both leaders have emphasized the importance of their mutual defense treaty, with the U.S. reiterating its commitment to regional peace and stability.

          <p>The development of solid-state batteries for electric vehicles is gaining renewed momentum, with major automakers like Volkswagen, Nissan, and Toyota setting ambitious timelines for mass production by the end of the decade. These batteries promise higher energy density, improved safety, and faster charging compared to current lithium-ion technology. While some companies are focusing on semi-solid-state batteries as a transitional step, critics note persistent technological hurdles and high costs. The industry remains divided, as recent advancements in existing battery technologies are also narrowing the performance gap. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite a slumping team batting average this month, the four total home runs in the game offered a much-needed boost.

          <p>This article analyzes President Donald Trump's increasing reliance on tariffs as a primary tool for foreign policy, often blurring the line between trade protectionism and punitive sanctions. Unlike traditional sanctions, tariffs offer unilateral control, generate revenue, and can be adjusted quickly, aligning with Trump's "America First" agenda. However, this strategy has created global trade tensions and market uncertainty, with critics warning of potential economic slowdowns and destabilization. The approach marks a shift from previous administrations, using economic leverage to address non-trade issues like immigration and political disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

She recounts being advised by a U.S. publisher to write about themes "specific to your culture," implying a demand for narratives that reinforce stereotypes of the region as a place of tragedy. Schnabl argues that this expectation limits the scope of Balkan literature presented to a global audience, overlooking diverse, universal stories that don't fit a preconceived, exoticized mold.</p>

          <p>The historic Ryde Hotel in Sacramento County is investigating the apparent theft of a large number of its resident peacocks after a guest witnessed two men capturing one of the birds. A subsequent head count revealed that only four peacocks remained from a local flock of several dozen. The Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office is investigating the incident as a felony, valuing the birds at thousands of dollars, and is concerned they may have been stolen for the black market exotic animal trade or for their meat. Hotel staff are mourning the loss of the birds, which were a beloved feature of the property.</p>

          <p>National Archives documents show that former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie received tens of thousands of pounds in discounts on designer clothing while at 10 Downing Street. Between 2001 and 2002, Cherie Blair paid just £31,000 for clothes valued at over £75,000, raising concerns among officials about potential conflicts of interest under the ministerial code. Memos reveal that Downing Street staff advised the Blairs to repay a portion of the discounts to manage public perception. The files highlight the internal discussions about the optics of such benefits for a sitting prime minister's family.</p>

          <h2>UK Rents Have Increased by an Average of £221 Per Month Over Three Years, Zoopla Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 22:07:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an analysis by property portal Zoopla, the average monthly cost of a new rental tenancy in the UK has risen by £221 over the past three years, a 21% increase. This sharp rise is attributed to high tenant demand and a shortage of available properties, putting significant financial pressure on renters. The increase is comparable to the rise in monthly mortgage payments for homeowners during the same period. While the rate of rent increases has recently slowed, particularly in some cities, the high costs are forcing some to turn down jobs or seek financial help from family. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recently circulated air-to-air images of China's fifth-generation J-35 stealth fighter provide strong evidence that the aircraft has entered production and is nearing operational readiness for the navy. The photos show two jets with clear naval markings, "Flying Shark" tail insignia, and official serial numbers, indicating they are part of an initial production run. A military analyst noted these details confirm the J-35 has been integrated into the People's Liberation Army Navy's carrier aviation force.

          <p>The preliminary report into the Air India Flight 171 crash that killed 260 people has sparked controversy and speculation, focusing on the cockpit voice recording. Seconds after takeoff, both fuel-control switches were moved to "cut-off," and the recording captures one pilot asking the other why they did it, followed by a denial. While international media reports have begun to focus on the senior pilot, Indian investigators and pilot associations have condemned the leaks as "premature and speculative." The ambiguity over who acted and why leaves open possibilities of pilot error, a mechanical glitch, or intentional action.</p>

          <p>Brett Hankison, a former Louisville police officer, has been sentenced to 33 months in prison for using excessive force during the 2020 raid that resulted in the death of Breonna Taylor. Although his ten shots did not strike anyone, they endangered a neighboring family, and he is the only officer to be criminally sentenced in connection with the incident. The judge rejected a Department of Justice recommendation for no prison time, stating it would minimize the jury's verdict.

          <p>A U.S. appellate court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 10,000 people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. The program provides temporary protection from deportation and work permits to individuals whose home countries are deemed unsafe. While the court acknowledged the plaintiffs' case has merit, it found insufficient evidence to block the policy's implementation during the ongoing lawsuit. The decision puts thousands of people at risk of deportation, as the administration argues conditions in both countries have improved enough for their return.</p>

          <p>Critics are accusing President Donald Trump of attempting to divert public attention from the controversy surrounding his administration's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. This follows a series of wide-ranging social media posts from the president on topics like the Washington Commanders' name and cashless bail. The accusations of distraction come as Trump faces backlash from some of his own supporters over the decision not to release more files on the case. The White House maintains the president is being transparent, while figures like Rep. Adam Schiff call the moves "political retribution" and a "convenient distraction."</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while President Donald Trump's universal tariffs are widely criticized, they may have a "silver lining" by forcing other nations and trading blocs to address their own protectionist policies. The piece suggests that the tariff crisis has prompted countries like Canada and China to begin dismantling long-standing internal trade barriers that have hindered their own economic potential. The author posits that this push for domestic economic liberalization could ultimately offset some of the negative impacts of the U.S. tariffs, exposing hypocrisy and encouraging freer commerce.

The list of unaccounted-for individuals has been reduced to just three. The flash floods killed at least 135 people, with the majority of deaths occurring in Kerr County. Officials explained that the initially high number of missing persons was largely due to tourists who left the area without checking in after the disaster. This pattern of sharp revisions in missing-person counts is common in the aftermath of large-scale emergencies.</p>
