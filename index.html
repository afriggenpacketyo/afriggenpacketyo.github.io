          <p>A blood test for Alzheimer's disease is set to become available in the United States in late June, developed by Fujirebio Holdings. Cleared by the FDA, the test detects amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer's, in individuals 55 and older exhibiting symptoms. This less expensive and faster method, taking about 30 minutes from blood draw to diagnosis, could significantly improve access to new Alzheimer's treatments by offering a quicker and easier alternative to PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests. The availability of this test is viewed as a critical step in making new types of Alzheimer‚Äôs treatments widely accessible.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has unanimously passed a bill proposing a tax deduction of up to $25,000 on tips for tipped workers. This bill also extends business tax credits for payroll taxes on tips in beauty and spa services. The proposal, championed by Sen. Ted Cruz, includes stipulations such as excluding employees with compensation exceeding $160,000. The bill, if enacted, would cost $110 billion in federal revenues over 10 years and awaits consideration in the House of Representatives before potentially becoming law. Sen. Jacky Rosen noted that the bill fulfills one of President Donald Trump's key campaign promises.</p>

The ministry described Washington's actions as "unilateral bullying and protectionism," violating international laws and harming Chinese enterprises. The 2021 Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law allows China to prosecute those implementing or assisting in sanctions against it and seek compensation for incurred losses. Beijing plans to closely monitor the US measures and take necessary actions to protect its interests, following the US Bureau of Industry and Security's guidelines restricting the use of Chinese chips and US chips for training Chinese AI models.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned after sparking public outrage by stating he never buys rice because he receives it as gifts, a comment that angered locals facing rising rice prices. This resignation comes as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government deals with low approval ratings and tariff negotiations with the U.S. Soaring rice prices in Japan are due to inclement weather and policies protecting local farmers' interests. The government has attempted to curb prices by releasing stockpiles, but with little effect. Former Environment Minister Koizumi Shinjiro will succeed Eto as the new farm minister.</p>

          <p>A new satellite analysis reveals that the world's tropical forests disappeared at the fastest recorded rate in 2024, with fires being the primary cause, surpassing land clearances for agriculture. Approximately 67,000 sq km of old-growth forests were lost, an area comparable to the Republic of Ireland, releasing 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases. The Amazon experienced its worst drought on record, leading to uncontrollable fires in Brazil and Bolivia. However, countries in South East Asia, particularly Indonesia, showed progress in reducing forest loss through government policies and community efforts.</p>

          <p>A new report highlights that record-breaking global temperatures in 2024 contributed to a catastrophic surge in forest loss worldwide, with wildfires responsible for nearly half of the destruction. Brazil experienced its worst year for forests since 2016, with two-thirds of the loss due to fires sparked by human activity, primarily in the Amazon rainforest. The hot, dry conditions also fueled blazes across South America, particularly in Bolivia and Colombia, where land clearing for agriculture contributed to the destruction. While Indonesia and Malaysia saw a decrease in forest loss due to prevention efforts, the report emphasizes that climate change is exacerbating the intensity and frequency of wildfires.</p>

Research indicates that young people hold more progressive values than previous generations, with young women being more supportive of abortion rights, feminism, environmental concerns, and redistribution. This shift presents a political opportunity for center-left parties to focus on the priorities and values of female voters, rather than pandering to the reactionary politics of the far right.</p>

The special lanes will be available at Tokyo's Haneda airport and Fukuoka airport, while South Korea will implement a similar measure for Japanese travelers at Gimpo in Seoul and Gimhae in Busan. Visitors who have traveled between Japan and South Korea within the past year will be eligible to use the fast-track entry system.

          <p>New emails reveal that a top aide to the director of national intelligence, Joe Kent, ordered analysts to edit an assessment of the relationship between Venezuela‚Äôs government and the gang, Tren de Aragua, to protect President Trump and Ms. Gabbard. Kent sought to rewrite the assessment to align with Trump's claim that the gang is controlled by the Maduro regime, a claim contradicted by the intelligence community. The intervention has raised concerns about politicizing intelligence analysis. The issue centers on Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport people accused of being gang members, despite intelligence suggesting the gang is not directed by the Venezuelan government.</p>
