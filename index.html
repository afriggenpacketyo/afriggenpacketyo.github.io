          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has made an uncharacteristically sharp critique of Israel's military conduct in Gaza, labeling its actions as "no longer acceptable." Speaking at a summer press conference, Merz called for an immediate ceasefire and increased humanitarian aid, noting the death toll has surpassed 58,000. While reaffirming Germany's commitment to Israel's right to self-defense due to historical responsibilities, he also stressed his government's opposition to Israeli settlement policy. Merz differentiated the situation from Russia's war in Ukraine, stating Israel is defending itself against Hamas, the group responsible for the October 7th attacks.</p>

          <p>The engine system for the United States' F-47 sixth-generation fighter jet is expected to face a two-year delay, pushing its completion to early 2030. According to a report citing 2026 budget documents, the original timeline for the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program was the second half of 2027. A US Air Force spokesperson confirmed that the revised schedule is a direct result of significant supply chain challenges encountered by the program. The F-47 aircraft is being developed under the broader Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) initiative to ensure future air superiority.</p>

          <p>A UK government minister has denied claims that the Labour Party leadership is actively trying to force veteran MP Diane Abbott out of the party. Abbott was suspended for a second time after a BBC interview where she reiterated controversial 2023 comments distinguishing racism against Black people from prejudice faced by Jewish people and Travellers. Treasury Minister James Murray stated it was "absolutely not the case" that the leadership wanted her gone, emphasizing that a standard internal investigation is underway. Abbott maintains her comments were factually correct and believes the leadership is targeting her for removal.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced that "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" will conclude its run in May 2026, a decision that has sparked political speculation. The announcement came just days after Colbert criticized the show's parent company, Paramount, for a $16 million settlement with Donald Trump, which Colbert termed a "big fat bribe." While CBS insists the cancellation is a purely financial decision, prominent Democratic figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren have questioned the timing and motive, suggesting it could be politically motivated. Colbert, a vocal critic of Trump, has hosted the popular late-night program since 2015.</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old Canadian man, Shaheer Cassim, has been charged with hijacking constituting terrorism after seizing control of a small Cessna 172 aircraft. Cassim allegedly threatened a flight instructor at Victoria International Airport before flying to Vancouver, prompting the scrambling of F-15 fighter jets. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police stated the suspect acted with an "ideological motive to disrupt airspace," linked to social media posts where he claimed to be a "messenger of Allah" sent to save humanity from climate change. The incident ended safely with no injuries, though it caused temporary disruptions at Vancouver's airport.</p>

          <p>The UK's Met Office has issued an amber warning for thunderstorms across southeast and eastern England, cautioning that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours. The torrential downpours, expected to bring 70-100mm of rain, pose a significant risk of flash flooding, transport disruption, large hail, and gusty winds. These storms are moving across England and into Scotland over the weekend. The severe weather comes after a period of heatwaves has left the ground baked and dry, increasing the risk of rapid water runoff and exacerbating flood conditions.</p>

          <p>An NHS doctor, Attiya Sheikh, and her husband, Omer Sheikh, have each been sentenced to 10 months in jail for stealing and reselling Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) from a hospital. The couple made nearly £8,000 by selling stolen gloves, face masks, and wipes on eBay during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, a time of critical shortages. An investigation was launched after an NHS supplier noticed its products on the auction site, leading to a search of the couple's home where 121 boxes of gloves were found. Officials condemned the act as an immoral exploitation of public fear.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health insurance premiums on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces are projected to increase by an average of 15 percent next year, with some plans rising by 20 percent or more. According to a new analysis from KFF, this is the highest single-year increase since 2018. Experts attribute the rate hikes to the expiration of enhanced ACA subsidies, which Republicans in Congress allowed to lapse, as well as the continued growth in medical service prices. The end of these subsidies is expected to make coverage unaffordable for millions, potentially leaving a sicker, more expensive patient pool and driving costs even higher. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite this regional success, Burberry's overall group revenues saw a slight 1% decline.

While the new price level has not been officially announced, officials suggest it will be a dynamic cap set just above $47 per barrel at current prices. The new measures also notably sanction a major Russian-owned refinery in India for the first time, intensifying economic pressure on Russia to end its war in Ukraine. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Donald Trump's grip on his base may be weakening due to his handling of the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. The author suggests that unlike past controversies, Trump's attempts to dismiss inquiries into the Epstein files as a "hoax" are failing to quell criticism from within the MAGA movement and among influential right-wing figures. The piece posits that for a segment of his supporters, exposing a perceived elite cabal was a key promise, and the administration's defensive posture is seen as a betrayal. This, combined with a sense that Trump is now a lame duck, is creating an unprecedented level of internal dissent.</p>

While investors anticipate a rate reduction later this year, recent data showing a rise in the Consumer Price Index to 2.7% in June has complicated the decision. Fed officials appear concerned that inflation, partly driven by import tariffs, is showing signs of persistence. This cautious approach puts them at odds with the White House, but policymakers seem intent on waiting for more economic data before resuming the rate cuts that began late last year.

This mid-decade redistricting is unusual, as the current map was drawn just a few years ago after the 2020 Census. The move is seen by analysts as a purely political maneuver to benefit the national Republican party's thin House majority, rather than a response to Texas's internal dynamics. The Justice Department has also raised concerns, alleging that several existing districts are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders, adding legal complexity to the politically charged effort.</p>

Researchers are uncertain how these two powerful trends will interact, but some economists argue that long-term economic growth is driven more by innovation than by population size. The key question is whether AI will boost productivity enough to counteract the fiscal strains of an aging population. Projections are split, with some models showing AI as a transformative technology that drives growth, while others see it as an incremental change insufficient to prevent economic stagnation.</p>

While the department says its standard complaint process has already recovered $67 million for policyholders, many disputes remain at an impasse.

          <p>President Trump's goal to hire 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers is facing skepticism from experts who point to historical challenges with large-scale law enforcement recruitment. A similar hiring push during Trump's first term failed to meet its targets, and a mid-2000s Border Patrol expansion led to lowered standards and a wave of corruption cases. Experts note that challenges include long hiring times, lower pay compared to other police forces, and the need for an enormous applicant pool. To meet the aggressive targets, the administration might turn to deputizing local law enforcement or using military personnel in support roles.</p>

          <p>Following two years of unprecedented land movement, officials in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, are proposing a permanent ban on new construction within the Portuguese Bend landslide zone. The ordinance would prohibit new homes and additions but permit repairs or replacements of existing structures on their original footprint. The area has seen severe damage, with dozens of homes red-tagged as unsafe, prompting a federal buyout program for some properties. While some residents support the cautious approach, others with vacant lots are concerned about the indefinite ban and its impact on property values in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Public health experts are concerned that the Trump administration's stringent immigration enforcement could hinder efforts to control the H5N1 bird flu outbreak. A significant number of dairy and poultry workers, who are on the front lines of the virus, are undocumented immigrants. Infectious disease specialists warn that fear of deportation may prevent these workers from reporting symptoms or cooperating with health investigators, making it harder to track and contain the virus. This could increase the risk of undetected spread and delay the identification of any new, more dangerous variants of the virus, hampering a potential pandemic response.</p>

          <p>The British government is set to introduce a bill that would lower the voting age to 16 for all UK elections, potentially adding 1.5 million young people to the electorate. This represents the most significant change to the franchise since 1969 and aligns national elections with rules already in place in Scotland and Wales. The move is expected to force political parties to intensify their outreach on social media platforms like TikTok, which are primary news sources for teenagers. Analysts suggest that while the Labour Party is expected to benefit most, the right-wing Reform UK party also has a strong social media presence that could attract this new voter base.</p>

The report also described "frightening conditions," with inmates held in dirty, overcrowded cells infested with cockroaches and mice for over 22 hours a day.

          <p>Sir Grant Shapps, the former UK defence secretary, has defended the government's decision to use a super-injunction to hide a massive data breach that exposed the details of thousands of Afghans who worked with Britain. He argued the secrecy was justified to save lives, as those on the list were at risk of being "murdered and executed" by the Taliban. The data of nearly 19,000 Afghans, plus over 100 British officials and spies, was accidentally leaked in 2022 but not discovered until 2023. The revelation forced the government to create a covert £850m resettlement scheme for those affected, who were not told about the breach.</p>

          <p>Following the deaths of 27 people at a Texas summer camp, experts are urging parents to ask camps specific questions about safety protocols for extreme weather events like heatwaves and floods. With federal regulations for camps being minimal and state oversight varying widely, the American Camp Association and other experts advise checking a camp's infrastructure, such as shade structures and misting systems. Parents should also inquire about emergency action plans, including weather monitoring, evacuation routes, and communication strategies for events like flash floods or wildfires. Children are particularly vulnerable to heat, making hydration and climate-aware scheduling crucial for their safety.</p>
