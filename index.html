          <p>Economists Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt have been awarded the 2025 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for their foundational work explaining how innovation drives long-term economic growth. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences recognized their contributions to understanding the dynamics of technological progress and its impact on prosperity. This award, officially the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was created in 1968. The announcement concludes this year's Nobel prize week, with the committee noting past criticism over the lack of diversity among laureates.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has advised UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves against implementing poorly conceived tax fixes to address a potential £20 billion fiscal gap. The think tank suggests that while significant revenue could be raised without breaking key manifesto promises, options like a wealth tax or restricting pension relief carry substantial economic risks. The IFS recommends broader, principled reforms to property and capital gains taxes, arguing such changes would be fairer and more conducive to growth than simple tax hikes. This guidance comes as the government prepares for a budget expected to increase the tax burden to meet its financial rules. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two men, Rashid Gedel and Samuel Dodsworth, have been charged with the murder of former Lostprophets frontman Ian Watkins and have appeared in Leeds Magistrates' Court. Watkins, who was serving a lengthy sentence for numerous child sex offenses, including the attempted sexual assault of a baby, was killed in an incident at Wakefield Prison. The high-security facility has recently faced scrutiny over rising violence and poor infrastructure. Watkins' crimes, described by the sentencing judge as plunging to "new depths of depravity," led to the immediate disbandment of his successful rock band in 2013.</p>

          <p>Former Scotland rugby captain Stuart Hogg has revealed that his decision to retire from the sport was an attempt to save his marriage, a choice he now calls the "biggest mistake" of his life. The 100-cap player, who recently returned to the sport with French club Montpellier, spoke about his mental health challenges, including using alcohol to cope and being on antidepressants before his initial retirement. Hogg, who pleaded guilty to domestic abuse last year, stated he is now in a better mental state and is learning to be selfless for his family and team.</p>

The 10-year commitment aims to provide "gap scholarships" for nearly 10,000 students who are nearing graduation but face financial shortfalls, thereby boosting graduation rates. This major philanthropic gift from the Home Depot co-founder and Atlanta Falcons owner will support students at Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, Morris Brown College, and Spelman College.

          <p>During her first visit to Kyiv, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas stated that Russia is "gambling with war" through its repeated airspace violations against European neighbors, which risk unintended escalation. Kallas met with Ukrainian officials to discuss ongoing military aid, energy security, and a reparations loan funded by frozen Russian assets. Her visit comes as Ukraine races to repair its energy infrastructure, heavily damaged by Russian strikes, ahead of winter. Meanwhile, reports confirmed a significant Ukrainian drone strike on an oil depot in Russian-annexed Crimea, part of Kyiv's strategy to disrupt Moscow's supply lines.</p>

          <p>Lloyds Banking Group is increasing its provision for compensating customers affected by the car finance scandal by £800 million, bringing its total allocation to nearly £2 billion. The move follows proposals from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for a redress scheme covering millions of drivers who were sold loans with hidden commission payments between 2007 and 2024. The FCA estimates the total industry payout could reach £8.2 billion, with around 14 million deals potentially eligible for compensation. Lloyds stated the potential impact is at the "adverse end" of its previous expectations due to a higher number of eligible cases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued a stark warning about the accelerating spread of drug-resistant bacterial infections, which are rendering common antibiotics ineffective and turning minor injuries into potentially fatal threats. According to a new report, one in six laboratory-confirmed bacterial infections in 2023 demonstrated resistance to treatment, with resistance rates increasing annually for over 40% of monitored antibiotics. Antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) superbugs are now a leading cause of death globally, directly causing over a million deaths each year.

          <p>During an ongoing government shutdown, the Trump administration has reportedly gutted the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) through sweeping layoffs. According to department sources, the reduction-in-force eliminated most staff responsible for overseeing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and managing roughly $15 billion in federal funding for the nation's 7.5 million students with disabilities. Critics and union representatives warn that these cuts will decimate federal oversight, leaving families without support and states without accountability for providing legally mandated services. The move is seen by some as part of a broader effort to reduce the federal role in education.</p>

Facing financial hardship in 1971 and about to drop out, Clark was told by Meshke that she had unexpectedly received a college drama scholarship that would cover her next semester's tuition. She later discovered from the financial aid office that no such scholarship existed and realized her professor had paid the fees himself. This quiet act of kindness enabled her to stay in school, secure better employment, and ultimately graduate.</p>

          <p>South Africa is currently debating the decriminalization of sex work, with advocates arguing that current laws make workers vulnerable to violence, police harassment, and health risks. Organizations like the Sex Workers Education and Advocacy Taskforce (SWEAT) are pursuing a legal challenge, asserting that criminalization is unconstitutional and prevents workers from reporting crimes or accessing healthcare without fear. Opponents, including some NGOs, argue that sex work is inherently exploitative and that decriminalization could promote trafficking. The Western Cape High Court is preparing for a major trial on the issue, which has global parallels with different legal models worldwide.</p>
