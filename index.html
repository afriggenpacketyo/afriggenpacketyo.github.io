        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. and EU have reached a trade deal, establishing a 15% tariff on most European goods, a lower rate than the previously threatened 30%. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President Trump confirmed the agreement in Scotland. As part of the deal, the EU has reportedly committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and investing an additional $600 billion in the U.S. The agreement aims to bring stability and predictability to the transatlantic trade relationship, though some European officials noted it will still make trade more challenging than before.</p>

          <p>The American Medical Association has voiced "deep concern" following reports that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to overhaul the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The independent panel provides evidence-based recommendations on preventive care, such as cancer screenings, which insurers are required to cover. Critics of the alleged plan worry it is a politically motivated move to dismantle a non-partisan body, potentially disrupting access to essential health services for millions of Americans. The Department of Health and Human Services has stated that no final decision has been made on the matter.</p>

          <p>A BBC News investigation has exposed a "fantasist" and convicted fraudster, James Kenny, who orchestrated an entirely fabricated music festival called Monmouth Rising. Kenny falsely claimed to have booked major acts like The Killers and secured millions in funding, deceiving employees, suppliers, and even government bodies. The elaborate hoax unraveled when he failed to pay staff and suppliers, with evidence emerging of forged financial documents. The story highlights the vulnerabilities within the festival industry and the trail of financial and emotional damage left by the promoter's deception.</p>

          <p>An attack attributed to the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), an Islamic State affiliate, has resulted in the deaths of dozens of people in the town of Komanda in northeastern DR Congo. Local officials report that about 20 of the victims were worshippers attending a night vigil at a church when the militants struck, shooting them and setting fire to nearby businesses. The ADF, originally from Uganda, is now primarily based in DR Congo and frequently carries out brutal attacks on civilians. The massacre highlights the ongoing and severe security crisis in the region.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has reportedly agreed to a deal to sell Colombian forward Luis Diaz to German champions Bayern Munich for a fee of approximately £65.5 million, including add-ons. The 28-year-old was left out of a recent pre-season friendly due to the transfer speculation and has been given permission to complete his medical. Diaz joined Liverpool in 2022 and had a prolific 2024-25 season, scoring 17 goals. His departure comes as Liverpool has been active in the transfer market, signing other forwards to reshape their attack for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Disney and Marvel's "Fantastic Four: First Steps" has launched with an impressive estimated $118 million in domestic ticket sales, marking a successful return for the franchise. The film, which is the first "Fantastic Four" movie produced under Marvel Studios' direct oversight, also earned $100 million internationally for a $218 million global debut. This strong opening is seen as a significant win for Marvel, which has faced inconsistent box office results with some of its recent post-"Endgame" releases. The positive reception suggests that quality filmmaking can still draw large audiences to superhero movies.</p>

          <p>Top Republicans are expressing differing views on the idea of a pardon or commutation for Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking. House Speaker Mike Johnson stated he would have "great pause" about any clemency for Maxwell, calling her crimes "unforgivable." In contrast, Representative Thomas Massie suggested a pardon should be considered if it could compel her to provide more information about Jeffrey Epstein's network. The debate highlights the political pressure on the Trump administration to address the Epstein scandal, revealing a split within the GOP on how to proceed.</p>
