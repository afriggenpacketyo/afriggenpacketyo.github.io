          <p>MasterChef's John Torode has confirmed he is the individual alleged to have used racist language in an incident from 2018 or 2019. The allegation was upheld during an inquiry into separate misconduct claims against his co-host, Gregg Wallace. In a public statement, Torode said he has no memory of the event and does not believe it happened, but affirmed that any racial language is unacceptable and apologized for any offense caused. This development is part of a wider conversation about workplace culture at the BBC and within the creative industries, following the substantiation of numerous allegations against Wallace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Subpoenaed documents have exposed significant protocol failures by the U.S. Secret Service team during the July 2024 assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania. The records show that key agents were undertrained, with the main site agent having no prior experience securing an outdoor rally and lacking basic knowledge. Several agents admitted to being aware of major security concerns, such as a clear line of sight from a nearby roof, but failed to elevate these issues or create a plan to address them. The documents also reveal that some senior agents never conducted final security walk-throughs of the site, contributing to the critical security lapse.</p>

          <h2>US to Impose 17% Tariff on Fresh Tomatoes from Mexico</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 18:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a 17.09% tariff on most fresh Mexican tomatoes after negotiations to renew a trade agreement failed. The Commerce Department withdrew from the 2019 Tomato Suspension Agreement, which had prevented Mexican exporters from selling tomatoes at artificially low prices. Proponents, including U.S. tomato growers, argue the tariff will protect the domestic industry, which has seen its market share shrink significantly. Opponents, including business groups and companies that grow produce in Mexico, warn the move will increase tomato prices for American consumers and could lead to retaliatory actions from trading partners.

          <p>San Francisco has announced a major initiative to provide 30,000 city workers with access to generative artificial intelligence through Microsoft 365 Copilot. The move aims to enhance the productivity of employees, from nurses to social workers, by automating administrative tasks like data analysis and report drafting. A six-month pilot program involving over 2,000 workers demonstrated productivity gains of up to five hours per week. Officials believe the AI tool will also improve city services by enabling faster response times and providing instant translation for the more than 40 languages spoken in the city, all at no additional cost due to an existing Microsoft license.</p>

          <p>The UK government has initiated a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting that ownership could be transferred to its postmasters. This proposal for mutualization comes as part of a broader effort to reform the organization's culture following the devastating Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. While a change in ownership structure is not expected until at least 2030, the government is seeking a "fresh vision" to restore public and internal trust. The consultation will also explore the future services the Post Office should offer, with a focus on expanding its role in banking.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its plan to fire more than half of the Department of Education's employees while a legal challenge is ongoing. The decision, issued from the court's expedited "shadow docket," allows for mass terminations that critics argue will effectively dismantle the department. In her dissent, Justice Sotomayor warned that the firings would eliminate entire offices responsible for critical programs, such as those for bilingual education and students with disabilities. This ruling raises significant constitutional questions about executive power, particularly whether a president can effectively nullify congressionally mandated programs by eliminating the workforce needed to run them.</p>

Chef-owner David Schlosser cited a significant drop in customers throughout 2024 as the primary reason for the closure, connecting it to broader challenges facing businesses in the downtown area. The closure of Shibumi contributes to a growing list of beloved L.A. eateries that have recently ceased operations, reflecting ongoing economic pressures on the city's restaurant industry.</p>

          <p>The suspension of former Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Julio Urías for violating MLB's domestic violence and sexual assault policy is set to end, making him eligible to be signed by any team. This was Urías's second such suspension, levied after a 2023 incident where he was seen on video in a physical altercation with his wife. His agent, Scott Boras, confirmed that Urías intends to continue his baseball career and is currently getting back into shape. While multiple teams have reportedly inquired about him, it remains uncertain if or when he will secure a new contract and return to the major leagues.</p>

          <p>During jury selection for a federal trial over a fatal 2019 Tesla crash, the name and public persona of CEO Elon Musk proved to be a significant factor. The lawsuit concerns a death and serious injury resulting from a Model S in Autopilot mode striking a parked vehicle. Several potential jurors expressed strong negative opinions about Musk, stating they could not be impartial, with one citing his "ethics, ownership and what I have seen in the news." Tesla's lawyers acknowledged the challenge, noting it's difficult for people not to have a strong view of Musk, even though the case is about the technology's alleged defects and shared responsibility.</p>

The measure is being implemented to comply with the country's new Online Safety Act, which mandates robust age-checking systems for sites showing adult material. Starting July 14, Reddit will use a third-party firm, Persona, to verify age through a selfie or a government-issued ID. Reddit stated it will not access the photo itself and will only retain the user's verification status and date of birth. Companies failing to comply with the new UK rules face substantial fines.</p>

However, NASA now states it has no legal obligation to do so, effectively leaving the comprehensive, peer-reviewed assessments without a central, public-facing home.

A former NYPD officer, Secret Service agent, and prominent right-wing media personality, Bongino's appointment was controversial due to his history of promoting conspiracy theories. He reportedly clashed furiously with Attorney General Pam Bondi after the Justice Department released a memo concluding Epstein died by suicide and did not have a "client list."

Researchers analyzing U.S. poison center data found that while these pouches are smoke-free, they contain nicotine, which can be highly toxic and even fatal to small children. The study noted that ingestions of products like Zyn were more likely to lead to serious medical outcomes or hospitalization compared to other nicotine products.
