        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) has revealed a takeover bid of 2.37 trillion yen to acquire 100% ownership of NTT Data, its publicly listed subsidiary. This move is aimed at enhancing the competitiveness of NTT's overseas businesses, which are primarily managed by NTT Data. The acquisition will involve NTT purchasing the remaining shares of NTT Data Group, which will then be delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The reorganization is expected to bolster NTT's global presence in the telecommunications sector.</p>

          <p>A study by researchers from the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) indicates that China's hypersonic weapons can reach speeds up to Mach 20 and potentially be launched from space. The analysis, published in Acta Aeronautica et Astronautica Sinica, reveals that these re-entry glide missiles can travel up to 21,000 km/h and strike global targets within half an hour. The possibility of launching from space-based platforms could significantly compress the adversaryâ€™s early-warning system response time and operational scope, enhancing penetration capabilities, according to the researchers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by World Weather Attribution concludes that climate change significantly worsened the deadly storms that struck eight U.S. states in early April, leading to at least 24 deaths. The analysis found that human-caused global warming made the record-breaking downpours approximately 9% heavier and 14 times more likely, due to unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico. Researchers also expressed concerns about the impact of staff shortages at the National Weather Service and the rising insurance costs in high-risk areas, emphasizing the need for a rapid shift away from fossil fuels to mitigate future extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter operating profit but has revised its global container market volume growth forecast to -1% to 4% due to increased macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty. The company's CEO, Vincent Clerc, noted that global supply chains are once again in the spotlight as trade tensions flare up, particularly with the U.S. imposing high import duties on products from China, prompting retaliatory tariffs. Maersk anticipates continued disruption in the Red Sea throughout the rest of the year, reflecting ongoing challenges in the global trade landscape.</p>

          <p>The article argues that voters prioritize cutting the cost of living over achieving net zero emissions, based on a recent poll that asked voters which was more important. The author suggests that this result indicates a lack of genuine belief in the urgency of net zero, as voters would prioritize it above all other issues if they truly feared a climate catastrophe. The article draws a parallel to Labour's policies during the Jeremy Corbyn years, which polled well in isolation but failed to resonate with voters when faced with other priorities.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the ethical implications of using AI to resurrect the dead, highlighting instances such as an AI avatar of a murder victim testifying in court and a digital recreation of Agatha Christie hosting a writing course. The use of AI to create digital "deadbots" for grieving relatives raises concerns about exploiting grief and commercializing the deceased without their consent. While some argue that these recreations can provide comfort, others fear they deny the reality of loss and undermine the dignity of the deceased, calling for laws to protect the rights and feelings of the bereaved.</p>

          <p>Britain is reportedly on track to sign a trade deal with the U.S., potentially becoming the first country to do so following the U.S.'s announcement of "reciprocal" tariffs. While details remain uncertain, it is speculated that the deal may be a finalized agreement or a framework for further negotiations. The UK, which runs a trade deficit with the U.S., was spared the higher tariffs but is still subject to a baseline levy. Discussions between the two countries are ongoing, with the aim of easing pressure on UK businesses and consumers.</p>

The industry, still recovering from pandemic shutdowns and Hollywood strikes, relies heavily on American productions, and the tariffs could lead to studios emptying and job losses. Government officials are in discussions with the U.S. administration, while some suggest the U.S. might increase tax breaks instead, impacting Britain's ability to attract productions.
