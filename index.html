          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry reports that all three public hospitals in north Gaza are out of service as Israel continues its offensive. The ministry states that Israeli forces besieged the Indonesian hospital in Beit Lahia, preventing the arrival of patients, medical staff, and supplies due to heavy fire. This hospital was the last operating in the north, and Israel's military announced the launch of "Operation Gideon's Chariot" amidst increased strikes in Gaza. The situation highlights the dire conditions and challenges in providing medical care in the region.</p>

          <p>A New York Times news analysis examines how India's rise as a diplomatic and economic power is hindered by its ongoing conflict with Pakistan. Despite military advancements, India struggles to resolve its 78-year conflict with its neighbor, often being equated with Pakistan, which it views as a sponsor of terrorism. The risk of escalation has increased with the deployment of advanced weaponry and the involvement of superpower politics, as the United States supports India and China backs Pakistan. Religious nationalism in both countries further complicates reconciliation, making restraint difficult even after terrorist attacks.</p>

          <p>A UK government minister confirms they are advocating for a deal that would allow UK passport holders to use EU e-gates at airports. The UK and EU are scheduled to hold their first bilateral summit since Brexit, with the aim of reaching agreements on trade and security issues. The minister hopes to reduce red tape to lower food prices but also acknowledged that 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.'

          <p>The Trump administration is set to resume wage garnishment for defaulted student loan borrowers, ending a half-decade pause. Millions of borrowers are currently in default, with the total potentially reaching 10 million. This shift marks a stark contrast to the Biden administration's relief measures. Many borrowers struggle to afford payments due to high living costs, and the garnishment of up to 15% of disposable income can create severe financial strain. The article highlights the plight of individuals like Jason Collier, a teacher, and Marceline Paul, a retiree, who face significant hardship due to student debt. </p>

          <p>Portugal is holding its third parliamentary election in three years after the previous government collapsed due to a confidence vote failure. Issues such as housing and immigration dominate the election, reflecting years of fragile governments.

          <p>Two volumes of the Zidanku Silk Manuscripts, dating back to around 300BC, have returned to Beijing from the United States after 79 years abroad. These manuscripts, considered the oldest ancient classics found in China, were illegally excavated in 1942 and later acquired by an American collector.

          <p>Haas F1 team has requested a review of the FIA's decision to disallow Oliver Bearman's final qualifying lap at the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix. The team believes Bearman completed the lap before a red flag was issued due to a crash. Despite television footage and live-timing data seemingly supporting Haas's claim, the FIA upheld its original decision, citing orange 'abort lap' lights on the start-line gantry. Bearman expressed his belief that the decision was unfair, stating that the red light on his dash appeared after he crossed the line.</p>

          <h2>Edison's Safety Record Declined, but Executive Bonuses Increased</h2>

          <p>Despite a decline in Southern California Edison's safety record, including a surge in fires and serious employee injuries, executive bonuses rose for some top executives. This raises concerns about the effectiveness of a state law designed to link executive compensation to safety performance. Consumer advocates argue that the law lacks teeth, as executives can still receive increased bonuses despite safety failures. The utility maintains that compensation is structured to promote safety, but critics point to the fact that most compensation is based on profit and stock price appreciation, not safety metrics.</p>

          <p>California is taking a multi-pronged approach to defend its climate progress against actions from the Trump administration. These actions include legal challenges, legislation, and leveraging the state's economic influence. The state has filed numerous lawsuits against the administration's environmental policies and is working to maintain its authority to set vehicle-emission standards. California is also exploring legislative measures to address climate change, such as requiring corporations to disclose carbon emissions and making polluters pay for climate-related damages.</p>
