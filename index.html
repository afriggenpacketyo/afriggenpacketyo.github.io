          <h2>Trump Urges European Union to Levy 100% Tariffs on India and China Over Russian Oil Purchases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-09 22:47:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has reportedly urged the European Union to impose tariffs of up to 100% on Chinese and Indian imports to pressure them over their continued purchases of Russian oil. This move is aimed at increasing economic strain on Moscow to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. The request was made during a meeting with senior U.S. and EU officials, where Washington also indicated a willingness to mirror any tariffs Europe imposes. The proposal follows the U.S. already placing punitive tariffs on India for its Russian oil trade, escalating global economic tensions amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region rose as investors evaluated new inflation data from China, which showed a larger-than-expected consumer price decline of 0.4% year-over-year for August. Despite the deflationary signal, the producer price index drop narrowed, aligning with expectations. Technology stocks in Apple's supply chain, like Foxconn and Samsung, saw gains following Apple's new product launch. Meanwhile, markets in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, and South Korea all advanced, with Hong Kong's Alibaba shares continuing a rally and South Korea's Kospi reaching its highest level since late 2021.

          <p>Poland's military has taken action to neutralize multiple drone-type objects that repeatedly violated its airspace during recent Russian strikes on Ukraine. Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed the military operation, stating that weapons were used against the objects and that he is in constant contact with the president and defense minister. The incursions prompted the closure of four Polish airports, including Warsaw's Chopin Airport, due to "unplanned military activity." This heightened state of alert reflects ongoing security concerns in the region, particularly after a stray Ukrainian missile killed two people in Poland in 2022.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has granted a preliminary injunction that blocks President Donald Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook while her lawsuit proceeds. Cook, the first Black woman on the Fed board, sued Trump after he attempted to remove her "for cause" based on allegations of mortgage fraud that predate her tenure. Judge Jia Cobb ruled that Cook demonstrated a strong likelihood of success, stating that the "for cause" provision in the Federal Reserve Act likely applies only to conduct during a governor's time in office. The ruling underscores the principle of Federal Reserve independence from political pressure.</p>

          <p>A recently released collection of documents from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, including a scrapbook of 50th birthday messages from 2003, provides a disturbing look into his elite social network and highly sexualized lifestyle. The documents feature crude messages and sexually explicit imagery from associates, as well as a purported letter from Donald Trump, which the former president claims is fake.

          <p>China's economy is facing persistent deflationary pressures as consumer prices fell by 0.4% in August, a steeper decline than economists had predicted. Concurrently, the producer price index dropped by 2.9%, marking its third consecutive year of deflation, though the rate of decline has slightly eased. These figures intensify calls for Beijing to implement stronger stimulus measures to boost weak domestic demand and support slowing export growth. While core inflation saw a slight increase, economists suggest that significant fiscal support is needed to counteract the mounting economic strains and achieve the government's inflation target.

          <p>During a House Oversight subcommittee hearing on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), lawmakers were shown startling video footage of a U.S. MQ-9 drone firing a Hellfire missile at a mysterious orb off the coast of Yemen.

Witnesses, including military veterans, testified that no known U.S. technology could withstand such an impact, expressing that the footage was frightening.

          <p>A new blood test for Alzheimer's disease is being trialed across the UK with over 1,000 patients, a development that could revolutionize how the condition is diagnosed. The test detects biomarkers for the rogue amyloid and tau proteins associated with Alzheimer's, aiming to improve diagnostic accuracy from the current 70% to over 90%. Led by University College London, the study will assess how the £100 test works within the NHS, potentially replacing more invasive and less accessible methods like PET scans and lumbar punctures. An accurate, early diagnosis is becoming increasingly crucial as new treatments for early-stage Alzheimer's approach clinical availability.</p>

          <p>New Mexico is set to become the first state in the U.S. to offer free, universal childcare to all its residents, regardless of income. Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the expansion of an existing program that has already helped lift thousands of families out of poverty. The initiative, effective November 1st, is expected to save families an average of $12,000 per child annually and is being hailed as a "model for the nation." The state's data-driven approach has already shown positive results, including reduced poverty rates for early childhood educators and greater financial stability for participating families.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles-based band La Santa Cecilia is using its music to create a space for joy and strength within the Latino community amid rising fears of mass deportations. This comes after a recent Supreme Court ruling allowing immigration agents to detain individuals based on appearance or language. The band, long known for its advocacy for immigrant rights, sees its upcoming performances as a way to help people replenish their spirits to face ongoing challenges. Their 2013 song "Ice el Hielo," which details the plight of undocumented families separated by ICE, remains deeply relevant in the current political climate.</p>

          <p>Immigrant rights organizers in Chicago are working to support local communities amid rising tensions from increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity, dubbed "Operation Midway Blitz" by the Trump administration. Activists are verifying tips about ICE sightings and providing resources to families, as many residents in targeted neighborhoods live in fear. The Department of Homeland Security claims it is targeting criminals, but organizers argue that anyone who appears to be of a certain ethnicity is being targeted. The heightened enforcement has led to the postponement of community events like Mexican Independence Day celebrations to protect residents.</p>

          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics has issued a major downward revision, indicating the U.S. labor market added 911,000 fewer jobs in the year ending March 2025 than initially reported. This preliminary benchmark revision, which is larger than economists had forecast, suggests that the labor market was cooling more significantly last year than previously understood. The updated data, which better accounts for business openings and closures, shows that job growth momentum was weaker entering 2025. This revision strengthens the case for the Federal Reserve to consider interest rate cuts to support the labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The public bus system in Akron, Ohio, has received national recognition as the mass transit system of the year following a major overhaul that led to a 24% increase in ridership. Under the leadership of CEO Dawn Distler, a former bus driver, Metro reinvented its routes based on passenger feedback, increasing frequency to every 15 minutes in key areas and adding service seven days a week. The changes were implemented without a budget increase and have been praised by residents for improving accessibility and convenience.

          <p>Recent data from The Nation's Report Card shows a concerning decline in academic proficiency among U.S. students, with average scores dropping for 8th graders in science and 12th graders in math and reading between 2019 and 2024. The results, described as "sobering" by officials, are the first post-pandemic scores for these assessments but indicate a downward trend that began even before 2020. The assessments also revealed the widest performance gaps ever recorded between the lowest- and highest-achieving students.

          <p>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has announced a change to martial law, now permitting men between the ages of 18 and 22 to leave the country. This move reverses a previous ban that prevented most men aged 18 to 60 from traveling abroad since the full-scale invasion began in 2022. The decision is intended to prevent young men from losing their connection to Ukraine by being taken abroad by their parents before finishing school. The policy change comes amid ongoing concerns about Ukraine's military manpower and a declining birthrate, raising questions about its potential impact on the long-term war effort.</p>

          <p>A district court judge in Michigan has dismissed all criminal charges against 15 Republicans who signed documents falsely claiming to be the state's official electors for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Judge Kristen D. Simmons ruled that the defendants, who believed there were serious election irregularities, had legally exercised their constitutional rights and were not sophisticated enough to fully understand the electoral process. The judge determined their actions did not constitute forgery or conspiracy. Michigan's Attorney General, Dana Nessel, called the ruling disappointing and stated her office will consider an appeal.</p>
