          <p>Harvard President Alan Garber is facing pressure from the Trump administration, which is threatening to cut federal funding and tax-exempt status due to concerns about antisemitism and ideological diversity on campus. Garber is fighting back against what he sees as federal overreach, while also acknowledging the need to address cultural issues within Harvard, such as intolerance of dissenting viewpoints. He has rolled back policies related to diversity and race, drawing criticism from some students who feel he is prioritizing optics over values. Garber's approach involves defending the university against external attacks while simultaneously reforming its internal culture to restore trust in academia.</p>

          <p>Capital One anticipates significant financial benefits from its acquisition of Discover Financial, particularly through expanding Discover's payment network internationally.

The company expects $2.7 billion in annual synergies by 2027, with expense savings and network benefits driving the value. Capital One also plans to move its entire debit-card volume to the Discover network, taking advantage of regulatory benefits related to swipe fees, but expanding Discover's international presence will take time and require building more partnerships with merchants.</p>

Berkshire Hathaway reported a drop in first-quarter earnings, partly attributed to the uncertainty generated by Trump's trade policies.

          <p>New research reveals that domestication is causing cats and dogs to evolve similar skull shapes due to human selection, leading to convergence in traits. Selective breeding for features like flat faces, driven by human preference for infant-like characteristics, results in health problems for the animals. The UK government has raised concerns about the welfare implications of breeding for extreme physical traits, including breathing difficulties and neurological conditions. Understanding how humans influence the evolution of domestic animals highlights the responsibility to prioritize animal welfare over aesthetic preferences.</p>

          <p>Lifestyle choices can significantly lower the risk of developing dementia, stroke, and depression later in life, according to a recent study.

The study highlights the interconnectedness of these conditions, suggesting that preventive measures can have a broad impact on brain health. The article then details the top three practices with the greatest effect on your chances of staving off these brain conditions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's claims that grocery and gas prices are falling are misleading, according to economists. While overall inflation has eased slightly, grocery prices have actually increased, and gas prices have remained relatively flat since Trump took office. Egg prices, specifically highlighted by Trump, have soared, while wholesale egg prices have declined, creating uncertainty for consumers. Experts emphasize that overall price levels are still rising, albeit at a slower pace, and that falling oil prices may indicate expectations of an economic slowdown.</p>

          <p>Child therapists have identified six common worries among children that parents often don't realize: social dynamics, social media, big life changes, packed schedules, inconsistency, and trauma. Children worry about fitting in with peers, comparing themselves to others on social media, and navigating disruptions in their lives. They also experience stress from overscheduled activities and anxiety caused by inconsistent routines or traumatic events. The therapists provide practical strategies for parents to help their children manage these worries, including naming emotions, practicing deep breathing, using affirming phrases, and scheduling a "worry window."</p>

          <p>Voice of America (VoA) is set to resume broadcasting after a federal appeals court temporarily blocked an executive order from the Trump administration that aimed to dismantle the broadcaster. The court ruling allows VoA staff to return to the office and resume programming while the appeal is processed. However, the funding freeze on other publicly funded broadcasters, such as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, will remain in place. The USAGA had enjoyed bipartisan support, until now, due to the vital role VoA and the other foreign-news broadcasters play in advancing democracy and US interests by reaching about 360 million people in countries that have little to no independent press.</p>

The pilot suspected that kerosene leaking from the plane had kept the predators at bay, and the survivors were taken to the hospital in excellent condition.</p>

Local officials deny the president's claims, but said the apartment complex was terrorized, including by people linked to Tren de Aragua. The state and city have vowed to defend their policies.</p>
