          <p>The United States and Europe are actively exploring alternatives to rare earth elements to lessen their strategic dependence on China, which currently dominates the global supply chain. These critical minerals are essential for a wide range of products, from consumer electronics and electric vehicles to advanced defense systems. Recent export controls by Beijing on certain rare earths and magnets have intensified the urgency for Western nations to develop new technologies and supply sources. This geopolitical tension underscores the vulnerability of relying on a single country for materials crucial to modern industry and national security.</p>

The social media platform reported substantial year-over-year sales growth and an increase in net income, alongside a record number of global monthly active users, particularly a strong increase in its Gen Z user base. However, the company noted lingering advertiser concerns related to tariffs and market uncertainty, which impacted investor confidence.

          <p>China has successfully completed a crucial test of its crewed lunar lander, named Lanyue, marking a significant step toward its goal of sending astronauts to the moon by 2030. The test, conducted in a simulated lunar environment, verified the lander's integrated systems, including its landing and ascent capabilities, guidance, and propulsion. This prototype is designed to transport two astronauts to the lunar surface and serve as their habitat and operational hub. The achievement represents a major milestone in China's ambitious space exploration program and its competition in the international space race.</p>

          <p>The bookseller Waterstones has issued an apology after its annual BookFest event at its flagship London store was heavily criticized by attendees for severe overcrowding and disorganization. Patrons described the scene as "utter chaos" and potentially unsafe, with videos showing massive queues and packed floors. Some attendees, including one with a disability, reported being knocked over, while another author reportedly had a panic attack and had to leave. Waterstones acknowledged the unexpectedly high turnout but stated that safety was never at risk, promising to review its procedures for future events.</p>

This federal security blitz involves deploying additional agents to key areas like the National Mall and Union Station and is backed by a task force established to make the capital safer. The effort will also focus on policies such as expediting concealed carry permits, cracking down on transit system offenses, and reviewing pretrial detention rules. This move follows the president's threat to federalize parts of the city's law enforcement to restore order.</p>

          <p>A contentious political battle over congressional redistricting is intensifying across the United States, spearheaded by a Republican effort in Texas to redraw maps to gain five additional House seats before the 2026 elections. This mid-decade push, encouraged by President Trump, has prompted Texas Democratic lawmakers to flee the state to block the vote. In response, Democratic-led states like California and New York are considering their own redistricting efforts to counteract potential GOP gains. The situation highlights the growing partisan struggle over gerrymandering and its profound implications for the balance of power in Congress.</p>

          <p>Intel's stock price declined after President Donald Trump publicly called for the immediate resignation of its CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, citing him as being "highly conflicted."

In response, Intel affirmed its commitment to advancing U.S. security and economic interests, highlighting its significant domestic investments in semiconductor manufacturing.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's proposal for a renewed military offensive and potential full occupation of the Gaza Strip is facing significant opposition. The plan has drawn warnings from Israel's own army leadership, who reportedly fear it is a "trap" that would endanger soldiers and the remaining hostages. Families of hostages are also advocating for a negotiated deal rather than expanded military action. The prospect of a full occupation, which could worsen the humanitarian crisis, has also raised concerns among international allies, further isolating Israel on the global stage.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, halting further construction at the controversial immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades known as "Alligator Alcatraz." The ruling is a victory for a coalition of conservation groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, who sued on the grounds that the facility was built without required environmental assessments and threatens a fragile ecosystem. While the facility can continue to house detainees, the 14-day pause on construction allows for further legal arguments over its environmental impact. The project has been criticized by activists for its location and the conditions inside.</p>

The injury raises significant concerns for the team's offensive line depth, as his absence would be a major blow to the protection for quarterback Justin Herbert.</p>

The recipe incorrectly listed parmesan and butter, and suggested optional cream, instead of the three required ingredients: pecorino cheese, black pepper, and pasta. An Italian restaurant association was so incensed it contacted the British embassy, clarifying that the published recipe was for a different dish entirely. The incident highlights the deep cultural significance of culinary tradition in Italy and the passionate defense of its authenticity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Supreme Court has unanimously ruled in favor of environmental groups, allowing their lawsuit challenging the state's cuts to rooftop solar incentives to proceed. The decision overturns a lower court ruling that had deferred to the Public Utilities Commission's (PUC) interpretation of the law. Environmental groups argue the PUC violated state law in 2022 when it drastically reduced the credits solar panel owners receive for sending excess power to the grid. This ruling is a significant victory for solar advocates, who claim the cuts undermine California's clean energy goals and illegally harm consumers.</p>
