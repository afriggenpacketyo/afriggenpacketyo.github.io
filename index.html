          <p>Following a lengthy and delayed trial, Samuel Woodward was convicted for the 2018 first-degree murder of Blaze Bernstein, a 19-year-old gay and Jewish college student, in a case that drew national attention. The jury in Orange County, California, found the killing to be a hate crime, revealing Woodward's deep involvement with a violent neo-Nazi organization and resulting in a sentence of life in prison without parole. The article details the painful six-year journey for Bernstein's parents, from their son's disappearance to the final verdict, and their confrontation with the killer in court. In response to the tragedy, the Bernstein family has established a kindness movement called "BlazeItForward" to honor their son's legacy.</p>

          <p>France is leading a major investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, positioning it as a European competitor to Elon Musk's Starlink service, though experts remain skeptical about its ability to compete on a mass-market scale. With a recent â‚¬1.35 billion state-led investment, France has become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, viewing the company as a strategic asset for the EU's technological sovereignty. However, Eutelsat's OneWeb constellation of 650 low-Earth orbit satellites is significantly smaller than Starlink's 7,600, posing a major challenge in capacity and coverage. Analysts suggest Eutelsat is better positioned to serve specialized government and enterprise markets that prioritize European control over raw capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The first half of the year has been marked by significant market volatility driven by geopolitical and trade tensions, a trend expected to continue into the second half. This week, focus shifts to the European Central Bank's forum in Sintra, Portugal, where central bankers will convene amidst ongoing political pressures, particularly from the U.S. on the Federal Reserve. In the U.K., Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government faces plummeting approval ratings one year into its term, struggling with domestic economic challenges despite securing several trade deals. Analysts warn that elevated policy uncertainty and a worsening macroeconomic backdrop will likely fuel higher equity volatility in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Quemoy, a small island group administered by Taipei but located just miles from the mainland Chinese city of Xiamen, serves as a unique example of the geopolitical standoff across the Taiwan Strait. Once a heavily militarized front line, the island has transformed into a quiet community caught between two political systems, showcasing the practical limits of influence for both Beijing and Taipei. Despite its proximity to the mainland, Quemoy remains under Taiwanese control, acting as a symbol of Taipei's governance. The article suggests the island's unique position demonstrates that neither side can fully impose its will, creating a complex and delicate balance in the region.</p>

          <p>In response to the perceived existential threat from Russia, five NATO countries bordering Russia or Belarusâ€”Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Polandâ€”are withdrawing from the 1997 Ottawa Convention, which bans anti-personnel mines. This move will allow them to produce and deploy land mines along their borders as a significant deterrent, effectively creating a new, explosive "Iron Curtain." The strategy is highly controversial due to the indiscriminate danger mines pose to civilians long after conflicts end, with critics highlighting the immense human and environmental costs. Proponents, however, argue it is a necessary measure for national defense against Russia, which never signed the treaty and possesses a massive mine stockpile.</p>

          <p>Over three years after the Taliban's takeover, a small but growing number of foreign tourists are venturing into Afghanistan, a development the unrecognized government is eager to support. Officials highlight the end of widespread conflict as a key factor for safety, and they see tourism as a vital source of revenue for the poverty-stricken nation, with nearly 9,000 foreign visitors arriving last year. This trend raises ethical questions, as visitors travel for leisure in a country where the government imposes severe restrictions on women and girls. Travelers interviewed acknowledged the moral dilemma but noted their spending directly supports local people rather than the government, while officials hope tourism will foster international relations.</p>

          <p>France has enacted a new nationwide ban on smoking in public spaces, including all beaches, parks, and areas near schools and libraries, which went into effect on Sunday. The rules are designed to protect non-smokers, especially children, from the effects of passive smoking and are part of a broader government goal to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032. While e-cigarettes are not included and restaurant terraces are exempt, violators of the new ban could face fines up to â‚¬700. The move comes as France, despite declining rates, still has one of the higher smoking populations in Europe, with over 30% of adults smoking.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation details the harrowing experience of Jay Hulme, who was subjected to a relentless stalking campaign by Venessa Pinto, a Church of England lay preacher, after he rejected her romantic advances. The abuse included online harassment, false accusations, and threats, which Hulme meticulously documented. When he reported the stalking, the Bishop of Leicester, Martyn Snow, initially dismissed his complaint, accused him of witchcraft, and punished him instead of the perpetrator. After a prolonged institutional failure by both the church and police, Pinto was eventually arrested and pleaded guilty to stalking, receiving a community order, while Hulme has been left with lasting trauma.</p>

The 51-49 vote allows the Senate to proceed to a final debate on the nearly 1,000-page bill.

          <p>The Leadmill, an iconic music venue in Sheffield for 45 years, has hosted its final event after losing a prolonged battle with its landlords, marking the end of an era for the city's music scene. The venue, which helped launch the careers of bands like Pulp and Arctic Monkeys, was a cultural cornerstone for generations of residents and students. Musician Richard Hawley compared its importance to Liverpool's Cavern Club, stating he would not return to the venue under new management on principle. The closure has been met with an outpouring of memories and sadness from fans and artists, who lament the loss of a vital grassroots venue.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new voluntary partnership with major food retailers and manufacturers in England to encourage healthier eating habits and tackle rising obesity rates. Under the plan, businesses will be asked to find ways to make healthy food more appealing, such as through promotions, loyalty point incentives, or in-store layout changes. While the initiative requires retailers to report on healthy food sales to increase accountability, it does not impose specific targets. The policy is part of a broader strategy to improve national health and relieve pressure on the NHS, as official figures show obesity affects over one in five children by the time they leave primary school.</p>

Without naming individuals, he alluded to past instances where he felt compelled to condemn remarks from both President Donald Trump and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer.

Athletes are now living together in a "virtual athletes' village" during competitions to simulate Olympic conditions and build resilience to challenges outside the pool, such as travel delays or unfamiliar environments. The initiative, trialed during a recent Tokyo championship, aims to foster a stronger team spirit and help younger athletes adapt to high-pressure international events.

This attack reopens a recent conflict between Musk and the Trump administration, which he briefly served as head of the Department of Government Efficiency.

          <p>Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters rallied in Belgrade, Serbia, demanding an early election and an end to President Aleksandar Vucic's rule, leading to clashes with riot police. The student-led demonstration, one of the largest in recent months, saw police use tear gas and stun grenades, resulting in dozens of arrests. President Vucic dismissed the protests as a foreign plot to topple his government and has refused calls for a snap election. The widespread unrest, which began last December after a deadly infrastructure collapse, has been fueled by accusations of government corruption and ties to organized crime.</p>

          <p>China's decision to halt exports of rare earth materials is expected to accelerate international efforts to establish alternative production facilities, though the process will be challenging and expensive. According to an American firm involved in the industry, building a non-Chinese supply chain will require significant investment, subsidies, and potentially tariffs to compete with China's market dominance. One such project involves a US$50 million plan by REalloys to create a high-performance magnet production line in collaboration with a Canadian research council, sourcing ore from Brazil. This highlights the global push to reduce dependency on China for these critical materials. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave brings high temperatures to the UK, cities like London are experiencing even more intense heat due to a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect. This effect causes built-up areas to be significantly warmerâ€”often by 4-6Â°Câ€”than surrounding rural landscapes, especially at night. The primary cause is the prevalence of dark, hard surfaces like asphalt and concrete, which absorb and retain the sun's heat, while a lack of vegetation and water reduces natural cooling from evaporation. As climate change makes heatwaves more frequent and severe, this effect means growing urban populations will bear the brunt of extreme heat.</p>

Critics view the spectacle as an affront to the fragile lagoon city, and they dismissed Bezos's donation to local environmental groups as an attempt to appease anger.

The initiative, which is planned for a nationwide rollout by 2026, educates pupils on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen correctly. Experts emphasize that sunburn during childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, later in life. With melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, charities and health professionals behind the project hope that instilling good habits early can help "grow skin cancer out of the next generation."</p>

The government had attempted to ban the march using a controversial "child protection" law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia, but the city's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, used a legal loophole to ensure it proceeded. The huge turnout, far exceeding last year's, was seen by many as a direct response to the government's ban attempt. The event transformed from a traditional Pride parade into a broader demonstration for freedom and solidarity against Orban's populist rule.</p>
