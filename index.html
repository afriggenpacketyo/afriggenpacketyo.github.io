        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Early Saturday, automatic gunfire was heard in central Gaza as the Israeli military mobilized troops for a broader advance, aiming to seize more land and displace civilians. The origin of the gunfire remains unknown, but it followed intense Israeli bombardment overnight, causing some civilians to flee westward. Mediators, including the Trump administration, are attempting to broker a new temporary truce between Israel and Hamas, who have been at war since October 7, 2023, resulting in significant casualties on both sides. Despite the toll, the conflict has not decisively defeated Hamas or freed all hostages, and the UN warns of widespread hunger due to a blockade imposed by Israel.</p>

          <p>Poland is set to hold its presidential election, with the outcome determining the fate of the pro-European government's reform plans, which have been hindered by the current president. The election pits left-wing liberal Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, against national-conservative Karol Nawrocki, who has support from the Law and Justice party. Tusk's coalition government, elected in December 2023, aimed to restore the rule of law, liberalize abortion legislation, and enhance LGBTQ+ rights, but President Andrzej Duda has largely blocked these efforts. Nawrocki's campaign has been marred by scandals and criticism, while Trzaskowski is seen as the candidate with the best chance of winning, despite a shrinking lead in the polls.</p>

Residents reported feeling the debris in the air, and expressways experienced significant backups. The National Weather Service noted that dust storm warnings are more common in rural parts of central and southern Illinois, making the event in Chicago highly unusual.</p>

          <p>Almost a month after the Aum Shinrikyo cult's nerve gas attack on Tokyo's subway, dozens of abused and famished children were rescued from its compound. Mitsuo Hosaka, working at a child welfare center, took charge of 53 children, providing them with a safe space. The children, brainwashed and abused, initially demanded to return to Aum, but gradually began to trust the staff and regain their childlike selves. The article recounts the efforts to reintegrate the children into society, including reunions with parents who had left the cult.</p>
