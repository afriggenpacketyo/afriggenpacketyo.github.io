        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>E-commerce giants Temu and Shein face challenges in the U.S. due to the closure of a trade loophole and high tariffs on Chinese goods. Despite these obstacles, experts believe the companies will remain competitive by accelerating localization strategies, onboarding American sellers, and leveraging economies of scale through bulk shipments to U.S. warehouses. Shein is also expanding its supply chain to countries like Turkey, Mexico, and Brazil. These companies have previously offered products at a third of the price of Amazon, so they will still be price competitive despite the tariffs. The article also notes that agile supply chains are key to the success of these companies (not investment advice).</p>

Signs of prolonged starvation are increasing, with lab tests showing indicators of starvation in a significant number of urine samples. The article asserts that Israel is exploiting aid as a tool of war, a violation of international law, and calls for immediate resumption of humanitarian aid, secure corridors, and a plan for recovery that guarantees Palestinian presence, security, and self-determination.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has barred Harvard University from receiving new federal grants, alleging antisemitism and criticizing its diversity policies. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated that Harvard has failed its "legal obligations" and should no longer seek grants. This move freezes billions of dollars in future research grants. Harvard is challenging this action, calling it an "illegal government overreach" and stating it will defend against attempts to stifle research and innovation. The university also sued the US government after it froze $2.2 billion (€1.94 billion) in federal grants to the institution, while pushing to strip the school of its tax-exempt status.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has requested a judge to dismiss a lawsuit from three GOP-led states aiming to restrict telehealth access to abortion medication mifepristone. The Justice Department argues that the states lack the legal right to sue, maintaining a legal course charted by the Biden administration. The lawsuit challenges the FDA's actions from 2016, which is past the six-year time limit to sue, and the attorneys said the states can't just piggyback on the earlier lawsuit as a way to keep the case in Texas.

The removal of two defense ministers and senior officers, including leaders of the Rocket Force, raises questions about the competence and reliability of Xi’s military commanders. While China's military has made significant advancements, the internal turmoil and lack of battlefield experience among officers weaken Xi’s appetite for war.

          <p>Friedrich Merz is set to become Germany's chancellor at a challenging time, marked by a stagnant economy, strained relations with the U.S., and the rise of a nationalist party. Despite lacking executive government experience, Merz is attempting to address these crises by criticizing President Trump, leading a newly muscular Europe, and breaking a campaign promise on fiscal restraint. While some see him as an agile politician, others criticize his inconsistency and alienating conservative voters. The article notes that Merz faces low approval ratings and challenges from the far-right AfD.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to close a tariff loophole is expected to significantly impact delivery companies like UPS and FedEx, as well as e-commerce companies selling Chinese goods in the U.S. The de minimis exemption, which allowed low-value goods to enter the U.S. without tariffs, has been eliminated for imports from mainland China and Hong Kong. This change could reduce the volume of shipments from China, affecting revenue for logistics companies and airlines. The article also notes that some trade experts said the administration’s change undermined tariff collection because it deprived Customs and Border Protection of information it needed to make sure that importers were paying the correct amount of import duties.</p>
