        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A former London police officer, Brian McManus, has been found guilty of murdering his wife, Lucille Ann McManus, in Warner Robins, Georgia. Prosecutors argued that McManus killed his wife after she discovered his affair and threatened to expose their "sham" marriage, which was allegedly arranged to help him secure a U.S. green card. He attempted to stage the scene as a suicide and blame the victim's family, but evidence, including security footage and conflicting statements, led to his conviction. The district attorney's office described the crime as a brutal and calculated act by a "serial liar and con man."</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that ten more hostages held in Gaza are expected to be released very shortly, as his administration continues to advocate for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The current proposal involves the return of these ten living hostages and the remains of eighteen others, in exchange for Israel releasing an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement comes amid reports that Israel's Mossad intelligence agency is seeking U.S. support for a plan to relocate Palestinians from Gaza to other countries. The administration has been signaling that a broader ceasefire agreement is imminent.</p>

          <h2>Argentine Actor Juan Pablo Di Pace Makes Directorial Debut with Personal Film 'Before We Forget'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 20:46:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Argentine actor Juan Pablo Di Pace, known for roles in "Fuller House" and "Mamma Mia!", has made his directorial and screenwriting debut with the film "Before We Forget." The movie explores a first love between two young men at an Italian film school, drawing from Di Pace's own adolescent experiences. Di Pace, who co-directed with longtime friend Andrés Pepe Estrada, emphasizes that the film is a universal love story rather than strictly an LGBTQ+ genre piece, focusing on tenderness and memory. The narrative shifts between the past and the present, where an adult version of the protagonist, played by Di Pace himself, reflects on his formative romance.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Marine veteran, Scott Harrison, has brought to life a vision that helped him endure the Vietnam War. During his service, Harrison would listen to a music box and imagine a peaceful carousel in a mountain meadow to cope with the trauma of combat. After struggling with PTSD for years, he decided to make that vision a reality, purchasing a broken-down carousel in 1986 and spending 26 years hand-carving new animals for it. Now a nonprofit attraction in Nederland, Colorado, the "Carousel of Happiness" has delighted over a million visitors and provided Harrison with a profound sense of healing and purpose.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act, landmark legislation creating the first major regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The bipartisan bill establishes consumer protections and clear legal definitions for these digital currencies, which are pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar to maintain a stable value. The law permits banks, nonbanks, and credit unions to issue their own stablecoins, a move the administration hails as a revolutionary step for financial technology that will strengthen the dollar's role in the digital age.

          <p>President Trump has filed a $10 billion libel lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal's publisher, its parent company News Corp., and owner Rupert Murdoch. The suit stems from an article alleging Trump sent a "bawdy" birthday letter to Jeffrey Epstein in 2003, which the president vehemently denies as fake. The lawsuit claims the report was false and defamatory, representing a failure of journalistic standards. This legal action coincides with the Justice Department, at Trump's request, filing a motion to unseal grand jury testimony related to the Epstein investigation, citing immense public interest in the case.</p>

          <p>A general contractor in Los Angeles reports that the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement is causing significant labor shortages in California's construction industry. Jason Pietruszka stated that many undocumented but highly skilled workers are now afraid to show up for jobs, fearing deportation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This shortage is delaying projects, including the rebuilding of thousands of homes destroyed in recent wildfires, and driving up labor costs. A UCLA Anderson Forecast report supports this, warning that increased deportations will deplete the state's construction workforce, which heavily relies on foreign-born labor.</p>

CVI occurs when veins in the legs struggle to return blood to the heart, causing pooling and swelling. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes like compression, elevation, and exercise.

Prosecutors allege Brycson Gaddis beat the child to death in an apartment before disposing of his body. The boy suffered extensive injuries, including a broken jaw and fractured ribs. This incident occurred while a bench warrant was out for Gaddis's arrest, after he failed to appear in court for a separate domestic violence case and his electronic monitoring device ran out of power, raising questions about his prior release from custody.</p>

          <p>The announcement that "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" will end in May 2026 has ignited a debate about the viability of the traditional late-night talk show format. While CBS cited financial reasons for the cancellation, the move has surprised many, as the show is a ratings leader. Critics and viewers are questioning whether the format, which relies on topical humor and celebrity interviews, can survive in an era of streaming, social media, and fragmented audiences. The decision also drew political scrutiny, with some questioning if it was influenced by Colbert's frequent criticism of the Trump administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After several quieter years, wasps are making a significant comeback in the UK this summer, according to pest control experts and entomologists. The increase is attributed to a very warm and dry spring, which created ideal breeding conditions. While many people dislike social wasps for their stings and presence at outdoor gatherings, scientists emphasize their crucial ecological role as apex predators and natural pest controllers. Experts advise the public to remain calm and avoid swatting the insects, suggesting that leaving a small amount of a sugary substance away from picnic areas can serve as a useful distraction.</p>

          <p>The popular cooking competition show "MasterChef" is facing a crisis after both of its long-time presenters, Gregg Wallace and John Torode, were sacked in quick succession. The dismissals follow an eight-month investigation that upheld over 40 claims of misconduct against Wallace, including unwelcome physical contact. Subsequently, an allegation that Torode used a highly offensive racist term on set was also upheld, leading to his departure. The BBC has affirmed its commitment to the show's future, but the events have raised questions about the workplace culture and what will happen to the already-filmed new series.</p>

          <p>The Jeffrey Epstein case continues to be a powerful and animating issue for many supporters of Donald Trump, representing a symbol of perceived corruption within the so-called "deep state." For years, figures within the MAGA movement have fueled conspiracy theories about a secret "client list" and a cover-up by powerful elites. The administration's recent, and to some, underwhelming, handling of the Epstein files has created a difficult situation for the president, pitting him against the conspiratorial elements of his own base. The controversy highlights how the case has become intertwined with broader narratives of institutional distrust that are central to the movement's identity.</p>

          <p>A new stage comedy in Liverpool, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," reimagines the lives of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a fantasy saga inspired by "The Lord of the Rings." Written by Helen Serafinowicz, co-creator of the sitcom "Motherland," the play is a humorous and affectionate homage to the couple. The plot is loosely based on a 2004 tabloid story claiming Coleen threw her engagement ring away, sparking a treasure hunt. The show's creators stress that the play is a silly, medieval-themed caper and not a malicious satire, celebrating the couple's resilience and status as local icons.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland is expanding its RSV immunization program to protect premature babies, who are highly vulnerable to the common respiratory virus. Starting this autumn, a long-acting injection, Nirsevimab, will be offered to infants born too prematurely to have benefited from the vaccine given to their mothers during pregnancy. RSV is a leading cause of hospitalization in young children, and this new single-injection treatment offers around 80% protection. Health officials emphasized that the move will help protect vulnerable infants and reduce pressure on the health service during the winter months, urging all parents to ensure their children receive recommended vaccinations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered a specific interaction between gut bacteria and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The study found that a molecule produced by certain gut bacteria can over-activate an immune protein called STING in individuals who have a less effective version of a protective gene, OTUD3. This unchecked immune response leads to chronic inflammation in the colon. The finding helps explain why the disease varies so much between patients and opens the door for developing more precise, personalized therapies that target this specific pathway, rather than suppressing the entire immune system.</p>

After a post-round discussion, his score for the hole was changed from a five to a seven, significantly impacting his position. Lowry expressed disappointment but accepted the penalty to protect his reputation, as the rules state the player is responsible even if the movement was not seen at the moment it occurred.</p>

The cuts are expected to lead to layoffs and reduced programming, with a disproportionate impact on smaller, rural stations that rely heavily on federal support. Acclaimed filmmaker Ken Burns noted that many educational projects would be impossible to produce without this funding.
