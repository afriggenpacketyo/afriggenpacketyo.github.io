          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a record high for the third consecutive day, driven by optimism surrounding ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S., even as other Asian markets experienced broader losses. The index briefly touched an intraday high of 3,794.87 before settling near its opening level, contrasting sharply with a weaker Asia-Pacific trend influenced by banking sector fears and intensifying trade tensions. This performance indicates specific investor confidence in South Korea's economic outlook and the potential benefits from the trade talks, distinguishing it from the general market apprehension. The article highlights that U.S. stock futures were also slightly lower, reflecting broader economic concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peru's interim government declared a state of emergency in Lima following deadly clashes between anti-government protesters and police. The demonstrations, fueled by grievances over low wages, corruption, and organized crime, resulted in one protester's death and numerous injuries among both civilians and police officers. President Jose Jeri, facing calls to resign, affirmed his commitment to national stability and sought legislative authority on public safety. The article reports that prosecutors are investigating the shooting death of a hip-hop singer during the unrest, with the president vowing to apply the full force of the law against those inciting chaos.</p>

          <p>An immigration barrister, Chowdhury Rahman, faces a potential disciplinary probe after a judge ruled he used AI tools, including ChatGPT, to prepare legal research for an asylum appeal. This resulted in him citing "entirely fictitious" or "wholly irrelevant" cases, which the judge discovered. Judge Mark Blundell dismissed the appeal, criticizing Rahman for wasting tribunal time and attempting to conceal his reliance on AI. The incident occurred during a case representing Honduran sisters seeking asylum, whose claims were ultimately rejected. The article indicates that Judge Blundell is considering reporting Rahman to the Bar Standards Board for his misleading submissions.</p>

          <p>The UK Prime Minister criticized the decision to prohibit Maccabi Tel Aviv fans from attending an upcoming Europa League match against Aston Villa in Birmingham. The city's Safety Advisory Group, supported by West Midlands Police, classified the fixture as "high-risk" due to intelligence and past incidents, including violent clashes involving Maccabi fans in Amsterdam. Political leaders, including Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch, condemned the ban as unacceptable and a "national disgrace," arguing against tolerating antisemitism. The article notes that UEFA encourages safe environments for fans, while local authorities maintain responsibility for security decisions based on thorough risk assessments.</p>

          <p>China has introduced new, sweeping restrictions on rare earth exports, tightening its control over the global supply of these critical minerals and gaining significant leverage in the ongoing trade war with the U.S. The new rules require foreign companies to obtain Chinese government approval for exports of products containing rare earths, impacting industries from smartphones to fighter jets. This strategic move prompted threats of additional tariffs from President Trump, escalating tensions. The article highlights China's near-monopoly in rare earth processing and its immense strategic value, despite the minerals' small economic contribution to China's GDP. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking long-acting injection for HIV prevention, cabotegravir (CAB-LA), has been approved for NHS use in England and Wales, aligning with Scotland's policy. Administered every other month, this injection offers a transformative alternative to daily pills, aiming to simplify prevention and help achieve the UK's ambitious goal of ending new HIV cases by 2030. Experts believe it will significantly benefit vulnerable individuals for whom oral PrEP is difficult to manage due to access, practicality, or privacy concerns.

Celebrities like Alan Carr, Adele, and Chrissy Teigen have openly discussed their perspiration, significantly contributing to its normalization. The article traces this cultural shift from early 20th-century hygiene marketing that shamed sweat to current trends like "post-gym skin" and the "Sweaty Hot Girl aesthetic." While some experts are skeptical of the commercialization of body positivity, the increasing acceptance of sweating, particularly in social settings like saunas, reflects a broader cultural shift towards authenticity and comfort with natural bodily functions.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court panel rejected the Trump administration's request to overturn a lower court order blocking the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois. The court found the deployment a "likely violation" of the Tenth Amendment and saw "insufficient evidence of a rebellion" against the U.S. government's authority. President Trump had sought to deploy troops for crime prevention in Chicago and to protect federal immigration facilities, describing the city as a "war zone." The article highlights the court's stance that political opposition and spirited protests, even if occasionally violent, do not constitute a rebellion justifying federal military intervention.</p>
