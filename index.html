          <p>Bridgend council is facing criticism for a draft PowerPoint presentation intended for schools that appeared to endorse strangulation during sex, including the line, "It is never OK to start choking someone without asking them first." The council claims the slides were part of an early draft and were removed after feedback, but experts and politicians are questioning why such content was ever considered appropriate. The council maintains the slide was meant to stimulate debate before advising participants that non-fatal strangulation is a dangerous and illegal crime, but critics argue the material is deeply concerning and a breach of trust. Welsh Parliament member Asghar has requested both versions of the presentation to ensure children are being taught properly.</p>

          <p>Representative Ritchie Torres is calling for an ethics investigation into President Trump's plan to accept a $400 million jet from Qatar, intended for use as Air Force One and later as a donation to his presidential library, arguing it violates the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Trump defended the deal on social media, stating it is a "GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE, of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40-year-old Air Force One." Qatari officials say the transfer is under review by legal departments. The article mentions that Presidents have historically circumvented the Emoluments Clause by classifying gifts as belonging to the office, not the individual.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly preparing to accept a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet from the royal family of Qatar for use as Air Force One, which will later be transferred to Trump's presidential library foundation, raising legal and ethical questions. The cost of a new commercial Boeing 747-800 is roughly $400 million. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that any gift given by a foreign government is always accepted in full compliance with all applicable laws. This comes amid Trump's frustration with delays and cost overruns in modernizing the current Air Force One aircraft.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to mutually lower extra tariffs on each other's imports by 115 percentage points and suspend additional 24 percent duties for 90 days, according to a joint statement.

Washington and Beijing also agreed to establish an economic and trade consultation mechanism to discuss issues of mutual concern.

          <p>President Trump is embarking on a four-day trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, prioritizing business deals worth over $1 trillion, including planes, nuclear power, and artificial intelligence investments.

The Qataris are reportedly donating a luxury Boeing 747-8 plane for use as Air Force One, potentially the largest foreign gift ever received by the U.S. government, raising ethical issues given Trump could use the $400 million plane after leaving office.</p>

          <p>Robert F Kennedy Jr, the US health secretary, has intimated that parents are to blame for their children’s autism, and that they are responsible for researching every aspect of their children’s lives that could affect their development, which has drawn criticism. Kennedy advised parents to "do their own research" on vaccines, despite scientific consensus showing no link between vaccines and autism. Critics argue these statements blame parents for vaccinating their kids and causing autism, a condition overwhelmingly genetic. This message reinforces ideals of intensive mothering and weaponizes the supermom myth, according to experts.</p>

          <p>A disputed North Carolina state supreme court race that took nearly six months to resolve has revealed a playbook for future candidates who lose elections to retroactively challenge votes, observers warn, but its ultimate resolution sent a signal that federal courts are unlikely to support an effort to overturn the results of an election. Democrat Allison Riggs defeated Republican Jefferson Griffin by 734 votes last November out of around 5.5m cast. The North Carolina episode marked the most aggressive push by a Republican to overturn an election since Donald Trump’s blunt push to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential race.</p>

          <p>President Trump's establishment of a task force charged with “eradicating anti-Christian bias” is raising questions about how the government will define authentic Christian belief and practice. The executive order cites examples of perceived discrimination against Christians, including prosecutions of anti-abortion protesters and the designation of Easter Sunday as Transgender Day of Visibility. The task force's mandate requires the government to determine the authentically Christian perspective on various issues, which is not always straightforward. This initiative is part of a broader project to recapture political and cultural ground that Christianity has lost, potentially undermining religious tolerance.</p>

Some argue that President Biden's decision not to step aside sooner set the stage for the party's current struggles.

          <p>A group of 49 white Afrikaners, granted refugee status by the Trump administration, have arrived in the U.S. after departing South Africa on a U.S. government-funded charter flight. This resettlement effort follows President Trump's claim that minority Afrikaners are being unfairly treated in South Africa. The South African government has expressed surprise and disagreement with Trump's attacks, saying he has been taken in by disinformation. The Afrikaners will have a pathway to U.S. citizenship and be eligible for government benefits.</p>

Possible reactions include issuing a strong diplomatic protest, recalling the ambassador from Washington, reducing cooperation on immigration and security, and seeking international condemnation.
