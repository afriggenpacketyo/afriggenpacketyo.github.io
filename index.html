          <p>Oil prices experienced a sharp decline after Iran's missile strike on the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar resulted in no casualties, alleviating concerns about escalating Middle East tensions. U.S. crude oil fell by 7.22% to $68.51 per barrel, while Brent crude decreased by 7.18% to $71.48. Qatar confirmed that its air defenses intercepted the Iranian missiles, preventing any casualties. Energy Secretary Chris Wright attributed the oil sell-off to the belief that the situation in the Middle East would de-escalate, crediting President Trump's foreign policy.

          <p>President Trump criticized former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev for suggesting that multiple countries are willing to supply Iran with nuclear warheads following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Trump questioned the accuracy of Medvedev's statement and cautioned against casually discussing nuclear weapons. He boasted about the strength of U.S. nuclear submarines, asserting their superiority. Medvedev had criticized the U.S. strikes on social media while downplaying their impact on Iran, a Russian ally, while the International Atomic Energy Agency reported no increase in off-site radiation levels after the strikes.</p>

          <p>EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas urged a more realistic approach to relations with China, citing concerns about China's support for Russia's war in Ukraine, cyberattacks, interference in democracies, and coercive trade practices. These issues strain the relationship and make it difficult to continue as before, according to Kallas. The ministers met to set the agenda for a planned July 2 Brussels meeting between Kallas and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, aimed at setting the tone for a July 24-25 EU-China leadersâ€™ summit in Beijing and Anhui. Iran will also be on the agenda when Kallas hosts Wang, with both parties thought to be worried about the potential disruption to their bilateral trade, particularly if the Strait of Hormuz is blockaded.</p>

Palestine Action condemned the government's action as "unhinged," while Cooper emphasized that the ban does not affect lawful protest groups campaigning on issues around Palestine or the Middle East. The move comes after several acts of serious damage committed by the group since its creation in 2020, including breaking into a Thales defense factory in Glasgow and causing over Â£1 million in damage.</p>

          <p>This summer, homeowners should understand the differences between home equity loans and HELOCs, as well as shop around for rates and terms to ensure they are getting the best deal. It's important to use home equity for financially sound purposes, such as paying off high-rate debt, rather than for discretionary spending like vacations. Homeowners should always utilize their home equity for smart reasons that can improve their financial standing and avoid uses that can hurt it. By making these strategic moves, homeowners can improve their chances of equity borrowing success. (not investment advice)</p>
