          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly advanced a significant tax and spending bill championed by President Trump, following a contentious session marked by Republican infighting. The 219-213 vote allows for final debate on the legislation, which extends 2017 tax cuts and boosts border security funding while cutting social programs. The bill, which was substantially altered by the Senate to include deeper Medicaid cuts and a higher debt limit increase, faced resistance from some House Republicans. Despite the internal opposition, leadership successfully pushed the measure forward, moving it closer to becoming law. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study published in Nature has shed light on the origins of the Uralic-speaking peoples, who include modern-day Estonians, Finns, and Hungarians. By combining genetic, linguistic, and archeological data from ancient individuals, researchers traced their ancestral roots back to Siberia. The findings detail migrations that occurred between 11,000 and 4,000 years ago, spreading Uralic languages and culture across Eurasia, from the Baltic Sea to East Asia. This research helps explain the unique linguistic heritage of Uralic speakers and their genetic connections to ancient Siberian populations, distinct from their Indo-European neighbors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Leading Chinese brokerages predict that the country's stock market will likely see minimal growth in the latter half of the year due to a lack of significant positive catalysts. Analysts from firms like GF Securities and Industrial Securities point to ongoing deflationary pressures and slow earnings growth as key factors weighing on investor sentiment. While government intervention and a weak but present economic recovery are expected to provide a floor for the market, stocks are considered to be fairly valued for now. This cautious outlook contrasts with more optimistic views on Hong Kong's market. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is reportedly planning to lower the annual tax-free allowance for Cash ISAs in an effort to encourage more investment in the stock market. While the overall Â£20,000 annual ISA limit is expected to remain, the proposed change would specifically cap the amount that can be placed in cash savings. Critics, including Martin Lewis, argue the move could penalize risk-averse savers rather than convert them into investors, potentially forcing them into taxable accounts. The government hopes the policy will boost British companies and provide better long-term returns for individuals. (not investment advice)</p>

Through initiatives like the New Development Bank and increased trade in local currencies, BRICS aims to create a multipolar world order.

          <p>A pilot for a Chinese airline died by suicide after jumping from a 15th-floor window following a dispute with his superiors over a failed performance evaluation. The 31-year-old pilot, identified only by his surname Li, had reportedly been deemed unqualified to fly due to a lack of understanding of certain rules and procedures. Before his death, he allegedly attacked two managers at the airline's Jilin branch office.

Bacon argued that voting against the bill would effectively mean a 20% tax increase for middle-class families. The legislation faces opposition from both moderate Republicans, concerned about an estimated 11.8 million people losing health insurance, and fiscal conservatives worried about adding $3.4 trillion to the national debt.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned that Republican-led proposals to reform Medicaid could result in over three million Californians losing their health coverage. The proposed changes, part of President Trump's larger fiscal plan, include imposing work requirements and making significant funding cuts to Medi-Cal, the state's low-income health program. An analysis by the state's health department estimates that up to 3.4 million residents could be dropped from the rolls. Newsom criticized the plan as a "devastating betrayal," highlighting that California could lose over $28 billion in federal funding, which would severely impact the state's budget and potentially lead to the closure of rural hospitals.</p>

          <p>A team of researchers from Chinese institutions has developed a new blockchain technology designed to be secure against attacks from future quantum computers. Traditional blockchain systems rely on encryption algorithms that are vulnerable to the immense processing power of quantum computing, which poses a significant threat to digital security. The new solution, created by a team from the Beijing Institute of Technology and Guilin University of Electronic Technology, aims to address this vulnerability. This innovation is part of a broader effort to create next-generation security protocols capable of protecting critical digital infrastructure like financial services and supply chain management systems.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have officially confirmed the discovery of a third interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, currently speeding through our solar system. The object, classified as a comet, is described as appearing fuzzy with a short tail, indicating it is releasing gas. It poses no threat to Earth and will pass just inside the orbit of Mars before exiting the solar system. This visitor from another star system is believed to be the largest yet detected and offers scientists a rare opportunity to study material from beyond our solar neighborhood, providing clues about the formation of other star systems.</p>

          <p>A federal jury in New York found music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs not guilty of the most serious charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking. However, he was convicted on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, which carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison each. The verdict came after a high-profile, seven-week trial featuring graphic testimony from former girlfriends. Combs, who had been in custody since his arrest, will remain detained pending a sentencing hearing scheduled for October. His attorneys had argued for his immediate release following the acquittal on the major charges.</p>
