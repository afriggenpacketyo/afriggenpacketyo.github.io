        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A legislative proposal championed by the Trump administration aims to eliminate federal income taxes on tips for service workers, framing it as a benefit for the working class. The bill, which has different versions in the House and Senate, includes income caps and a temporary 2028 expiration date for the tax break. However, critics and policy experts argue the measure would offer limited relief, as many low-wage tipped workers already have no federal income tax liability. They suggest that raising the federal minimum wage would be a more effective way to support these employees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit a new immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz" by state officials. Governor Ron DeSantis announced the center, located at a remote airport, is designed to house up to 5,000 individuals for processing and deportation. Administration officials highlighted the site's isolation and surrounding dangerous wildlife as a deterrent against escape, describing it as a key component in federal efforts to increase deportations of unauthorized immigrants.

          <p>The jury has started deliberations in the federal trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs, who faces charges of racketeering and sex trafficking that could lead to a life sentence. Over seven weeks, prosecutors presented testimony from 34 witnesses, including ex-girlfriends, alleging a pattern of violence, coercion, and forced sexual encounters. The defense argued the case is about money, not crime, and chose not to call any witnesses, instead focusing on challenging the accusers' credibility.

          <p>The Senate is advancing toward a final vote on President Trump's extensive tax and immigration bill, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," aiming for passage by July 4. The process has involved a rare weekend session and a "vote-a-rama" with numerous proposed amendments from Democrats, who criticize the bill as a giveaway to the wealthy. Despite some Republican infighting, including Senator Thom Tillis's opposition over Medicaid changes, GOP leaders are pushing to secure the necessary votes. If passed, the bill will return to the House, where its approval is uncertain due to the GOP's narrow majority. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has delayed by one month a plan to cut off access to a key satellite data program essential for hurricane forecasting, following alarm from the scientific community. The data, collected by Department of Defense satellites, was set to be suspended, a move some scientists warned could set forecasting back decades. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) cited a "significant cybersecurity risk" as the reason for the initial decision but postponed the cutoff at NASA's request. The delay provides a temporary reprieve while concerns over the impact on public safety and climate tracking persist.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Sinaloa, Mexico, discovered 20 bodies, many of them decapitated, on a highway bridge, highlighting a surge in narco-violence. The gruesome finding is linked to an ongoing internal war within the Sinaloa cartel, pitting factions loyal to Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada against those aligned with the sons of "El Chapo" Guzman. This conflict has resulted in over 1,200 deaths this year, characterized by extreme brutality and the public display of victims. The violence underscores the escalating crisis in Mexico, where drug trafficking has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths and disappearances since 2006.</p>

          <p>A Trump administration investigation by the Department of Health and Human Services has found that Harvard University violated federal civil rights law by failing to protect Jewish students from antisemitic harassment. The report accuses the university of being "deliberately indifferent" and at times a "willful participant" in discrimination since October 2023, potentially risking federal funding. Harvard strongly disagreed with the findings, stating it has taken significant steps to combat antisemitism and support its Jewish community.

Following a backbench rebellion, the government conceded that stricter eligibility criteria would only apply to new claimants after November 2026 and announced a review of the assessment process. Despite the U-turn, many MPs question the logic of changing criteria before the review is complete.

Struggling with a low batting average and no home runs through the first month, Muncy discovered he had astigmatism and began wearing glasses. The crucial change, however, came from a "lightbulb moment" during a May 9 at-bat, where he rediscovered a swing mechanic that allowed him to handle high fastballs effectively. Since that game, he has been on a tear, leading the league in RBIs and re-establishing himself as a vital part of the Dodgers' lineup.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar has recorded its most significant first-half decline in over half a century, falling more than 10% against a basket of major currencies since the start of 2025. This downturn, the worst since 1973, is attributed to investor concerns over the Trump administration's economic policies, including tariffs and a budget bill expected to increase national debt. Expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts have also contributed to the dollar's weakness. In contrast, other currencies like the euro have strengthened, and assets like gold have seen a significant price jump amid the geopolitical and economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has canceled its planned digital services tax (DST) just as it was set to take effect, a move designed to restart trade talks with the United States. The 3% tax would have affected large digital companies, many of which are American, and was labeled a "blatant attack" by President Trump, who had suspended negotiations in response. By shelving the tax, Canada has potentially averted retaliatory U.S. tariffs and brought the administration back to the negotiating table. The decision highlights the economic pressure the U.S. can exert and raises questions about whether other nations with similar taxes will follow suit.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles, Mayor Karen Bass, and the City Council, seeking to block the city's sanctuary law. The lawsuit alleges that the policy illegally hinders federal immigration enforcement and has contributed to "lawlessness" amid a recent surge in ICE operations in Southern California. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that such policies undermine law enforcement at all levels. The legal action comes as Los Angeles officials were considering their own lawsuit against the Trump administration to protect residents from what they describe as unconstitutional racial profiling and detentions.</p>

The remarks were condemned as antisemitic by festival organizers and politicians, and the BBC stated it should have cut the feed.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of Department of Homeland Security data shows a dramatic increase in the detention of immigrants with no criminal history since a White House push to expand enforcement in late May. From early May to early June, detentions of individuals facing only civil immigration charges rose by over 250%. While the Trump administration has stated its focus is on deporting criminals, the data indicates that only about 8% of all detainees since January 20 have violent crime convictions. This shift suggests a broader enforcement strategy targeting all unauthorized immigrants, leading to record numbers in ICE detention facilities.</p>

          <p>England's victory over India in the first Test was significantly aided by fast bowler Josh Tongue's effectiveness in dismissing India's lower-order batsmen, a skill often referred to as "mopping up the tail." India's last four wickets contributed very few runs in both innings, with Tongue taking three wickets each time using an aggressive and intimidating style. This ability to prevent the "tail from wagging" is seen as a crucial, though sometimes overlooked, aspect of Test cricket. It provides a psychological lift and prevents the opposition from gaining late-game momentum, a weakness England has previously struggled with.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that his administration is developing a "temporary pass" system to shield certain immigrant workers, particularly in the agriculture and hospitality sectors, from deportation. Acknowledging the potential negative impact of aggressive ICE operations on these industries, Trump stated he "cherishes" farmers and recognizes their reliance on long-term workers who may have entered the country improperly. This approach would allow farmers some control and let workers pay taxes, representing a nuanced stance alongside his broader hardline immigration policy. The president emphasized that the priority remains deporting criminals from the country.</p>

Researchers also point to other potential factors, such as the rising state pension age keeping more people in the "working-age" category for longer. This trend provides context for the government's current efforts to reform the benefits system amid political pressure.</p>

          <h2>White House Signals Intent to Pressure Other Countries to Drop Digital Taxes</h2>

          <p>Following Canada's decision to rescind its digital services tax (DST), a senior Trump administration official stated that the White House expects other countries to follow suit. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said that eliminating these taxes, which the U.S. views as unfair trade practices targeting American tech companies, will be a key part of future trade negotiations. The statement serves as a clear warning that countries maintaining or implementing DSTs could face retaliatory measures from the U.S. This development came as Canada and the U.S. resumed trade talks after the tax was scrapped.

          <h2>Clean Energy Stocks Decline as Trump-Backed Bill Proposes New Taxes and Ends Key Credits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 12:24:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stocks in the clean energy sector fell after the latest draft of a major Senate spending bill included provisions harmful to the industry. The proposed legislation introduces a tax on wind and solar projects that use Chinese components and accelerates the phase-out of crucial investment and production tax credits, ending them for projects starting after 2027. This change compresses development timelines and adds significant risk for renewable energy companies, prompting criticism from figures like Elon Musk. While the bill is viewed as negative for utility-scale projects, rooftop solar stocks saw a rise, as the bill appears to preserve their tax credits. (not investment advice)</p>
