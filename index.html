          <p>With a July 9 deadline looming, economic uncertainty is growing over the potential implementation of sweeping US tariffs on foreign imports. Economists warn that the new duties could fuel inflation and harm businesses, while the Trump administration continues to negotiate trade deals. Experts suggest several possible outcomes, including finalized agreements with some nations, further extensions for others negotiating in good faith, and the imposition of high tariffs on countries deemed non-compliant. The ongoing threat of tariffs creates significant uncertainty, which could hinder investment and economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in northern England have unearthed a collection of unusually large 2,000-year-old Roman shoes at the Magna Roman Fort near Hadrian's Wall. Several of the eight shoes found are equivalent to a modern US size 15, a size range that is exceptionally rare at other Roman sites. The discovery, made in a defensive ditch used for refuse, has prompted researchers to investigate which Roman regiments were stationed at Magna. They are exploring the diverse origins of soldiers within the vast Roman Empire to explain the presence of individuals with such large feet.</p>

          <p>Two brothers are on trial for allegedly assaulting three police officers during a brawl at Manchester airport last summer. The prosecution claims the incident, which was captured on CCTV, began after one of the brothers headbutted and punched another man at a Starbucks in the terminal. The court heard that the altercation with police occurred when officers attempted to arrest one of the brothers for the initial assault. The defendants, who deny the charges, claim they were acting in self-defense during the entire confrontation.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that celebrating American freedom on the Fourth of July feels contradictory amid a perceived backslide in democratic principles and civil rights protections. The authors, three legal professionals, contend that marginalized communities have always recognized the gap between America's ideals and its reality. They urge citizens to resist despair and instead engage in grassroots action within their own communities to defend and transform democracy. The article suggests that true change is built from the ground up, by empowering local communities and reimagining institutions to be more equitable.</p>

          <p>In Springfield, Ohio, community volunteers are urgently working to obtain US passports for thousands of American-born children of Haitian immigrants. This effort comes as the parents, who have Temporary Protected Status (TPS), face potential deportation following a Department of Homeland Security announcement to terminate the program. Without passports for their US-citizen children, families fear being separated or the children becoming stateless if they are forced to leave the country. The situation is compounded by the ongoing humanitarian and security crisis in Haiti, which advocates say makes deportation unsafe.</p>

          <p>The latest installment in the Jurassic franchise, 'Jurassic World Rebirth,' attempts to reset the series by returning to a remote island setting where dinosaurs now congregate. The film, directed by Gareth Edwards, is praised for its impressive sense of scale and visually clear action sequences. However, this review finds it to be a plodding and disenchanting experience, with a familiar plot and underdeveloped characters who seem bored by the prehistoric creatures around them. Despite capable performers, the movie lacks narrative stakes and fails to recapture the awe of the original films.</p>

          <p>This essay posits that the Continental Army, under George Washington's command, was instrumental in creating a unified American national identity where none previously existed. Before the Revolutionary War, the 13 colonies viewed each other as competitors with stronger ties to Britain than to one another. The shared hardships and experiences of soldiers from different states during the war blurred regional loyalties and fostered a new, collective spirit. This new identity was reinforced through traditions like celebrating Washington's birthday and institutions like the Society of the Cincinnati, founded by veterans.</p>

          <p>This essay reflects on Virginia Woolf's seminal work, "A Room of One's Own," from the perspective of a working-class Latina who initially felt excluded by mainstream feminism. The author describes overcoming her initial grievances to find profound relevance in Woolf's arguments about the necessity of financial independence and personal space for women's creativity. The piece connects Woolf's century-old observations on patriarchy and the dismissal of women's stories to contemporary issues like the gender pay gap and the undervaluing of female artists, while also acknowledging the limitations of Woolf's upper-class perspective.</p>

The futuristic city, which was to be located near Mbodiène and run on a new cryptocurrency called Akoin, has seen no significant construction since its announcement in 2018. Citing a lack of funding and stalled progress, the government has terminated the original plan. However, officials stated they are now working with Akon on a more realistic development project for the same site, which remains strategically valuable.</p>

          <p>A strike by French air traffic controllers has caused major travel disruptions across France, leading to the cancellation of approximately 40% of flights at Paris airports during the peak summer season. Unions are demanding better working conditions, citing staff shortages and the impact of inflation on salaries, while also protesting new work monitoring measures. The national civil aviation authority warned of significant delays and disruptions nationwide. The strike affects not only flights to and from France but also those passing through its airspace.</p>

          <p>The passage of President Trump's sweeping spending bill is expected to result in over $1 trillion in federal cuts to Medicaid, threatening healthcare for millions of Americans. Experts warn the cuts will disproportionately affect rural areas and could trigger "kill switch" laws in states like North Carolina, automatically ending their recently implemented Medicaid expansion programs. This could lead to the closure of rural hospitals and eliminate innovative programs that address social needs affecting health, ultimately increasing costs and leaving vulnerable populations without care.

          <p>A rare, handwritten letter from Thomas Jefferson discussing the right of citizens to bear arms against autocracy has been rediscovered and is being offered for sale. Penned in 1783, the letter to Virginia's governor observes revolutionary movements in Europe and notes the insistence of Dutch citizens to be armed, drawing a parallel to the American Revolution. Previously considered missing, the document provides a historical snapshot of Jefferson's views on democratic movements and the role of an armed citizenry in opposing tyranny, shortly after the conclusion of the war for independence.</p>

          <p>A first-of-its-kind US study has found that sewage sludge sites and wastewater treatment plants are major sources of PFAS "forever chemical" pollution in rivers. Researchers tested water upstream and downstream from 32 sites nationwide and found significantly higher PFAS levels downstream in 95% of cases. The findings raise serious questions about the common practice of spreading sludge, a byproduct of wastewater treatment, on cropland as fertilizer. Public health advocates argue this reintroduces toxic chemicals into the food supply and water systems.</p>

          <p>This essay examines the phenomenon of AI-generated music through the lens of The Velvet Sundown, a seemingly popular but likely artificial band on Spotify. The author argues that the band's innocuous, genre-blending sound is perfectly suited for the modern era of passive, vibe-based listening, where music serves as ambient background noise rather than an object of active engagement. This shift, driven by streaming playlists, has flattened musical subcultures and created a space where soulless, machine-made content can thrive. The piece concludes that such music is not for art, but for lulling listeners into an emotionless void.</p>

          <p>In the early 1990s, the Walt Disney Company planned to build a US history-themed amusement park in Virginia called "Disney's America." The ambitious project intended to tackle complex and painful aspects of the nation's past, with executives stating they wanted to make visitors "feel what it was like to be a slave." The proposal ignited a fierce culture war, drawing opposition from historians concerned about the "Disneyfication" of history and environmentalists worried about its proximity to a Civil War battlefield.
