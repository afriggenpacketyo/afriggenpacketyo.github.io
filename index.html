          <p>The Louvre Museum in Paris was forced to close after a brazen daytime robbery where thieves stole priceless jewelry from the Apollo Gallery. The suspects, who escaped on motorcycles, broke into a section of the museum under construction and reportedly took nine pieces from Napoleon and Empress Eugénie's collection. While no one was injured, French officials have described the stolen items as having "inestimable heritage and historical value," prompting a major investigation.

          <p>Comfort Colors, a half-century-old T-shirt brand owned by Gildan, is experiencing a significant surge in demand, driven largely by Gen Z consumers who value its vintage aesthetic and comfort. The brand's popularity has grown approximately 40% year-over-year, boosting sales in Gildan's activewear category and outperforming the S&P 500. Its success is attributed to its focus on bulk sales for custom printing, a strong presence on platforms like Etsy and TikTok, and an appeal to social groups from fraternities to music artists. This growth has prompted Gildan to plan an expansion into new product categories like hats and bags.</p>

          <p>Top Wall Street analysts are recommending three dividend-paying stocks—EOG Resources, Coterra Energy, and AT&T—as potentially stable investments given the uncertain macroeconomic climate and hints of future interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. The analysis points to factors like EOG's potential for free cash flow, Coterra's attractive valuation, and AT&T's strong operating performance as reasons for their positive outlooks. These selections are presented as a way for investors to secure a steady income stream during a period of potential market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During Medicare's open enrollment period, experts are advising beneficiaries to carefully evaluate their coverage options for the upcoming year, as plans and costs can change significantly. The ongoing federal government shutdown may cause delays in accessing information from official channels like the 1-800-Medicare hotline, prompting suggestions to wait before finalizing decisions. Beneficiaries should compare traditional Medicare and private Medicare Advantage plans, paying close attention to prescription drug coverage, provider networks, and out-of-pocket costs. Reviewing plans is crucial as some carriers are altering their offerings, which could impact both coverage and expenses.</p>

          <p>China's Minister of Transport, Liu Wei, has called for a global effort among shipping companies and port operators to defend free trade against what he termed US "unilateralism and protectionism." His remarks follow the Trump administration's decision to impose significant port fees on Chinese-built and operated vessels, a move that prompted Beijing to enact retaliatory fees on US ships. Liu asserted that China's response was necessary to protect its shipping industry's interests amid escalating trade tensions. The dispute highlights growing concerns about potential disruptions to international supply chains and the global economy.</p>

The investigation revealed that Shymanski's ex-wife, Heather Snyder, was a former high school classmate of Battiste's, and Snyder's new boyfriend, Brandon Holbrook, was the prime suspect. Holbrook was convicted of the murder, but Shymanski's family continues to question Snyder's potential involvement, an allegation she denies.

          <p>Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, once a staunch loyalist of Donald Trump, has recently surprised observers by breaking with the Republican party on several key issues, including healthcare subsidies, the war in Gaza, and the release of Jeffrey Epstein's files. While she has avoided direct criticism of Trump, her independent streak has won her unexpected praise from some Democrats and sparked speculation about her motives. Analysts suggest her actions reflect a populist appeal to her constituents' immediate concerns over party loyalty, carving out a unique lane within the MAGA movement. This shift challenges the narrative of a monolithic Republican party under Trump's control.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that Democratic-led states should consider 'fiscal disobedience' as a form of resistance against the Trump administration's punitive actions, such as slashing federal funds and deploying military forces to their cities. The proposed strategy involves creating state-administered escrow accounts to temporarily hold federal tax revenues, releasing them only when the federal government meets its constitutional obligations. This act of civil disobedience would aim to transform a one-sided assault into a constitutional struggle over federal power. The author suggests that a coordinated effort by several economically powerful states could create significant leverage and reassert their co-sovereignty.</p>

The industry is using a network of Republican-tied strategists and pollsters to frame Maha's efforts—such as banning soda purchases with SNAP benefits—as an attack on the choices of working-class Trump voters. This strategy involves obscure research groups, paid MAGA-aligned social media influencers, and conservative media outlets to create a narrative pitting 'Maga' against 'Maha'.

Advocates state that the administration's rhetoric feels threatening and is a distraction from the real challenges autistic people face.

His lawyers argue his re-detention is unconstitutional, as there is no likelihood of his removal, and are working to reinstate his green card after vacating a past criminal conviction.

The growing popularity of the sport, now played by nearly 20 million Americans, is correlated with a higher volume of injuries such as corneal abrasions and lacerations, particularly among adults over 50. Researchers and medical experts are calling for standardized guidelines for protective eyewear, which can prevent up to 90% of sports-related eye injuries. They emphasize that despite the use of a lightweight wiffle ball, the fast-paced nature of the game on a small court presents considerable risk.</p>

In an interview, he explains that memory helps us understand the present and anticipate the future, and that forgetting is as crucial as remembering. Emotionally significant events are prioritized, which is why trauma can be so persistent, while everyday details fade quickly. This selective process means our satisfaction with past experiences is often based on a 'highlight reel' rather than the full event, underscoring how the stories we tell ourselves define our identity and happiness.</p>

The author argues that recent trends, including approvals based on weak evidence like single studies or anecdotes, undermine the FDA's role as a gatekeeper for safety and efficacy. This flexibility can lead to patients using ineffective or harmful treatments, like a recently approved gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy that was later linked to deaths. Instead of lowering the bar for approval, the focus should be on increasing federal research support and improving access to investigational drugs through existing legal pathways.</p>

          <p>NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), a cornerstone of American space exploration, is facing a severe crisis following multiple rounds of layoffs that have eliminated over 10% of its workforce. The cuts are a direct result of congressional funding reductions for its flagship Mars Sample Return mission, which has been plagued by budget overruns and delays. The uncertainty has led to plummeting morale and distrust in leadership among remaining staff. As JPL grapples with its future, experts suggest the renowned lab may need to pivot towards defense projects and supporting human spaceflight to reclaim its vanguard position in innovation.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian drone has successfully struck a major gas processing plant in Russia's Orenburg region, approximately 1,700 kilometers from the Ukrainian border, causing a fire and partial damage. The facility, part of a complex operated by Gazprom, is one of the world's largest of its kind. This attack represents a significant escalation in Ukraine's strategy of targeting Russian energy infrastructure to disrupt fuel supplies and economic resources funding the war. The strike occurred as both nations continue to exchange drone attacks, with Russia also targeting energy facilities in eastern Ukraine.</p>

This move escalates a power struggle between Dutch authorities and the company's Chinese owner, Wingtech Technology, which acquired Nexperia in 2019.

          <p>A long-running investigation, aided by secret filming from a 2016 BBC documentary, has led to the conviction of 14 people involved in a £28 million timeshare fraud. The scheme, run by a company called Sell My Timeshare, targeted over 3,500 elderly victims who were desperate to exit their timeshare contracts. Instead of helping them, the company used high-pressure tactics to sell them useless fake "credits," funding a lavish lifestyle for its owners. The final sentences were handed down recently, bringing a measure of closure to a complex case that prosecutors described as one of the largest frauds of its kind in the UK.</p>

          <p>Fred Done, the co-founder of betting company Betfred, has warned that a significant increase in gambling taxes could force the closure of all 1,287 of its UK shops, putting 7,500 jobs at risk. The warning comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves considers raising taxes on the industry, a move supported by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown to fund child poverty reduction. Done stated that a tax rate of 35-40% would eliminate profitability, echoing similar concerns from other major betting companies like William Hill. He argued that such a hike would decimate a high street presence and push bettors to untaxed offshore operators.</p>

Analysts suggest these moves provide North Korea with diplomatic legitimacy and potential avenues to bypass international sanctions, as countries like Vietnam and Laos offer neutral ground and economic corridors in a challenging geopolitical environment for Pyongyang.</p>

          <p>Over the past four decades, China has made remarkable progress in pushing back the Mu Us Desert in the Ningxia region, safeguarding the capital city of Yinchuan. Through extensive sand control and afforestation efforts at the Baijitan National Nature Reserve, the desert's edge has been moved back by more than 20 kilometers. These measures have stabilized vast areas of drifting sands and protected the crucial Yellow River from sedimentation. This successful environmental campaign has effectively reversed the desert's expansion, which once threatened local agriculture and livelihoods, serving as a model for ecological restoration.</p>
