          <p>The escalating US-China trade war has prompted Chinese companies to reconsider their overseas expansion strategies.  Accessing the American market is no longer the top priority when building foreign factories, according to industry insiders. Mexico, a popular investment destination due to its proximity to the US and USMCA, has seen a significant decrease in inquiries from Chinese firms.  This shift reflects uncertainty surrounding preferential trade treatment for products made in Mexico amid increased trade tensions.</p>
