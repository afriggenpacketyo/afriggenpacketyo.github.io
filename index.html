          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has promised a response after a Houthi missile struck near Israel's Ben Gurion Airport, injuring four people and causing temporary flight suspensions. The missile, launched from Yemen by the Iran-backed group, prompted sirens across the country and is being investigated by the Israeli Air Force for failing to intercept it. Netanyahu is scheduled to meet with ministers to discuss a response, while Defense Minister Israel Katz vowed to hit back "seven times stronger." The Houthis claimed responsibility, warning airlines to avoid the airport, and Hamas praised the attack. Optimism score: 30</p>

          <p>Former Harvard President Lawrence Summers accuses President Trump of engaging in "extortion" by pressuring universities, particularly Harvard, through threats to research funding and tax-exempt status. Summers believes Trump's goal is to force universities to conform to his political agenda, particularly regarding diversity policies and the handling of anti-Semitism. While acknowledging that Harvard has issues with left-leaning bias and identity politics, Summers argues that Trump's tactics are not in good faith and threaten academic freedom.
