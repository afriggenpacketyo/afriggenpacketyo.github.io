          <p>Gold prices surged to an unprecedented $4,000 per ounce, driven by a weakening U.S. dollar, ongoing geopolitical instability, and persistent economic uncertainty. The precious metal serves as a safe haven for investors, with central banks and retail buyers increasing their holdings. This rise follows a Federal Reserve interest rate cut, making other debt instruments less appealing. While some analysts recommend gold as a portfolio hedge, others advise caution due to potential market correction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UFC star Conor McGregor has been handed an 18-month suspension for breaching the organization's anti-doping policy. The ban stems from three missed biological sample collections within a 12-month period in 2024, which are considered whereabouts failures. Combat Sports Anti-Doping (CSAD) backdated the sanction to September 2024, noting McGregor's cooperation and injury recovery as mitigating factors that reduced the standard 24-month penalty. CSAD emphasized the importance of accurate whereabouts filings for unannounced testing.</p>

However, he highlighted energy supply as a critical constraint, with customers like OpenAI facing power availability issues for their massive data center projects.

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's 2024 voter coalition reveals some slippage in support, particularly among Hispanic/Latino Americans and young people. Despite a series of controversial policies and frequent clashes, Trump's overall approval ratings have remained steady, albeit historically low. The decline in support among key demographics is largely attributed to negative perceptions of the economy, including inflation and affordability concerns. This article suggests that while the core MAGA base remains loyal, the broader coalition that secured his 2024 victory is showing signs of fragmentation due to economic dissatisfaction.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court deliberated on a Colorado counselor's challenge to the state's ban on "conversion therapy" for minors, questioning whether it regulates professional conduct or speech. Kaley Chiles, a Christian counselor, argues the law unconstitutionally censors conversations about gender dysphoria and sexual orientation. Colorado maintains the ban only prohibits unsafe and ineffective medical treatments, not speech, and aims to protect minors.

          <p>Tesla introduced more affordable versions of its Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan, with prices starting just under $40,000 and $37,000 respectively. The announcement led to a 4.45% dip in Tesla's stock, as investors had hoped for more significant price reductions or updates on other new products like the Roadster. The new Model Y standard variant lacks some premium features and offers a slightly reduced range. This article notes that these lower prices aim to attract buyers following the expiration of federal EV tax credits and amid increasing competition.</p>

          <p>The UK's most senior prosecutor, Stephen Parkinson, confirmed that a spy case against Christopher Cash and Christopher Berry, accused of spying for China, collapsed due to insufficient evidence. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) could not obtain government evidence explicitly stating China was a national security threat at the time of the alleged offenses. A previous Conservative government's assessment only labeled China an "epoch-defining challenge." This article highlights the legal complexities and political implications of prosecuting under the Official Secrets Act, especially concerning defining an "enemy."</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 715 into law, establishing a state Office for Civil Rights to address antisemitism and other forms of discrimination in schools. The legislation, spurred by concerns from Jewish groups regarding ethnic studies curricula and rising antisemitism, aims to monitor complaints, provide educational materials, and assist schools in compliance. While supported by a broad legislative majority, the bill faced opposition from teacher unions and Muslim organizations, who feared it might suppress discussions on Middle East events or equate criticism of Israel with antisemitism. This article notes the bill's intent to foster safe and respectful learning environments.</p>

          <p>A columnist critiques President Trump's portrayal of Portland as a "war zone," arguing that the described "battlefield" is a fabricated spectacle. The article describes peaceful protests against federal presence, where citizens are met with federally sanctioned tear gas and militarized optics. The author, a former CNN journalist, suggests Trump employs a "Society of the Spectacle" strategy, using choreographed menace to present himself as a savior against a contrived chaos. This piece warns that such actions, reminiscent of authoritarian tactics, erode democratic principles by turning governance into a political performance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that inhalers, essential for treating asthma and COPD, contribute substantially to greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating both climate change and the very conditions they aim to relieve. A study published in JAMA found that U.S. inhalers generated an estimated 24.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions over a decade, comparable to over 500,000 gas-powered cars annually. Metered-dose inhalers, which use potent hydrofluoroalkane propellants, account for 98% of these emissions. This article highlights the urgent need for lower-emission alternatives to protect patient and planetary health.</p>

She also deflected inquiries about an alleged bribery scheme involving a border advisor and her handling of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.

          <p>Illegal crossings at the US-Mexico border have plummeted to their lowest levels in over half a century, according to federal data obtained by CBS News. In the fiscal year 2025, U.S. Border Patrol agents recorded 238,000 migrant apprehensions, with fewer than 9,000 monthly crossings during President Trump's first eight months in office. This marks the lowest figure since 1970. White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson attributed the progress to Trump's immigration executive orders, including troop deployment, ending asylum requests, and expanding ICE's arrest powers.

          <p>Many Los Angeles residents will experience a dramatic increase in trash collection fees after the City Council approved a plan to address a heavily subsidized program. The city's sanitation services were losing approximately $500,000 daily, contributing to a nearly $1-billion budget deficit. Single-family homes and smaller apartments will see their monthly fees more than double, or increase by about 50%, with further increments planned over the next four years. This article notes the fee hike aims to cover actual operational costs, aligning with other nearby cities, but will impact residents already facing rising living expenses.</p>
