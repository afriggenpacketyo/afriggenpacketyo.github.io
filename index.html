          <p>A 46-year-old man was successfully rescued after being trapped behind a waterfall in California for two days. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down the Seven Teacups waterfalls when strong water hydraulics forced him off his lines and stranded him. After being reported missing, an extensive search involving aircraft and a drone located him alive and responsive. A California Highway Patrol helicopter was used to hoist him to safety, where he was treated for dehydration and minor injuries before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin has rapidly strengthened into a Category 5 storm over the Atlantic Ocean, becoming the first hurricane of the 2025 season. The National Hurricane Center reported that Erin's maximum sustained winds reached near 160 mph, with its outer bands affecting the northern Leeward Islands. While tropical storm watches have been issued for several islands due to potential heavy rain and flash flooding, the hurricane's core is forecast to remain at sea. Current models show the storm curving northward, passing well offshore of Puerto Rico and the U.S. East Coast.</p>

          <p>Guatemalan authorities successfully secured the release of nine prison guards who were held hostage for three days by inmates from the Mara Salvatrucha gang. The crisis began earlier in the week when members of the country's two largest gangs, Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha, rioted in two separate prisons. The inmates were demanding the return of ten gang leaders who had been transferred to a different facility and placed in solitary confinement. The situation remains tense, highlighting the significant power and influence these gangs wield within Guatemala's prison system.</p>

          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding internationally, moving beyond Westernized dishes to offer authentic, regional cuisine from areas like Hunan and Zhejiang. Using Singapore as a launchpad, brands such as Luckin and Nong Geng Ji are testing diverse palates before expanding to other parts of Asia, North America, and beyond. This culinary movement challenges outdated stereotypes about Chinese food and aims to showcase its sophistication and diversity. Some observers suggest this gastronomic expansion could serve as a form of soft power, potentially improving China's global image through cultural exchange.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed that National Guard members deployed in Washington, D.C., may be armed as part of their mission, a shift from previous guidance. An official stated that while the Guard will not be making arrests, they may carry weapons to protect federal assets and provide a secure environment for law enforcement. The deployment was initiated by President Trump, who declared a public safety emergency and placed the city's police under federal control to address crime. This move has drawn protests from some D.C. residents concerned about the increased law enforcement presence.</p>

          <p>Samsung's share of the U.S. smartphone market surged from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, narrowing the gap with Apple, whose share declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly attributed to the growing momentum of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors compared to the standard smartphone design. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's wider range of price points and experimentation with new technology are creating renewed competition. Analysts suggest Apple may release its own foldable iPhone by 2026 to counter this trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that despite its past successes, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 is under threat from legislative proposals aimed at weakening its regulations. The author contends that loosening protections to favor energy development and fishing operations is misguided, as many marine mammal populations are facing new dangers. Climate change, warming oceans, ship strikes, and pollution are contributing to declining populations of species like the North Atlantic right whale and West Coast gray whales. The article asserts that maintaining strong protections is crucial not only for the animals but also for the overall health of ocean ecosystems.</p>

In response to widespread flight cancellations affecting 130,000 daily customers, the Canadian government quickly invoked its authority to force both parties into binding arbitration, a move the union has condemned.

          <p>Following his summit with Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump reportedly told European leaders he would support a peace deal requiring Ukraine to cede the unoccupied parts of its Donbas region to Russia. According to sources, Putin demanded the withdrawal from all of Donetsk as a condition for freezing the front lines in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. This position marks a significant break with Ukraine and its European allies, who oppose changing international borders by force. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to meet with Trump in Washington on Monday amid fears he will be pressured to accept the terms.</p>

          <p>Norfolk Police arrested 13 individuals in Norwich for displaying support for Palestine Action, a group recently proscribed as a terrorist organization by the UK government. The arrests occurred during a protest outside City Hall, where individuals were holding placards in support of the group, an act now illegal under the Terrorism Act 2000. The proscription and subsequent arrests have been described as concerning by Amnesty International, while the group's co-founder is legally challenging the ban, arguing it infringes on the right to free speech and legitimate protest. This follows hundreds of similar arrests across the UK.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian political analysts have largely characterized the Alaska summit between Presidents Trump and Putin as a failure for Ukraine and a strategic success for Russia. Experts noted the absence of concrete results for Kyiv and viewed the event as an "information operation" that helped legitimize Putin on the world stage without achieving any progress toward peace. Many in Ukraine fear that President Zelenskyy's upcoming visit to Washington will result in increased U.S. pressure to accept unfavorable terms. The symbolic gestures of the summit, such as the red carpet for Putin, were met with anger and frustration on Ukrainian social media.</p>

          <p>A Denver man was scammed out of $17,000 after his call to United Airlines' official customer service number was mysteriously transferred to a fraudster. While attempting to rebook a canceled flight, the man, Dan Smoker, spoke with an agent who processed a new ticket but also made a fraudulent charge under a different name. Call logs confirmed he dialed the correct number, but United's internal records showed a much shorter call duration, and the airline could not explain how the call was rerouted. The incident highlights a sophisticated evolution of airline scams, where even cautious consumers can be victimized through official channels.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Erin's rapid intensification from a tropical storm to a powerful Category 5 hurricane is attributed to a combination of ideal environmental factors. The storm passed over exceptionally warm ocean waters, with sea surface temperatures exceeding 85 degrees Fahrenheit, which fuels storm development. Additionally, Erin possessed low wind shear and a compact core, creating perfect conditions for its wind speeds to increase by more than 58 mph in just 24 hours. This phenomenon, known as rapid intensification, is becoming more common due to climate change and warming oceans, making storms more powerful and harder to forecast.</p>

          <p>Topshop is planning a major comeback with the relaunch of standalone physical stores, years after its previous owner, Arcadia, collapsed and all locations were closed. The brand, now owned by online retailer Asos, recently held its first catwalk show in seven years, signaling a renewed focus on its influential role in fashion. Industry experts note that while nostalgia for the brand is high among millennials, Topshop will face challenges in attracting younger Gen-Z shoppers and competing with fast-fashion giants. The new strategy will focus on quality products and re-establishing the brand's unique "London girl" aesthetic.</p>

          <p>John Cruickshank, the last surviving British recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War Two, has died at the age of 105. The former Royal Air Force flight lieutenant from Aberdeen, Scotland, earned the UK's highest military honor for his bravery during an attack on a German U-boat in 1944. Despite suffering 72 separate injuries from enemy fire, he successfully piloted his Catalina flying boat to destroy the submarine, saving his crew and protecting British vessels. After the war, he left the RAF for a career in banking and rarely spoke of his wartime experiences, viewing his actions simply as his duty.</p>

          <p>During the Alaska summit, President Donald Trump reportedly hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The letter is said to have raised concerns about the thousands of Ukrainian children who have been abducted and transferred to Russia since the 2022 invasion. This act has been classified as a war crime by the International Criminal Court, which has an outstanding arrest warrant for Putin. Ukrainian officials expressed gratitude for the first lady's attention to the issue, which they consider a form of state-sponsored child trafficking and genocide.</p>
