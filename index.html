        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors in Virginia have concluded a two-month investigation into former FBI Director James Comey, finding insufficient evidence to press charges for allegedly lying to Congress. Despite a detailed memo stating that probable cause does not exist, the newly appointed U.S. attorney, Lindsey Halligan, reportedly intends to seek an indictment from a grand jury. This move follows President Trump's public calls to prosecute political adversaries and comes as the five-year statute of limitations is about to expire. Career prosecutors have advised against this course of action, citing potential ethical issues and a likely rejection by the grand jury.</p>

          <p>An unusually high number of "pink meanie" jellyfish are being sighted along the Texas coast, a phenomenon marine scientists say is unprecedented in their records. This species, which can weigh up to 50 pounds with tentacles stretching 70 feet, was only officially identified in 2011. Experts believe their increased presence is directly linked to a current population boom of moon jellyfish, which are the pink meanie's primary food source. Officials are cautioning beachgoers that while the jellyfish's sting is not life-threatening, it is painful and can leave red marks for several days.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump recently questioned the standard medical practice of vaccinating newborns against hepatitis B, suggesting parents should wait until a child is 12 years old. However, pediatricians and infectious disease specialists have strongly refuted this advice, labeling it as irresponsible and dangerous. They emphasize that infants are at the highest risk for developing chronic, life-threatening liver disease if infected, and the virus can be transmitted in non-sexual ways, such as through contact with contaminated surfaces or caregivers. Since the universal newborn vaccination program began in 1991, infection rates among young people in the U.S. have plummeted by 99 percent.</p>

          <p>Billy Vigar, a 21-year-old striker for Chichester City FC and a former Arsenal academy player, has died after suffering a significant brain injury during a match. The injury is believed to have occurred when he collided with a concrete wall during a game against Wingate and Finchley. Vigar was placed in an induced coma and underwent an operation, but the injury proved too severe. His family released a statement expressing their devastation that he passed away while playing the sport he loved, and the FA offered its heartfelt condolences.</p>

          <h2>White House Budget Office Instructs Federal Agencies to Prepare for Mass Firings Amid Shutdown Threat</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has issued a memo directing federal agencies to prepare for potential mass firings if a government shutdown occurs. The directive warns that agencies without alternative funding whose priorities are not aligned with the President's should consider issuing reduction-in-force notices. This move escalates the political pressure on Congress to fund the government before the October 1 deadline.

          <p>As part of a major turnaround effort, Starbucks has announced plans to close hundreds of underperforming stores and lay off close to 1,000 non-retail employees. CEO Brian Niccol stated the cost-cutting measures are necessary to build a more resilient company, with the restructuring expected to cost $1 billion. The closures will target locations that are not financially viable or do not fit the company's desired physical environment. This is the second round of corporate layoffs this year as the coffee giant struggles with slowing business and aims to reinvest in a better customer experience.</p>

          <p>With credit card debt at high levels for many Americans, financial experts are highlighting various debt relief options for those struggling with payments. The article notes that while the Federal Reserve recently lowered its benchmark rate, credit card APRs have remained stubbornly high, making it unwise to wait for rates to drop. Because interest compounds daily, carrying a balance can quickly become unmanageable. Strategies such as debt consolidation, balance transfers, or formal debt management plans are presented as proactive ways for borrowers to reduce costs and regain control of their finances.

          <p>A new report from The Wall Street Journal reveals significant disorganization and tension within the Trump administration regarding the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. The situation reportedly escalated into a crisis following a poorly managed PR event and continued with high-stakes meetings in the Situation Room. According to the report, President Trump was worried that friends might be mentioned in the files and that documents could have been doctored to harm him. The administration's chaotic approach culminated in a memo from the Justice Department and FBI that effectively closed the case, a move that one official described as a 'bomb going off' inside the White House.</p>

          <p>Andy Burnham, the Mayor of Greater Manchester, is encountering resistance from Labour MPs after criticizing the current Labour government and suggesting he has been urged to challenge Prime Minister Keir Starmer. In a series of interviews, Burnham outlined alternative economic policies, prompting Starmer to compare his proposals to those of former Conservative PM Liz Truss. A BBC survey of Labour MPs revealed little appetite for a leadership change, with many viewing Burnham's actions as self-indulgent and unhelpful. While some backbenchers are supportive, most believe a challenge would be damaging to the party's stability.</p>

          <p>An independent review of Los Angeles County's response to the deadly January wildfires has found that significant delays in warning residents were caused by a lack of resources and outdated emergency alert policies. The report, commissioned after the Eaton and Palisades fires killed over 30 people, identified critical staffing shortages, unreliable cellular connectivity for first responders, and inconsistent communication methods as major weaknesses. These failures hampered the effectiveness of the response and, in some cases, residents did not receive evacuation alerts until after their homes were already on fire.

He argued that CEO Brian Niccol is strategically closing underperforming locations to reallocate resources to more successful ones, a key part of any turnaround plan aimed at improving same-store sales. The $1 billion restructuring is intended to address declining sales and restore operating margins, which have remained below pre-pandemic levels. Cramer reiterated his confidence in Niccol's ability to guide the coffee giant back to growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A homeless man, Charles Dupriest, has pleaded not guilty to charges of child neglect and being a felon in possession of a firearm after his six children were discovered living in a Milwaukee storage unit. A court commissioner found probable cause to proceed to trial. Police found the children, ranging in age from two months to nine years, after someone reported hearing a baby crying from inside the locked unit. The space had no electricity or running water, and a bucket was being used as a toilet, while the parents were found sleeping in a vehicle in the parking lot.</p>

          <p>Business owners on Shirley High Street in Southampton are reporting a prolonged campaign of antisocial behavior by a group of teenage girls, including theft, vandalism, and threats. Shopkeepers feel helpless, stating that the police seem unable or unwilling to take effective action, leaving the teenagers with a sense of invincibility. The article explores the challenges this behavior poses for law enforcement and the community, as current civil injunction powers do not apply to those under 18. The persistent harassment has left local business owners worn down and, in some cases, fearful for their safety.</p>

In an interview with Axios, he stated that Ukraine now possesses combat drones capable of traveling up to 3,000 kilometers, a range sufficient to reach deep into Russian territory. This statement follows the lifting of range restrictions on weapons supplied by Western allies.

          <p>With the annual cost of nursing home care exceeding $120,000 and expected to rise, planning for long-term care has become a critical issue for retirees. Many mistakenly believe Medicare will cover these expenses, but it only pays for short-term skilled care after a hospital stay, not the custodial care most seniors need for daily living. This article explains that long-term care insurance can bridge this gap, protecting retirement savings from being depleted. Securing a policy while still healthy is crucial, as premiums increase significantly with age and a decline in health can lead to being denied coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce plans for a compulsory, UK-wide digital ID scheme, which the government believes will help combat illegal working and modernize the state. The proposal will be subject to a consultation to address its practical implementation, including how it will function for individuals without smartphones or passports. The idea marks a significant shift, as a previous Labour government's attempt to introduce ID cards was blocked by a Conservative-led coalition. The announcement has already drawn criticism from opposition parties, who have raised concerns about civil liberties and government overreach.</p>

          <p>Denmark is grappling with how to respond after a series of coordinated drone sightings over airports and military bases exposed vulnerabilities in its national security.

The Danish Defence Minister described the events as a systematic "hybrid attack" by a "professional actor," though no blame has been officially assigned.

These probes, conducted under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, will determine if reliance on these imports threatens U.S. national security. A positive finding could pave the way for new tariffs on these goods, a move intended to bolster domestic production but which could also increase costs for hospitals, manufacturers, and consumers.

Verified images from the scene showed deceased prisoners, with at least two having been decapitated. Ecuador's overcrowded and poorly controlled prisons have become centers of operation for powerful drug trafficking gangs with ties to international cartels, leading to frequent and brutal outbreaks of violence.</p>

          <p>Nicolas Sarkozy is set to become the first former French president to serve prison time after being sentenced to a five-year term for criminal conspiracy in the "Libyan money" trial. The court convicted him on the charge of "criminal association" related to allegations of seeking campaign funds from Libya, though he was cleared of several other charges. The sentence is not suspensive, meaning he is expected to go to jail even while appealing the verdict. The decision has reignited fierce political divisions in France, with Sarkozy's supporters claiming judicial persecution and opponents seeing it as accountability for a powerful figure.</p>
