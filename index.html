          <p>The White House has suspended the 'de minimis' exemption, which allowed imported packages valued at $800 or less to enter the U.S. without tariffs. This policy change, effective August 29, aims to close a loophole allegedly exploited by shippers to evade duties and smuggle illicit goods like synthetic opioids. The move follows a similar restriction placed on imports from China and Hong Kong, which significantly impacted ultra-low-cost online retailers such as Shein and Temu. The number of these low-value shipments has surged dramatically, from 134 million in 2015 to nearly 1.4 billion projected for 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a deadly mass shooting in Manhattan, Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani held a press conference where he faced questions about his past anti-police rhetoric. He addressed his 2020 calls to defund the police, attributing them to the widespread frustration following the murder of George Floyd, and reiterated his current focus on a comprehensive public safety approach. Mamdani, who has since walked back his defund stance, criticized political rivals like former Governor Andrew Cuomo for focusing on his past statements rather than on solutions to ensure New Yorkers' safety, while pledging to address police staffing shortages if elected.</p>

The error, traced to a packaging supplier, poses a health risk as consumers could unknowingly ingest alcohol. The recall affects products shipped in late July to several states, including Florida, New York, and Ohio. While no illnesses have been reported, the company is urging customers to dispose of any affected Celsius-branded cans and is offering refunds.</p>

          <p>An NTSB hearing revealed that the Army helicopter in the fatal mid-air collision over Washington D.C. had faulty altimeters, causing it to fly 80 to 130 feet higher than intended. The crash, which occurred on January 29, resulted in the deaths of all 64 people on an American Airlines flight and three crew members on the helicopter. While the investigation's final cause is pending, this finding points to a critical equipment failure. The hearing also highlighted concerns about the insufficient vertical separation standards between helicopter and airplane routes near Reagan National Airport.</p>

As part of the scam, Li and her co-conspirator also charged foreign nationals $93,000 each for access to a 2017 fundraiser, where they took photos with then-President Trump. These photos were then used to further solicit investments, while the funds were illegally funneled to a political committee.</p>

          <p>A detailed analysis explains the severe intensification of Gaza's hunger crisis, which humanitarian groups now describe as a famine scenario affecting the entire population. The situation worsened dramatically after a ceasefire ended in March, leading Israel to cut off all aid for two months. Although some aid has resumed, distribution is chaotic and insufficient, hampered by competing UN and a new US/Israeli-backed system, creating dangerous conditions for desperate civilians. The article notes that while Israel denies a policy of starvation, international pressure is mounting as evidence of malnutrition and hunger-related deaths becomes undeniable.</p>

          <p>There is renewed hope for solving the infamous 1991 murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop, thanks to advances in DNA technology. The case, which saw two men convicted and later released after their confessions were questioned, has been cold for years. A key piece of evidence is an unidentified male DNA profile found on one of the victims. Although a potential database match in 2017 proved to be a false lead after further testing, investigators believe that as DNA science improves, the small remaining sample could finally identify the person responsible for the brutal crime.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Plan to End 'Blue Slip' Tradition for Federal Prosecutor Appointments Explained</h2>

          <p>President Trump is calling for an end to the Senate's 'blue slip' tradition, which allows home-state senators to effectively veto presidential nominees for federal district judge and U.S. attorney positions within their state. The move is prompted by Democratic senators from New Jersey blocking the permanent appointment of his former lawyer, Alina Habba, as U.S. Attorney. During her temporary appointment, Habba pursued controversial investigations into prominent Democrats. Eliminating the blue slip could allow Trump to install loyalist prosecutors and judges in blue states, raising concerns about politically motivated prosecutions.</p>

          <h2>Aid Groups Criticize Gaza Airdrops as Ineffective and 'Futile'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As UN-backed experts warn that a famine is unfolding in Gaza, international aid organizations are strongly criticizing the use of airdrops to deliver assistance. Groups like Doctors Without Borders and the Center for Humanitarian Action have labeled the airdrops by Jordan, the UAE, and others as "futile," "cynical," and "notoriously ineffective." They argue that airdrops are expensive, dangerous, and fail to reach the most vulnerable populations. Instead, they are calling on Israel to open land crossings for unhindered access, stating that hundreds of aid trucks are needed daily to address the catastrophic humanitarian crisis.</p>

          <p>President Faustin-Archange Touadera of the Central African Republic has been nominated by his party to run for a third term, a move made possible by a controversial 2023 constitutional referendum. The referendum, which the opposition boycotted and alleges was fraudulent, abolished the two-term limit and extended the presidential mandate from five to seven years. Opposition parties and civil society groups fear the changes could allow Touadera to remain in power for life and are demanding a national dialogue before the 2025 elections, citing concerns about the integrity of the electoral process.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The city council of Leinfelden-Echterdingen, a town near Stuttgart, Germany, has ordered the demolition of a nearly finished mosque. The decision was based on a contract violation by the Cologne-based Islamic association (VIKZ) that built it. The original 2014 building permit stipulated that construction had to be completed within four years, a deadline the association failed to meet. After a legal battle that went to Germany's highest court, the town revoked the permit. While the council has offered to help find an alternative site, VIKZ has stated it will not comply with the demolition order.</p>

          <p>Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has reported that seven more people, including children, have died from malnutrition, bringing the total of such deaths to 154 since the conflict began. This comes as UN-backed experts warn that a famine is actively unfolding in the territory, where a dire shortage of food, medicine, and fuel persists. Despite Israel's claims that it does not restrict aid, the UN and other agencies report that deliveries are woefully insufficient, with most aid trucks being looted by desperate crowds before reaching their destinations. At least 600 trucks are needed daily to mitigate the crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite significant costs from tariffs on imported steel, aluminum, and foreign-made vehicles, major automakers have largely avoided passing these expenses on to consumers. Data shows new-vehicle prices have risen less than the historical average, as carmakers absorbed billions in tariff-related costs to maintain sales and market share. However, this strategy is not sustainable under investor pressure. Industry analysts predict that prices will eventually rise, likely with the arrival of 2026 models, through higher sticker prices or less favorable financing deals and cash-back offers.

          <p>Recent immigration enforcement raids in California are already having a measurable negative impact on the state's economy, according to researchers. An analysis of census data showed a significant 3.1% drop in people reporting to work in the private sector when the raids began, a decline comparable to the COVID-19 lockdown period. Economists warn that the disruption to the undocumented workforce, which constitutes 8% of the state's labor and generates nearly 5% of its GDP, could hobble key industries like agriculture and construction, leading to project delays and potential food price increases nationwide.</p>

Commander Zena Cardman was originally slated for a previous mission but was bumped to accommodate the return of Starliner's first crew. She will be joined by NASA veteran Michael Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui, and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. The mission will utilize the Crew Dragon Endeavour, which is making a record sixth flight, as SpaceX and NASA work to certify the capsules for up to 15 missions.</p>
