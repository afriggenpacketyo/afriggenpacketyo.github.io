          <p>Matthew Ecker has been sentenced to 30 years in prison for the 2022 murder of his ex-girlfriend, 32-year-old nurse Alex Pennig. Ecker initially claimed Pennig had taken her own life in her bathroom, but investigators found critical inconsistencies in his story. A key piece of evidence was a small metal part of the door lock found under Pennig's body, suggesting the door was forced open before she was shot. The case highlights the complex investigation that led to Ecker's conviction despite his claims of innocence.</p>

          <p>Baseball Hall of Famer Mariano Rivera sustained a torn achilles tendon during the New York Yankees’ Old-Timers’ Day game on Saturday. The 55-year-old former closer was injured while moving to field a fly ball in shallow center field and will require surgery. Rivera, who was unanimously inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2019, famously recovered from a torn ACL in 2012 to play a final season. The injury cast a shadow over the celebratory event, which was held for the first time since 2019.</p>

          <p>In the Los Angeles Rams' 31-21 preseason victory over the Dallas Cowboys, several key players made a strong impression. Rookie running back Blake Corum demonstrated his readiness for a larger role, rushing for 32 yards and two touchdowns, suggesting he could help lighten the workload for starter Kyren Williams. Quarterback Stetson Bennett also had a solid performance, completing 16 of 24 passes for 188 yards and two touchdowns, reinforcing his confident showing during training camp. The game provided valuable insights into the team's depth heading into the regular season.</p>

          <p>The 'quiet luxury' trend of understated, logo-free high fashion is giving way to a resurgence of 'loud luxury,' characterized by bold branding and distinctive designs. Major fashion houses like Gucci, Burberry, and Versace are shifting their creative direction to inject novelty and reignite consumer interest amid slowing sales. This sartorial shake-up aims to attract weary shoppers and reverse the fortunes of brands that struggled while more discrete, ultra-luxe labels thrived. Analysts see this as a potential turning point for the industry, moving away from subtlety to more visible and statement-making styles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Kentucky bourbon industry, which experienced a renaissance after the 2008 recession, is now facing a significant slowdown. A combination of factors, including post-pandemic inflation, changing drinking habits among younger generations, and the threat of international trade tariffs, has contributed to declining sales. This economic pressure has led to bankruptcies and closures for some distilleries, such as LMD Holdings and a Jack Daniel's barrel-making plant.

          <p>Six months ago, the release of Chinese AI app DeepSeek-R1 sent a shockwave through Silicon Valley, challenging the assumption that bigger and more expensive models were superior. DeepSeek claimed its chatbot rivaled ChatGPT's performance at a fraction of the development cost, briefly tanking tech stocks like Nvidia. While no longer a headline topic, DeepSeek's emergence marked a 'Sputnik moment' for AI, proving that smarter engineering could compete with massive computational power. The event has shifted industry perspectives and intensified the US-China AI rivalry, even as security concerns about the app's Chinese origins persist.</p>

The attack has been condemned by some former CDC employees as a tragic result of the villainization of public health workers and the spread of vaccine misinformation by prominent figures, creating a climate of hostility and mistrust.</p>

This news assuaged investor fears that tariffs could significantly harm Apple's profitability. The positive momentum was also supported by a strong quarterly earnings report from the company two weeks prior. (not investment advice)</p>
