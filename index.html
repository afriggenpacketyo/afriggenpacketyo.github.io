        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The release of audio recordings from former President Joe Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur has amplified concerns about his cognitive state and the validity of pardons issued via autopen. Critics, including House Oversight Committee Chair Rep. James Comer, are calling for investigations into the use of autopens for blanket pardons, including those potentially involving his son Hunter Biden and other controversial figures. The recordings reportedly reveal Biden's struggles with memory and speech, fueling claims that he lacked the mental capacity to authorize such actions. Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch has long questioned the legality of these pardons, arguing they lack specific charges and offer broad protections, and believes Biden should be prosecuted for mishandling documents. </p>

          <p>Todd S. Purdum of the New York Times reflects on Desi Arnaz's pivotal role in breaking racial barriers in early television and his broader impact on Hollywood. Facing initial resistance from CBS executives who doubted the appeal of a Latino actor as Lucille Ball's husband, Arnaz orchestrated a vaudeville tour to showcase their chemistry, ultimately paving the way for "I Love Lucy." Arnaz's success not only challenged racial stereotypes but also revolutionized television production by filming the show, enabling reruns and syndication. The article emphasizes the importance of diversity and inclusion, drawing parallels to contemporary challenges in the entertainment industry. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a news analysis, the New York Times examines President Trump's evolving Middle East diplomacy, which appears to be sidelining Israel in favor of engaging directly with countries like Saudi Arabia and Syria. Trump's recent actions, such as lifting sanctions on Syria and pursuing deals with Iran and Yemen, have been undertaken without consulting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While the U.S. maintains its support for Israel, Trump's focus on Gulf states for economic and strategic partnerships signals a shift in priorities. This change has raised concerns in Israel, with some analysts suggesting Trump has lost interest in resolving the Gaza conflict due to perceived stalemate.</p>

          <p>Tressie McMillan Cottom of The New York Times explores the complex racial dynamics within country music, noting the genre's recent surge in popularity and the simultaneous rise of Black, Hispanic, Indigenous, and queer artists. Cottom argues that country music faces an identity crisis, divided between Nashville's mainstream, white-dominated sound and the growing diversification of the genre. The article examines how the industry often anoints white artists as the "saviors" of country music, while marginalizing non-white artists who challenge the genre's racial codes. Cottom concludes that the battle for control of country music is intensely political, reflecting broader cultural power struggles.</p>

Many borrowers, including teachers and retirees, express concern about the financial strain this will cause.

          <p>A British mountain guide, Kenton Cool, has achieved a record-breaking 19th ascent of Mount Everest, surpassing his own previous record for the most ascents by a non-Sherpa guide. Cool reached the 29,032-foot peak on Sunday along with other climbers. He has climbed Everest almost every year since 2004, with exceptions in 2014, 2015, and 2020 due to various circumstances. Only Nepali Sherpa guides have scaled the peak more times than Cool, with Kami Rita holding the record at 30 ascents.</p>

The sketch, revolving around two couples vying for a table, initially presents a stereotypical macho dynamic, but subverts this expectation as the men reveal their insecurities in Spanish. The article emphasizes how the non-Spanish-speaking characters misinterpret the situation, underscoring the gap between perceived and actual realities. The article also notes that the terse subtitles elided the subtleties of Hernández and Bad Bunny’s banter in Caribbean-inflected Spanish.</p>

          <p>The Guardian reports that US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged that Walmart may increase prices for consumers due to President Trump's tariffs. Bessent stated he received assurances from Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon, that the company would absorb some of the tariffs. This follows Trump's demand that Walmart "eat the tariffs" rather than raise prices. McMillon had previously indicated that the company could not fully absorb the tariff costs, leading to higher prices for consumers. The president’s strategy, which he insisted would lead to negotiations and trade deals with at least 150 countries, was variously ridiculed and condemned as flawed and unworkable.</p>
