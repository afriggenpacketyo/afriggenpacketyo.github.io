          <p>Shares of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD experienced a significant drop of over 8% following the company's announcement of price reductions on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models through June.

          <p>Octopus Energy has apologized to a Hartlebury man, Peter Holden, for pursuing him for nearly four years over someone else's £6,000 gas bill. Despite Holden repeatedly informing the company of the error, he continued to receive monthly bills and was contacted by debt collectors. The issue stemmed from an error in industry data, where Holden's meter shared the same serial number as another unconnected account. Octopus Energy's commercial director has personally apologized to Holden and promised further staff training to prevent similar mistakes in the future, ensuring his credit score was not affected.</p>

          <p>Venezuela's electoral council, loyal to Nicolás Maduro, has claimed an overwhelming victory in regional and legislative elections, despite boycotts by the opposition. The results, presented without evidence, strip the opposition of key positions, including the governor's seat of Zulia. The electoral council claimed turnout was over 40%, despite near-empty polling places and the absence of independent observers. The article states that the announcement comes less than a year after a presidential election in which Maduro also claimed victory, despite a vote count that showed that he had lost decisively.</p>

          <p>Despite a marked change in tone from leaders in the UK and EU regarding Israel's actions in Gaza, there is a disconnect between condemnation and what happens on the ground. International organizations and courts of justice have been rendered powerless by their inability to translate their findings into action. The shift in language feels like a breakthrough only in comparison to what came before, but the Israeli government draws strength from the condemnation, viewing it as proof that the country is on its own. The article asserts that it will take far more than reviewing and suspending future trade talks between Israel and the UK to deter Israel from its plans.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study has discovered that sleep serves as the brain's nightly clean-up crew, flushing out harmful oxygen-derived free radicals that accumulate during wakefulness. The research, published in Cell Metabolism, explains how hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), a reactive by-product of metabolism, acts as a molecular signal to trigger sleep and restore balance in the brain. Excess build-up of these free radicals disrupts sleep quality and sparks inflammation, offering critical insights into age-related insomnia and degenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease. The article states that this research opens pathways for therapies targeting oxidative stress to combat sleep disorders.</p>
