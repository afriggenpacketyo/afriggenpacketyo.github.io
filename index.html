          <p>Polling data indicates historically low favorability for the Democratic Party, with significant discontent among Democrats, independents, and Republicans. The dissatisfaction stems from various factors, including a perception of weakness and ineffectiveness in opposing the Trump administration, particularly among the party's liberal base. Further divisions exist over the party's ideological direction and the deep unpopularity of its national leaders, even as individual Democratic representatives maintain higher approval ratings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate approaches a one-year low, experts suggest several ways for potential homebuyers to obtain better loan terms. Key strategies include improving one's credit score by paying bills on time and maintaining low credit utilization, which can significantly lower interest payments over the life of a loan. Additionally, providing a larger down payment and considering alternatives to a traditional 30-year fixed mortgage, such as an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), can also help secure a more favorable rate from lenders.

For individuals with conditions like high cholesterol, limiting saturated fats is crucial, though foods like eggs are now considered healthy in moderation for most people.</p>

          <p>The transfer of soccer star Alyssa Thompson from Angel City FC to Chelsea, a potentially record-breaking deal in women's soccer, was managed awkwardly by the NWSL club. The team's coach refused to mention Thompson by name in press conferences, and the club's messaging suggested it tried to block the move, creating a negative perception. This approach risks alienating future talent by signaling that the club may not support players' ambitions to advance their careers on a larger stage, overshadowing the financially successful negotiation.</p>

          <p>The trend of institutional investors, like private equity firms, buying single-family homes to rent them out has generated significant controversy and political debate. Research indicates a complex trade-off: while this practice can increase home prices and make ownership more difficult for middle-class families, it also increases the availability of rental properties in suburban areas. This has been shown to make neighborhoods more affordable for lower-income families and contribute to greater demographic diversity, particularly in areas with good schools.</p>

          <p>For nearly 50 years, Melody Barnett has run Palace Costume, a vast and eclectic fashion archive on Fairfax Avenue that serves as a vital resource for Hollywood's costume designers. The collection, which contains over half a million items dating back to the 1880s, has supplied wardrobe for iconic films from "Chinatown" to "Everything Everywhere All at Once." Barnett, now 83, continues to grow her collection, which began with a box of Victorian dresses and evolved into a four-story treasure trove of wearable history.</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that recent statements by President Trump, such as describing some individuals as "born to be criminals," echo the dangerous and pseudoscientific ideas of eugenics. The author draws a parallel between this rhetoric and the historical eugenics movement, which sought to solve social problems by focusing on heredity and led to policies like forced sterilization. The article suggests that these ideas are re-emerging in contemporary politics, framing certain groups as inherently "unfit" and justifying policies that target them.</p>

          <p>Dan Brown, author of the global bestseller "The Da Vinci Code," is releasing a new novel titled "The Secret of Secrets," which delves into the science of human consciousness.

          <p>In his book "Raising A Nation," researcher Elliot Haspel argues that advocates for affordable child care should reframe the issue as a fundamental American value rather than just an economic necessity for working parents. He contends that treating child care as a public good, similar to K-12 education, carries greater moral weight and is essential for family well-being, community stability, and even national security. This approach, he believes, is necessary to build the broad political consensus needed for transformative federal investment in a national child-care system.</p>

This has led some U.S. citizens of Latino descent to feel they must now carry their passports at all times to avoid wrongful detention, creating a sense of being treated like second-class citizens.</p>
