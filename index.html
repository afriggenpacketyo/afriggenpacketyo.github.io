          <p>The Japan Coast Guard reported that Chinese coast guard ships have been observed near the Senkaku Islands for the 215th consecutive day, matching the longest streak since Japan put the islets under state control in 2012. The uninhabited islets, claimed by China as Diaoyu, have been a long-standing point of contention between the two countries. Four Chinese coast guard ships equipped with autocannons were seen sailing in the contiguous zone outside Japan's territorial waters. The Japan Coast Guard issued warnings to the ships, advising them not to approach Japanese territorial waters, as the situation remains tense in the East China Sea. The ongoing presence underscores the persistent territorial dispute and the need for diplomatic efforts to manage the situation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Benjamin Netanyahu's long-held ambition to confront Iran has materialized in a series of Israeli strikes, targeting nuclear facilities and military leaders. Despite facing domestic challenges and international scrutiny, Netanyahu has found support within Israel for his actions against what many Israelis perceive as their greatest threat. The attacks, initiated on June 13, have resulted in casualties on both sides and raised concerns about regional stability. While some view it as a vindication of Netanyahu's warnings about Iran, critics argue that it is a politically motivated move to distract from his domestic troubles and bolster his legacy. The long-term consequences of this conflict remain uncertain, with the potential for further escalation and devastating repercussions.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England is planning to implement DNA testing for all newborn babies to evaluate their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative is part of a broader government effort to predict and prevent illnesses, with £650 million being invested in DNA research for all patients by 2030. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated that gene technology would enable the health service to proactively address diseases rather than react to them. The plan follows a previous study that analyzed the genetic code of up to 100,000 babies, reflecting a significant shift towards preventative healthcare through genetic screening.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has rerouted the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier strike group from the Indo-Pacific to the Middle East, marking the fourth such redeployment in less than a year. This decision follows escalating hostilities between Israel and Iran, prompting the US to bolster its military presence in the region. Analysts suggest that the United States must balance immediate operational needs in the Middle East with its long-term strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific, particularly concerning Taiwan. The redeployment highlights the increasing demands on American military resources amid fluctuating and prolonged conflicts, requiring careful management of global security commitments.</p>

Khalil, a green card holder, had been detained for months as the Trump administration attempted to deport him over "foreign policy" concerns. Upon his release, Khalil criticized the administration's actions, while officials defended the decision to detain him. The ACLU, representing Khalil, expressed relief that he would be reunited with his wife and newborn son, after a judge determined that Khalil is not a threat to the community, not a flight risk and that his detention has been "highly unusual."

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, but President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" to resolve the conflict. The preliminary injunction prevents the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. The Department of Homeland Security had previously told Harvard it was revoking its student visa system certification due to alleged failures in addressing campus antisemitism.

          <p>The Rhode Island state House has passed a bill that would ban the sale and manufacturing of certain semiautomatic rifles, commonly referred to as assault weapons. The proposal now goes to Governor Dan McKee, who supports such bans, making Rhode Island the eleventh state with some form of prohibition on these firearms. The bill applies only to sales and manufacturing, not possession, aligning with Washington state's approach. Critics argue that the ban will not curb mass shootings and may be deemed unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court, with some gun control advocates calling the bill the "weakest assault weapons ban in the country."</p>

          <p>A study indicates that visits by foreign tourists to locations related to manga and anime in Japan have significantly boosted local economies. In 2024, approximately 3 million foreign tourists, or 8.1 percent of inbound visitors, visited these sites, up from 4.8 percent in 2016. Purchases of anime and manga-related goods totaled an estimated 54.3 billion yen last year, a 53 percent increase from 2016. The trend, known as "seichi junrei," has become popular after the success of the anime film "your name," with tourists visiting real-life settings that inspired the works, thus contributing to Japan's soft power reach.</p>

          <p>Recently unsealed court documents reveal more about Vance Boelter, the suspect charged in connection to the deadly shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses. Boelter's wife told investigators they were "preppers" and that he had given her a "bailout plan" to leave the house, fearing armed individuals. Law enforcement discovered empty rifle cases and gun-cleaning supplies in a storage locker rented by Boelter. The Hoffmans, who were shot but survived, recounted being awakened by someone impersonating an officer, highlighting the politically motivated nature of the attacks. The family also said they were praying for civility, with society needing to return to a level of civility that allows all to live peacefully.</p>
