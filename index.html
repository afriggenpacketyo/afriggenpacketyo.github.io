          <p>A New York Times article reports that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) has lowered its economic growth forecast for the fiscal year, citing the impact of U.S. tariffs imposed by President Trump.

The central bank decided to keep interest rates steady at 0.5 percent, acknowledging that tariffs are likely to remain at a level that cannot be ignored.

          <p>An article in The Guardian discusses the UK's disappointing position in trade talks with the US under President Trump, suggesting that appeasement has been ineffective. Despite efforts to align with Trump's requirements, the UK is ranked behind South Korea and Japan in trade priorities. The author argues that belligerence and leverage have been more successful in negotiations with Trump. The article suggests that the UK's exceptionalism and belief in its ability to talk its way out of any situation may be misguided when dealing with Trump's capricious nature. </p>

          <p>China has lifted sanctions on Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in what is seen as a "charm offensive" to improve relations with the EU amidst trade uncertainty created by President Trump's tariffs. The sanctions, imposed in 2021, had strained EU-China relations and stalled a trade and investment deal. While the EU welcomes the move, it maintains concerns about human rights issues in China and will continue to monitor trade flows to prevent the dumping of cheaper Chinese products. </p>

          <p>A New York Times guest essay argues that the U.S. military lacks the necessary personnel and equipment to fight a major war, despite possessing advanced military technology. The authors contend that the focus on high-tech weapons has come at the expense of quantity, leaving the military ill-prepared for prolonged conflicts. They point to the war in Ukraine and recent operations against the Houthis as examples of modern warfare's demands, highlighting shortages in artillery shells, missiles, and recruits. The authors urge Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to prioritize resources that directly strengthen America's combat power. </p>
