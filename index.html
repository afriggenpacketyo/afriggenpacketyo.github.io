          <p>Manchester United's improved offer for Cameroonian forward Bryan Mbeumo, valued at Â£55 million plus Â£7.5 million in add-ons, has been rejected by Brentford. This follows an earlier rejected bid, as United seeks to bolster its attack after signing Matheus Cunha. Brentford is reportedly holding out for a guaranteed upfront fee similar to the Â£62.5 million Wolves received for Cunha. Mbeumo, who had a standout season with 20 goals and nine assists, is also drawing interest from other top clubs, including Tottenham.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The dissenting opinions from the Supreme Court's liberal justices reveal profound concerns about the court's recent conservative-led rulings and their impact on American democracy. Justice Sonia Sotomayor read a potent dissent from the bench, arguing a decision limiting nationwide injunctions gifts the executive branch unchecked power and poses an "existential threat to the rule of law." These dissents highlight a sharp ideological divide on the court and a growing fear among its liberal wing that fundamental rights and judicial checks on presidential power are being dangerously eroded.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent 12-day conflict with Iran, initiated by U.S. and Israeli strikes, offers insight into President Trump's second-term foreign policy approach. Despite ordering the bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities, Trump quickly pivoted to a ceasefire, suggesting a continued aversion to prolonged "forever wars" and ambitions of regime change. Instead, the events indicate that he views military force as a powerful tool to create leverage for negotiations with existing world leaders. This strategy marks a departure from neoconservative hawks, prioritizing deal-making, albeit through highly risky and aggressive means.</p>

The 6-3 ruling stemmed from challenges to his executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship, though the court did not rule on the order's constitutionality.

          <p>In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court sided with a group of Maryland parents who sought to opt their elementary school children out of instruction involving books with LGBTQ+ themes. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Samuel Alito, stated that the school district's policy burdened the parents' right to guide their children's religious development. In a sharp dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned the ruling would create chaos for public schools and hand a veto power to a subset of parents over established curriculum choices, chilling inclusive education.</p>
