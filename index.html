          <p>In an economy marked by inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to protect their purchasing power. Current high-yield CDs provide returns that outpace the inflation rate, and these rates can be locked in for the duration of the CD term. This article explains that while national average CD yields are modest, online banks often offer significantly higher rates, particularly for short-term CDs. It advises consumers to compare different options to secure the best possible returns on their savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's new trade policy, featuring a baseline tariff on all imports and higher reciprocal tariffs for certain countries, is taking full effect. While the deadline was initially postponed, it has now expired, leading to new trade agreements with some partners like the EU, UK, and Japan, but leaving others facing increased levies. The article details the new tariff rates for various countries, including deals made with the Philippines and Vietnam, and highlights ongoing tensions with holdouts like Brazil, India, Canada, and Mexico. The complex situation with China also continues as a separate deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is set to review the legality of President Trump's sweeping tariffs, which were imposed using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). A lower court previously ruled that the president lacked the authority under IEEPA, but the tariffs were temporarily reinstated pending this appeal. The case, brought by 12 states and several small businesses, tests the limits of presidential power, arguing that Congress holds the authority to set tariffs. The administration defends the tariffs as a necessary tool to address national emergencies like trade deficits and drug trafficking.</p>

Additionally, the strength of the U.S. dollar, interest rates, and central bank policies play a significant role in determining the precious metal's price, making it a complex but historically resilient investment.

          <p>Moderna is set to cut approximately 10% of its global workforce by the end of the year as a cost-saving measure. The decision comes as sales of its COVID-19 vaccine continue to decline and the company faces uncertainty in the vaccine market. CEO Stephane Bancel stated the restructuring is essential for the company to remain focused and financially disciplined while continuing to invest in its product pipeline. The company has been working to reduce operating expenses by scaling down R&D and renegotiating supplier agreements to align with new business realities.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has announced that Canada will recognize Palestine as a state at the United Nations General Assembly in September. This move aligns Canada with recent decisions by the United Kingdom and France, citing the deepening suffering of civilians and the erosion of a two-state solution. The recognition is conditional on reforms within the Palestinian Authority, the release of all hostages by Hamas, and the demilitarization of the future state. The decision was condemned by the Israeli Foreign Ministry, which described it as a "reward for Hamas."</p>

          <p>The UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has launched formal investigations into four companies operating 34 pornography websites for potential non-compliance with new age verification laws. These rules, part of the Online Safety Act, require sites with adult content to use effective tools to prevent access by children. The investigation targets companies with a combined nine million monthly visitors, prioritizing them based on user numbers and the potential risk of harm. This enforcement action comes amid a public debate over the law's effectiveness and privacy implications, with some critics pointing to the use of VPNs to circumvent the checks.</p>

The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which would avoid the costly and disruptive need to reroute the M25 motorway. The company claims its proposal would reduce risk, control spiraling costs, and could be fully operational by 2035. This development introduces the first-ever rival bid for the long-debated expansion project, with the government now set to review both competing proposals for the major infrastructure upgrade.</p>

This legal challenge follows Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement that the UK would move toward recognition unless Israel meets certain conditions. A government minister defended the plan, noting the UK is not a signatory to the convention and that 147 UN members already recognize Palestine.</p>

The brief failure forced a reduction in air traffic for safety reasons, causing a domino effect across the country's busy airspace. Airlines have criticized NATS for the second major outage since 2023, while experts explain that the system's high traffic volume means even a short failure can cause major backlogs.

          <p>Comcast reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street estimates, driven by a significant net income boost from the sale of its Hulu stake. The company's content and experiences division, particularly its film studios and theme parks, showed strong revenue growth. However, the connectivity and platforms business saw a loss of 226,000 broadband customers, a continuing challenge for the cable industry amid heightened competition. In a positive sign, Comcast added a record 378,000 mobile customers, and its streaming service Peacock saw reduced losses for the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A petition filed in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court alleges that Washington County District Attorney Jason Walsh pressured his county's coroner to rule an infant's death a homicide to bolster his political career. The coroner claims in an affidavit that Walsh told him, "I need this to be a homicide. I need it to win an election." The case involves a father who insists his 11-week-old son's death was an accident, yet he faces a capital murder charge. The petition highlights the potential for the death penalty to be exploited for political advantage and questions the scientific basis of "shaken baby syndrome," which was listed on the allegedly fraudulent death certificate.</p>

          <p>A DW fact-check investigates conflicting narratives about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where Israeli officials deny the existence of starvation. This contrasts sharply with reports from global hunger monitors like the IPC and the World Health Organization, which indicate that famine thresholds have been surpassed and malnutrition-related deaths are rising. The article examines specific claims circulated on social media, such as photos of emaciated children attributed to pre-existing conditions and videos of bustling markets. It finds that while some claims contain a grain of truth, they are often used to distort the overwhelming evidence of a severe and widespread food crisis.</p>

          <p>Experts confirm that American children are increasingly suffering from chronic health conditions, a central claim of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement. A recent study found a significant rise in conditions like asthma, diabetes, and depression over the last decade. While experts applaud the attention on this crisis, they criticize the MAHA report for conflating neurodevelopmental conditions like autism with diseases and for promoting misinformation, particularly regarding vaccines. Critics also point out that the Trump administration's policies, such as environmental deregulation and cuts to social programs, actively undermine children's health.</p>

          <p>A new NHS England report has concluded that the concerns of a mother were repeatedly ignored by healthcare providers before the death of her five-year-old son, Yusuf Nazir. The boy died from a lung infection in 2022, days after being sent home from a hospital emergency department. The report identifies multiple missed opportunities to escalate his care and found that a reliance on clinical metrics over caregiver insight led to a lack of shared decision-making. The family is now calling for a full inquest to demand accountability and ensure lessons are learned from the tragic series of failures.</p>

          <p>This article explores the cultural phenomenon of Labubus, a line of bunny-eared monster toys from Pop Mart that has become a massive commercial success. Sold in limited, late-night online "drops," the toys have cultivated a fervent following willing to pay high prices on the resale market. Their "cute-ugly" aesthetic is highly polarizing, which experts suggest only fuels the craze by creating a sense of in-group belonging for fans. The purchasing process, which involves "blind boxes" and a race against time, taps into psychological mechanisms similar to gambling, making the thrill of the chase a key part of the appeal.</p>

A survey of RCN members revealed overwhelming dissatisfaction with the recent 3.6% pay increase. Rather than demanding a higher raise, the union is focused on reforming the NHS contract, arguing that too many experienced nurses are stuck on low pay bands that don't reflect their skills. The government has expressed disappointment with the union's stance but has indicated a willingness to discuss contract reform, while holding firm that headline pay is not up for renegotiation.</p>

This move places India in a difficult diplomatic and economic position, caught between its long-standing ties with Russia and its important trade relationship with the U.S. Analysts suggest the threats may be a negotiating tactic, but they risk straining U.S.-India relations regardless of the outcome.</p>
