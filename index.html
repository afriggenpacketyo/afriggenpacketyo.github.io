          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently sold approximately $36.4 million worth of the company's stock, part of a pre-established plan to sell up to six million shares. This transaction occurs as Nvidia's market capitalization surpasses $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable company. Huang's personal wealth has soared, placing him in close competition with Warren Buffett on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Despite the sale, Huang retains a massive holding of over 858 million shares in the artificial intelligence chipmaking giant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Small businesses along Malibu's Pacific Coast Highway are still struggling to recover six months after the devastating Palisades fire. Although the highway has reopened, customer traffic remains significantly below normal levels for the peak summer season. Eateries, surf shops, and souvenir stores that survived the flames report sales are down by 25-30% or more, with some unable to pay employees for months. The slow return of tourism, combined with the visible scars on the landscape and contaminated beaches, has created a challenging environment for local entrepreneurs who remain cautiously hopeful for a return to normalcy next year.</p>

          <p>The new "Superman" film by James Gunn has sparked a culture war debate, with some critics labeling it "superwoke" for its acknowledgment of the character as an immigrant. The article argues that this backlash is overblown, as Superman's origin as an alien refugee from Krypton has always been central to his story. It points out that the film emphasizes his all-American upbringing in Kansas as the source of his values, presenting a story of assimilation rather than radical politics. The piece contrasts the fictional hero's experience with the current real-world targeting of specific immigrant communities in the U.S.</p>

          <p>In response to an unusual and prolonged swarm of over 1,700 tremors in the Tokara Islands, Japan's government has approved upgraded disaster response plans. While authorities state this activity is not a precursor to the feared Nankai Trough earthquake, they acknowledge a major disaster is inevitable. The new plans aim to reduce the projected death toll from a potential magnitude-9 quake by 80% within a decade through infrastructure like taller sea walls and refuge towers. Experts stress that public education on rapid evacuation is equally critical, as some coastal areas could be hit by a tsunami within minutes.</p>

The ruling responds to a lawsuit by advocacy groups alleging unconstitutional tactics like racial profiling. The order specifically blocks arrests based solely on factors like race, accent, or presence at locations like day laborer sites without reasonable suspicion.

This approach follows a 90-day "pause" on global tariffs, during which new trade deals were meant to be negotiated. With only one deal signed with the U.K., many countries now face the prospect of renewed and potentially higher tariffs. The letters leave room for negotiation, suggesting rates could be lowered if countries remove their own trade barriers, but they create significant policy uncertainty for global markets.

While sharing nationalist and anti-immigration views, the party is wary of Trump's unpopularity among many French voters and the negative economic impact of U.S. tariffs. Led by Marine Le Pen and Jordan Bardella, the party is pursuing a strategy of "vote maximization" for the 2027 presidential election, which requires appearing moderate enough to attract mainstream voters.

          <p>The Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP) brought beach volleyball indoors, transforming the new Intuit Dome, home of the L.A. Clippers, into a sand-filled arena. The move, which involved pouring 300 tons of sand onto the arena floor, aims to attract new fans and elevate the sport's professional profile. Players expressed excitement about competing in a major sports venue, noting that the controlled indoor environment, free of wind, changes the game's dynamics by enabling more powerful serves and cleaner jumps. The event represents an innovative attempt to grow the sport beyond its traditional beach settings.</p>

          <p>A proposal by German Education Minister Karin Prien to consider a quota for students with immigrant backgrounds in schools has ignited a national debate. Prien suggested a cap of 30-40% could be a "conceivable model" to improve educational outcomes, but the idea has drawn sharp criticism from educators, researchers, and student groups. Opponents argue it is impractical, discriminatory, and would stigmatize children, while the core issue is a lack of German language skills, not immigrant background. The debate highlights broader challenges within Germany's education system, which has shown mediocre performance in recent international studies.</p>

          <p>Chelsea is set to face Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final, a match that presents a significant test for their youth-focused project. Despite being considered underdogs against a PSG team that recently dominated Real Madrid, Chelsea approaches the final with confidence, having already secured financial benefits and proven their mentality. The article notes that both clubs have embraced a strategy of building young, aggressive teams. Chelsea's manager, Enzo Maresca, is expected to stick to his positional-play style rather than "park the bus," setting the stage for a tactical battle against Europe's reigning champions.</p>

          <p>Two men have been charged with multiple offenses, including robbery and kidnap, after a stolen BMW being pursued by police crashed into a care home in Sunderland, UK. The crash resulted in the deaths of two female residents, one in her 80s and another in her 90s, and injured eight others. The police investigation is still examining whether the crash contributed to the two deaths. The incident began after the car was reported stolen, with a woman allegedly being forcibly removed from the vehicle shortly before the chase and subsequent crash, which caused major structural damage.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Clippers player Kobe Brown showcased his potential with a strong performance in a Summer League game against the Houston Rockets before exiting with an injury. Brown scored 14 points in 20 minutes but left in the third quarter after another player fell on his right ankle. The team described the injury as a right ankle contusion and said his removal was precautionary. The Clippers are hopeful that Brown, a 2023 first-round draft pick, can become a key rotational player this season, and his performance before the injury demonstrated his ability to score and defend effectively.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered their seventh consecutive loss, falling 8-7 to the San Francisco Giants despite a late-game offensive resurgence. An early 8-2 deficit, created by a difficult outing for pitcher Dustin May, proved too much to overcome. The Dodgers' bats finally came alive, tagging Giants ace Logan Webb for six runs, including Shohei Ohtani's 32nd home run of the season. However, the comeback fell just short, culminating in a game-ending double play in the ninth inning, marking the team's longest losing streak since 2017 and shrinking their division lead to four games.</p>

          <p>In this opinion piece, author Raja Shehadeh argues that Israel's plan to move Palestinians into a camp in Rafah would constitute a crime against humanity. He contends that international law has consistently failed to protect Palestinians, citing the world's inaction despite the International Criminal Court issuing arrest warrants for Israeli leaders. The author reflects on the decades-long dispossession of Palestinians and questions how Israelis can show no remorse for the suffering in Gaza. He concludes that hope lies not in failed legal systems but in Palestinian resilience and the eventual emergence of truth about the war.</p>

          <p>Poland has finalized a $6.7 billion deal to acquire a second batch of 180 K2 main battle tanks from South Korea, part of a larger 2022 agreement. This purchase underscores Poland's military modernization in response to Russia's war in Ukraine and solidifies South Korea's status as a major global arms supplier, particularly to U.S. allies. As American stockpiles are strained by conflicts, South Korea is increasingly filling the gap. The deal includes domestic production of a Polish variant of the tank, bolstering Poland's defense capabilities on NATO's eastern flank. (not investment advice)</p>
