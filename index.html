          <p>Wise, a British money transfer firm, announced its intention to shift its primary listing to the United States, a move that poses a setback for the London Stock Exchange. The company will implement a dual listing strategy, maintaining a secondary listing in London while establishing its main hub in the U.S. This decision aims to enable Wise's shares to be traded on both a U.S. stock exchange and the LSE, potentially broadening its investor base and access to capital. The announcement led to a 7% increase in Wise's shares during early morning trading. Optimism surrounds the company's strategic move to enhance its global presence. Optimism score is 75.</p>

          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued a warning to women using weight-loss injections, advising them to use effective contraception due to potential risks to unborn babies. The MHRA highlights that it remains uncertain whether medications like Wegovy and Mounjaro could harm a fetus. The agency recommends contraception during the use of GLP-1 medicines and for a specific period afterward before attempting pregnancy, advising those on Mounjaro and oral contraceptives to also use condoms for four weeks after starting the drug or switch to alternative methods. Concerns have arisen that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' may lead to unsafe drug use or inadequate advice. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>Three unexploded U.S. bombs from World War II were successfully defused in Cologne, Germany, prompting the city's largest evacuation since the war's end. Over 20,000 residents were evacuated from the city center after the bombs were discovered during road construction preparations. Experts managed to defuse the bombs in approximately one hour. Unexploded bombs are frequently found in Germany, requiring precautionary evacuations, and the location of this discovery was notably close to Cologne's historic center.

          <p>Russell Martin has been named the new head coach of Rangers, signing a three-year contract to lead the club into a new era.

Rangers finished the previous season without a trophy and as runners-up to Celtic in the Scottish Premiership, so Martin faces the challenge of making the club more competitive.

The writers also discuss the potential for a small-market finals, the coaching matchup between Mark Daigneault and Rick Carlisle, and unheralded players to watch like Aaron Nesmith and Andrew Nembhard.

          <p>A charity is advocating for pensions for retired police dogs to assist with their often complicated and costly medical needs. These dogs risk their lives in the line of duty, but receive no support after retirement, leaving their adopters to cover expenses for chronic health issues and service-related injuries. The Thin Blue Paw charity estimates that adopting a retired police dog costs an average of £3,000 more per year compared to other dogs. Nottinghamshire Police is one of the few forces that pays pensions to its retired dogs. Optimism score is 60.</p>
