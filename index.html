          <p>Federal and local authorities are investigating an explosion near a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California, which occurred Saturday morning. Palm Springs Police Department Chief Andy Mills indicated the incident appeared to be an intentional act of violence, with the blast field extending several blocks and damaging nearby buildings. At least one person died in the explosion, though authorities have not yet identified the victim, and several others were injured.

          <p>New Jersey Transit executives and the union representing its train drivers adjourned negotiations on Saturday without reaching a deal, marking the second full day of the state's first transit strike in 40 years.

          <p>Hamas has proposed releasing more hostages in exchange for a 60-day truce and the release of Palestinian prisoners, as part of a new ceasefire deal negotiated with Israel. The proposal comes after Israel launched a major new offensive in Gaza, resulting in hundreds of deaths. The new deal reinstates a previous humanitarian protocol, including the entry of 400 aid trucks daily and the evacuation of medical patients from Gaza, but does not include an explicit end to the war or Israeli withdrawal. The intensified offensive has drawn condemnation from the UN and some European leaders, with warnings about the risk of famine among Gaza's population. </p>

The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period and reveals that Mosura was more complex than previously known radiodonts.

The audio captures pauses and digressions, including stories about his early career and personal life, which may further fuel questions about his fitness for office.

          <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz criticized President Trump in a law school graduation speech, accusing him of abusing power and violating the rule of law. Walz, the vice presidential nominee in 2024, called on graduates to stand up to abuses of power, stating that lawyers are the "first and last line of defense." He cited Trump's immigration policies and questions about due process as examples of the crumbling of the rule of law. Walz's remarks reflect ongoing debate among Democrats about how to check the Trump administration. </p>

Legal scholars have praised the courts' support of due process while expressing concern that such support was needed in the first place. </p>
