          <p>Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin for U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, citing Martin's support for criminal defendants in the January 6th Capitol riot cases. Tillis's decision jeopardizes Martin's confirmation, as it could lead to a tie vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee, preventing the nomination from moving forward. Martin is currently serving as interim U.S. Attorney for D.C., but his term is set to expire soon. Tillis met with Martin the evening before making his decision.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough is launching a new film titled Ocean, which he considers one of the most important films of his career, as he approaches his hundredth year. The film emphasizes the crucial role oceans play in maintaining biodiversity and combating climate change, arguing that oceans are the planet's support system and humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe. The film documents the decline in ocean life during Sir David's lifetime, but also highlights the ocean's remarkable ability to recover if given the chance. The film contains graphic footage of the damage caused by bottom trawling.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have reached a trade agreement after three years of talks, aimed at boosting trade between the two countries by an estimated Â£25.5 billion a year by 2040. The agreement will reduce tariffs on UK exports like whisky, cars, and food products, while cutting taxes on Indian clothing and footwear exports. UK Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds hailed the deal as "massive" for both businesses and consumers.

          <p>Coterra Energy is reducing its oil drilling due to lower crude prices and increasing its focus on natural gas production, a move that has led to a stock sell-off. The company's first-quarter revenue increased 33% year over year to $1.9 billion, falling short of estimates. Operational issues in Culberson County, Texas, have also contributed to the stock decline, with some wells producing higher-than-normal water volumes. Coterra is still considered a solid oil-and-gas play, providing a dividend payout and exposure to long-term trends in natural gas demand, but the stock may face near-term challenges.</p>

          <p>Air traffic controllers lost contact with aircraft heading to and from Newark Liberty International Airport last week, their union said, detailing an equipment failure that led to massive flight delays and raised more concerns about aging U.S. aviation infrastructure and staffing shortages. The controllers who guide flights in and out of the New Jersey airport on April 28 "temporarily lost radar and communications with the aircraft under their control, unable to see, hear, or talk to them," the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, their union, said in a statement. Staffing shortages followed the incident, which was so severe that some of the controllers involved "have taken time off to recover from the stress of multiple recent outages," the Federal Aviation Administration said Monday.</p>

          <p>House GOP leaders stressed early this week that the budget package central to President Trump's agenda remains on track even as they acknowledged a delay that comes amid simmering disagreements in the Republican conference that have threatened to stunt progress on reconciliation. "It just made sense for us to push pause for a week to make sure that we do this right," House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Tuesday at his weekly news conference. Committees face a May 9 deadline to complete their committee work under the budget resolution that the House and Senate adopted in April.</p>

          <p>It's become an almost weekly item at this point. While interest rates remain elevated on a variety of borrowing products, they've been in a steady decline on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) for more than a year now. A rate cut courtesy of the central bank, or even a hint toward one, could be powerful enough to cause HELOC rates to decline again. That's because the central bank is widely expected to keep its federal funds rate unchanged at the current range between 4.25% and 4.50%.</p>

          <p>Interest rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have been steadily declining this year, reaching their lowest point since 2023, but they are unlikely to adjust much this week. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to keep its federal funds rate unchanged, which will do little to change HELOC rates. However, comments made by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after the Fed's meeting could cause HELOC rates to shift, depending on his optimism about future rate cuts. HELOC rates are likely to stay steady this week.</p>
