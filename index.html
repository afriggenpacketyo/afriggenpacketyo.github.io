          <p>The article discusses the growing trend of using electric grills as a climate-friendly alternative to traditional fossil fuel grills. Many consumers are switching to electric grills due to their convenience and environmental benefits, especially as electricity grids become cleaner. While some chefs express skepticism about the flavor compared to charcoal or wood, electric grills offer precise temperature control and are suitable for cooking vegetables and other sensitive foods. Companies like Kenyon and Current Backyard are expanding their electric grill lines, appealing to younger consumers and those in apartments where gas grills may not be allowed. The couple in the article replaced their gas grill with an electric one after switching to electric cars, lawn mowers, trimmers, and a water heater.</p>

          <p>The article reports that the Senate is likely to make significant changes to the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" passed by the House, despite President Trump's push for swift action. Senate Republicans have raised concerns about the bill's impact on the national debt, with some calling for steeper spending cuts. While Senate Republicans aim to pass Trump's legislative agenda, they plan to modify the bill to reflect their priorities. The House-passed bill includes tax cuts, cuts to social safety net programs, and changes to SNAP, drawing criticism from Democrats who argue it favors the wealthy at the expense of the poor.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a gala dinner for top investors in the $TRUMP meme coin, sparking accusations of corruption and protests. Critics argue that the event represents a way to buy access to the President, while the White House defends Trump's actions as securing good deals for the American people. The event took place as Bitcoin hit a record high, and the article notes Trump's evolving views on cryptocurrency, from calling Bitcoin a "scam" in 2021 to now being an active participant in the industry. The Trump family also holds a majority stake in the crypto exchange World Liberty Financial. Three days into his term, Trump issued an Executive Order to establish a regulatory framework that promotes the growth of digital currencies.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, along with the leaders of France and Canada, of siding with Hamas and being on the "wrong side of history." This accusation follows criticism from these countries regarding Israel's expanded offensive in Gaza, which they deemed "disproportionate." Netanyahu's remarks were prompted by an attack on Israeli embassy staff in Washington, where the suspect shouted "free Palestine." While the UK has condemned the killings, they maintain support for Israel's right to self-defense within international law, emphasizing the need for aid to reach suffering civilians in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Florida has suggested that President Trump possesses the authority to unilaterally impose tariffs, citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 and a precedent from a 1970s court case involving a Japanese zipper company. Despite this favorable view, the judge transferred the case to the Court of International Trade in New York. The lawsuit was filed by Emily Ley Paper, challenging the legality of Trump's tariffs. The judge's opinion offers a symbolic victory for the Trump administration, which faces multiple lawsuits questioning the tariffs' legitimacy.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times opinion piece, Harvard professor Steven Pinker argues against the extreme criticism aimed at Harvard, which he calls "Harvard Derangement Syndrome." He acknowledges Harvard's issues, including erosion of academic freedom and political narrowness, but criticizes the "black-and-white splitting" that paints the university as a "woke madrasa" or "anti-Semitic institution." Pinker defends the value of universities in discovering and transmitting knowledge, not social justice. He also notes that while there are valid concerns about antisemitism at Harvard, the situation is not as extreme as some critics claim, and punitive defunding from the Trump administration is not the solution.</p>

          <p>The New York Times Editorial Board criticizes the Republican plan to undermine Obamacare by restricting access to Medicaid through work requirements. The editorial argues that the plan, disguised as a common-sense measure, would deprive millions of Americans of health insurance to fund tax cuts for the wealthy. The board points out that evidence suggests work requirements do not increase workforce participation and can lead to eligible individuals losing coverage due to paperwork issues. The article emphasizes that health care is a right and the Republican plan would increase the number of uninsured Americans by at least 13.7 million by 2034.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army will implement a new Army Fitness Test (AFT) on June 1, 2025, replacing the current Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) with updated scoring standards emphasizing readiness and combat effectiveness. The AFT comprises five events: the three-repetition maximum deadlift, hand-release push-ups, sprint-drag-carry, plank, and a two-mile run. Scoring requirements are more demanding, especially for soldiers in combat roles. Experts suggest that while challenging, the AFT is achievable for individuals with a basic fitness foundation, though some estimate less than 5% of civilians could pass it without proper preparation.</p>

This comes amid growing scrutiny of President Donald Trump’s proposed missile shield. General Stephen Whiting said Beijing’s strategy included deploying weapons in orbit, developing jamming systems and fielding kinetic anti-satellite missiles, all with the explicit aim of blinding and disrupting US military operations during a crisis. The ambitious defence system known as the Golden Dome is a sweeping plan to build a layered missile defence architecture to protect the US from long-range and hypersonic threats.</p>

          <p>A Republican budget bill passed by the House aims to penalize states that provide healthcare coverage to people in the U.S. without authorization. The bill would cut federal Medicaid reimbursements to these states unless they roll back the benefits, potentially leaving millions without insurance. The legislation targets 14 states, most of them Democratic-led, and could result in significant financial burdens and difficult political decisions for those states. The article highlights the potential impact on states like California, New York, Utah, and Illinois, and the debate over whether Congress has the authority to penalize states for their healthcare policies.</p>

          <p>The article examines the complexities involved in converting a luxury jetliner gifted by Qatar into the next Air Force One. While President Trump suggests a quick conversion, experts warn that the process would take years due to the high-tech communications, defense systems, and unique layout required. The current Air Force One planes are aging, necessitating a replacement, but retrofitting the gifted plane to meet the necessary standards is a significant undertaking. The plane would require significant modifications, including advanced security systems and potentially a complete overhaul to ensure no listening devices or malware are present.</p>

          <p>Shenzhen, China’s top exporting city, experienced a 2.9% decline in exports in April, contrasting with the 8.1% growth seen nationally. This indicates that traders are still facing challenges amid ongoing tariff tensions with the US. Peng Peng of the Guangdong Society of Reform noted the volatility in Shenzhen's export performance, attributing it to the city's high dependence on foreign trade. The decline was primarily driven by a drop in general trade, while export processing also saw a decrease. The situation underscores the unpredictability and limited policy maneuverability facing Shenzhen's economy.</p>

          <p>The UN Security Council is set to vote on renewing an arms embargo on South Sudan, with Amnesty International warning that the conflict could worsen without it. The embargo, dating back to 2018, aims to curb arms transfers to parties involved in the conflict, which has resulted in thousands of deaths and widespread displacement. Amnesty International accuses Uganda of openly violating the embargo through the deployment of armed soldiers and equipment. While the UN insists it is doing all it can to stop the conflict, some citizens question the impact of UN peacekeeping efforts.</p>
