          <p>India is looking to tap into its rare earth reserves as China's restrictions on rare earth exports are impacting various industries. Experts believe that India could become an alternative to China for countries like the U.S. if it invests more in the sector. China currently dominates the rare earth elements market, producing about 60% of the world's supply and processing nearly 90%. India's Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal called China's pause in exports of rare earth elements a "wake-up call" for the world and an opportunity for India to provide an alternative.

          <p>Israel launched a series of airstrikes against Iran, targeting locations it claims are related to Iran's nuclear program. The strikes resulted in the deaths of key Iranian military officials, including Mohammad Hossein Bagheri, chief of the Iranian Armed Forces, and Hossein Salami, commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Iranian news outlets reported that two leading nuclear scientists, Fereydoun Abbasi-Davani and Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi, were also killed.

          <p>Former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown is facing an attempted murder charge in Miami-Dade County following a shooting outside a celebrity boxing event. Brown allegedly punched a man, grabbed a firearm from a security officer, and fired two shots at the man, with one bullet possibly grazing his neck. This charge adds to Brown's growing list of legal issues, including prior arrests and domestic violence allegations. Brown, who last played in the NFL in 2021, has previously attributed some of his behavior to possible chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).</p>

However, Israel felt it had an opportunity to act, believing Iran to be weakened after the degradation of Hezbollah. Secretary of State Marco Rubio released a statement distancing the U.S. from what he called "unilateral action" by Israel. The U.S. had previously indicated it would not provide support for any Israeli military action, even refusing aerial refueling assistance.</p>

          <p>According to the World Gold Council, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. The researcher, John Reade, points out that cryptocurrencies tend to move with equities, unlike gold, which acts as a hedge during market volatility. Reade believes that digital assets have different characteristics and should not be marketed as "gold 2.0". His comments come amidst growing market interest in stablecoins and other digital currencies, as well as a fresh rally in gold prices due to Middle East tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union has been largely sidelined as the United States and China engage in high-stakes talks aimed at stabilizing the global trading system.

          <p>The article analyzes Israel's recent military action against Iran, questioning whether it constitutes a preemptive or preventive war. It defines preemptive attacks as spoiling attacks meant to thwart an imminent threat, while preventive attacks remove the source of a threat on the attacker's own terms. The author argues that Israel's actions, targeting Iran's nuclear program and military leaders, resemble a preventive war, carrying significant moral and practical risks. The author compares this situation to historical examples, including the U.S. war on Iraq, and emphasizes the dangers and complexities of such decisions in the nuclear age.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court temporarily halted a judge's ruling that had blocked the Trump administration from deploying members of the California National Guard in Los Angeles and ordered President Trump to return control to Gov. Gavin Newsom. The Trump administration can deploy the National Guard to L.A. while the court considers the administration's appeal, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals said late Thursday. The Ninth Circuit Court ordered a hearing before the three-judge panel for June 17 on the case.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked a judge's ruling that would have prevented the Trump administration from deploying the California National Guard in Los Angeles. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals granted an administrative stay, allowing the Trump administration to continue deploying the National Guard while the court considers the appeal. This decision reverses a previous ruling that found Trump's decision to federalize the National Guard in response to protests was likely unlawful. The appeals court has scheduled a hearing for June 17 to further consider the case.</p>

China's focus on STEM education and the prevalence of engineers in top government positions highlight the country's emphasis on technological advancement and large-scale public works.
