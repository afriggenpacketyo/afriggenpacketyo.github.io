        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article discusses the remarkable decrease in violent crime rates across the United States, following a sharp increase during the pandemic. FBI data indicates that murder rates have fallen to pre-pandemic levels, with some cities like Baltimore experiencing their lowest homicide rates in over a decade. The article attributes the decline to the easing of pandemic-related stressors, the return of social services, and government initiatives such as community violence interruption programs. Despite these positive trends, the article notes that many Americans still believe crime is rising, highlighting a disconnect between perception and reality, and emphasizes that bad news tends to dominate media coverage.</p>

          <p>A major power outage struck Cannes, France, on the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, affecting 160,000 homes and businesses.

          <p>Former President Trump is considering taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, potentially ending 17 years of federal control over the mortgage giants. This move has garnered support from investors like Bill Ackman, who believes it could benefit taxpayers and the housing market. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, warn it could disrupt the mortgage market and increase housing prices. The article also notes that the government created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to stabilize the mortgage market, and that they were placed under federal conservatorship during the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece from Fox News accuses broadcast networks of bias in their coverage of political books, particularly "tell-all" books, claiming they favor those critical of Trump while downplaying those with scoops about Biden. The article contrasts the extensive coverage given to anti-Trump books like Michael Wolff's "Fire and Fury" and Omarosa Manigault-Newman's "Unhinged" with the limited attention paid to Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's new Biden "tell-all." The author argues that networks aggressively pushed the White House line that questioning Biden‚Äôs fitness was a fringy MAGA talking point.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has drastically reduced its support for anti-crime initiatives, leaving law enforcement agencies and nonprofits struggling to replace the lost funding. An estimated 373 grants, totaling about $500 million, have been terminated, surprising many public safety groups. The cuts are impacting various programs, including those focused on community violence intervention and fentanyl investigations. While the Justice Department states its focus is on prosecuting criminals and protecting Americans from violent crime, critics argue the cuts were made without proper research and understanding of the programs' effectiveness.</p>

          <p>This article examines a report cited by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to justify an FDA safety review of mifepristone, a drug used in medical abortions. The report, published by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, claims mifepristone is dangerous, but its methodology and conclusions are questioned by health experts. The article details concerns about the report's data sources, criteria for defining adverse events, and lack of peer review, suggesting it is not a reliable basis for changing government guidance on the drug.</p>

          <p>An article discusses the deaths of 4,000 baby chicks shipped through the USPS, highlighting the often-hidden aspects of transporting live animals for the meat industry. The article notes that the animals raised for food are often transported multiple times throughout their lives, and they‚Äôre typically treated like cargo rather than living, feeling animals. It also details the conditions on factory farms, where disease spreads quickly and millions of chickens die before they can even be trucked to the slaughterhouse. The article suggests that the meat industry could choose to pack fewer animals into each truck, require heating and cooling during transport, and give animals ample time for rest, water, and food on long journeys.</p>
