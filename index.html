          <p>A grassroots football league in Jiangsu province, China, known as the Su Super League, has gained immense popularity, attracting millions of online viewers and thousands of fans to stadiums. The league features 13 city-based teams with players from diverse backgrounds and has become a commercial success, stimulating consumption in various sectors, including match tickets and local products. This enthusiasm contrasts with the disappointment often felt by Chinese soccer fans towards the national team. The league's unexpected and sustained impact has significantly boosted the local economy, demonstrating the potential of grassroots sports to drive commercial activity. The league's success is a welcome development for the region, providing a source of pride and economic stimulus.</p>

          <p>In a case filled with twists, charges against Barry Morphew for the murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, were dismissed without prejudice, meaning charges can be refiled. Prosecutors stated they need to investigate further and believe they are close to discovering Suzanne's body, citing the exclusion of key expert witnesses as a reason for the dismissal. Morphew's attorney maintained his innocence, emphasizing the lack of physical evidence connecting him to the alleged crime. The case has been marked by bizarre clues, including a chipmunk alibi, a tranquilizer gun, and a spy pen, making it a complex investigation with no definitive answers yet, and in May 2023, Barry Morphew filed a $15 million federal civil rights lawsuit against prosecutors and law enforcement officials stating he was wrongfully arrested, jailed and prosecuted.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" with Harvard to resolve the conflict. The Department of Homeland Security had previously threatened to revoke Harvard's student visa system certification, citing concerns about campus antisemitism, but the judge sided with Harvard, arguing that the school was being politically targeted. This legal battle has significant implications for Harvard, where a substantial portion of the student body comes from outside the United States, and other universities have faced similar pressure regarding their handling of pro-Palestinian protests.</p>

Read's parents acknowledged that her life would never be the same due to the notoriety of the trial, which involved misogynistic comments and dehumanization. Despite the verdict, the question of responsibility for O'Keefe's death remains unanswered, and Read still faces a civil wrongful death suit filed by the O'Keefe family.</p>

Purchases of anime and manga-related goods totaled an estimated 54.3 billion yen last year, marking a 53% increase from 2016. This trend, known as "seichi junrei" or "holy pilgrimage," has become a popular activity for fans, who visit places that inspired or were the real-life settings for popular works, and local governments need to address overtourism issues affecting the lives of those who live near the popular locations.</p>

          <p>Newly unsealed court documents reveal that Vance Boelter, the suspect in the deadly shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers and their spouses, was a "prepper" who had a "bailout plan" for his wife. Boelter is accused of killing Democratic House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and seriously wounding Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. His wife told investigators that he had instructed her to take their children to her mother's home in Wisconsin and law enforcement found empty rifle cases, gun-cleaning supplies, and a bike in a storage locker rented by Boelter. The Hoffman family released a statement expressing their grief and concern about the risks associated with public service in the current political climate.</p>

Antworks Co., which operates pork rice bowl eateries, recently opened its first ramen noodle restaurant in Tokyo and plans to expand with three more locations. Yoshinoya Holdings Co., parent company of a major beef bowl restaurant chain, is also strengthening its ramen noodle business, citing ingredient cost balance and market saturation for beef bowls. As consumers seek alternatives to rice, sales of frozen udon noodles and packaged udon noodle soup have grown, while western-style breakfast foods like bread and cereal have also gained popularity.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece highlights the erosion of traditional values in China, citing viral videos of young people refusing to give up courtesy seats to elderly individuals on public transport. The author notes that Chinese civilization is deeply rooted in virtues such as sympathy, respect, and love towards the elderly, drawing on Confucian teachings about filial piety. The incidents have sparked public debate about the neglect of moral values in an increasingly individualistic society. The subway authority in Shanghai offered little guidance on how to avoid similar situations in the future.</p>

          <p>Scientists are investigating anomalous radio waves detected beneath the Antarctic ice that appear to defy the laws of physics. These signals emerged during a search for high-energy cosmic particles called neutrinos, and the signals came from below the horizon, suggesting they passed through thousands of miles of rock before reaching the detector. However, the radio waves should have been absorbed by the rock, leading researchers to believe these signals cannot be explained by the current understanding of particle physics. Follow-up observations have not confirmed the signals, leaving their origin a mystery that larger, more sensitive detectors may help solve.</p>

          <p>A rockfall in Banff National Park killed two people, including retired University of Alberta professor Jutta Hinrichs, and injured three others. The incident occurred on the Bow Glacier Falls hiking trail, and officials have called off rescue efforts, believing everyone is accounted for. The University of Alberta described Henrichs as a "dedicated leader and educator," and officials said the rockfall was an "extremely rare event" that was "neither predictable nor preventable."</p>

          <p>Dodgers manager Dave Roberts has been suspended one game by MLB for his actions during a benches-clearing altercation against the San Diego Padres. In addition to the suspension, Roberts was fined an undisclosed amount, and Padres manager Mike Shildt also received a one-game suspension and fine. The back-and-forth animosity on the field escalated when Dodgers relief pitcher Jack Little hit Fernando Tatis Jr. with a pitch, leading to Shildt's ejection and Roberts' subsequent charge toward home plate.</p>
