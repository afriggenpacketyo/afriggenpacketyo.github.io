        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed in April, falling short of analyst expectations and signaling ongoing concerns about consumption in the world's second-largest economy. Despite a slight easing in the urban unemployment rate, fixed-asset investment also grew at a slower pace. The real estate sector continues to face significant challenges, with existing home prices in major cities falling at the fastest pace in months. While industrial output exceeded expectations, officials caution that external factors remain unstable and domestic demand lacks momentum, highlighting the need for further consolidation of economic recovery.

          <p>The UK and the European Union have agreed to a post-Brexit reset deal, aiming to improve relations after Britain's departure from the bloc in 2020. The agreement, reached during a summit in London, includes reciprocal access to fishing waters until June 2038, energy cooperation, and a security and defense partnership. This deal seeks to address trade frictions, potentially involving a role for the European Court of Justice in resolving disputes and increased cooperation on energy policy. The agreement comes amid a shift toward U.S. isolationism, prompting the UK and EU to strengthen their partnership.</p>

          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to decrease in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that the bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by £129 annually, a decrease of nearly 7%. This reduction would bring the typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit to £1,720, down from the current level of £1,849. The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, so usage still affects the total bill.</p>

          <p>The German Police Union (GdP) is warning that intensified border checks and asylum rejections cannot be sustained due to staff shortages and suspended training. The GdP chief stated that the measures rely on adjusted rosters, canceled leave, and paused training. Currently, over 1,000 riot police are deployed at the borders following tightened controls by the Interior Minister. Separately, an Iraqi couple is on trial in Germany, accused of enslaving and abusing two Yazidi girls.</p>

          <p>A Chinese military magazine claims that India’s new Prachand combat helicopter is no match for China’s Z-10 attack helicopter, dismissing the aircraft’s capabilities in high-altitude operations. The Indian Ministry of Defence recently approved an order for 156 of these helicopters for operations at 5,000 meters and above, covering areas along the Himalayan border with China and the Kashmir region with Pakistan. The LCH Prachand is India’s first domestically designed and manufactured attack helicopter, intended for air-to-ground attack roles.</p>

          <p>The liberal, pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, Nicusor Dan, has won the Romanian presidency after a tense race against a right-wing nationalist. George Simion, leader of the far-right AUR party, initially won the first round, fueled by anger over the annulled presidential race. Dan secured victory with 53.6% of the vote, emphasizing the need to build Romania together, irrespective of voting preferences. Romanians are broadly dissatisfied with mainstream parties, and this election followed the collapse of the government after its candidate failed to make the second round.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has uncovered child sexual assault in South Africa's illegal mines. Children are recruited for cheap labor, and others are brought in specifically for sexual exploitation. Miners described instances of older miners forcing young boys to have sex with them, sometimes in exchange for gold. Activists say criminal gangs specifically target children to work in illegal mines across South Africa, with many being abducted from neighboring countries and trafficked.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, is facing criticism after stating that he does not need to buy rice because he receives plenty from supporters, amid soaring rice prices affecting households. Eto's comments were made during a fundraising party, while his ministry is exploring measures to lower rice prices, including releasing government stockpiles. The average rice price has roughly doubled from last year due to a poor harvest.

It also proposes significant spending increases for border security and defense.
