          <p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the administration is confident that recent airstrikes "completely and totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear facilities, specifically mentioning the Fordo site. Leavitt emphasized that the strikes targeted the storage location of Iran's enriched uranium, crucial for nuclear weapon development. She asserted that Iran no longer possesses the capability to construct a nuclear weapon and pose a global threat. The comments come amid questions about the extent of the damage and the fate of the enriched uranium. </p>

Activists from the group recently broke into RAF Brize Norton, spray-painting military planes red to protest the UK's support of Israel in the Gaza war.

          <p>A 31-year-old gunman, Brian Anthony Browning, was fatally shot outside a church in Wayne, Michigan, after opening fire on worshippers; the police stated that Browning's mother is a member of the church. Browning, who had attended services a couple of times in the past year, was wearing a tactical vest and carrying a rifle and handgun when he began shooting. One person was shot in the leg before a parishioner struck the gunman with a pickup truck, and security staff then exchanged gunfire with him. Police found additional weapons and ammunition at Browning's home, and they are investigating a potential mental health crisis as a motive. </p>

          <p>The average price of rice in Japan has fallen below 4,000 yen per 5 kilograms, marking the first time since March, due to increased distribution of stockpiles. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries reported the average price dropped to 3,920 yen per 5 kg during the week ending June 15. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi attributed the price decrease to the government's release of additional rice reserves.

          <p>Iran's parliament has approved a measure to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil trade route, in response to recent U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The decision now rests with the country's national security council, raising concerns about higher energy prices and geopolitical tensions. Experts suggest that closing the strait would alienate Iran's neighbors and trade partners, particularly China, which relies heavily on Iranian oil exports. While the possibility of closure remains minimal, any disruption could significantly impact global oil markets. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>President Trump asserted that "obliteration" is an accurate description of the damage inflicted on Iran's nuclear facilities by recent U.S. strikes. This statement contradicts attempts to downplay the extent of the damage, even though a full assessment is still underway. Gen. Dan Caine reported "severe damage and destruction" to facilities at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. The U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth affirmed that precision munitions struck intended targets with the desired effect. </p>
