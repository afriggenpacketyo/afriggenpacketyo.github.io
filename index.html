          <p>Amy Wadge, Ed Sheeran's co-writer, expressed immense relief after the US Supreme Court rejected an appeal to revive the copyright trial over their hit song *Thinking Out Loud*. Structured Asset Sales (SAS) claimed the song copied Marvin Gaye's *Let's Get It On*, but the court upheld previous rulings in Sheeran's favor, ending a decade-long legal battle. Wadge described the trials as "haunting" and emphasized how the song changed her life, enabling her to achieve significant success at 37. The legal team successfully argued that the similar chord pattern was a common building block in pop music, leading to the court's decision that no reasonable jury could find the songs substantially similar. </p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Donald Trump has dominated international events with his approach to the Iran-Israel conflict. The author suggests Trump tacitly approved Israel's strikes on Iran after Iran failed to engage in serious negotiations regarding its nuclear weapons program within a 60-day window. Trump's strategy involves maintaining "masterful ambiguity" while offering mediation and warning against harming Americans. The author claims Trump's actions have shifted the U.S. position from restraining Israel to supporting its actions against Iran, and he praises Trump's messaging and negotiation tactics. </p>

          <p>An opinion piece discusses the history of the US immigration system, arguing that it was not an original component of US governance but evolved with racist and xenophobic justifications. The author contends that multinational corporations later recognized the value of closed borders in maintaining cheap labor and increasing profits. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is cited as an example of an agreement that facilitated the movement of goods and capital but restricted the movement of workers, creating an imbalance of power. The author criticizes the current system as a "massive grift" that divides communities and subsidizes corporate profits. </p>

          <p>A recent poll indicates increasing public support for Medicaid, even as Republican lawmakers aim to cut $800 billion in federal spending on the program. The KFF poll reveals that 83% of the public views Medicaid favorably, including a significant increase in support from Republican voters. This rise in popularity comes as more people become aware of proposed Republican cuts to Medicaid in the news. The proposed budget bill, which includes these cuts, is significantly less popular than Medicaid itself, with most Americans expressing unfavorable views. </p>

Ronaldo plays for Al-Nassr, Al-Hilal's biggest opponent, and the move would only have been for a short period. The decision was made despite both clubs being controlled by the country's Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Ronaldo's contract expiring at the end of June. Al-Hilal is still looking to reinforce the team for the traditional transfer window after the tournament. </p>

The sustainability of this rebound depends on predictable policies, macro stimulus, and stable US-China relations. China's private sector accounts for a significant portion of the country's GDP and urban employment, but it has faced challenges in recent years due to strict pandemic restrictions and regulatory crackdowns.
