          <p>The United States and Vietnam have finalized a new trade agreement, introducing a 20% tariff on many Vietnamese exports while granting preferential market access for U.S. goods, including large-engine cars. This deal, announced by President Trump, preempts a higher 46% tariff that was imminent. Concerns remain about the interpretation and enforcement of transshipment rules, with the U.S. aiming to levy a 40% tax on third-country goods relabeled in Vietnam. China has cautioned against trade agreements that negatively impact third parties.</p>

          <p>President Trump's sweeping tax and spending legislation is heading for a final vote in the U.S. House of Representatives after passing a key procedural hurdle overnight. The bill, which extends 2017 tax cuts and boosts border security and defense spending, faces opposition from both Democrats and some Republicans concerned about its impact on the national deficit and significant cuts to Medicaid and other social programs. Despite internal party divisions and a projected $3.3 trillion addition to the national debt over a decade, Trump is intensely lobbying holdouts to secure its passage by his Friday deadline.</p>

The Greater Manchester Police have made improvements in handling such allegations, but past failings have led to an "irrecoverable loss of trust" among victims, underscoring the severe impact of these delays on justice.</p>

          <p>Urban heat islands are metropolitan areas significantly hotter than their rural surroundings, primarily due to heat absorption by concrete and asphalt, lack of vegetation, and trapped air from tall buildings. This phenomenon intensifies heatwaves, posing risks to urban populations and exacerbating climate change through increased energy demands for cooling. Solutions include greening cities with trees and parks, implementing "cool roofs" and pavements that reflect sunlight, and adopting practices like water spraying to lower temperatures and promote environmental stability.</p>

          <p>The BRICS bloc, initially comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, has expanded to ten member countries, representing over 40% of the world's population and a third of global economic growth. Leaders are meeting in Rio to strengthen trade and technology exchange, aiming to challenge the US-led global financial systems established after World War II. Despite its growing geopolitical and economic power, the bloc faces internal divisions, economic disparities, and challenges to its "dedollarization" efforts, with some analysts questioning its long-term effectiveness as a cohesive counterweight to the West.</p>
