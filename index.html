            <p>Jamison Wagner, a New Mexico resident, has been arrested and charged with arson for attacks on a Tesla showroom and the Republican Party headquarters in Albuquerque. The Tesla showroom was spray-painted with anti-Elon Musk messages, while the GOP headquarters had "ICE=KKK" graffiti. These incidents are part of a series of criminal cases targeting Tesla properties, which have become controversial due to Elon Musk's involvement with President Trump's policies. Wagner faces federal charges of malicious damage or destruction of property by fire or explosives, reflecting the severity of the alleged crimes and their potential political motivations.</p>

            <p>A group of five small businesses has filed a lawsuit against President Trump, challenging the legality of recently imposed tariffs on foreign imports. The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of International Trade, argues that Trump has overstepped his authority by using trade deficits as justification for emergency tariffs, claiming it usurps Congress' power. The businesses assert that trade deficits do not constitute an emergency or an unusual threat, and that the tariffs are devastating small businesses. The plaintiffs seek a court declaration that the president's actions are illegal and an injunction against the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump is exploring the legality of sending U.S. citizens convicted of crimes to prisons in El Salvador or other countries. During a meeting with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele at the White House, Trump suggested that Bukele should build more prisons to accommodate both Salvadoran and U.S. criminals. Trump stated he was "studying the laws" regarding this possibility, although legal experts have questioned the constitutionality of such a move. The administration has already deported numerous alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador, indicating a broader strategy of leveraging foreign prisons for U.S. law enforcement purposes.</p>

            <p>Shares of automakers experienced a midday surge after President Trump indicated his administration is exploring ways to "help some of the car companies" impacted by his 25% auto tariffs. Trump mentioned that automakers require time to shift production to the U.S. and that his administration is considering measures to ease the transition. Automakers have responded to the tariffs in different ways, including offering temporary deals and ceasing U.S. shipments, while GM has strategically increased some U.S. production.

            <p>President Trump suggested a potential temporary exemption from auto tariffs to allow carmakers sufficient time to overhaul their supply chains and relocate production to the United States. He acknowledged the complexity of the automotive industry's supply chains, which are deeply interwoven with other nations, making fully American-made vehicles nearly impossible. The 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars are expected to significantly increase car prices, potentially by thousands of dollars. This consideration of a pause reflects the administration's awareness of the economic impact of the tariffs and the challenges faced by automakers in complying with the new regulations.

            <p>U.S. stock markets experienced a rise following the White House's announcement that tariffs on Chinese-made smartphones and some other electronics devices would not be applied. The move, however, was followed by President Trump suggesting these goods were simply being moved into a different tariff category. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index saw a 1% increase, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2% and 1.1%, respectively. Apple, which manufactures most of its iPhones in China for U.S. sale, saw its share price jump 5% before settling to 3.8% higher, reflecting investor relief over the tariff news.

            <p>Analysts suggest that President Trump's combination of tariffs and cuts to scientific research are designed to move America down the value chain, rather than up. The tariffs aim to promote industrialization but may primarily direct American production back into industrial inputs, making manufacturing more expensive. Simultaneously, cuts to basic scientific research and specialized government experts threaten to undermine high-tech sectors. The intended outcome appears to be a return to a nostalgic view of the American past, focused on manufacturing and resource extraction rather than advanced technology and innovation.

Industry experts attribute the decline to other states and countries offering more attractive film and TV tax credit programs, prompting productions to move out of California.
