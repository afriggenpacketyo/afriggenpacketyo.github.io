        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have identified a tipping point in Atlantic Ocean atmospheric conditions that caused massive toxic seaweed blooms.  Changes in circulation and wind patterns, starting around 2009, pushed sargassum into warmer waters, leading to significant growth and subsequent beach inundation.  This research highlights the connection between atmospheric changes and harmful algal blooms.</p>
