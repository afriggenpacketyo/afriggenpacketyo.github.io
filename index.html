          <p>England selector Luke Wright has refrained from confirming Ollie Pope's position as the number three batsman for the upcoming Test series against India, despite Pope's recent century. The inclusion of Jacob Bethell in the squad adds another dimension to the selection dilemma, with Bethell having previously batted at number three in New Zealand. Wright emphasized that various factors, including conditions and past performances, will be considered before a final decision is made closer to the match. Bethell's impressive performances, including half-centuries in New Zealand and a recent strong showing against West Indies, have made him a strong contender for the spot. The final lineup will be announced two days before the Test. The presence of depth in the squad is seen as a positive issue for the team. The article suggests the selectors are carefully evaluating all options before making a final decision. The situation is complex and it is not clear who will be selected. The team will have to assess the situation before a final decision is made. The selectors are assessing the situation before a final decision is made. The article does not give investment advice.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has implemented a travel ban, restricting entry to the United States for citizens from twelve countries, citing national security concerns. The affected countries include Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. The proclamation states that these countries lack adequate vetting processes to detect individuals who may pose safety or terrorism threats. Additionally, partial restrictions have been placed on nationals from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela. The policy mirrors a similar travel ban from 2017, which was later rescinded by President Biden in 2021. The new ban is scheduled to take effect on Monday, June 9, and excludes U.S. permanent residents, athletes attending major sporting events, and immediate family members with sufficient evidence of their relationships.</p>

          <p>A Harvard University report indicates that the United States continues to lead China in critical technologies such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, semiconductors, space, and quantum computing. The report attributes the US's competitive edge to significant public and private investment, a skilled and diverse research workforce, and a decentralized innovation ecosystem. While other indexes point to China's leading research output, this report emphasizes the importance of financial resources in quantifying the global tech race. The Critical and Emerging Technologies Index places considerable weight on funding, an area where the US maintains an advantage. The findings suggest that while China is rapidly advancing, the US remains at the forefront of technological innovation. The article does not give investment advice.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth stated that NATO is likely to increase its defense spending target to 5% of member nations' GDP, echoing President Trump's demand. This announcement comes ahead of a larger NATO summit where defense capabilities will be discussed. The 5% target is composed of 3.5% for pure defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure. While defense spending has increased among NATO members since Trump's previous term, some major economies still lag below the 2% GDP threshold. Military analysts emphasize the importance of maintaining defense spending at 5% to address threats from Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. The article does not give investment advice.</p>

          <p>While best friendships can be a source of joy and support for children, experts say they are not essential for healthy development. Children with best friends tend to be less anxious and better at handling rejection, but the pressure to have a best friend can also be stressful. Experts suggest that children need a repertoire of anchors, or supportive relationships, rather than a single best friend. It is important for children to have people they can rely on for different things. Having a strong support system is more important than having a best friend.</p>

          <p>An article discusses the complexities of affirmative action, arguing that while it may have been necessary in the past, it has become unfair in practice. The author notes that affirmative action has been criticized for benefiting those already more fortunate and for fostering resentment among other groups. The author suggests that a class-based system of affirmative action is the only defensible path forward, as it would address structural inequalities while treating all applicants with greater fairness. The article emphasizes the need for policies that promote equal opportunity without relying on racial preferences. The article does not give investment advice.</p>

          <p>An article discusses the increasing presence of religion, specifically Christianity, in public life and the potential impact on American plurality. The author recounts a personal experience of being a Jewish student in a predominantly Catholic school where religious practices were imposed. The article highlights recent events, such as a Christian prayer service led by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth at the Pentagon and legislation in Texas and Oklahoma promoting religious content in schools. The author expresses concern that this aggressive push undermines the notion of American plurality and can make individuals from other faiths feel unwelcome.</p>
