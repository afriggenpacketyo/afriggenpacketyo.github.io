            <p>A Chinese firm is offering its Kuanfu 02B series satellites to countries participating in the Belt and Road Initiative, touting their high performance and low cost. The satellites can cover large urban areas in a single pass due to their 0.5m resolution and 150km swath, making them ten times more efficient than competitors. Weighing only 230kg, the Kuanfu 02B is the lightest of its kind, significantly reducing production and launch expenses. The company has focused on producing high-specification satellites while minimizing costs, weight, and power consumption, aiming to improve large-scale monitoring capabilities.</p>

            <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has temporarily halted the deportation of Venezuelans detained under the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th-century wartime law invoked by the Trump administration. This action follows concerns raised by civil liberties groups that the detainees, accused of being gang members, were not given adequate opportunity to challenge their removal. The ACLU argued that the men were given notices in English despite some only speaking Spanish and were not informed of their right to contest the deportation decision in court. The Supreme Court's order prevents the removal of detainees until further notice, with Justices Thomas and Alito dissenting.</p>

            <p>Economists are concerned that Donald Trump's proposed tariffs could lead to corporate profiteering and rising consumer prices. While inflation has cooled recently, the expectation of new tariffs may give companies an excuse to raise prices beyond actual cost increases. Senator Elizabeth Warren warns that corporations could use tariffs as a cover for "price-gouging." A study on past washing machine tariffs found that prices rose even on domestic machines not subject to the tariffs. Consumers' inflation expectations are also split along political lines, with independents anticipating a sharp rise, suggesting that tariffs could reignite inflationary pressures.

Trump claims this proves Garcia's gang affiliation, despite courts not having made such a determination. Social media users questioned the authenticity of the image, suggesting it was digitally altered. Garcia's wife's social media posts show tattoos on his knuckles but without the "MS-13" lettering. The post came hours after a senator's visit to Garcia in El Salvador, where the senator accused the Salvadoran government of staging a photo opportunity.</p>

            <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a stellar performance, outdueling Jacob deGrom in the Dodgers' 3-0 win over the Rangers. Yamamoto pitched seven scoreless innings with 10 strikeouts, showcasing his evolving repertoire and establishing himself as a potential Cy Young contender. Manager Dave Roberts praised Yamamoto's elevated game and ability to use his entire pitch mix effectively. Despite deGrom's strong outing, Yamamoto's dominance and control of his pitches proved to be the difference, cementing his status as one of the best pitchers in the National League.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court temporarily blocked the removal of Venezuelan detainees accused of being foreign gang members under a wartime law. This action came after the ACLU argued the men were at risk of imminent deportation to an El Salvadoran prison. ACLU lawyers stated that officials at Bluebonnet Detention Facility were telling detainees they would be deported and asked them to sign removal notices. The Trump administration had flown hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador, where they are being held in a mega-prison. The legal battle tests the limits of President Trump's deportation plans and his power.</p>

            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen reported that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, mistakenly deported to El Salvador, has been moved to a new prison with improved conditions but remains traumatized. Van Hollen met with Abrego Garcia and said he was initially blocked by Salvadoran authorities but later facilitated. Despite a Supreme Court order to "facilitate" his return, the Trump administration insists Abrego Garcia, accused of being an MS-13 member, will not return to the US. Van Hollen also highlighted the lack of access to news and communication with the outside world for Abrego Garcia.</p>
