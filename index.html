          <p>The first seven of the final group of Israeli hostages held since October 2023 have been returned as part of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire agreement with Hamas. This initial release is part of a larger prisoner exchange, with additional hostages expected to be freed shortly. The development coincides with former U.S. President Donald Trump's arrival in Israel, where he is scheduled to address the Knesset. This event marks a significant step in the ongoing efforts to de-escalate the two-year conflict in the region.</p>

          <p>In a notable move towards technological self-reliance, China's Ministry of Commerce has begun issuing official documents exclusively in the format of WPS Office, a domestic alternative to Microsoft Office. This is the first time the ministry has diverged from the commonly used Microsoft Word format, requiring users to utilize the Chinese-developed software to access the files directly. The shift is interpreted as another strategic step in the escalating trade and technology rivalry between Beijing and Washington, asserting China's independence from American software ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has formally requested that the prime minister address Parliament regarding the collapsed espionage case against two men accused of spying for China. In a letter, Badenoch highlighted that key questions remain unanswered after the prosecution was dropped, reportedly because the government failed to provide necessary evidence. The situation has drawn criticism from MPs, who accuse the government of weakness and a desire to appease Beijing on a critical national security matter.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has cautioned UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves to avoid directionless and potentially harmful tax increases in the upcoming Budget. The influential think tank argued that while the government needs to raise revenue to meet its fiscal rules, it should focus on bold, systemic reforms rather than simple tax hikes. The IFS specifically recommended overhauling property taxes like stamp duty and council tax, suggesting these changes would be fairer and more beneficial for economic growth.</p>

          <p>China's exports grew 8.3% in September from a year earlier, marking the fastest pace in six months and significantly beating economists' forecasts. Imports also saw a surprisingly strong jump of 7.4%, the largest gain since April 2024, signaling a potential rebound in domestic demand. However, trade with the United States continued to decline sharply, with both exports and imports falling by double digits amid escalating tensions and new tariff threats from Washington.

          <p>More than 150 unvaccinated students from two schools in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, are under a 21-day quarantine after being exposed to measles. The measure comes as a local outbreak has grown to at least eight cases, contributing to the highest number of measles cases reported in the U.S. since 1992. Health officials link the resurgence of the disease to declining MMR vaccination rates, which have fallen below the 95% threshold recommended for community protection, leaving thousands of children vulnerable.</p>
