          <p>Republican lawmakers are proposing a tiered tax on the endowments of wealthy private colleges and universities, aiming to hold accountable what they describe as ‚Äúwoke, elite universities.‚Äù The New York Times article reports that the tax, outlined in a House Ways and Means Committee report, would impact at least 58 schools, including smaller institutions like McPherson College in Kansas, potentially costing them millions annually. The tax rates would be tiered based on endowment size and enrollment, with top rates hitting schools like Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, leading to significant financial losses for these institutions. University officials and industry trade groups are pushing back against the proposal, arguing that endowment funds are crucial for supporting financial aid for students from poor and middle-class backgrounds.</p>

The BBC News article details that Ebid organized the movement of nearly 3,800 migrants from North Africa to Italy between October 2022 and June 2023, some of whom later made their way to Britain. Ebid, who arrived in the UK on a small boat in 2022 and applied for asylum, was found to have ruthlessly exploited desperate individuals for profit, bribing officials and ordering threats of violence towards the migrants. The judge condemned his actions, highlighting the horrifying treatment of migrants and the considerable risk of loss of life involved in the operation.</p>

          <p>Conflict in Thailand's deep south, particularly in the provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani, and Yala, has intensified this year, jeopardizing prospects for lasting peace. According to the DW article, the violence between separatist groups, mainly the Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN), and Thai military forces has seen a resurgence, with attacks targeting civilians. Recent incidents, such as the Sungai Kolok District Office attack and the killing of senior BRN member Abdulroning Lateh, have led to increased troop deployments and renewed discussions of peace talks. Despite these efforts, analysts suggest that the government's actions are more symbolic, and Malaysia's role in facilitating negotiations remains uncertain, with some suggesting that the Thai government should consider the BRN's proposals for negotiation.</p>

          <p>President Trump is meeting with House Republicans to garner support for his budget bill, which faces significant opposition from various factions within the party. According to CBS News, conservatives are pushing for deeper spending cuts and stricter Medicaid work requirements, while moderates are wary of cuts to Medicaid and are demanding changes to the state and local tax deduction (SALT). With House Speaker Mike Johnson needing near-unanimous Republican support to pass the bill, these internal divisions pose a major challenge. The bill, which the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates would add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, must first clear the Rules Committee before a full House vote.</p>

          <p>Home Depot has announced its commitment to maintaining steady prices, contrasting with Walmart's warning of potential price hikes due to tariffs. According to CBS News, Home Depot is collaborating with suppliers to keep prices consistent and shifting production away from China to avoid tariffs. CFO Richard McPhail stated that the company intends to maintain current pricing levels due to its scale and partnerships with suppliers. This decision comes after President Trump criticized Walmart for attributing potential price increases to tariffs. Home Depot aims to further reduce its reliance on China, with plans for no country outside the U.S. to represent more than 10% of its purchases within a year.</p>

          <p>President Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' faces an uphill battle in the House as outstanding issues on state and local tax deductions, Medicaid work requirements, and overall spending remain unresolved, according to Fox News.

The House Rules Committee convened early Wednesday to begin preparing the package for the floor, a process expected to be protracted with numerous amendments proposed. Trump's meeting with Republicans is expected to last about an hour and a half, with the aim of swaying skeptical members to support the bill.</p>

Despite exhaustion and immense losses, Ukrainians express a determination to carry on, relying on allies for support and focusing on self-reliance.

          <p>A recent power outage in Spain and Portugal has ignited debates about the stability of renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind power. According to a DW article, the blackout, believed to be one of Europe's worst, occurred shortly after renewables accounted for around 70% of Spain's electricity production. While some attribute the outage to an overreliance on renewables, experts suggest that grid stability issues are more to blame, pointing to the need for grid systems to adapt to the integration of renewable sources. The article highlights the importance of investing in technologies like synthetic inertia and better battery storage to improve grid stability and ensure a reliable power supply.</p>

Clean-energy advocates seek to preserve tax breaks benefiting Republican-held districts, and state-tax deductors demand a higher cap on state and local tax deductions.

The unpredictability of US trade policy has also dented exporters' confidence, with 42% anticipating a decline in turnover over the next 12 months. While many companies have attempted to mitigate the impact by stockpiling goods, they will eventually need to pass on the tariff costs to consumers if the trade war continues.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a large-scale drone attack on Ukraine following a phone call between Presidents Trump and Putin, despite assurances of upcoming peace talks. According to ABC News, Ukraine's air force reported shooting down 35 of 108 Russian drones, with others neutralized, while Russia claimed to have shot down eight Ukrainian drones. Trump expressed confidence in achieving a peace deal, stating that Putin wants to end the bloodshed.

          <p>President Trump's aggressive trade policies have fractured Western unity and could reshape the global order as allies explore alternatives, according to a veteran Chinese diplomat. Wu Hailong, president of the China Public Diplomacy Association, stated that Trump's global tariff war has worsened conflicts between the US and its partners, shaking the foundation of transatlantic ties. The South China Morning Post reports that fault lines have opened up due to Trump's accusations of allies exploiting US advantages and his sidelining of Europe in talks with Russia, potentially leading US allies to consider fresh options.</p>

          <p>Venture capital firms focused on artificial intelligence are driving much of the growth in the startup market, while companies in other areas are struggling to raise cash, according to a report from Silicon Valley Bank. According to CNBC, about 40% of the total amount raised by U.S. venture funds last year was from funds that list AI as a focus, up from 10% in 2021. Excluding AI investment, there is no meaningful uptick for other companies, with investment from this group essentially flat for the last year. The challenge for the broader market is that exit activity remains tight, and while investors were bullish on Trump's return, the aggressive tariff policy has led to delays in planned IPOs.</p>
