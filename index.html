          <p>Multiple NATO countries, including Denmark, France, and Germany, are deploying additional troops and fighter jets to the alliance's eastern flank. The move comes after Poland reported that over a dozen Russian drones entered its airspace, with some being shot down and others crashing. Warsaw has labeled the incursion a deliberate act, while Moscow denies any intention to target Polish facilities. The incident has heightened regional tensions, prompting the US to reaffirm its commitment to defending all NATO territory and allies to bolster their collective defense posture.</p>

          <p>An opinion article explores the potential return of Cristiano Ronaldo to the United States for the first time in over a decade, coinciding with the upcoming World Cup and the political climate under Donald Trump. The author speculates that a friendly match involving Portugal could signal a clearing of legal and public relations hurdles that have kept the soccer star away, following past allegations of sexual assault. The piece frames Ronaldo's potential reappearance as a significant brand-building opportunity and a symbolic event that aligns with the current political dynamics in the U.S.</p>

          <p>China's military has accused the United States and Britain of provocation after warships from both nations conducted a transit through the Taiwan Strait. Beijing described the mission as an action that undermines regional peace and stability, stating its forces tracked the vessels and remain on high alert. The allied nations characterized the passage as a routine freedom of navigation operation. This event follows a similar transit by Canadian and Australian warships a week prior, which also drew a strong rebuke and warning from the Chinese government.</p>

          <p>A new border demarcation process between Armenia and Azerbaijan, based on Soviet-era maps, has resulted in the construction of a concrete wall that splits the Armenian village of Kirants. This division has caused a political crisis in Armenia and significant disruption for villagers, many of whom lost access to their farmland and received government compensation for property now on the Azerbaijani side. While the wall has reportedly stopped the frequent gunfire that once plagued the village, residents remain anxious about the future and the loss of their land and sense of community.</p>

          <p>The World Athletics Championships in Tokyo have begun under grueling weather conditions, with temperatures reaching 30°C and humidity exceeding 90%. Athletes in the opening 35km race walk described the conditions as "absolutely brutal," with one Japanese competitor collapsing after finishing. Organizers have moved start times for some events earlier to mitigate health risks, as a heatwave is expected to intensify. Despite the challenging weather, the event marks a celebratory return of major sports with spectators to Tokyo, four years after the city hosted a spectator-free Olympic Games.</p>

          <p>Professional golfer John Daly has set a new, undesirable record on the PGA Tour Champions by scoring a 19 on a single par-5 hole during the Sanford International.

This score surpassed the previous tour record for the highest score on a single hole by three strokes. The event is reminiscent of a similar, though less severe, moment in his career in 1998 when he scored an 18 on a hole at the Bay Hill Invitational.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the cultural normalization of the sexual exploitation of underage girls in the 1970s and 80s, citing examples from films, music culture, and the art world. The author, Rebecca Solnit, argues that the recently revealed Jeffrey Epstein birthday album is a relic of an era before feminist movements successfully challenged and began to dismantle these pervasive attitudes. The article posits that feminism was crucial in establishing the concept of active consent and exposing the power imbalances inherent in relationships between adults and children, thereby denormalizing widespread abuse.</p>
