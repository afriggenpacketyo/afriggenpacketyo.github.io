          <p>NHS England has announced plans to establish specialist mental health crisis centers across the country over the next decade to alleviate overcrowding in hospital A&E departments. These walk-in clinics, accessible via GP or police referral, will provide immediate treatment for individuals experiencing acute mental distress. NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey hailed the initiative as a pioneering model for providing the right support in the right setting, while Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, expressed skepticism due to the scheme's untested nature and called for better funding for NHS mental health services. A recent study highlighted the increasing number of people facing long waits in A&E, underscoring the urgency for improved mental health care access.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief has emphasized the bloc's commitment to a trade deal with the United States founded on mutual respect, following threats from US President Donald Trump to impose a 50% tariff on all EU goods. EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic stressed the importance of EU-US trade relations being guided by respect rather than threats. European governments have voiced concerns that higher tariffs would negatively impact both sides, with leaders from Ireland, France, and Germany urging negotiations and de-escalation. Trump expressed impatience with the trade negotiations, stating his intention to raise tariffs on June 1 unless a major European investment is made in the US.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has implemented new regulations mandating that journalists be accompanied by official escorts when accessing most of the Department of Defense's headquarters.

President Donald Trump is scheduled to deliver a commencement address at West Point military academy, marking his first such address since returning to office this year.

A White House official suggested that Trump's endorsement indicates approval of Nippon Steel's acquisition plan for U.S. Steel, despite national security concerns. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have both expressed their support for the partnership.

          <p>Many women are apprehensive about becoming pregnant due to pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a condition affecting up to 8% of women with an average diagnosis wait time of 12 years. Contraception, the primary treatment, poses a dilemma for those wanting children, as discontinuing it can trigger severe anxiety or suicidal thoughts. Women are calling for more research into PMDD to provide treatment options beyond contraception. The Welsh government has allocated £3 million to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and awareness of conditions affecting women, including PMDD.</p>

Despite government warnings about the risks of an aging population and a strained pension system, young workers prefer focusing on current well-being.

Unlike previous generations, these individuals are content with fulfilling the minimum job requirements, unmotivated by praise or performance-related bonuses. A study reveals that 45% of Japanese workers admit to doing the bare minimum, with those in their 20s being the most likely to embrace this approach. This shift reflects a desire for more 'me time' and a rejection of the sacrifices made by their parents' generation, who often prioritized work over personal lives.</p>

          <p>A knife attack at Hamburg's main railway station resulted in injuries to eighteen people, with some sustaining life-threatening wounds. Police arrested a 39-year-old German woman at the scene and believe she acted alone, possibly due to mental distress. The incident occurred between platforms, and some victims were treated inside trains. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed shock and thanked emergency services for their quick response.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government-stockpiled rice directly to retailers to lower prices for consumers amid soaring costs. The goal is to make rice available in stores at 2,000 yen ($14) per 5 kilograms, addressing criticism that the government has failed to curb price spikes. Koizumi is exploring online sales to ensure broad distribution and has engaged with Rakuten Group Inc. for potential collaboration. The average price of rice in supermarkets has reached a record high, prompting the government to release 300,000 tons initially, with potential for additional supplies.</p>

          <p>Germany often prides itself on confronting its Nazi past, yet this vigilance is selective, as highlighted by the Herbert Quandt Media prize, which celebrates the legacy of an early SS supporter who profited from slave labor during the Nazi era. Despite public acknowledgment of the Quandt family's crimes, journalists continue to accept the award, effectively whitewashing a legacy of war crimes. This incident reflects a broader German reluctance to confront the full extent of societal entanglement with state violence and genocide, with many wealthy families having built their empires on Nazi collaboration and forced labor.</p>
