          <h2>Study Suggests Neanderthals Used Advanced Fat Extraction Methods 125,000 Years Ago</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 21:06:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reports that Neanderthals in modern-day Germany were engaged in a sophisticated food preparation process to extract and consume animal fat around 125,000 years ago. Archaeologists discovered clusters of fractured animal bones at a site called Neumark-Nord, which they have termed "fat factories." Researchers believe Neanderthals systematically smashed marrow-rich bones and boiled the fragments to skim the calorie-dense grease from the water's surface. This evidence suggests a high level of resource management and planning, pushing back the timeline for such advanced nutritional strategies by nearly 100,000 years.</p>

          <h2>Critics Decry Connecticut Law Allowing Towing Companies to Sell Towed Vehicles After Only 15 Days</h2>

          <p>A controversial Connecticut law is drawing criticism for allowing towing companies to sell vehicles they have seized just 15 days after towing them. Opponents of the law label it as predatory, arguing that it disproportionately targets working-class and low-income residents who may struggle to pay impound fees quickly. The article highlights the story of a couple who lost their car and details the operations of one company, MyHoopty.com LLC, which residents accuse of aggressively targeting their apartment complexes. The company owner defends his actions as simply enforcing the private property's parking rules.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in rural San Luis Obispo County, dubbed the Madre fire, has rapidly expanded to 70,800 acres, making it the largest blaze in California this year. The fire, which is currently only 10% contained, has prompted evacuation orders for over 200 people and threatens at least 50 structures. Fueled by hot and windy conditions, the fire's cause remains under investigation as more than 600 personnel and dozens of fire engines work to control its spread. This event surpasses the size of other recent deadly fires in the state, highlighting the ongoing and severe wildfire risk.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to some claims, the new tax and spending law does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most recipients. Instead, the legislation introduces a new temporary "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older who fall below certain income thresholds. Policy experts clarify that this deduction applies to a senior's total income, not just their Social Security payments, and it does not alter the fundamental taxation of benefits. The measure offers some relief but primarily benefits higher-income seniors, while potentially increasing financial pressure on the Social Security trust fund. (not investment advice)</p>

The remains have not yet been identified, but officials had previously stated that seven people were unaccounted for following the incident at Devastating Pyrotechnics. The powerful explosion destroyed multiple structures, sparked grass fires, and led to evacuation orders.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared a path for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records from a naval base in Djibouti to South Sudan. The court paused a lower court's injunction that had required the government to provide the men a chance to contest their removal over fears of torture or death. This ruling is a significant victory for the administration's policy of deporting migrants to third-party countries that are not their places of origin.

          <p>New research indicates that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are "unsung heroes" in the fight against climate change, locking away vast amounts of carbon in the deep ocean. These animals feast on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface in Antarctica before migrating deep underwater, where they burn their fat reserves, effectively sequestering the carbon for centuries. Scientists calculate this process removes as much carbon from the atmosphere as the annual emissions of 55 million cars, a far greater amount than previously understood. The discovery highlights the critical but often overlooked role of these creatures in regulating the global climate.</p>

This scheme has allowed them to steal millions of pounds and commit significant inheritance tax fraud.

          <p>President Trump has signed a major tax-and-spending package into law, marking a significant legislative achievement for his administration. The bill makes many of the 2017 tax cuts permanent while also introducing deep cuts to federal safety-net programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which provides food assistance. Additionally, it allocates approximately $170 billion to enhance immigration enforcement, supporting the administration's mass deportation goals. While proponents celebrate the economic implications, critics condemn the legislation for benefiting the wealthy at the expense of low-income families and expanding controversial immigration policies.

          <p>Germany began its Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory over Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. While the win was a positive start, the team's performance was marred by an injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the pitch in tears after a knee injury in the first half. Given Gwinn's history with two previous ACL injuries, her availability for the rest of the tournament is now in serious doubt, casting a shadow over the victory. The team was also noted as being wasteful in front of goal, suggesting they will need to be more clinical against tougher group stage opponents.</p>

          <p>A new executive order signed by President Donald Trump will implement significant changes at U.S. national parks, including charging higher entry fees for international visitors. The order states that any revenue from these increased fees will fund infrastructure improvements. Additionally, the directive gives U.S. residents preferential treatment in park access lotteries. In a separate but related move, the order also revokes a 2017 memorandum that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts in the management and storytelling within the national park system, aligning with the administration's broader move to end government DEI programs.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart attacks has shared advice on five "toxic" foods he avoids feeding his own children to promote lifelong health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts and sugary cereals for their high sugar content, and processed meats like hot dogs because of sodium and nitrates. He also warns against deep-fried foods, which contain inflammatory compounds. Instead, he recommends alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fresh fruit, lean proteins, and using an air fryer to achieve a healthy crunch, emphasizing a proactive approach to nutrition.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team narrowly defeated India by five runs in a dramatic T20 match at The Oval, keeping the series alive. Chasing 172, India needed six runs off the final ball, but England seamer Lauren Bell secured the win by dismissing India's captain. England's innings was a story of two extremes, with a massive opening partnership of 137 followed by a stunning collapse of nine wickets for just 31 runs. Despite a chaotic fielding performance with multiple dropped catches, a crucial bowling spell from Lauren Filer turned the game back in England's favor, setting up a tense finish.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is currently withholding $715 million in grant funding designated for adult education programs across the United States. This move has left numerous programs, which collectively serve over a million students annually, in a state of uncertainty and scrambling to find solutions. These programs provide essential services such as literacy education, high school equivalency preparation, and job training skills to adult learners. The delay in funding distribution threatens the operational stability of these vital community resources and the educational progress of the students who depend on them.</p>

          <p>In a spectacular performance against India, England's Jamie Smith scored 184 not out, registering the highest-ever Test score by an England wicketkeeper. This epic innings, achieved just a year after his debut, surpassed the record held by his mentor, Alec Stewart, and solidified his role as an aggressive and powerful number seven batsman. The 24-year-old's rapid rise and ability to dominate attacks have drawn comparisons to Australian legend Adam Gilchrist. While still early in his career, Smith's talent and impact suggest he has the potential to become one of England's greatest-ever wicketkeeper-batters.</p>
