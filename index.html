        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, Israel accused Iran of violating the agreement by launching more missiles. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz instructed the IDF to continue attacking Tehran to thwart regime targets, while Iran denied launching missiles after the ceasefire took effect. An Iranian missile struck Beersheba, killing four and wounding 20, and sirens later sounded in northern Israel due to additional missiles. The ceasefire agreement was brokered with the help of Qatar, following escalating conflict and U.S. military action against Iran's nuclear program, resulting in at least 974 deaths.</p>

          <p>Spanish authorities are investigating the discovery of multiple bodies in the Mediterranean Sea with their hands and feet bound. Police suspect the victims may be migrants from North Africa, potentially thrown into the sea by smugglers due to disputes. Regional president Marga Prohens described the discovery as revealing the "cruelest side" of irregular migration routes. While most Europe-bound migrants arrive in Spain via the Canary Islands, hundreds attempt the shorter crossing from North Africa to the Balearic archipelago, where 31 bodies have been found this year. The UN recorded 8,542 migrant deaths worldwide in 2023, with 37% occurring in the Mediterranean.</p>

Such parades have become more frequent under Xi Jinping, reflecting a shift in China’s defense strategy and foreign policy towards greater assertiveness. This demonstration of military might comes amid intensified geopolitical rivalry, especially with the United States, signaling China's ambition to modernize its military and play a more prominent role on the global stage.</p>

          <p>Moira Donegan argues that the Democratic establishment's support for Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral race represents a concerning trend of imitating Trump's vulgar and combative style. Donegan describes Cuomo as a "Democratic Trump," highlighting his alleged abusiveness towards women, indifference to corruption, and vengeful nature. She criticizes Democratic leaders for abandoning decency and squandering the talents of other candidates like Zohran Mamdani and Brad Lander. The endorsement of Cuomo signals a moral failure and a lack of imagination within the Democratic party, as they seemingly prioritize masculine bullies over principled leadership.</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who resigned amid sexual harassment allegations, is now a frontrunner in the New York City mayoral race.

Cuomo's campaign is heavily funded by wealthy donors, including Michael Bloomberg, and he emphasizes his experience and promises to address crime and affordable housing. However, Mamdani criticizes Cuomo's record and the allegations that led to his resignation, while Cuomo claims the complaints were political.</p>

          <p>Huawei Technologies continues to face challenges in advancing to the 5-nanometer chip manufacturing process, according to an analysis of its latest laptop hardware. The MateBook Fold Ultimate Design laptop features Huawei’s Kirin X90 system-on-a-chip (SoC), manufactured by SMIC using its 7-nm process node. This finding dampens speculation that Huawei had made the leap to SMIC’s 5-nm process, which is difficult to scale due to US sanctions. Huawei's slow progress in securing 5-nm chips means the company is multiple generations behind its US rivals.</p>

          <p>A recent statement from the Trump White House touting its success in pushing up “blue-collar wage growth” is being questioned for its methodology and accuracy. The statement claimed the largest increase in nearly 60 years under Trump, but economists argue that the data is cherry-picked and misleading. The gains cited may reflect the strength of the Biden economy, and Trump's policies have not demonstrably produced wage gains on this scale. The administration's claims about manufacturing and immigration are also dubious, raising concerns about the reliability of economic data.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance is facing criticism for misnaming Senator Alex Padilla as "José" during a press conference, which is viewed as a derogatory slur against Latinos. The incident occurred after Padilla was detained at a federal building for questioning Homeland Security head Kristi Noem. Critics argue that Vance's remark perpetuates a history of using Spanish first names as catchall slurs against Latinos. The incident highlights ongoing concerns about anti-Latino sentiment and the dehumanization of Mexican individuals.</p>

          <p>A German court has lifted a government ban on a far-right magazine, ruling that the case against it didn't meet the high legal bar required to outlaw its publisher. The court stated that Germany's constitution guarantees freedom of the press and opinion, even for enemies of freedom. The court also said that a ban could only be justified if the publisher's anti-constitutional activities were proven to be “formative” for the group, and a review of the evidence did not reach that threshold. The magazine has been criticized for disseminating antisemitic, anti-minority, and conspiracy theory content.</p>
