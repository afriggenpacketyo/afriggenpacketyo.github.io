          <p>During the 250th-anniversary parade in Washington, the US Army showcased its autonomous and intelligent combat technology with robot dogs, also known as quadruped unmanned ground vehicles (Q-UGVs). The US Marine Corps also utilizes robot dogs for patrol and reconnaissance, particularly in dangerous missions such as explosives detection. China has also invested heavily in Q-UGVs for various operations by the Peopleâ€™s Liberation Army. These unmanned autonomous systems offer advantages over unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wheeled unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in urban combat, as UAVs struggle indoors and UGVs have difficulty with obstacles.</p>

          <p>Dame Louise Casey is advocating for a newly announced inquiry into grooming gangs to serve as a "national reset" on the issue. Her report on group-based child sexual abuse in England and Wales led to Sir Keir Starmer's announcement of a new national inquiry. Casey emphasized the need for openness to scrutiny and change from those providing evidence. She also addressed the ethnicity of perpetrators, urging caution in interpreting data and highlighted the disproportionate involvement of individuals of Asian heritage in child sexual exploitation cases, while child abuse cases are not disproportionate and often involve white men. </p>

          <p>Consumer spending in the U.S. experienced a sharp decline in May, with retail sales falling by 0.9%, exceeding economists' expectations of a 0.6% drop, according to the Commerce Department. This decrease, following a 0.1% decline in April, reflects growing consumer unease over tariffs and geopolitical tensions. Notable decreases were seen in building materials, gasoline stations, and auto sales, while online sales and furniture stores saw increases. Despite surveys indicating improved consumer sentiment, the ongoing trade war has impacted consumer and business optimism. (not investment advice)</p>

Officials said Boelter impersonated a police officer, surveilled his victims, and compiled notes about them.

          <p>Gambling advertisements are increasingly prevalent in Brazilian football, exceeding levels in other major leagues, which has led to financial and mental health implications. A DW analysis reveals that six out of ten advertising boards during the 2024 Brazilian football league season displayed gambling ads, rising to seven in ten during the final match day. This surge has led to increased gambling addiction, particularly among lower-income Brazilians. While Brazil legalized online gambling in 2018, it only began legislating against its harms in 2025, prompting discussions about stricter advertising regulations to protect vulnerable individuals.</p>

          <p>Retail sales in the U.S. experienced a sharp decline in May, attributed to consumers pulling back after increased spending in March to avoid anticipated tariffs. Sales at retail stores and restaurants decreased by 0.9%, following a 0.1% decline in April, with a significant drop in auto sales due to President Trump's tariffs on imported cars and car parts. While consumer confidence has declined, low unemployment and cooling inflation could support steady spending in the coming months.

          <p>According to China expert William Figueroa, China lacks the capability for power projection in the Middle East, but the Iran-Israel conflict poses a risk to China's energy security. China has accused President Trump of "pouring oil" on the conflict and called for de-escalation. Figueroa believes China will maintain its approach of supporting regionally initiated efforts, acting as a facilitator for negotiations. While China is diplomatically supportive of the Palestinian cause, it is unlikely to weaponize its economic relationships with Iran to influence the conflict's outcome.</p>

          <p>President Trump denied reports that his early departure from the G7 summit in Canada was to work on an Israel-Iran ceasefire, suggesting his focus was on something "much bigger." Trump stated that he was seeking an "end" to the conflict, not just a ceasefire, and hinted at the possibility of Iran "giving up entirely." He reiterated that "IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON" and suggested that it might be safer for residents to evacuate Tehran. While not ruling out U.S. involvement, Trump indicated he might consider sending Vice President JD Vance and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff to meet with the Iranians.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated a potential escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict, stating his early departure from the G7 summit was due to "much bigger" issues than a ceasefire. The G7 leaders affirmed support for Israel's right to defend itself while calling for a resolution to escalating tensions in the Middle East. Trump urged Iranian civilians to "immediately evacuate Tehran," and reiterated that "Iran should have signed the deal I told them to sign." Israel claimed to have eliminated Ali Shadmani, identified as Iran's "war-time" chief of staff, further signaling the conflict's intensification.</p>

          <p>The pharmaceutical industry believes that antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) could eventually replace chemotherapy in certain cancer treatments, reducing harsh side effects. ADCs deliver chemotherapy directly to cancer cells, sparing healthy cells, unlike traditional chemotherapy. Companies like AstraZeneca, Daiichi Sankyo, Pfizer, and Merck are investing billions in developing ADCs, with some showing promise in specific settings. However, experts note that refining these treatments and identifying the right cancer-causing proteins and payloads are essential for broader application.</p>

The train, a new type that debuted last year, stopped in Tochigi Prefecture, forcing two other trains to halt. Passengers on the halted trains were transferred or returned to Utsunomiya Station, where temperatures reached 35.0 C. The railway operator conducted on-site repairs, and the defective train was able to travel to Nasushiobara Station at around 4 p.m.</p>

          <p>A study by the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) reveals that one in four immigrants in Germany is considering leaving, citing economic factors and discrimination. Skilled immigrants with higher education and economic success are more likely to consider leaving, posing a risk to Germany's skilled labor force. Family reasons, better career opportunities, higher earnings, high taxes, and experiences of discrimination contribute to the decision to emigrate. The political atmosphere in Germany, dominated by debates on migration, also plays a deterrent role.</p>

The Trump Organization stated that the phone will be "built in the United States," but analysts suggest it was designed and would be manufactured by a Chinese firm. Experts cite the lack of local manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. as a major obstacle, noting that the phone would likely be produced by a Chinese original device manufacturer (ODM).</p>
