          <p>Shares for fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters surged after the company credited its marketing collaborations with celebrities Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce for driving strong sales. Despite a minor sales dip in the previous quarter, the company now projects low single-digit growth, citing an uptick in customer engagement following the viral ad campaigns. One campaign featuring Sweeney generated significant online debate but also led to her signature jeans selling out within a week, showcasing the high impact of the celebrity endorsements on the brand's performance.</p>

She credits her ability to bounce back to a mental health break from the sport, which allowed her to approach the rematch with a positive and fearless attitude, leading to a 6-4, 6-3 win.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has formally appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court after a federal appeals court ruled that its global "reciprocal tariffs" are illegal. The lower court determined that President Trump overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the levies, stating that the power to implement tariffs is constitutionally vested in Congress. The administration argues the ruling undermines the president's ability to conduct foreign policy and protect national security, setting the stage for a major legal battle over executive power.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has voided the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in research grants to Harvard University, labeling the action an illegal and "ideologically-motivated assault." The ruling found that the administration unlawfully retaliated against Harvard for refusing to alter its academic and diversity programs, using concerns about antisemitism as a pretext. The freeze had halted numerous critical research projects, including studies on tuberculosis and support for veterans, and the White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has denounced reports of potential White House interference in the city's election as an "affront to our democracy." The criticism follows a New York Times report that President Trump's advisers discussed offering administration jobs to his opponents, Mayor Eric Adams and Curtis Sliwa, to clear the electoral field. Mamdani asserted that the news reveals a corrupt attempt to subvert the will of voters and declared that the city's leadership is not for sale to be decided by backroom deals in Washington, D.C.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll shows that Americans continue to hold a negative view of the national economy, with most describing its current state as "uncertain" and "struggling." The primary driver behind this sentiment is the perception of rising prices, with two-thirds of respondents stating that prices are still increasing and expecting them to continue to do so. These persistent concerns about inflation are closely linked to negative ratings of personal financial situations, and a majority of Americans believe the economy is getting worse.

This has created a conflict with House Speaker Mike Johnson, who advocates for a more limited investigation through the Oversight Committee, a path Massie has dismissed as a "placebo."</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates has issued a stern warning that any Israeli move to annex the occupied West Bank would be a "red line" that would severely damage regional relations. A senior Emirati official emphasized that such an action would undermine the spirit of the 2020 Abraham Accords, which normalized ties between the two nations, and would be the "death knell" for the two-state solution. The statement came in response to a proposal by Israel's far-right finance minister to apply Israeli sovereignty over large portions of the Palestinian territory.</p>
