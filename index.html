          <p>London's annual Notting Hill Carnival has commenced, transforming the streets of west London into a spectacle of vibrant colors and lively sounds. The festivities began early with the J'ouvert celebration, followed by the children's parade featuring musicians and dancers in bright costumes. This event, Europe's largest street party, is expected to attract over a million people throughout the Bank Holiday weekend, embodying a rich tradition rooted in Jamaican culture and reggae music. Organizers have scheduled a 72-second silence each day to honor the 72 lives lost in the Grenfell Tower fire, as well as those who have passed away at Carnival in recent years and Kelso Cochrane, whose 1959 murder helped catalyze the event.</p>

          <p>Former CIA Director David Petraeus expressed skepticism regarding an imminent meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stating that Putin remains the primary impediment to peace in Ukraine. Petraeus asserted that Russia shows no intention of ending the conflict without territorial concessions, which Ukraine is unlikely to grant. He advocated for the U.S. to lift restrictions on certain weapons for Ukraine, seize frozen Russian assets, and impose further sanctions to alter the conflict's dynamics. The article also touches on recent military officer removals within the Trump administration, a move Petraeus finds concerning due to its unprecedented nature.</p>

          <p>Nigerian authorities confirmed the rescue of 76 hostages, many of them children, from a "bandit" camp in Katsina state following precision airstrikes. This operation is part of a broader strategy to dismantle criminal networks responsible for widespread killings, kidnappings, and extortion that have plagued innocent citizens in remote areas for years. The rescued individuals are believed to be part of a group taken during a mosque assault last week that tragically killed 50 people. Despite ongoing efforts by President Bola Tinubu, the region continues to face significant challenges from these criminal groups and Islamist extremist militias, alongside an uptick in clashes between farmers over access to vital land and water resources.</p>

          <p>Jerry Adler, a respected actor widely recognized for his memorable roles as Hesh Rabkin in "The Sopranos" and Howard Lyman in "The Good Wife," has passed away peacefully in his sleep at the age of 96. Born in Brooklyn, New York, Adler initially forged a successful career on Broadway as a stage manager, producer, and director for several decades before embarking on his acting journey later in life. His onscreen career gained significant momentum in the 1990s, notably after a role in "The Public Eye" and a subsequent collaboration with "Sopranos" writer David Chase, which led to his iconic six-season run. Adler is celebrated for his enduring contributions to entertainment and is survived by his four daughters.</p>

          <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated unequivocally that no meeting between President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is currently planned, directly refuting earlier suggestions by former U.S. President Donald Trump. Lavrov indicated that Putin is only prepared to meet once a comprehensive summit agenda is fully prepared, which he claims is not ready at all. These comments cast significant doubt on Trump's ability to broker a peace deal between the two warring nations, especially as Russia continues its missile strikes on Ukraine, including a recent attack that hit a U.S.-owned electronics factory. The article highlights the ongoing diplomatic impasse and continued hostilities despite peace overtures.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused President Donald Trump of "manufacturing a crisis" to justify sending federalized National Guard troops into Chicago, bypassing local leaders. Jeffries, a New York Democratic congressman, criticized Trump for "playing games with the lives of Americans" through unprecedented domestic military deployments, which have expanded to include armed troops in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker also condemned Trump's actions as an abuse of power, asserting that the state has made no request for federal intervention and that any such deployment would be illegal. This political dispute underscores growing tensions over federal authority and states' rights.</p>

Residents in the central provinces of Thanh Hoa, Quang Tri, Hue, and Da Nang have been directed to leave their homes, with flights cancelled and boats ordered to remain ashore for safety. Forecasters predict the storm will bring winds of up to 200km/h and 300-400mm of rain, along with dangerous storm surges of 2-4m (6.6-13ft), as it moves inland. Authorities have deployed soldiers to assist with the evacuations, fearing the storm could be as devastating as Typhoon Yagi last year, which tragically killed hundreds across the region.</p>

          <p>US sanctions against China's nuclear power industry, including blacklisting China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN) and suspending equipment licenses, have inadvertently backfired, according to an exclusive article. Instead of hindering, these measures have spurred China to achieve advanced capabilities and incredible industrial scale in nuclear energy. With the US and Europe facing costly delays and atrophied supply chains in their own nuclear expansions, China's sanctioned industry has become an unattainable benchmark of efficiency. Its exclusion now threatens to stall the West's atomic energy revival, highlighting the complex geopolitical dynamics and the need for global cooperation in the industry.</p>

          <p>The article details how the U.S. space industry has become increasingly dependent on Elon Musk's SpaceX, now valued at around $400 billion. Initially struggling, SpaceX was saved by a $1.6 billion NASA Commercial Resupply Services contract in 2008, followed by a $2.6 billion contract for astronaut transport. Today, SpaceX dominates launch services, conducting 134 orbital launches in 2024, accounting for 83% of all spacecraft launched. Its Dragon capsule and Falcon 9 rocket are primary for ISS missions, while Starlink satellites provide crucial internet access, and Starship is key for moon plans, underscoring its indispensable role.</p>

The article argues that economic pragmatism, while present, is ultimately being outweighed by an "immovable priority: foundational security." Even with significant EU-China trade relationships and climate deals, allies instinctively safeguard their vital US intelligence-sharing pacts and defense commitments. Their discontent manifests as diplomatic appeals for restraint, rather than outright support for China-led confrontation, suggesting that the fundamental gap between Beijing's global ambition and geopolitical reality remains unbridgeable due to these deep-seated security concerns.</p>
