          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief serving a 30-year sentence for murder and sexual assault, was recaptured after escaping from an Arkansas prison. Hardin escaped on May 25 by impersonating a corrections officer, prompting a manhunt involving local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. He was apprehended approximately 1.5 miles west of the Calico Rock North Central Unit after tracking dogs picked up his scent. Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders thanked law enforcement for their efforts in bringing the search to a peaceful conclusion, highlighting the assistance from a U.S. Border Patrol tactical unit. His capture brings relief to the community, especially after the Stone County Sheriff expressed fears that Hardin might harm someone. The optimism score is unrelated to the events that transpired.</p>

          <p>Sunny Jacobs, who became a celebrity after being freed from death row, has died at the age of 77. Jacobs, along with her husband and a friend, was wrongly convicted of murdering two police officers in 1976 and spent 17 years in prison before being exonerated. Her story gained widespread attention and was adapted into an Off Broadway play and television movies. However, an investigator later questioned the accuracy of her story in a 2021 book, casting doubt on some of the details surrounding her case and conviction. Jacobs' experience highlighted the flaws in the justice system and the challenges faced by wrongfully convicted individuals.</p>

          <p>Walmart is implementing new strategies to attract younger shoppers amidst rising tariffs and economic uncertainty. These efforts include a fresh advertising campaign, a new clothing brand designed for tweens called Weekend Academy, and the expansion of drone deliveries to 100 stores in three states. The company aims to gain market share by offering better items and more convenience to value-conscious shoppers across income levels. Walmart CFO John David Rainey noted that tariffs have not changed consumer spending patterns, with shoppers spending more on groceries and less on discretionary items. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon defended the decision to announce price increases due to tariffs, emphasizing the company's responsibility to communicate with shareholders.</p>

          <p>Matthew Smith, co-founder and chief executive of Fortify Rights, is suing the Trump administration over an executive order imposing sanctions on the International Criminal Court (ICC). The order targets the ICC's chief prosecutor and prohibits providing services to the prosecutor's office, which Smith argues infringes on his First Amendment rights. Fortify Rights, which investigates atrocities in Asia, including crimes against humanity in Myanmar, routinely shares evidence with the ICC. Smith, represented by the ACLU, argues the order chills human rights work and obstructs the pursuit of international justice over severe crimes. The lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of the executive order and its impact on human rights organizations.</p>

          <p>Five members of the Proud Boys, including Enrique Tarrio, are suing the U.S. government for $100 million, alleging their constitutional rights were violated during prosecutions related to the January 6 Capitol attack. The lawsuit claims the FBI and DOJ engaged in evidence tampering, witness intimidation, and violations of attorney-client privilege to punish political allies of President Trump. Four of the men were convicted of seditious conspiracy but later pardoned or had their sentences commuted by President Trump after he took office this year. The suit argues that the government lacked probable cause to raid their homes and that they were convicted under a novel and legally unsound theory of criminal conspiracy.</p>

One attorney described a family with a U.S. citizen child spending the night in the basement despite the father having a stay of removal. ICE refuted the assertions, stating they treat those in custody with dignity, while DHS said those arrested had final orders of removal and had not complied.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native mistakenly deported to El Salvador, has been returned to the United States to face charges of illegally transporting migrants. A federal grand jury indicted Abrego Garcia for allegedly participating in a years-long conspiracy to transport undocumented migrants from Texas to the interior of the country. Attorney General Pam Bondi thanked El Salvador's president for agreeing to return Abrego Garcia, who is alleged to have made over 100 trips, including transporting MS-13 members. His attorney called the charges an abuse of power, while a high-ranking federal prosecutor resigned over concerns the case was politically motivated.

          <p>Tesla's stock price plummeted after a public feud erupted between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. The dispute began when Musk criticized Trump's spending bill, leading to a social media war of words and threats of canceled government contracts. The fallout resulted in a 14% drop in Tesla shares, wiping out approximately $152 billion in value and significantly decreasing Musk's net worth. This conflict jeopardizes Tesla's relationship with the Trump administration, potentially impacting future regulations, investigations, and government support. The company already faced challenges, including declining revenue and increased competition, making the Musk-Trump breakup particularly damaging. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Yoga classes have resumed at San Diego beaches after a federal appeals court ruled that a city ordinance restricting such activities was unconstitutional, affirming that teaching yoga is protected speech. The court sided with two instructors who sued over a 2024 law banning yoga classes of four or more people at shoreline parks and beaches. The city argued the rule targeted commercial activity, as the instructors' free classes drew donations. One instructor, who had been cited multiple times, resumed teaching classes, emphasizing that outdoor yoga is a service for those who are disabled or cannot afford classes elsewhere.

U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli warned of a legal challenge if the measures impeded the use of domestic energy resources. Environmental advocates supported the measure, while Southern California Gas and others argued it would make gas appliances less affordable and strain the electrical grid. The proposed rules aimed to phase in zero-emission heating equipment, displacing gas-powered units and reducing smog-forming emissions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed executive orders intended to bolster America's drone industry, enhance airspace security, and improve military readiness. The orders seek to restrict foreign drone manufacturers, particularly Chinese companies like DJI and Autel Robotics, from selling new models in the US. Trump stated that foreign-made drones endanger the public and compromise critical infrastructure, necessitating immediate action. The directives also call for federal investment in US drone production to revive a domestic sector overshadowed by Chinese competition. These measures expand on previous efforts to limit drones linked to foreign adversaries, reflecting growing concerns in Washington regarding Chinese drone dominance in the US market.</p>

          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a nonpartisan agency, is facing criticism from Republicans over its projections that their signature legislation would increase federal deficits. The CBO was established in 1974 to provide Congress with objective analysis of the budgetary impacts of proposed bills, acting as a counterbalance to the executive branch's Office of Management and Budget. Critics argue the CBO's estimates are inaccurate, while supporters maintain the agency provides fair and objective assessments, given the difficulty of predicting future economic outcomes. The CBO's work is advisory, and it makes no policy recommendations, leaving it up to lawmakers to decide how to use the information provided.</p>
