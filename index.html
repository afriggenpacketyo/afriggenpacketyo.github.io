        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass the necessary appropriations bills to fund federal agencies, forcing them to cease all non-essential operations. This is mandated by the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits the government from spending money without congressional authorization. While essential services related to protecting life and property continue, hundreds of thousands of federal employees are either furloughed or work without pay until funding is restored. The current impasse stems from a partisan disagreement over healthcare provisions and presidential funding authority.</p>

          <p>A prolonged government shutdown could significantly disrupt air travel across the United States, even though most Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) employees are deemed essential. These workers are required to report for duty without pay, which in past shutdowns has led to increased sick calls and staff shortages. Such labor shortages can result in longer security lines, flight delays, and cancellations. The U.S. Travel Association warns that a shutdown could cost the travel economy $1 billion per week and halt the hiring of new air traffic controllers.</p>

          <p>During the government shutdown, all active-duty U.S. military personnel are required to continue their service, but their pay will be delayed until a funding agreement is reached. While Congress has previously passed legislation to ensure troops are paid during shutdowns, a similar bill for this year did not pass in time. Some financial institutions that serve the military community, such as Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA, plan to offer no-interest loans to affected service members. Essential civilian Defense Department employees will also work without immediate pay, while others will be furloughed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military has conducted another strike in the Caribbean Sea, destroying a vessel allegedly operated by the Tren de Aragua criminal organization and killing six people on board. This marks the tenth such operation since early September as part of the Trump administration's campaign against drug trafficking. The strikes have drawn criticism from members of Congress, including both Democrats and Republicans, who have raised concerns about their legality and the president's authority to order them without congressional approval. Some observers believe the operations may also be intended to apply military pressure on Venezuela's government.</p>

          <p>The government shutdown is expected to have a minimal impact on most conventional mortgages but could cause delays for borrowers seeking government-backed loans. Agencies like the FHA and VA will continue to process most loans, but furloughs may slow the timeline. A more significant issue could arise for government-sponsored entities like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which may face bottlenecks in verifying tax transcripts if the IRS is closed. Additionally, homebuyers in flood zones may face delays as the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program cannot issue new policies during a shutdown.</p>

          <p>Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients will continue to receive their monthly payments during the government shutdown, as the program's funding is mandatory and not subject to annual appropriation battles.

Non-essential services such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and issuing replacement Medicare cards will be halted. Furthermore, the shutdown could delay the release of key inflation data, which in turn might postpone the annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA).</p>

          <p>U.S. consumer confidence fell for the third straight month in October, according to the University of Michigan's sentiment index, indicating a dimming economic outlook among Americans. The decline is primarily driven by persistent inflation and a weakening labor market, with lower to middle-income households expressing the most concern over job and income prospects. Inflation expectations also increased slightly, showing that high prices remain a top concern for consumers. The report noted that the ongoing government shutdown has had a surprisingly minimal cited impact on the economic outlook of those surveyed.</p>

This article provides a historical look at previous shutdowns, which have ranged from a single day to the record 35-day lapse in 2018-2019. Past funding battles have been waged over issues such as spending cuts under President Reagan, budget balancing under President Clinton, and disputes over healthcare and immigration under Presidents Obama and Trump.

          <p>The trial of 23-year-old activist Zoe Rosenberg is underway in California, where she faces felony conspiracy and other charges for removing four chickens from a truck outside a Petaluma Poultry slaughterhouse. Her defense argues that her actions constituted an "open rescue" of animals in distress, not theft of property. The case brings to the forefront the legal and ethical debate championed by the group Direct Action Everywhere, which questions whether it is a crime to rescue a suffering animal from a factory farm, challenging the legal status of animals as property.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Centrist Parties Strengthen Far-Right by Adopting Their Rhetoric</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from the Berlin Social Science Center suggests that mainstream centrist parties, both on the left and right, unintentionally strengthen far-right parties when they adopt their anti-immigration rhetoric. Researchers argue that this strategy backfires by legitimizing the far-right's core issues and bringing their ideas from the fringe into the mainstream political debate. Instead of winning over voters, this approach tends to increase the visibility and appeal of the very parties the centrists are trying to combat, a trend observed across several European countries.</p>

The company noted a "K-shaped" trend where higher-income shoppers buy in bulk while lower-income consumers stretch products to their limit.

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index rose to a 3.0% annual rate in September, a figure that was slightly lower than economists' forecasts. The long-delayed report, released amid the government shutdown, showed that a monthly jump in gasoline prices was a major contributor, while core inflation remained more muted. The softer-than-expected inflation data is widely seen as giving the Federal Reserve more justification to proceed with an anticipated interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting, as it continues to prioritize concerns over a slowing labor market.

The witness, deputy national security adviser Matthew Collins, stated he made the change because calling China an "enemy" did not reflect the official government policy under the Conservatives at the time. This is a critical detail, as a prosecution under the Official Secrets Act required proving that information was passed to an "enemy," and the revelation now shifts focus onto the previous government's role in the case's failure.</p>
