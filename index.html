        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors have formally announced their intention to seek the death penalty for Luigi Mangione, accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. The prosecution argues that Mangione, motivated by an ideological message against the health insurance industry, deliberately killed Thompson to incite resistance. Mangione's lawyer has criticized the decision as barbaric, accusing the government of defending a corrupt healthcare system. Thompson was shot outside a hotel in December, and Mangione, who pleaded not guilty to state charges, is awaiting trial in a New York prison.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth reportedly had an unsecured internet connection installed in his office to bypass Pentagon security filters and use the Signal app on a personal device, raising concerns about potential security breaches. Defense Department computers use separate networks for classified and unclassified information, and Hegseth's use of an alternative line could have exposed sensitive data to hacking or surveillance. This revelation follows earlier reports that Hegseth and other officials used Signal to discuss sensitive military operations, including strikes on Yemen. The Pentagon has confirmed that Hegseth has never used Signal on his government computer.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to expedite deep-sea mining, seeking to reduce U.S. dependence on China for critical minerals. The order aims to fast-track permits for mining nickel, copper, and rare earth elements from the seabed in both U.S. and international waters. Advocates claim deep-sea mining could be a lucrative industry, while critics warn of potential environmental damage and ecosystem destruction. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) is working to establish regulations for deep-sea mining by the end of 2025, a timeline that Trump's order may preempt.</p>

Authorities stated that initial evidence suggests the crime was unrelated to her activism, but the Guerreros Buscadores are calling for a thorough investigation.

          <p>The Trump administration has issued a controversial executive order to accelerate deep-sea mining, aiming to establish the U.S. as a leader in responsible seabed mineral exploration. The move bypasses ongoing UN negotiations on mining in international waters and has drawn criticism from China and environmental groups. While the administration estimates deep-sea mining could significantly boost the U.S. economy, environmentalists and scientists express concerns about potential harm to undiscovered deep-sea species. One mining company, The Metals Company (TMC), has already applied for permits in international waters.</p>

          <p>Greg Grandin argues that Latin America provides inspiration for resisting authoritarianism, despite its history of coups and dictatorships. The region's democratic spirit is vital, with social democrats advocating for economic and social rights. Latin America has consistently defended these principles against interventionism and power politics. Grandin contrasts this with the timidity of the Democratic party in the United States, urging them to embrace a forceful agenda of social rights to improve people's lives.</p>

          <p>Former Social Security Administration (SSA) Commissioner Martin O'Malley predicts a potential "interruption of benefits" due to cuts implemented by Elon Musk's "Doge" team. The cuts, aimed at reducing waste and fraud, have led to website outages, regional office closures, and incorrect declarations of death for some recipients. Critics fear that these measures could ultimately undermine social security. O'Malley warns that the system faces catastrophic failure, with some recipients already experiencing payment disruptions.</p>
