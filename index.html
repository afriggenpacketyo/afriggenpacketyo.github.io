          <p>The Trump administration has acquired a 10% stake in chipmaker Intel, investing $8.9 billion primarily through CHIPS Act grants and secure chip program awards. This move, which saw Intel shares rise, represents a significant shift in U.S. industrial policy towards greater government involvement in the private sector. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick emphasized the government's right to an equity stake for its funds, while Intel stated the government would not have a board seat. This development follows a $2 billion investment from SoftBank and Intel's efforts to expand U.S. chip manufacturing despite project slowdowns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thousands of Venezuelan citizens, including civil servants, housewives, and retirees, volunteered to join the Bolivarian Militia over the weekend in Caracas. This mass registration was a direct response to President Nicolas Maduro's call for citizens to prepare against what he termed "outlandish threats" from the United States. The show of force also sends a message to Washington, which has issued a $50 million bounty for Maduro and stationed warships off Venezuela's coast. Volunteers, some affirming their commitment at Hugo Chavez's mausoleum, were shown weapons and documentaries on past foreign blockades, underscoring a strong nationalistic sentiment.</p>

          <p>As Washington D.C. students return to school, Mayor Muriel Bowser has stated that federal law enforcement, deployed by President Trump, will not assist with student safety, asserting the city's ability to manage. This comes as D.C. boasts its highest English and math proficiency rates since before the pandemic. However, the presence of National Guard troops and federal agents, including an accident involving a military-style vehicle, raises new safety questions, especially near Metro stations used by many students. Bowser views the federal presence as unnecessary, arguing local crime rates had already decreased significantly.</p>

          <p>A search operation for Natalia Nagovitsyna, a Russian climber stranded with a broken leg on Kyrgyzstan's 24,406-foot Victory Peak, has been suspended indefinitely due to severe weather. An Italian climber, Luca Sinigaglia, died on August 15 attempting to rescue her. Despite a drone confirming Nagovitsyna was alive earlier in the week, no signs of life were detected in a later flyover, and authorities now believe she is no longer alive, citing impossible manual or helicopter evacuation from such altitudes.

          <p>China Evergrande Group was delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, marking a symbolic end for the once-dominant developer and highlighting the ongoing crisis in China's property sector. Once valued at $51 billion, Evergrande became the world's most indebted developer with over $300 billion in debt, its default triggering a broader economic downturn. Analysts believe the market adjustment is not yet over, though its drag on GDP is expected to lessen. Beijing is implementing measures to boost home demand and stabilize the sector, potentially leading to consolidation around state-backed developers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK hospitality industry reports that over 50% of the nation's job losses since last October, totaling around 89,000 positions, have occurred within its sector. UKHospitality attributes this decline to higher taxes, including business rates and VAT, announced in the Autumn Budget, which have stifled investment and hiring. The group warns that job losses could reach 100,000 by the next budget if urgent action is not taken to reduce costs. Rising minimum wage, National Insurance contributions, and inflation are further pressuring businesses and reducing consumer spending.</p>

          <p>A recent federal immigration crackdown in Washington D.C., marked by federal agents near a bilingual childcare center, has instilled widespread fear among immigrant families and workers. Parents are hesitant to send children to school, and nannies are requesting escorts or calling out of work due to increased police presence and checkpoints. The White House confirmed hundreds of arrests of undocumented immigrants, leading many Washingtonians to feel their city is no longer safe.

          <p>Donald Trump's potential involvement is casting a significant shadow over New York City's mayoral election, with speculation he may endorse a candidate. This adds complexity to an already contentious race featuring Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams. Reports suggest Trump has spoken with Cuomo and praised Adams, while also calling Mamdani a "communist." Despite Trump's unpopularity in the city, wealthy New Yorkers are reportedly keen on his intervention to counter Mamdani's progressive platform.

          <p>This article argues strongly for banning student cell phones in schools, citing their detrimental effects on learning, increased social anxiety, and suppressed emotional and intellectual growth. The author, a former teacher and parent, highlights how phones distract students, condition them to constant online engagement, and hinder face-to-face interactions crucial for developing social acuity and resilience. With 31 U.S. states now requiring or recommending phone limits, and positive outcomes reported from bans in Australia, there's growing momentum for such policies. However, challenges remain in implementation, as some parents resist restrictions and school curricula increasingly integrate device use.</p>

          <p>President Trump's executive order on homelessness emphasizes involuntary commitments, or civil commitments, forcing unhoused individuals into mandatory treatment facilities. While seemingly extreme, this practice has been used for decades and is gaining popularity, particularly in blue states like California, which accounts for half of the nation's unsheltered homeless population. Experts like Alex Barnard argue that such commitments are most effective when coupled with available housing, and that focusing solely on coercion without addressing housing affordability is a catastrophic failure. The article highlights that this "tough on homelessness" approach transcends traditional political divides, with even some progressives reframing coercion as compassion.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is actively pursuing a deal for Bayer Leverkusen defender Piero Hincapie, identifying the Ecuador international as a priority for a left-sided defender this summer. The Gunners' recruitment staff have extensively scouted the 23-year-old, who has a 60 million euro release clause and is reportedly eager to leave the German club. Hincapie has made 166 appearances for Leverkusen, contributing to their Bundesliga and German Cup wins in 2023-24. Arsenal, having already spent over £200 million on new signings, is also looking to sell players like Fabio Vieira and Oleksandr Zinchenko to facilitate further transfers.</p>

          <p>This article questions whether leading AI companies truly prioritize American democratic values, despite their "America First" rhetoric emphasizing competition with China. Figures like Sam Altman and Dario Amodei warn against authoritarian AI but appear more interested in government approval and contracts than actively safeguarding democracy, especially under the Trump administration. The administration's "AI Action Plan" offers limited oversight and fast-tracked infrastructure, aligning with industry desires. Critics argue this approach, reminiscent of social media's rise, risks outsourcing national interest to billionaires and turning "democratic AI" into a user-acquisition strategy, with companies remaining silent on actions that erode democracy.</p>

          <p>An American man, identified as Martin D., who worked for a U.S. Defense Department contractor at a military facility in Germany, has been indicted on espionage charges. Prosecutors allege he repeatedly contacted Chinese authorities in the summer of 2024, offering to provide sensitive U.S. military information to Chinese intelligence. He was arrested in Frankfurt in early November. While German media reported he did not manage to transfer any data before his arrest, the indictment highlights ongoing concerns about national security and foreign intelligence threats targeting military personnel and contractors abroad.</p>

          <p>Ether, the second-largest cryptocurrency, experienced a 6% price drop to $4,548.32 on Monday, after hitting a fresh record of $4,954.81 over the weekend. This decline, which also saw Bitcoin fall, erased gains made after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinted at upcoming rate cuts, prompting investors to return to risk-on mode. Despite recent outflows, Ether has been leading the crypto market due to regulatory tailwinds, increased interest in stablecoins, and corporate accumulation. Analysts suggest that with rate cuts on the table, Ether's $4,000 level could become a new foundation for its future pricing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article questions the societal double standard where flag football is promoted for girls due to safety concerns, while boys continue to play tackle football despite known health risks like CTE. The author, a scholar of gender and sports, argues that adapting sports rules for girls' "supposed physical limitations" is a historical pattern, but the health costs for boys in tackle football are often overlooked. The piece suggests that the public celebration of tackle football reinforces a self-destructive masculinity, disproportionately affecting working-class men of color. It calls for a re-evaluation of why boys play tackle football, proposing a shift towards flag football for all youth.</p>

While they offer significant health benefits, a major unanswered question remains: what are the long-term effects on human desire, joy, and the broader emotional experience?

          <p>This article argues that while President Trump's claims about soaring crime rates in major U.S. cities are statistically incorrect, his rhetoric successfully taps into a genuine and increasing public fear of crime. Despite significant declines in violent crime in places like Washington D.C. and Chicago, national surveys indicate that fear of crime is at a 30-year high. The author suggests that this paradox is fueled by sensationalized media coverage, social media, an aging population, and a declining tolerance for disorder. Democrats are advised to acknowledge and address this fear directly, rather than solely relying on statistics, to build credibility and offer effective solutions beyond federal deployments.</p>

The author contends that pro-Israel PACs exert undue influence through campaign funding, creating an incentive structure that prioritizes donors over constituents.

          <p>Contrary to common perception, new research indicates that fish may experience pleasure and actively seek it, challenging the view of them as "simple-minded animals." Scientists studied bluestreak cleaner wrasse and threadfin butterflyfish, observing that butterflyfish preferred areas where they had been "cleaned" by wrasse, even without parasites. Experiments using opioid mimics and blockers suggested that the fish's opioid system mediates this pleasurable sensation. The findings differentiate between "liking" and "wanting," proposing that the desire for pleasure might be governed by dopamine. This research could lead to a rethinking of fish treatment in aquariums and aquaculture, highlighting their complex emotional states.</p>
