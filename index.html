          <p>A "Unite the Kingdom" rally in London, organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, drew an estimated 110,000 to 150,000 people. The event became violent as some demonstrators clashed with police who were separating them from a smaller counter-protest. At least 26 officers were injured, four seriously, and 25 arrests were made for offenses including violent disorder and assault. The rally, focused on themes of free speech and anti-migration, highlights growing nationalist sentiments and tensions in the UK.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Alibaba has created a new, highly efficient foundation model for artificial intelligence that matches the performance of its larger predecessors while being significantly smaller and cheaper to train. The new model, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B, reportedly performs some tasks ten times faster than a model released in April and was developed with a 90% reduction in training costs. This breakthrough in AI efficiency, estimated to cost less than $500,000 to train compared to the millions for competitors, marks a significant step in making powerful AI more accessible.</p>

          <p>Officials in the Swiss canton of Fribourg have enacted a strict new regulation to protect the local chamois ram population from mistaken killings by recreational hunters. After finding that over 25% of chamois rams killed in 2024 did not meet age or gender criteria, authorities will now impose a two-year ban on hunting the species for any hunter guilty of a wrongful kill. The measure is intended to enforce greater care and accountability, ensuring hunters properly identify their targets to maintain the ecosystem's balance.</p>

          <p>Following the arrest of 22-year-old Tyler Robinson for the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, questions about his motive are fueling intense political debate in the U.S. While Utah's governor stated the suspect was "deeply indoctrinated with leftist ideology," concrete details remain scarce, and his personal political beliefs are unclear. Reports, some unconfirmed, have circulated about the suspect's personal life, including that he lived with a transgender partner, which has been used by commentators to frame the narrative around the killing.</p>

          <p>On "The View," co-host Whoopi Goldberg criticized fellow Democrats for their public handling of concerns surrounding former President Joe Biden's fitness for office. Goldberg argued that the party should have addressed the issue "in-house" rather than turning it into a "public spectacle," which she believes damaged public perception. Her comments came during a discussion about an excerpt from former Vice President Kamala Harris's new book, in which Harris reportedly described Biden's decision to seek re-election as "reckless."</p>

          <p>Leaked military planning documents indicate the Trump administration has drafted a proposal to deploy 1,000 Louisiana National Guard troops for law enforcement operations in the state's urban centers. The plan, which would supplement local police in cities like New Orleans and Baton Rouge, outlines a potential mobilization lasting until September 2026. This development aligns with President Trump's focus on crime in Democratic-led areas but has raised concerns about the militarization of domestic policing and its potential use as a political tool.</p>

          <p>A staffer for Mexico's ruling Morena party has resigned after making controversial comments about the assassination of U.S. conservative activist Charlie Kirk on a major television news program. The staffer, Salvador Ramírez, suggested Kirk got "a spoonful of his own chocolate" due to his pro-gun stance, prompting an online backlash and a warning from a U.S. State Department official about visa revocations for foreigners who glorify violence. The news network also issued an apology, highlighting the intense international scrutiny and consequences surrounding commentary on Kirk's death.</p>

          <p>Medical staff at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital have reported that at least 32 people, including 12 children, were killed in a barrage of Israeli airstrikes on Saturday. The strikes are part of an intensified Israeli offensive in the city, which Israel describes as the last major stronghold for Hamas. The Israeli military has urged the hundreds of thousands of remaining residents to evacuate to a southern humanitarian zone, but aid groups warn that displacement will worsen an already catastrophic humanitarian crisis marked by famine.</p>

          <h2>Experts Analyze "Extremely Online" Engravings on Bullet Casings from Kirk Shooting</h2>

          <p>Authorities have revealed that bullet casings found at the scene of Charlie Kirk's assassination were engraved with messages referencing internet memes, video games, and anti-fascist history. The inscriptions include the emoticon "OwO" from furry subculture, a code for a bomb in the game "Helldivers 2," and lyrics from the Italian anti-fascist anthem "Bella Ciao." Experts caution against drawing simple conclusions about the shooter's motive from this "extremely online" language, suggesting it may be designed as doublespeak to confuse investigators and generate viral attention.</p>
