          <h2>Pistons Coach Expresses Frustration Over Missed Foul Call in Playoff Loss</h2>

          <p>The Detroit Pistons lost to the New York Knicks in a close Game 4 due to a controversial no-call at the end of the game, leading to an outburst from Pistons coach J.B. Bickerstaff. The coach argued that Knicks guard Josh Hart made contact with Tim Hardaway Jr. on a jump shot, which should have been called a foul. NBA officials later admitted the mistake after reviewing the play, acknowledging that a foul should have been called. Despite a strong performance from Cade Cunningham, the Knicks took a 3-1 series lead with Karl-Anthony Towns and Jalen Brunson leading the charge. </p>

          <p>Canada is holding a snap federal election after Prime Minister Mark Carney, leader of the Liberal Party, called for a vote following Justin Trudeau's resignation.

          <p>Despite agreeing to a ceasefire following a devastating earthquake in Myanmar, the ruling junta has repeatedly violated the agreement, according to a BBC reporter who witnessed the breaches in Karenni state. The violations included rocket and mortar attacks that killed and injured civilians and resistance fighters. The conflict between the junta and various ethnic and insurgent groups has been ongoing since the 2021 coup, with the recent earthquake exacerbating the humanitarian crisis. The United Nations has called for an end to the military operations, but attacks continue, with both sides claiming the right to respond if attacked. </p>

          <p>Tyler Glasnow, a pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers, exited Sunday's game against the Pittsburgh Pirates in the second inning due to discomfort in his right shoulder. This injury comes after Glasnow missed the end of the previous season with an elbow sprain and left his last start due to leg cramps. Glasnow previously underwent Tommy John surgery in 2021, and his recent shoulder issue adds to the Dodgers' pitching concerns, as Blake Snell is also on the injured list with shoulder inflammation.</p>

However, concerns remain about the offensive line, as the team only drafted one rookie prospect, Branson Taylor, who is projected to play guard. The Chargers hope to improve their offensive line through competition and potential offseason transactions, aiming to support quarterback Justin Herbert and the running game.</p>
