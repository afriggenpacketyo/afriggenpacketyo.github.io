        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has initiated an investigation into former President Biden's administration, focusing on the alleged misuse of an autopen to sign presidential documents and concerns about Biden's cognitive state. Trump's memo directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to probe a purported conspiracy to conceal Biden's cognitive decline through the use of a mechanical signature pen. The investigation aims to determine the extent of autopen usage, the individuals responsible, and the potential implications for the legality of executive actions. Biden has dismissed the allegations as false and a distraction, asserting his full decision-making authority during his presidency. The investigation is expected to be controversial, especially given the historical use of autopens by presidents of both parties. Optimism regarding the political climate is low.</p>

          <p>High-stakes negotiations concerning Iran's nuclear program are facing uncertainty as the U.S. and Iran publicly disagree on the terms of an interim agreement proposed by the Trump administration. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected the proposal, asserting that Iran would not halt uranium enrichment on its soil. This stance contrasts with President Trump's assertion that the agreement would prohibit any enrichment of uranium. With both sides expressing skepticism and mistrust, the future of the negotiations and a potential sixth round of talks remain unclear. The current status of the negotiations suggests a potential stalemate.</p>

Beadle learned about the change through The Hollywood Reporter, finding the situation "a little embarrassing" after being in the business for over 20 years. She hosts "Beadle and Decker" with Cody Decker, which will no longer air from 12-3 p.m. ET every weekday due to Smith's arrival.

Kimmich acknowledged Germany's shortcomings, stating they weren't active enough and didn't bring enough energy to the pitch. Ronaldo's performance overshadowed Kimmich's milestone, leading Portugal to the Nations League final.

          <p>President Trump has barred most international students from entering the United States to study at Harvard University, escalating a feud between his administration and the Ivy League school. The proclamation suspends the entry of foreign students or exchange visitors planning to attend Harvard, unless their entry is deemed "in the national interest." The order claims Harvard is no longer a trustworthy steward of international student programs, accusing the school of failing to report student disciplinary records and criticizing its ties to researchers based in China. A Harvard spokesperson called the order an illegal retaliatory step violating the school's First Amendment rights, highlighting the ongoing conflict between the university and the administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a sweeping order banning travel from 12 countries and restricting travel from seven others, citing national security concerns. The ban, effective Monday, targets nationals from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, and other nations, while imposing partial restrictions on Burundi, Cuba, Laos, and others. Trump justified the ban by referencing the recent attack in Boulder, Colorado, stating the need for stricter vetting of foreign nationals. Critics argue the ban is discriminatory and will separate families, particularly impacting communities with large immigrant populations from the affected countries. This action revives and expands upon travel bans from Trump's first term, sparking controversy and legal challenges.</p>

The study, published in Science Bulletin, details the structural analysis of feathers dating back 99 million years.

While modern birds are descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs lacked the same flying ability.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria our bodies encounter after birth can protect against dangerous infections. The study showed that good bacteria, specifically Bifidobacterium longum, can halve the risk of young children being admitted to the hospital with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute analyzed stool samples from 1,082 newborns and tracked their health for two years. Babies with B. longum were significantly less likely to require hospitalization for lung infections. The protective bacteria were found only in babies delivered vaginally, suggesting early microbial encounters are crucial for immune system development.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the FDA review the latest data on mifepristone, the abortion pill. The FDA confirmed the review, but details on its scope and timeline are unclear. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley stated the review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety, though experts argue safety concerns are misguided. Mifepristone was approved by the FDA in 2000 after a thorough review and has been used by millions of patients. This review comes after the Supreme Court rejected a challenge targeting the availability of mifepristone in 2024.</p>

          <p>Pregnant women are being warned against using weight-loss injections due to unknown risks to unborn babies. Drug safety experts in the UK advise women trying for a baby, pregnant, or breastfeeding to stop using medicines like Wegovy and Mounjaro. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) emphasizes that women should use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward. There are concerns that the growing popularity of 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has intensified his opposition to President Trumpâ€™s tax bill, criticizing it in numerous posts on X and urging voters to contact lawmakers to "KILL the BILL."

White House officials maintain that Trump remains committed to passing the bill despite Musk's opposition. The bill has faced criticism for its potential impact on the national debt and its provisions regarding foreign student visas and immigration policies.

          <p>A US judge has temporarily halted deportation proceedings against the family of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, the suspect accused of a petrol-bomb attack on Jewish demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado. US District Judge Gordon Gallagher ordered deportation proceedings to be halted, a day after the White House said it had six one-way tickets to deport the wife and five children from the US. Lawyers for the defense had accused the government of unfairly targeting the family, who say they were unaware of Mr Soliman's violent plans and have co-operated with investigators. The decision was one of three immigration rulings on Wednesday against Trump by federal judges as he seeks to deliver on his pledge for mass deportations.</p>
