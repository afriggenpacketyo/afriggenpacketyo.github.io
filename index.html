          <p>Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson stated the city received no prior notification regarding the Department of Homeland Security's "Operation Midway Blitz," an enhanced immigration enforcement effort targeting "criminal illegal aliens." The department justified the operation by referencing a fatal drunk driving incident involving an undocumented individual, while Mayor Johnson condemned it as militarized enforcement lacking due process. He cited ICE's history of human rights abuses and urged residents to utilize "know your rights" resources. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker also criticized the Trump administration for focusing on intimidation rather than collaborative public safety efforts, escalating political tensions over immigration enforcement in sanctuary cities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch expressed "serious worry" that the UK might require an International Monetary Fund bailout, reminiscent of the 1976 sterling crisis, if the government fails to deliver a strong economic growth plan. She proposed working with Sir Keir Starmer on welfare cuts and growth to address rising taxes and precarious public finances, citing record-high UK borrowing costs as a key indicator. Badenoch criticized the Labour government for lacking an economic strategy, suggesting their approach was not working. Labour, in turn, accused the Conservatives of having "crashed the economy" previously, making Badenoch's advice seem disingenuous. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US lawmakers released a "birthday book" compiled for Jeffrey Epstein in 2003 by Ghislaine Maxwell, which reportedly contains a note allegedly signed by then-friend Donald Trump. The White House has denied the note's authenticity, claiming the signature does not match the president's. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, however, seized on a line about a "wonderful secret" to suggest Trump was lying about his involvement. This release is part of a larger trove of documents from Epstein's estate, including his will and address book, detailing contacts with global figures. The ongoing demands for transparency surrounding Epstein's high-profile connections continue to generate political scrutiny and legal action.</p>

          <p>The tragic murder of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte Metro train has escalated to federal concern, with FBI Director Kash Patel and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy confirming investigations. Duffy announced a USDOT probe into the Charlotte transit system's safety failures, aligning with President Trump's "zero tolerance" message on crime. The Trump administration is reportedly considering withholding federal transportation funds from cities that do not adequately address public transit violence. This incident is being framed as a critical national test of accountability, emphasizing the administration's broader crime-and-safety agenda and its intent to maintain the case in the national spotlight.</p>

          <p>Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index surged to a record high, crossing 44,000, extending gains after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation. The technology sector spearheaded this rally, with major chip-related shares like Advantest and Tokyo Electron experiencing significant increases. Investors are largely betting that the next leader from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party will implement new fiscal stimulus measures to further bolster the economy.

          <p>The tragic fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska on a Charlotte light rail has ignited a national debate on public safety and mental health, drawing sharp criticism from President Trump and local officials. The alleged assailant, Decarlos Brown Jr., had a lengthy history of criminal charges and psychiatric crises, including a schizophrenia diagnosis and multiple releases without bail. Critics contend the killing was preventable, pointing to systemic failures in managing repeat offenders and individuals with severe mental illness within the justice system. Charlotte's mayor acknowledged a "tragic failure by the courts and magistrates," urging bipartisan solutions to address these complex societal challenges.</p>

          <p>A succession agreement for Rupert Murdoch's media empire has been finalized, confirming his eldest son, Lachlan Murdoch, will assume sole control of News Corp and Fox Corp after his father's passing.

The new arrangement involves creating a trust and a reported $3.3 billion cash settlement for the three other Murdoch siblings, who will relinquish their holdings in the media companies. This consolidation solidifies Lachlan's leadership, ensuring the continued political orientation of influential outlets such as Fox News and The Wall Street Journal.</p>

The film, based on true events, depicts civilians risking their lives to expose Japanese atrocities, using restrained storytelling.

A University of Kansas analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data identifies the prohibitive costs of childcare as the primary driver for this trend, often rendering it financially unfeasible for mothers to continue working. Economist Misty Heggeness emphasizes the critical lack of adequate policy support and structural assistance for caregivers, forcing women to make difficult choices between their professional careers and their children.

The report cards will utilize a five-point grading scale across various areas like curriculum, achievement, and leadership, aiming to provide more detailed information to parents. Critics, however, argue it's merely a "cosmetic rebranding" that perpetuates a high-stakes, punitive regime for teachers, potentially increasing stress without significant benefits or safeguards.</p>

Companies with high floating-rate debt could experience improved profitability due to expected interest rate cuts and new tax deductions from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Gold mining stocks are projected to rise significantly, driven by strong gold price growth fueled by central bank and ETF demand, with a forecast of a 14% increase through 2026.

Many foreign-born aides, like Marcia, who has worked in the U.S. for 25 years since Hurricane Mitch, rely on TPS for legal work authorization. Advocates warn that revoking TPS could profoundly impact organizations like Sunnyside Community Services, where over 90% of their home health aides are foreign-born. This article highlights the severe personal and systemic consequences of immigration policy changes on essential workforces, vulnerable populations, and the broader healthcare system, urging for a path to green cards for long-term contributors.</p>

          <p>The Garnet fire, spanning over 49,000 acres in Sierra National Forest, has burned into the McKinley grove of giant sequoias, with several of the rare, towering trees now in flames. An aerial assessment confirmed crown fires in some sequoias, prompting the deployment of smokejumpers to the area. While initial reports suggest the blaze remained mostly on the ground, the possibility of new embers igniting further damage persists. McKinley grove, home to approximately 200 ancient trees, was previously identified as highly vulnerable to fire. This incident underscores the increasing threat of severe wildfires, fueled by climate change, to California's iconic and once fire-resistant giant sequoias, with an estimated 20% already lost in the last decade.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have approved Assembly Bill 519, which bans online pet dealer websites and middlemen posing as local breeders from selling dogs, cats, and rabbits under a year old to consumers. This measure aims to close loopholes exploited by out-of-state puppy mills and deceptive resellers, a problem highlighted by a previous investigation into misleading sales tactics and the sale of sick pets. The bill, now awaiting Governor Newsom's signature, has overwhelming bipartisan support and is seen as a crucial step to protect consumers from unknowingly purchasing sick or poorly bred pets. Opponents, like PuppySpot, however, argue it unfairly penalizes responsible online operations while doing little to prevent unregulated sales.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved updated Covid-19 vaccines for adults 65 and older and younger individuals with specific high-risk medical conditions, including asthma, heart conditions, and obesity, among others. This narrower approval, following changes announced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., means access may be limited for some who previously qualified for routine vaccination. While healthcare providers can offer "off-label" vaccinations, pharmacists' ability to do so may be constrained in certain states due to varying regulations. The article details the comprehensive list of eligible conditions, vaccine availability timelines, and potential insurance coverage issues, highlighting complexities in vaccine access and differing recommendations from groups like the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p>

          <p>Six whistleblowers, current and former Meta employees, allege the company covered up harm to children on its virtual reality (VR) devices and apps. They claim Meta deleted or doctored internal safety research showing children exposed to grooming, sexual assault, and violence in its 3D realms. Managers reportedly instructed staff to avoid research revealing child harm and delete interview information, with one researcher told to "swallow that ick." These allegations, disclosed to Congress and federal agencies, come amidst ongoing scrutiny of Meta's social media products and their impact on youth. Senator Marsha Blackburn called for legislation, condemning Meta for silencing employees and burying egregious evidence.</p>

          <p>John Elkann, chair of Ferrari and Stellantis, has agreed to perform one year of community service and jointly pay €183 million (£159 million) to Italian tax authorities to settle an inheritance tax dispute. The case relates to the estate of his grandmother, Marella Caracciolo, with prosecutors alleging the Elkann siblings failed to declare roughly €1 billion in assets and €248.5 million in income, based on her purported Swiss residency. Elkann's lawyer stated the agreement does not imply an admission of liability, aiming to swiftly conclude the "painful affair." This outcome is part of a broader, ongoing civil dispute between the Elkann siblings and their mother over the vast estate of Gianni Agnelli, the former Fiat boss.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has sacked head coach Nuno Espirito Santo after 21 months, following a publicly acknowledged deterioration in his relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis. Nuno, who guided the club to a seventh-place Premier League finish and European qualification last season—their highest since 1994-95—had expressed concerns about their transfer business and internal tensions. Despite his on-pitch success, including notable wins against top teams, a clear breakdown in communication and disagreements over recruitment strategy ultimately led to his dismissal. The club confirmed talks are underway for a replacement, with former Spurs manager Ange Postecoglou reportedly a contender, signaling a new chapter for the team's leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A leading waste firm boss, Roger Wright of Biffa, claims the ban on disposable vapes in the UK is failing, with millions still being improperly discarded and causing increased fires in waste systems. Despite the ban, Biffa, which handles nearly a fifth of the UK's waste, has observed a 3% rise in vapes incorrectly mixed with general recycling. Wright attributes this to large pre-ban stock sales and the vape industry's launch of cheap "reusable" devices often treated as disposables, noting the proliferation of new vape types complicates recycling efforts. The Independent British Vape Trade Association, however, blames illegal black market trade for the issue, while the waste industry faces significant costs from vape-related fires.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes Donald Trump's consistent use of violent rhetoric, exemplified by his "Chipocalypse Now" meme threatening Chicago and his intent to rename the Defense Department to "Department of War." It highlights how his language, once dismissed as mere swagger, has escalated into concrete threats against American cities and has influenced his administration's actions, such as deploying the National Guard. The article draws parallels to the "imperial boomerang" concept, suggesting that brutal tactics used abroad can eventually be turned domestically. It also details internal administration conflicts and the political consequences of his aggressive communication style, which has drawn both strong support from his base and condemnation from critics.</p>

He emphasized the significant hard work and clear determination within the team, which he feels are undermined by simplistic categorizations of their strategy. McCullum's comments highlight the team's focus on creating an environment where talent thrives, rather than being bound by tension or solely focused on high scoring.</p>
