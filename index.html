          <p>Scientists in China have made a breakthrough in perovskite light-emitting diode (PeLED) technology, potentially revolutionizing electronic devices. Researchers have found a way to extend the lifespan of PeLEDs to over 20 years, while maintaining brightness comparable to commercial displays. The team's PeLEDs reached a brightness exceeding the brightest commercial display screens. This development could lead to the creation of low-cost, ultra-bright lighting and high-end display screens.</p>
