Despite the overall market downturn, GE Vernova, a company focused on nuclear energy and small modular reactors, experienced an intraday high after Trump agreed to allow a New York offshore wind project to move forward, and amid a new SMR deal with the Tennessee Valley Authority.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a potential 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the United States, pushing for Apple to shift production to the U.S. The threat follows Apple supplier Foxconn's plan to invest $1.5 billion in Indian operations, a move to diversify production away from China. Apple CEO Tim Cook previously mentioned that over half of iPhones sold in the U.S. are now made in India. Analysts believe producing iPhones in the U.S. is unlikely due to high domestic manufacturing costs, potentially raising the price of high-end models to $3,500 each.</p>

While acknowledging Harvard's genuine shortcomings, such as the erosion of academic freedom and lack of viewpoint diversity, Pinker contends that the university is not the "woke madrasa" or "cesspool of extremist riots" that its critics claim. He calls for a more balanced and nuanced approach to addressing Harvard's ailments, rather than the Trump administration's destructive assault.</p>

          <p>A new study found that contrast-enhanced mammography can detect three times as many invasive cancers in dense breast tissue as ultrasound, and can find tumors smaller than those found by regular mammography. While MRI scans are slightly better at detecting tumors overall, contrast-enhanced mammography is more cost-effective and could be more widely available. The study suggests that contrast-enhanced mammography should become standard care for high-risk women with dense breasts, although it has not yet been approved by the FDA for breast cancer screening.</p>
