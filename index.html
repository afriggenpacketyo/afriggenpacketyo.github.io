          <p>China has implemented retaliatory measures against the European Union by excluding EU-based companies from government medical device contracts exceeding US$6.3 million. The new rule, effective Sunday, does not apply to EU-funded firms already operating within China. The Chinese Ministry of Commerce described the move as a last resort, following unsuccessful attempts to resolve procurement differences through dialogue. This action highlights escalating trade tensions and Beijing's use of reciprocal countermeasures in international disputes.</p>

          <p>A man in Manavgat, a resort city in southern Turkey, was seriously injured after being attacked by a lion that had escaped from a local zoo. The 53-year-old man was sleeping outdoors when the lion, named Zeus, mauled him, leading to a struggle before the animal fled. Authorities later located and shot the lion dead. The incident raises questions about safety protocols at the "Land of Lions" park, which has not commented on how the animal escaped.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after the G8's Gleneagles summit, which saw historic promises on debt relief and aid, the spirit of global solidarity has significantly eroded. The article contrasts the optimism of 2005 with today's fragmented, multipolar world, strained by financial crises, geopolitical conflicts like the war in Ukraine, and shifting political priorities. While campaigners note some progress on debt relief, the current political climate, marked by budget cuts and reduced international cooperation, makes a repeat of such ambitious initiatives unlikely.</p>

          <p>At least 50 people have died and over two dozen remain missing after catastrophic flash floods struck Texas Hill Country. The Guadalupe River rose dramatically, inundating areas including a children's summer camp, Camp Mystic, from which at least 27 campers are unaccounted for. Hundreds of air and water rescues have been conducted as officials grapple with the disaster's scale, which they state was caused by rainfall far exceeding forecasts. The event has prompted a federal disaster declaration and raised serious questions about the adequacy of flood warning systems in the region.</p>

The article argues that RCV allowed Mamdani, an initial long-shot candidate, to build a coalition without the "spoiler effect" common in traditional elections. This system encouraged a more positive, issue-focused campaign and led to historic voter turnout. Proponents suggest the New York election demonstrates how RCV can empower voters, increase engagement, and produce majority winners with broad support, offering a potential model for less polarized politics.</p>

          <p>Autism researchers are deeply concerned by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s recent initiatives, which they fear will undermine decades of scientific progress. Kennedy has dismissed established genetic research and is pursuing his long-held, disproven theory linking vaccines to autism. His rhetoric, which frames autism as a "catastrophe," has also been criticized by the autistic community and their families for promoting stigma. Experts worry that his actions, combined with funding cuts, will not only halt valid research but also erode public trust and cause harm to autistic individuals.</p>

          <p>Jackie and Shadow, the celebrated bald eagle pair from Big Bear Lake, have disappeared from their nest following the city's Fourth of July fireworks display. The eagles, who are monitored by a popular 24-hour webcam, were reportedly frightened away by the loud explosions. The nonprofit Friends of Big Bear Valley, which had petitioned against the fireworks show, documented the eagles' distress and subsequent departure. The incident has reignited debate over the impact of such celebrations on local wildlife, with fans and conservationists hoping for the birds' safe return.</p>

          <h2>Contributor Argues California's Energy Policies Increase Gas Prices and Outsource Pollution</h2>

          <p>An opinion article argues that California's aggressive green energy policies are creating a self-inflicted crisis by dismantling essential fossil fuel infrastructure. With refineries closing, the state is becoming more reliant on imported oil and fuel, often from places with lower environmental standards, which paradoxically increases global pollution. The author contends these policies disproportionately harm working-class families who cannot afford electric vehicles and are burdened by the nation's highest gas prices. The piece calls for a more pragmatic energy transition that balances environmental goals with economic and national security realities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two months after leaving the German government, the Green Party is struggling to redefine its role and strategy as an opposition party. Party leaders have put forward a paper aiming to restructure their approach, acknowledging a need to better connect with voters' everyday concerns. The article notes the party's challenge in balancing its core issue of climate protection, which is currently less popular with the electorate, with the need to address more immediate economic and social issues. This transition is complicated by a lack of personnel, particularly in eastern Germany.</p>

          <p>Scientists in China have created a faster, more energy-efficient data sorting method using memristors, a type of electronic component with memory capabilities. This new system is designed to overcome the "Von Neumann bottleneck," a fundamental limit on data transfer speeds in conventional computing architecture. By performing sorting operations directly within the memory, the hardware prototype demonstrated significant speed and efficiency gains in tasks like route finding. The innovation could have major implications for performance-limited applications in AI, databases, and scientific computing.</p>

          <p>A California family that voted for Donald Trump, supporting his tough immigration stance, has expressed shock after the Canadian-born mother was detained by ICE. Cynthia Olivera, who has lived in the U.S. since she was 10 and has three U.S.-born children, was taken into custody during an interview for permanent residency. Her husband, a U.S. citizen, stated he feels betrayed and wants his vote back, as they never believed the deportation policies would affect their family. The case highlights the broad impact of the administration's immigration crackdown, which affects many without criminal records.</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy, delivered via a single injection, has successfully reversed hearing loss in a clinical trial involving children and adults with a specific form of congenital deafness. The therapy works by delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. All 10 participants in the small-scale trial showed considerable hearing improvement within months, with one seven-year-old regaining almost full hearing. Researchers are hopeful this safe and well-tolerated method can be adapted to treat other common forms of genetic deafness.</p>

The shopkeeper, Andrew Board, personally stopped the thief and brought him back to the store. However, police dealt with the matter through a "community resolution," where the offender simply paid for the stolen goods and was banned from the shop, avoiding a criminal conviction. Board argues this lack of a real deterrent fuels the growing problem of shoplifting, which is at a record high nationally while charge rates remain low.</p>

          <p>Monasteries and convents across Germany are closing at an accelerating rate as the number of monks and nuns dwindles. The article highlights the sale of St. Erentraud's Abbey as an example of a wider trend, with Catholic orders shrinking dramatically over the past decades. The decline is attributed to reduced religious adherence, smaller family sizes, and more professional opportunities for women outside the church. This trend has societal consequences, as religious orders have historically run many schools and hospitals, and their closures represent a loss for local communities.</p>
