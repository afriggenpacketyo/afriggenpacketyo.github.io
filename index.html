            <h2>Trump's Trade Policies Weaken U.S. Position, Empowering Europe and China</h2>

            <p>Donald Trump's recent tariff actions have destabilized the U.S. financial system and weakened his political standing, creating an opportunity for Europe and the UK to forge a new trade order. Trump's initial boasts of global leaders seeking his favor quickly turned into a market-driven humbling, forcing him to pause tariff implementations. The EU and Britain are now positioned to collaborate on a global pact promoting free trade, potentially excluding the U.S. and carefully engaging with China, which seeks to establish a new global order. Britain should align with the EU in trade negotiations and pursue a deeper trade deal to boost its growth, rather than relying on a weak U.S. deal.</p>

            <p>The United States and Iran have engaged in their first high-level discussions since 2018 regarding Tehran's nuclear program, mediated by Oman. Both nations described the initial meeting as "constructive," setting the stage for a second round of talks the following week. The US envoy, Steve Witkoff, conveyed President Trump's desire to resolve differences through diplomacy. Iran seeks a fair agreement to limit its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief, while the US aims to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and avert potential military action. These talks are viewed as a crucial first step towards a potential deal.</p>

            <p>Israel has announced the completion of a new security corridor in the Gaza Strip, effectively controlling the city of Rafah and dividing the Palestinian territory. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) stated they have eliminated dozens of terrorists and dismantled Hamas infrastructure during the operation. Defense Minister Israel Katz indicated that IDF activity would expand to other areas in Gaza, urging residents to evacuate fighting zones. This move follows earlier evacuation orders for parts of Khan Yunis and Rafah, with the IDF aiming to separate Hamas fighters and expand its security zones. Katz also expressed support for the forced expulsion of Palestinians.</p>

The investigation hinges on locating the main rotor, transmission, and tail structure, which could reveal the cause of the crash. Preliminary findings suggest a rotor may have detached, leading to the accident, but authorities are also considering bird strikes, drone interference, and mechanical failure. The helicopter was carrying a Siemens executive and his family on a sightseeing tour when it crashed near Jersey City, New Jersey.</p>

            <p>President Trump's rapidly changing tariff policies are causing confusion and anxiety among American consumers, with some engaging in panic buying while others feel paralyzed by uncertainty. The recent tariffs include a 145% duty on goods from China and a 10% tax on most other imports, leading to fears of significant price increases and potential shortages. While some retailers have stockpiled goods, experts predict higher prices for clothing, electronics, and other items in the coming months. Economists warn that these tariffs could lead to slower economic growth and increased unemployment, potentially triggering a recession.</p>

            <p>U.S. missionary Josh Sullivan was abducted at gunpoint from his church in South Africa while delivering a sermon. The kidnappers, who knew him by name, stole cell phones before forcing Sullivan into his car and driving off. Authorities suspect the abduction is financially motivated, with a ransom expected. Sullivan, who arrived in South Africa with his family in 2018, was holding a prayer meeting with about 30 people when the incident occurred. Police are investigating the kidnapping, which highlights the increasing problem of kidnappings in South Africa.</p>

            <p>Hundreds of passengers were forced to spend the night on airplanes after two international flights from Mexico were diverted to Montgomery Regional Airport in Alabama, which lacks customs facilities. The flights were rerouted from Atlanta due to weather conditions, but the airport's inability to process international travelers left passengers stranded on the tarmac for hours. Delta Airlines has apologized for the incident and is offering full refunds to affected customers. Passengers were eventually allowed to disembark after 5 a.m. local time but were confined inside the airport.</p>

            <p>The resurrection of the dire wolf by Colossal Biosciences has ignited debate about conservation priorities and ethical considerations. Critics argue that resurrecting extinct species diverts resources from protecting existing endangered animals and their habitats. While Colossal claims to have created the first successfully de-extincted animal, scientists clarify that it's a genetically modified wolf, raising concerns about animal welfare and the potential for a life in captivity. Critics suggest that the focus should be on addressing the root causes of extinction, such as climate change and habitat destruction, rather than attempting to bring back long-dead species.</p>

            <p>Former President Barack Obama's preference for medium-well steak continues to spark debate among culinary enthusiasts. While many steak purists consider cooking beyond medium a culinary transgression, Obama defends his choice, stating, "That's just how I like it." Cooking steak to medium-well ensures it reaches an internal temperature of 145 to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, minimizing the risk of foodborne illnesses. Although controversial, Obama's steak order aligns with food safety guidelines, as rare or undercooked meat can harbor harmful bacteria.</p>

            <p>President Trump has authorized the U.S. military to take control of land at the US-Mexico border, allowing them to take a more direct role in securing the boundary. The order permits the Department of Defense to exercise jurisdiction over federal lands, including the Roosevelt Reservation, giving troops the right to detain immigrants accused of trespassing. Military activities may include border-barrier construction and the emplacement of detection equipment. Critics argue that the move circumvents the Posse Comitatus Act and represents an escalation of Trump's immigration enforcement policies.</p>
