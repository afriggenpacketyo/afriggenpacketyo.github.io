          <h2>China Reveals New Rocket-Like Vertical Takeoff and Landing Drone</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 22:00:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has unveiled a new military drone capable of vertical takeoff and landing, similar to a rocket. During a test in Sichuan province, the unmanned aerial vehicle demonstrated advanced autonomous capabilities, including target allocation and route planning, which are crucial for drone swarm operations. Developed by the state-owned Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, the drone resembles the U.S. military's MQ-35 V-BAT and combines the speed of a fixed-wing aircraft with the deployment flexibility of a quadcopter, as it does not require a runway.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are moving forward with a vote on President Trump's request to rescind approximately $9 billion in funding, primarily targeting foreign aid and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The effort has been complicated by internal party divisions and Democratic demands for a vote on releasing files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The Senate passed a slightly smaller version of the cuts, which also targets USAID and funding for public stations like NPR and PBS. The bill faces a tight deadline, after which the funds must be spent as originally allocated.</p>

          <p>The state of California has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration following its decision to cancel $4 billion in federal funding for the state's high-speed rail project. The lawsuit, filed by Attorney General Rob Bonta, argues the administration's action is unlawful, arbitrary, and politically motivated by President Trump's personal animus towards the project. Governor Gavin Newsom described the move as a "heartless attack on the Central Valley" that jeopardizes jobs. The administration cited significant budget shortfalls and missed deadlines as the reason for pulling the funds from the long-delayed project.</p>

          <p>President Trump has repeatedly expressed frustration with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, whom he appointed, over the central bank's decision to maintain relatively high interest rates to combat inflation. This article explains the Federal Reserve's role in setting monetary policy to achieve its dual mandate of low unemployment and stable prices, independent of political pressure. Trump's criticism also extends to a renovation project at the Fed's headquarters. While the legality of firing a Fed chair is untested, any such attempt could destabilize financial markets, a risk the president has acknowledged.</p>

          <p>U.S. Border Patrol agents conducted raids in Sacramento, including at a Home Depot, in a move seen as a direct challenge to California's sanctuary state policies. A Border Patrol chief recorded a video in front of the state capitol, stating, "There is no such thing as a sanctuary state." Governor Gavin Newsom's office condemned the actions as "illegal racial profiling." The enforcement actions come after a federal judge blocked agents from using racial profiling in arrests in Southern California, raising questions about whether the new raids violate court orders.</p>

          <p>The FDA has authorized Juul to keep its tobacco and menthol-flavored e-cigarettes on the U.S. market, reversing a 2022 order to remove them.

This decision is expected to face strong opposition from anti-tobacco groups and parents who blame Juul for fueling the teen vaping crisis. Juul, which previously discontinued its popular fruit flavors, will now be one of only two companies permitted to sell menthol vapes.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to produce its signature soda with cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup, a move he claims will improve the taste. The announcement aligns with a focus by health advocates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the perceived dangers of corn syrup. However, public health experts point out that cane sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are metabolically almost identical, and both contribute to health issues like diabetes and obesity when consumed in excess. The change is seen by some as a political gesture rather than a significant public health victory.</p>

This data comes amid concerns over economic growth due to potential U.S. tariffs. While persistent inflation supports the case for a rate hike, some analysts believe the Bank of Japan will wait until 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign vein condition. The diagnosis came after medical tests were conducted in response to mild swelling observed in his lower legs. A physician's note confirmed the condition is not serious and is common in his age group, stating Trump remains in "excellent health." The announcement followed public speculation prompted by photographs showing the president with swollen legs and bruised hands, which the White House attributed to frequent handshaking while taking aspirin.</p>

          <p>Five migrants deported from the United States to Eswatini under a third-country agreement are being held in solitary confinement for an indefinite period. The men, convicted of serious crimes like murder and child sexual assault in the U.S., were sent to the southern African nation because their home countries would not accept them. This action is part of a controversial Trump administration policy of deporting individuals to countries with which they have no ties, raising alarm from human rights groups due to Eswatini's poor human rights record, which includes reports of torture and unlawful killings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Labour Party has suspended MP Diane Abbott for a second time after she stated in a recent interview that she did not regret comments made in 2023 that led to her initial suspension. Last year, Abbott wrote a letter appearing to equate the prejudice faced by Jewish people with that experienced by redheads, for which she later apologized. The party's decision to suspend her again is seen as an effort to maintain consistency in its hardline stance against antisemitism under leader Keir Starmer. Abbott claims the Labour leadership wants her out of the party.</p>

          <p>CBS has announced it will end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in May 2026, retiring the entire "Late Show" franchise. The network described the move as a purely financial decision driven by the challenging advertising landscape in late-night television and not related to the show's content or performance. Colbert, who has hosted for a decade and consistently ranked #1 in broadcast late night, informed his audience of the decision, which he learned about the previous day. The cancellation reflects a broader industry shift as younger audiences increasingly consume short-form content on digital platforms.</p>

The lawsuit stemmed from the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal, alleging that officials failed to protect user data and violated a 2012 FTC consent order. Shareholders were seeking to have Zuckerberg and others reimburse Meta for over $8 billion in fines and legal costs the company incurred. Details of the settlement were not disclosed, but the agreement brings an end to a trial where Zuckerberg and former COO Sheryl Sandberg had been expected to testify.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. consumers are facing record-high beef prices this summer, with a pound of ground beef averaging $6.12 in June, an increase of nearly 12% from the previous year. This price surge is driven by a long-term decline in the U.S. cattle herd, which is now at its smallest size since 1951 due to factors like persistent drought and high feed costs. Additional pressures, including the suspension of cattle imports from Mexico due to a parasite outbreak and the potential impact of widespread tariffs, suggest that significant price relief for beef is unlikely in the near future.
