          <p>Authorities apprehended Vance Luther Boelter on Sunday, the suspect in the fatal shooting of Minnesota Democratic state Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, which was described as a politically motivated assassination. Boelter is also accused of shooting Democratic state Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, in a separate attack on Saturday morning, with the couple reported to be in stable condition. Law enforcement located what they believe to be the suspect's vehicle in Sibley County, Minnesota, finding "items of evidence" relevant to the investigation. Over 100 law enforcement officers and SWAT teams were involved in the search leading to Boelter's capture. Optimism surrounding the capture of the suspect brings a sense of relief to the reeling state of Minnesota. </p>

          <p>Residents in the Tokyo metropolitan area are increasingly opposing the construction of large data centers in residential zones, citing concerns about electricity shortages, heat islands, and obstruction of natural light. Industry groups are attempting to mediate between concerned locals and the tech companies building these facilities. In Hino, Tokyo, a proposed five-story data center faces opposition due to its height exceeding city ordinances. Some municipalities, like Tokyo's Koto Ward, are implementing regulations requiring earlier construction announcements and clear indications of heat-emitting units. The situation highlights the challenges of balancing technological infrastructure needs with community concerns. </p>

Technicians worked to restore services, requiring thousands of fiber splices, with some areas experiencing continued outages into the evening. Spectrum is collaborating with the Los Angeles Police Department and offering a reward for information leading to an arrest, highlighting the broader issue of wire theft affecting the telecommunications industry.

          <p>America's JJ Spaun overcame challenging conditions to win the US Open on a chaotic final day at Oakmont Country Club. Spaun holed an incredible 65-foot birdie putt on the last to win his first major. Robert MacIntyre applauded when the putt dropped. At one stage on the back nine, five players shared the lead. </p>
