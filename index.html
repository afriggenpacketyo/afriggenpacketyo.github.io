          <h2>Yale Alumni Express Concerns Over Treasury Secretary's Role in Trump Administration</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-25 20:52:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of Yale University alumni penned a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, a fellow alumnus, expressing their deep concern over his role in the Trump administration. They argue that the administration's actions undermine democratic principles and could lead to authoritarianism. The letter cites examples such as alleged attacks on independent media, universities, and the justice system. Bessent responded by dismissing the letter as a partisan attack from close-minded progressives, defending his service in the Trump administration as an honor. The alumni group says they sent a similar letter earlier in March but did not receive a reply.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small business owners are appealing for exemptions from the Trump administration's tariffs on foreign goods, citing threats to their livelihoods. Senator Ed Markey has urged the Small Business Administration to provide relief, highlighting the vulnerability of small businesses due to thin margins and limited resources. While large corporations have received exemptions, small businesses struggle to absorb price shocks and navigate complex supply chains. The tariffs, including those on Chinese imports, are defended by the administration as measures to protect domestic manufacturing and generate federal revenue.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has drafted a counterproposal to a White House peace plan, outlining potential compromises while also presenting obstacles for the Kremlin. The Ukrainian plan suggests no restrictions on its military size and proposes a European security contingent backed by the U.S. to guarantee security. Frozen Russian assets would be used for reconstruction. The plan notably omits demands for the full return of all territory seized by Russia or insistence on NATO membership, suggesting a willingness to negotiate on these previously non-negotiable issues. However, key provisions may be unacceptable to the Kremlin.</p>

          <p>Shedeur Sanders, son of Deion Sanders, experienced a surprising slide in the NFL Draft, not being selected in the first round and then being passed over by the New Orleans Saints in the second round. This occurred despite projections that he could have been a top pick. The decision has sparked debate, with some attributing it to racial bias and others to concerns about his playing style. Former President Trump and Representative Jamaal Bowman have weighed in on the situation, adding to the controversy surrounding Sanders' draft position.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has revoked a Biden-era policy that protected journalists in leak investigations, potentially allowing authorities to subpoena reporters and compel testimony. Attorney General Pam Bondi justified the decision by citing the need to prevent federal employees from leaking sensitive information, arguing that it undermines the rule of law. The move marks a return to a more aggressive approach to leak investigations, similar to those used during the Trump and Obama administrations. Advocates for press freedom argue that these protections are vital for enabling journalists to uncover and report important stories.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) claims to have saved over $10 billion weekly since President Trump took office, but BBC Verify's analysis suggests these figures lack solid evidence. The department focuses on cancelling contracts and reducing the workforce, but accounting errors and overstated savings have been highlighted. Doge claims it is working to upload receipts in a transparent manner. The analysis questions the basis for Doge's largest claimed savings, finding that some figures are based on speculative and never-used amounts.</p>
