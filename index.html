          <p>Space technology firm Firefly Aerospace has raised the expected share price for its initial public offering to between $41 and $43, which could value the company at over $6 billion. This updated range would raise nearly $697 million, an increase from the previous target of a $5.5 billion valuation. The move reflects growing investor interest in the space sector, with companies like SpaceX achieving high valuations. Firefly, known for its Alpha rockets and lunar landers, has seen significant revenue growth and holds partnerships with NASA and major defense contractors like Northrop Grumman.

          <p>Following a weak jobs report, market sentiment is leaning towards the Federal Reserve implementing an interest rate cut in September, a move expected to boost stock markets. This comes amid controversy over the jobs data itself, which has been politicized. Separately, analysis from Morgan Stanley indicates that major tech companies, or "hyperscalers," are projected to significantly increase capital expenditure on AI infrastructure, with spending expected to grow 56% in 2025. This sustained investment signals strong confidence in the long-term profitability and demand for generative AI technologies across the tech industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters experienced a significant surge of over 20% after former President Donald Trump praised the company's new advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The campaign, which uses the slogan "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans," had previously faced criticism for its perceived double entendre and for being out of touch. Trump's endorsement on social media reversed a recent slump in the stock's performance, highlighting the powerful, and often unpredictable, impact of cultural and political discourse on market behavior. The event has also generated a massive spike in online search interest for the brand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major political conflict is escalating in Texas, where Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to remove Democratic state legislators from office if they do not return to the statehouse. The lawmakers fled Texas to deny Republicans the quorum needed to pass a controversial new congressional map, which could create up to five new Republican-held seats. Democrats are holding events in other states to protest the move, which they argue is an attempt to rig future elections and disenfranchise minority voters. The governor has set a deadline for their return, raising constitutional questions about his authority to oust elected officials.</p>

She led the agency from 1992 to 1996, a period of significant transformation that included MI5 taking lead responsibility for countering Irish republican terrorism in Great Britain. As the first director general to be publicly named upon appointment, she ushered in an era of greater transparency for the historically secretive organization. After her retirement, she became a successful novelist, and she was also widely credited as the inspiration for the character M in the James Bond films.</p>

As of August 1, interest has resumed accruing for these borrowers, which could add hundreds of dollars to their debt each month if they do not switch to an active repayment plan. Staying in the forbearance also means borrowers will not make progress toward loan forgiveness programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness. The Department of Education has recommended that borrowers switch to another plan, with many experts suggesting the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan as the most viable current option.

The author contends that this "lively experiment" has allowed both religion and government to thrive independently, preventing the religious conflicts that have plagued other nations. However, recent trends, such as legislation in states like Louisiana and Texas to post the Ten Commandments in schools and the use of taxpayer funds for religious education, are eroding this foundational wall.

          <p>Eurostar passengers traveling between London and Paris are experiencing major disruptions, with numerous trains delayed or canceled due to a power supply problem on a high-speed rail line in northern France. The issue, which began Monday morning, has forced trains to be rerouted onto slower lines, causing delays of up to five hours. The disruption affects a peak travel period during school holidays, impacting thousands of travelers. French rail operator SNCF Réseau is conducting major repairs and anticipates that normal service may not resume until the following day. Eurostar has advised passengers to postpone their journeys if possible.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced a six-month delay on its planned retaliatory tariffs against the United States, which were originally set to take effect this week. This suspension provides time for both sides to implement the broader trade agreement reached in late July between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and former President Trump. The political agreement, which includes a 15% tariff on most EU goods, is intended to restore stability and predictability for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. The European Commission stated it is working with the U.S. to finalize the details of their joint statement on the deal.</p>

          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale has died in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, following an incident with a 21-foot boat. According to New Jersey State Police, the whale reportedly charged at the vessel, causing it to nearly capsize and throwing one passenger overboard, though no humans were injured. The Marine Mammal Stranding Center was alerted, but the whale was confirmed to have died shortly after the collision and was found resting on a shallow sandbar. Officials plan to tow the whale to a nearby state park to conduct a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death and investigate the circumstances of the unusual encounter.</p>

          <p>Amazon is laying off approximately 110 employees from its Wondery podcast unit as part of a significant restructuring of its audio business. The head of Wondery, CEO Jen Sargent, is also stepping down. As part of the changes, some of Wondery's teams will be consolidated under Amazon's Audible division, which focuses on audiobooks and podcasts. The company is separating its teams that handle narrative podcasts from those that develop creator-led shows, a move intended to better address the evolving podcast landscape, particularly the rise of video podcasts on platforms like YouTube. The restructuring aims to better align teams and create an improved experience for creators and advertisers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A randomized controlled clinical trial has found that people lost twice as much weight when eating a diet of minimally processed, home-style meals compared to a diet of ultraprocessed foods, even when the latter were designed to be nutritionally healthy. Over eight weeks, participants on the minimally processed diet naturally consumed fewer calories and lost more weight and body fat. This occurred despite both diets meeting the UK's official nutritional guidelines for fat, sugar, salt, and fiber. The findings suggest that the level of food processing itself, beyond just nutrient content, plays a significant role in calorie consumption and weight management.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that a makeshift migrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," will serve as a model for a new network of state-run facilities.

The Florida facility, located in isolated swampland, has faced legal challenges and criticism from attorneys over its legality and the conditions for detainees. Noem argued the model is a cost-effective and deterrent-focused strategy, part of a broader push to enforce immigration laws more strictly.</p>

          <p>The firing of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer by former President Trump has drawn sharp criticism from former agency heads and non-partisan economic groups. Critics, including a group led by both a Trump and an Obama-appointed former commissioner, called the move baseless and stated that it undermines the credibility of federal economic data, which is essential for decision-making. Trump had alleged, without evidence, that the recent weak jobs report was "faked" and "rigged." The groups are calling on Congress to investigate the firing and ensure the non-partisan integrity of the position is protected from political interference.</p>

While expectations for a breakthrough in Kyiv are low, there is hope that the shift in rhetoric could lead to more tangible U.S. support for Ukraine.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key regulation known as the "60% rule" significantly impacts senior homeowners using a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), a common type of reverse mortgage. This FHA rule limits borrowers to withdrawing no more than 60% of their total loan proceeds during the first year. The regulation was designed to prevent homeowners from depleting their home equity too quickly, thereby promoting long-term financial stability. However, for seniors facing immediate large expenses, this cap can be a challenge, potentially forcing them to seek other, more expensive forms of credit to cover their needs while they wait to access the remainder of their funds.
