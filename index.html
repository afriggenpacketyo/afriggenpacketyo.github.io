          <p>An investment group led by Boston Celtics minority owner Steve Pagliuca has reportedly agreed to buy the WNBA's Connecticut Sun for a record $325 million. The deal, which is pending league approval, includes plans to relocate the team to Boston for the 2027 season and build a new $100 million practice facility. The sale marks a significant increase in franchise value compared to previous WNBA team sales and comes amid a period of rapid growth and expansion for the league. The Mohegan Tribe, the current owner, had purchased the team for $10 million in 2003.</p>

The ongoing stalemate has kept senators in Washington past their scheduled recess, with President Trump urging his party to remain and force the confirmations through.

          <p>Syria's defense ministry and the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have accused each other of initiating an attack in the northern city of Manbij. The Syrian government claims an SDF rocket barrage injured four soldiers and three civilians, calling the act irresponsible. In response, the SDF stated they were retaliating against an unprovoked artillery assault on civilian areas by factions aligned with the Syrian government. This incident raises concerns about the stability of a recent integration deal signed in March, which aims to merge the Kurdish-led forces with Syrian state institutions.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery surrounding the death of a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill during World War II has been solved. The platypus, named Winston, was a diplomatic gift from Australia in 1943 but died during its voyage to the UK. While rumors long suggested it died from shell-shock due to a nearby Nazi U-boat attack, archival research has revealed a more mundane cause. Logbooks show that Winston likely succumbed to heatstroke as the ship crossed the equator, as water and air temperatures far exceeded the safe threshold for the species.</p>

This move aims to disrupt the business models of people-smuggling gangs, who increasingly use social media to offer services like fake documents and passage to the UK.

          <p>The average monthly cost for a nursing home in Germany has surged to €3,248, a figure that is increasingly unaffordable for many retirees and is placing the system under immense strain. This sharp rise is attributed to necessary wage increases for care staff and higher staffing levels. With the gap between income and care costs widening dramatically, German Health Minister Nina Warken has called for urgent reform of the country's long-term care insurance system. The situation highlights the broader demographic and economic challenges facing Germany as its population ages. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England is facing the monumental task of chasing a target of 374 runs to win the final Test against India at The Oval, a feat that would be a remarkable achievement. The team's situation was made more difficult by the loss of key all-rounder Ben Stokes to injury and a late wicket on day three. The article reflects on England's depleted fast-bowling resources throughout the grueling series, which has seen them bowl significantly more overs than India. A win would be a stunning victory, but a loss would mean a drawn 2-2 series and regrets over missed opportunities.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Special Counsel (OSC), an independent federal agency, has confirmed it opened an investigation into former Special Counsel Jack Smith for potential violations of the Hatch Act. The probe follows a referral from Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who alleged that Smith's investigations into President Donald Trump were politically motivated to harm his 2024 election prospects. The Hatch Act restricts the political activities of federal employees. It remains unclear what action the OSC could take against Smith, who is no longer a government employee, though it could refer findings to the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Romania is taking steps to more openly acknowledge its history regarding the genocide of its Sinti and Roma populations during World War II, a topic long silenced in the country. At a recent event commemorating the European Day of Remembrance, Romania's new president and other officials called for the nation to grapple with its past and combat ongoing discrimination. During the war, Romania's pro-Nazi regime deported over 25,000 Roma to Transnistria, where most perished. The recent public discussions and educational initiatives signal a significant shift in addressing this dark chapter of the nation's history.</p>

          <p>The Police Federation of England and Wales has described a government-backed 4.2% pay increase for officers as barely enough to "tread water." While the raise is slightly above the current inflation rate, the federation argues it does little to reverse over a decade of real-terms pay cuts or address crises in retention and mental health. The Home Secretary framed the increase as a signal of gratitude, supported by £120 million in additional funding. However, the association representing front-line officers stated the raise is not enough to stop record resignations and assaults on police. (not investment advice)</p>
