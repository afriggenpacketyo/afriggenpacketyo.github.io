          <p>European stock markets advanced on Friday, as investors eagerly awaited a crucial U.S. jobs report anticipated to influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. The regional Stoxx 600 index saw gains, particularly in mining stocks, buoyed by recent payroll data that increased bets on a September rate cut without sparking fears of a severe economic downturn. Meanwhile, Danish wind farm developer Orsted adjusted its full-year earnings guidance downwards, citing lower-than-normal offshore wind speeds and legal challenges impacting its U.S. projects. This demonstrates a nuanced market environment balancing macroeconomic expectations with specific corporate performance issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK retail sales volumes increased by 0.6% in July, surpassing analyst forecasts, with sunny weather and the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 tournament cited as key drivers. This data, released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) after a two-week delay due to data quality concerns, showed a positive month-on-month rise. However, sales over the three months to July were down, and economists caution that the July boosts are unlikely to be sustained. The ONS apologized for past errors and outlined improvement plans, acknowledging the critical role of its statistics in government policy and Bank of England decisions.</p>

          <p>OpenAI announced plans to launch an AI-centered jobs platform and expand its "OpenAI Academy" with a new certification program, aiming to enhance AI literacy and connect talent with companies. This initiative could position OpenAI as a direct competitor to Microsoft's LinkedIn, despite Microsoft being a major investor in the AI startup. The platform intends to assist both large corporations and local businesses in finding AI talent, with a target of certifying 10 million Americans by 2030. These developments unfold amid discussions about AI's impact on the labor market, where roles requiring AI skills are commanding higher salaries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A United Nations weather agency report revealed that wildfires, increasingly frequent due to climate change, significantly contributed to air pollution last year. The World Meteorological Organization's bulletin emphasized the vast impact of fires in regions like the Amazon, Canada, and Siberia on air quality, specifically concerning harmful PM 2.5 particles. These particles, small enough to enter the bloodstream, pose growing risks to human health and ecosystems. While noting a decline in particle pollution in Eastern China due to reduction efforts, the report underscores the urgent need to address wildfires as a major environmental and public health challenge.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden recently underwent Mohs surgery for skin cancer, as confirmed by his spokeswoman. This procedure removes skin until no cancerous cells remain, following his previous removal of a cancerous skin lesion in 2023. Biden was also diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that had spread to his bones in May. The Biden family has been vocal advocates for cancer research and awareness, with their son Beau having died from brain cancer in 2015.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced plans to rename the Department of Defense as the "Department of War," with an executive order expected to authorize the use of "secondary titles" for the department and its secretary. While legislative approval is typically required for a permanent name change, Trump aims to proceed with this alteration, asserting it projects a "stronger message of readiness and resolve." The original War Department was consolidated into the Department of Defense in 1947 after World War II, a move that unified the armed forces under a single entity.</p>

          <p>This article critically assesses President Trump's plan to rename the Department of Defense as the "Department of War," calling it "inanity" and "cringe." The author argues the 1947 name change reflected a mature understanding of national security beyond mere warfare, a concept embraced by post-WWII leaders. The commentary suggests Trump and Secretary Pete Hegseth's preference for "War" over "Defense" stems from a desire to project a "tough guy" image, not strategic rationale. It concludes such a symbolic change is unlikely to impress global adversaries.</p>
