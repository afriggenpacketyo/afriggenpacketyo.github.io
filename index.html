          <p>President Trump's implementation of "reciprocal" tariffs has introduced significant volatility and uncertainty into the global economy and stock markets. While some financial advisors recommend a long-term perspective, noting the market's historical resilience, others suggest tactical adjustments for investors. Market strategists point to opportunities in sectors less exposed to tariffs, such as financials and utilities, and the use of ETFs to manage risk and target specific areas like cryptocurrency or nuclear energy. The article highlights that while the environment is tricky, strategic investment opportunities still exist for those willing to look. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced his intention for a new census that excludes undocumented immigrants, a move that faces significant legal and logistical hurdles. The U.S. Constitution mandates a decennial count of all persons for congressional apportionment, and the Supreme Court previously blocked the Trump administration's attempt to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. This article explains that the census process is a multi-year undertaking planned far in advance, with the 2020 count having already undercounted minority populations. Any change would have major repercussions on congressional representation and federal funding distribution across the states.</p>

          <p>This article draws a parallel between President Trump's recent firing of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) commissioner and President Nixon's actions in 1971. It recounts how Nixon, angered by jobs numbers, sought to purge the BLS of Jewish employees whom he baselessly suspected of disloyalty, though he was ultimately constrained by political norms. The author argues that Trump's public dismissal of the commissioner for producing "rigged" data is an abuse of power that even the paranoid Nixon did not dare to commit so openly. The analysis suggests a dangerous erosion of institutional norms and checks on presidential authority.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record $1.21 trillion and interest rates near all-time highs, many consumers are considering debt forgiveness as a solution. This strategy typically involves stopping payments to creditors and negotiating to settle the debt for a lump sum that is less than the total amount owed. On average, consumers can reduce their balances by 30% to 50% before fees, though results vary based on factors like financial hardship and negotiation skill. While this approach can damage credit scores and have tax implications, it may offer a faster path to becoming debt-free for those in serious financial distress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a Trump administration executive order to broaden the availability of crypto in retirement plans, this article explores the role of cryptocurrency ETFs for long-term investors. It highlights the explosive growth and record inflows into products like BlackRock's Bitcoin Trust, which offer exposure to digital assets without the need for a crypto wallet. The analysis contrasts standard crypto ETFs with more aggressive leveraged funds, which are designed for short-term trading and carry significantly higher risk. The piece advises that for steady, long-term exposure, non-leveraged ETFs that simply track the price of a token are the more suitable option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Democratic Senators Ron Wyden and Elizabeth Warren are demanding internal documents from UnitedHealth Group regarding a program that offers financial bonuses to nursing homes for reducing hospital transfers. This request follows an investigation alleging the healthcare giant may be prioritizing its bottom line over the health of nursing home residents by incentivizing the avoidance of potentially necessary hospital care. The senators expressed concern that the bonus metric does not distinguish between avoidable and unavoidable hospitalizations. UnitedHealth defends the program, stating it curbs unnecessary hospital visits and improves care coordination, and denies any wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>Several Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, have sent a letter to Google and YouTube inquiring about settlement discussions for a censorship lawsuit filed by Donald Trump. The senators are concerned about a potential "quid-pro-quo" arrangement where Google might settle the suit in exchange for favorable treatment from the Trump administration on other legal matters. The letter notes that Google is currently facing major government antitrust and labor lawsuits.

          <p>The global oil market is largely dismissing President Trump's threats to impose heavy secondary tariffs on countries that purchase Russian oil, with prices closing lower. Traders appear to believe the threats are a negotiation tactic and that the administration will ultimately back down to avoid a spike in energy prices. The administration recently targeted India, Russia's largest oil customer, with a 25% tariff, a much lower rate than the 100% initially threatened. Analysts suggest that if the U.S. were to enforce harsh sanctions that significantly curb Russia's ability to sell oil, it would remove supply from the market and cause gasoline prices to soar.

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has updated its 2025 Atlantic hurricane season forecast, now predicting a 50% chance of above-normal activity. The new outlook calls for 13 to 18 named storms, of which five to nine are expected to become hurricanes, including two to five major hurricanes. This is a slight decrease from the agency's May forecast but still points to an active season, influenced by warm ocean temperatures and neutral El Niño conditions. Officials urge communities in storm-prone areas to remain prepared as the season enters its peak period between mid-August and mid-October.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly demanded the immediate resignation of Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan, accusing him of being "highly conflicted" due to alleged ties to China. The accusation appears to stem from Mr. Tan's past investments in Chinese companies, some of which the U.S. government has linked to the Chinese military. This unusual presidential demand on a private company executive comes as Intel, a recipient of billions in U.S. government subsidies, announced it was scaling back some U.S. manufacturing investments. The White House defended the president's call, stating a commitment to ensuring leaders of iconic American companies are trustworthy.</p>

They argue that converting these political appointees to career civil service roles could violate laws against political patronage.

          <p>This opinion piece posits that the decline of politeness, exacerbated by online interactions and AI, is detrimental to personal well-being. The author argues that being polite, even to nonhuman entities like AI bots, reinforces positive behavior and can increase happiness and lower anger. Conversely, rudeness and sarcasm, whether expressed or consumed, contribute to a negative state of mind. The article suggests three rules for personal conduct: make courtesy a habit in all interactions, renounce snark, and respond to rudeness with dignity. Practicing politeness is framed as a countercultural act of personal freedom in an increasingly uncivil world.</p>
