          <p>Two easyJet planes experienced a minor ground incident at Manchester Airport, where their wings clipped while taxiing on the runway. Airport operations were briefly suspended for assessment but resumed quickly as the aircraft were able to return to the stand without further issue. No injuries were reported as a result of the collision, and an investigation into the circumstances is currently underway. The airline is managing travel arrangements for the passengers who were affected by the event.</p>

          <p>The deployment of National Guard troops to Washington D.C. by the Trump administration has raised concerns about authoritarianism, but legal experts suggest such an action would be difficult to replicate in other cities. Unlike the capital, which falls under direct federal jurisdiction, states have command over their own National Guard units, presenting a significant obstacle to unilateral presidential intervention. A pending court case in California could further clarify and potentially limit the president's authority to deploy military personnel for domestic law enforcement, as critics argue the D.C. move is a political maneuver.</p>

          <p>During India's 78th Independence Day address, Prime Minister Narendra Modi advocated for national self-reliance, particularly in energy and defense, while facing the threat of increased U.S. tariffs. Modi's speech underscored the importance of achieving energy independence to reduce reliance on other nations, a subtle response to U.S. pressure over India's purchase of Russian oil. He also issued a stern warning to Pakistan against future threats, stating that India will no longer tolerate what he termed "nuclear blackmail." The address highlighted India's assertive foreign and domestic policy stance in a complex geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has started canceling flights in anticipation of a potential strike by its 10,000 flight attendants, which could ground the airline's operations by Saturday. The union issued a 72-hour strike notice after contract negotiations stalled over demands for better wages and compensation for unpaid work time. The airline responded with a lockout notice and has begun a gradual suspension of services, expecting to impact over 100,000 customers by Friday evening. Air Canada is offering full refunds for canceled flights and is attempting to arrange alternative travel options with other carriers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's approach to international trade is fundamentally challenging the core principles that have governed the global system under the World Trade Organization (WTO).

Other key principles at risk include the 'single undertaking' rule preventing cherry-picking of agreements and 'national treatment' requiring equal handling of foreign and local companies. The erosion of this framework threatens to create a more fragmented and unpredictable global trading environment.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are scheduled to meet in Anchorage, Alaska, for a high-stakes summit aimed at finding a path to end the war in Ukraine. The meeting will take place at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, chosen for its security capabilities. The talks come after previous negotiation rounds failed to produce a ceasefire, with Trump setting a deadline for Putin to agree to terms or face more severe sanctions. While the White House has framed the summit as a "listening exercise," the primary goal is to de-escalate the conflict, though Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is not expected to attend.</p>

          <p>Undefeated British heavyweight boxer Moses Itauma, 20, is set for the most significant fight of his young career as he faces veteran Dillian Whyte in Saudi Arabia. Itauma, who has an impressive record of 12 wins with 10 knockouts, is seen as a major rising star in the division with a style that draws comparisons to champion Oleksandr Usyk. A victory against a well-known opponent like Whyte would significantly elevate Itauma's profile and potentially position him for a future world title shot. The fight is considered a critical test to see if the highly-touted prospect can live up to the considerable hype surrounding him.</p>

Experts warn that the increased demand could strain national grids and water supplies, potentially leading to higher utility bills for consumers.

Speaking on the anniversary of Korea's liberation, Lee stated his government would take proactive steps to rebuild trust, citing the recent cessation of propaganda broadcasts and leaflet balloon launches.

Another possibility involves freezing the current frontlines, particularly in the southern regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.

This trend reflects a broader 'spending pause' among global consumers, where selective splurging on treats coexists with budget-conscious purchasing.

          <h2>Practical Tips and Scientific Insights for Improving Sleep Quality, Especially During Hot Weather</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 02:14:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Achieving quality sleep can be challenging, particularly during summer heatwaves, but several evidence-based strategies can help. Daily exercise is proven to increase sleep duration and quality by boosting melatonin production and reducing stress. It is also advisable to avoid caffeine in the afternoon and evening, as its effects can linger for many hours and disrupt natural sleep cycles. Reducing screen time before bed is crucial, as the light and mental stimulation can interfere with the body's ability to wind down, with reading a book being a recommended alternative for better sleep hygiene.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals China's Textile Industry Produced Over One Billion Tonnes of Fiber in Four Decades</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive study by Tsinghua University has quantified the massive output of China's textile industry, revealing that it produced more than a gigatonne (one billion tonnes) of fibers between 1978 and 2022. This period of rapid economic growth positioned China as the world's clothing manufacturer, accounting for over half of global processing capacity. However, the research also highlights a significant environmental challenge, with the waste recovery rate for these textiles at only 17 percent in China. Most of this recovered material is downcycled into lower-quality products, underscoring the need for more sustainable practices.</p>

          <p>The arrival of U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage for a summit on the Ukraine war has elicited strong and varied reactions from local Alaskans. Many residents with Ukrainian heritage gathered to protest Putin's presence, expressing anger that a leader they view as a war criminal is being hosted in their state. Conversely, others, including local fishermen and members of the Orthodox Church with historical ties to Russia, voiced hope that the high-stakes meeting could finally lead to a peaceful resolution of the devastating conflict. The summit's location in Alaska adds a layer of historical resonance, as the U.S. purchased the territory from Russia in 1867.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has struck down two directives from the Trump administration that sought to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs in schools and universities. The ruling found that the Department of Education acted unlawfully when it threatened to withhold federal funding from institutions that continued DEI initiatives. The judge determined that the guidance, which broadly interpreted a Supreme Court ruling on admissions, created a "sea change" in regulation and illegally chilled protected speech. This decision marks a significant victory for educational and civil rights groups that had challenged the policy as government overreach.</p>

          <p>New home prices in China's major cities fell by 0.3 percent in July, matching the previous month's decline and indicating that government stimulus efforts have not yet revived the struggling property market. This marks a continuation of a downward trend that has persisted for over two years, with consumer confidence remaining low and potential buyers opting to save rather than invest in real estate. Despite measures such as lower mortgage rates and eased purchasing restrictions, the sector continues to face challenges, with major developers still grappling with significant debt burdens.

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has weighed in on the ongoing transfer saga involving Newcastle striker Alexander Isak, stating that it will be very difficult for the player to remain at the club.

Rooney suggests that due to financial regulations, it might ultimately benefit Newcastle to sell the star striker to free up funds for strengthening the overall squad.

          <p>Surrey Police have initiated a campaign called 'Jog On' to address the under-reported issue of street harassment and catcalling directed at female joggers. The operation involves female police officers running undercover in plain clothes in targeted areas, with uniformed colleagues nearby to intervene and educate perpetrators. An officer participating in the campaign described the behavior as making her feel "horrible" and "icky," highlighting the negative impact it has on women's sense of safety. The initiative was prompted by a local survey where 94% of female residents reported experiencing harassment, yet nearly half never reported it.</p>
