          <p>Celebrations following Paris Saint-Germain's Champions League victory were marred by violence across France, resulting in two deaths and numerous arrests. In Dax, a 17-year-old boy died from a stabbing, while in Paris, a 23-year-old man was killed in a vehicle accident. Wild celebrations included setting off flares, smashing bus shelters, and torching cars, leading to 192 injuries and 559 arrests nationwide, with 491 in Paris alone. French President Emmanuel Macron congratulated PSG on their victory. The events highlight the delicate balance between celebratory fervor and public safety. The optimism score for this article is relatively low due to the tragic loss of life and widespread violence during what should have been a joyous occasion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reports indicate that over 20 Palestinians were killed and numerous others injured near a Gaza aid distribution site, with witnesses alleging Israeli forces opened fire. Hamas claimed 30 deaths and accused naval warships, tanks, and drones of firing upon the crowd gathering to receive food amidst a monthslong Israeli blockade. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), backed by Israel and the US, asserted it distributed aid "without incident," dismissing reports of deaths and chaos. UN agencies have declined collaboration with the GHF, citing Israeli control over aid distribution as a violation of humanitarian principles. The incident underscores the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza and the contentious nature of aid delivery. The optimism score is low due to the reported loss of life and the ongoing humanitarian crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of Jared Isaacman's nomination to lead NASA, citing a "thorough review" of Isaacman's "prior associations," without elaborating on the specific reasons. Isaacman, a tech billionaire and associate of Elon Musk, had been Trump's pick for the role since December and had received Senate committee approval in April. Musk expressed his disappointment, praising Isaacman's competence and character. The decision comes after Musk's departure from his government role heading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The situation introduces uncertainty into NASA's leadership and future direction. The optimism score is neutral, reflecting the change in leadership without inherent positive or negative implications.</p>

          <p>China maintained a low profile at the Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's largest security summit, marked by the absence of the defense minister and the cancellation of a plenary session on China's security. Traditionally, Chinese military delegations actively countered American messaging at the forum, but this year's response was led by military academic institutions. The absence of Defense Minister Dong Jun meant there were no bilateral talks between China and other countries, including the US, despite concerns about China's military capabilities. Other countries seeking bilateral discussions were also reportedly disappointed, with the Chinese delegation indicating they were not conducting such engagements during the dialogue. The situation raises questions about China's strategic intentions and diplomatic approach in the region. The optimism score is neutral, reflecting the ambiguity surrounding China's actions and motivations.</p>

          <p>Following an IAEA report indicating Iran is increasing its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi spoke with IAEA Director Rafael Mariano Grossi, stressing Iran's "continuous cooperation."

Araghchi emphasized that Iran's nuclear activities are within agreements and monitored by the IAEA, while also requesting Grossi ensure the agency isn't exploited for political agendas. Iran's deputy foreign minister rejected many of the report's findings, noting the high number of IAEA inspections in Iran.
