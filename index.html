          <p>Ten-year-old Oliver Price has been formally identified as the schoolboy tragically killed in a coach crash in Somerset. The incident, which occurred last Thursday near Wheddon Cross, involved a coach carrying Minehead Middle School pupils that left the road and slid down a 20-foot slope. A major incident was declared, and 21 people were initially hospitalized, with five, including two children, remaining in stable condition. Avon and Somerset Police are conducting a thorough investigation to determine the cause, a process expected to take time. The community has shown immense support, reflecting its close-knit nature during this unimaginably difficult period for Oliver's family.</p>

          <h2>Texas Legislature Convenes Special Session for Congressional Redistricting Amid Trump's Influence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 12:58:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Texas Legislature has convened a special session to redraw the state's congressional map, a move reportedly pushed by former President Trump to potentially increase GOP seats in the U.S. House. This mid-decade redistricting follows the 2020 Census, which initially resulted in Republicans holding 25 of 38 seats. Critics argue the effort is politically motivated, aiming to secure an edge for the GOP in upcoming elections, rather than reflecting state dynamics. The previous 2021 map faced legal challenges over alleged racial gerrymandering, with 95% of Texas' growth driven by non-White voters. Experts warn that gaining more seats might require undermining the political power of communities of color, risking further lawsuits and potential political peril.</p>

          <h2>Mother and Disabled Daughter Found Deceased Months After Unanswered 999 Call in Nottingham</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 12:54:47 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A mother, Alphonsine Djiako Leuga, 47, and her 18-year-old disabled daughter, Loraine Choulla, were found dead in their Nottingham home in May 2024, believed to have been undiscovered for weeks or months. An inquest revealed Alphonsine had called 999 in February, reporting she was cold and couldn't move, but an ambulance was not dispatched. East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) apologized for the "missed opportunity," as a call handler mistakenly closed the call. Alphonsine's death was attributed to pneumonia, while Loraine, who was entirely dependent on her mother, had an "unascertained" cause of death, with malnutrition or dehydration not ruled out. The inquest continues to investigate the circumstances, including whether Alphonsine died on the day of her 999 call.</p>

          <p>A double-decker bus in Eccles, Salford, had its roof torn off after colliding with a bridge at the junction of Barton Road and Trafford Road, resulting in 15 injuries. All injured individuals were treated at the scene by North West Ambulance Service, which deployed 10 emergency ambulances and a hazard response team, and were subsequently transported to Salford Royal or Manchester Royal Infirmary hospitals. Emergency services, including an air ambulance, rapidly responded to the incident, which occurred around 3:00 PM BST. Road closures were implemented, with police advising the public to avoid the area. This marks a repeat incident, as a bus previously lost its roof after striking the same bridge in April 2023, highlighting an ongoing safety concern at this location.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As college costs continue to escalate, federal student loans serve as a primary funding source, offering unique borrower protections. However, these loans have borrowing limits that vary based on dependency status, academic year, and student level (undergraduate or graduate). For instance, independent undergraduates have a lifetime limit of $57,500, which often falls short of the average annual costs, especially at private institutions. When federal loans are insufficient, private student loans can bridge the funding gap, allowing borrowing up to the full cost of attendance. While private loans may offer lower interest rates, they typically require a credit check and careful consideration of repayment terms, emphasizing the importance of a thoughtful financial plan to manage student debt effectively.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly threatened the Washington Commanders football team, stating he will not facilitate a new stadium deal in Washington, D.C., unless the team reverts to its former "Redskins" name. Trump called the current "Commanders" moniker "ridiculous" and urged an immediate change to restore the team's "heritage and prestige." The Commanders dropped their previous name in 2020 due to racist connotations toward Native Americans, adopting the current name in 2022. Team managing partner Josh Harris has previously stated there are no plans to change the name. This demand comes as the Senate passed a bill allowing the federal government to lease land for a potential new stadium.</p>

          <p>With individuals spending an average of 4 hours and 37 minutes daily on their phones, smartphone addiction has become a prevalent global issue, impacting mental and physical health. Studies link problematic smartphone use to increased depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and physical pain. This behavioral addiction shares symptoms with gambling or video-game addiction, often serving as an escapist tool from stress. Scientists recommend a multi-faceted approach to quitting, including leaving phones out of bedrooms, reducing notifications, setting screens to black-and-white, and using self-control apps. The more methods applied simultaneously, the higher the long-term success rate, with some clinical trials showing short-term effectiveness in reducing problematic use. Understanding the root cause of addiction and seeking professional help, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, are also crucial steps.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has issued warnings about "active attacks" exploiting vulnerabilities in its on-premises SharePoint collaboration software, affecting global businesses and governments. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) confirmed that the flaw allows unauthenticated access, enabling attackers to gain full control of SharePoint content and execute code. While Microsoft released patches for two versions, a 2016 version remains vulnerable. Security researchers at Palo Alto Networks estimate thousands of organizations worldwide could be impacted, highlighting that the vulnerability allows hackers to impersonate users even after patching. This breach is particularly concerning as SharePoint often connects to other Microsoft services, raising fears of widespread data theft and password harvesting.</p>

Kennedy Jr. from his position as Health Secretary, criticizing him as a "peddler of junk science" and vaccine skeptic.

Bloomberg argues Kennedy's actions, including equivocating on vaccine benefits, directly undermine public confidence, potentially leading to unnecessary suffering and deaths.

          <p>A Canadian man, Luciano Frattolin, has been charged with second-degree murder and concealment of a corpse in the death of his 9-year-old daughter, Melina Galanis Frattolin, whose body was found in a shallow pond in upstate New York. Authorities allege Frattolin killed his daughter during a U.S. vacation, hid her body, and then fabricated a story that she was abducted by strangers near Lake George. The New York State Police issued an Amber Alert and launched a massive search before discovering inconsistencies in Frattolin's account, leading to his arrest. A motive for the alleged killing remains under investigation, with police noting no prior criminal history or domestic violence concerns.</p>

          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary announced the airline is considering increasing the €1.50 bonus paid to staff for identifying passengers with oversized carry-on bags. This initiative aims to "eliminate the scourge of oversized bags" that delay boarding and are unfair to the vast majority of passengers who comply with rules. O'Leary stated that while only a small minority incur these fees, the airline is determined to reduce excess baggage issues. He expressed confidence that incentivizing staff with a share of these fees will lead to a decline in oversized bags over time. The announcement comes as Ryanair reported a significant jump in profits for the April to June period, supported by fare increases and cost control.</p>

Separately, Rachel Bee, diagnosed with Crohn's disease at 13, transformed her personal discomfort during treatments into innovation. She invented "Infusion Hero," a sweatshirt with a zippered sleeve designed to keep patients warm while maintaining IV access, now receiving pre-orders.

          <p>UK media regulator Ofcom has urged YouTube to give greater prominence to content from public service broadcasters (PSBs) like the BBC and ITV, citing a "serious threat" to their future. The report highlights that children spend significantly more time on YouTube than on traditional PSBs, risking a disconnect with British-made content. Ofcom suggests urgent collaboration between broadcasters and YouTube to ensure their content is easily discoverable, and recommends government consideration of legislation to mandate this. The regulator also stressed that PSBs must improve their content to appeal to digital audiences. This push aims to safeguard impartial news and culturally relevant programming amidst evolving consumption habits and financial challenges for traditional media.</p>

COVID-related emergency room visits for young children are at their highest since March. While chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook notes a gradual decrease in deaths and hospitalizations each season, he warns against complacency, especially for vulnerable populations like very young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. The latest variants, Nimbus and Stratus, are not considered more deadly, and current vaccines are effective against them. The CDC now recommends "shared clinical decision-making" for COVID-19 vaccination, particularly for healthy children, while still advising it for most adults.</p>

          <h2>Liam Dawson Returns to England Test Cricket Team After Eight-Year Absence</h2>

          <p>Spinner Liam Dawson will play his first Test match for England in eight years, having been named in the squad to face India at Old Trafford. The 35-year-old left-armer replaces injured off-spinner Shoaib Bashir and boosts England's lower-order batting, boasting 18 first-class hundreds. Dawson's return marks his fourth Test cap, with his last appearance being in July 2017, spanning 102 Tests. Despite previously being "realistic" about his England prospects, his recent T20 recall paved the way for this Test opportunity. England, leading the series 2-1, aims to secure a series victory, a feat not achieved in a five-Test series since 2018.</p>

          <p>The wreckage of HMS Nottingham, a Royal Navy warship sunk during World War One, has been discovered in the North Sea, 60 miles off the coast of Scotland, 109 years after its demise. A team of ten divers from ProjectXplore identified the 492ft ship at a depth of 82 meters, confirming its identity through name stamps, dimensions, and equipment. The vessel was torpedoed three times by a German U-boat on August 19, 1916, resulting in the deaths of 38 crew members. The captain and 377 other crew were rescued. After a century of failed attempts, ProjectXplore's extensive research and sonar surveys led to this significant historical find, documenting the site this month.</p>

          <h2>Nurse Asserts Impartial Treatment of Trans Patients Amidst Tribunal Over Trans Doctor Encounter</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 11:29:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A clinical service manager at NHS Fife testified at a tribunal that nurse Charlotte Myles would not treat trans patients differently, despite an altercation with trans doctor Beth Upton. Myles, tasked with reviewing nurse Sandie Peggie's suspension, found no patient safety concerns, believing Peggie's personal feelings towards Dr. Upton could not be linked to patient care. Peggie, who claims her treatment was unlawful, reportedly told Myles she would treat all patients equally and expressed sympathy for trans people. Despite concerns from other senior staff about alleged past racist incidents, which Myles dismissed as unsubstantiated hearsay, Myles advocated for Peggie's return to work. Proposals were made to separate the two individuals to prevent further issues.</p>
