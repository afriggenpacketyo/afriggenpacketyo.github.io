          <p>Bitcoin's rally continued, reaching a new record high near $112,000, driven by increased institutional ownership, corporate adoption, and easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Positive momentum around U.S. crypto regulation and continued interest from institutional buyers have fueled the price surge. Despite a drop in U.S. equities, Bitcoin's price has diverged, potentially due to investors seeking alternative stores of value. President Trump's pro-crypto agenda and the Senate's advancement of crypto legislation have also supported the market, with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, a known skeptic, announcing that the bank will allow clients to buy the digital currency.

          <p>A report released by the White House's "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) commission, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., identifies poor diet, chemical exposure, lack of physical activity, and overmedicalization as key drivers of childhood chronic diseases. The report criticizes ultra-processed foods and the corporate influence on media while also mirroring some public health advice from the Biden administration. Despite some criticisms from current and former federal health officials, the report aims to spark urgent action to address the rising rates of chronic conditions in children. It also pledges to support U.S. farmers, acknowledging that changes in agriculture practices could have an adverse impact on the food supply.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from terminating the legal status of thousands of international students, citing that the students would "continue to suffer significant hardship" due to the administration's actions. The judge's nationwide injunction prevents immigration authorities from arresting or jailing the plaintiffs and those similarly situated, and from transferring them outside their jurisdiction. This ruling came after the administration's "Student Criminal Alien Initiative" terminated the SEVIS records of numerous students, effectively ending their legal status, despite lacking a criminal history that would pose a threat or render them deportable.</p>

          <p>In a 51-44 vote, the Senate blocked California's plan to phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles, a decision that could have nationwide implications. The vote was a victory for the oil and gas industry, with Republicans using a legislative tactic that Democrats denounced as a "nuclear" option. California leaders, including Governor Newsom and Attorney General Bonta, have vowed to challenge the Senate vote and restore the ban, arguing that it is essential for the state's economy, health, and global competitiveness. The article notes that this move comes as the Trump administration intends to weaken federal limits on emissions.</p>

          <p>As gold prices reach record highs, this article addresses three common myths about investing in gold. These include the misconception that gold's price always rises, the belief that inflation always causes gold's price to rise, and the idea that it's worth waiting for gold's price to fall before investing. The article clarifies that gold prices can fluctuate, inflation doesn't always correlate directly with price increases, and waiting for a significant price drop may not be a viable strategy.

          <p>Rapper Kid Cudi testified at Sean Combs's federal trial, recounting incidents of Combs's alleged jealous rage, including a break-in at his home and suspicion that Combs arranged the firebombing of his Porsche. Cudi described receiving a call from Casandra Ventura (Cassie), who was dating both men, and later finding Combs inside his home. He also recounted a later incident when his car was firebombed, adding to the government's narrative that Combs used violence as a tool. Another witness testified about seeing Cassie with injuries after an incident with Combs on a private jet.</p>

          <p>A White House report led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. blames a crisis of chronic disease in children on ultraprocessed foods, chemical exposures, lack of physical activity, stress, and excessive use of prescription drugs. The report highlights corporate influence in federal policymaking and calls for more research on the causes of disease and prevention. While diverging from standard government thinking, the report aligns with Kennedy's long-held views. Critics have raised concerns about the report's misrepresentation of scientific consensus and the administration's dismantling of public health and research efforts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is holding eight migrants in Djibouti after a judge blocked their deportation to South Sudan, citing a violation of a court order. The migrants, who include nationals from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, South Sudan, Myanmar, and Vietnam, are being held at a U.S. military base. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says the migrants have serious criminal records, while President Trump criticized the judge's ruling and defended the administration's efforts to ramp up deportations. The judge has ordered the Trump administration to give six men "reasonable fear" interviews to screen them for any concerns about being harmed in a third country.</p>

Harvard has called the revocation "unlawful" and is working to support its international students and scholars. A federal judge issued an injunction that could block the Trump administration from acting on its threat against international students currently enrolled at Harvard.</p>

The initial ban, based on the Navy's own search terms, included titles like "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" and "How to Be an Antiracist."

These arrests, part of a coordinated operation, have been reported in cities such as Phoenix, Miami, Los Angeles, and New York.

Ramaphosa's calm demeanor and measured responses drew praise.

Some of these claims are demonstrably false. There is anger and disappointment [in South Africa] about the way President Donald Trump handled the meeting. Additional reporting from Dianne Hawker.</p>
