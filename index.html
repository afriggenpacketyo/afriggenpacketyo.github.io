          <h2>Trump Considers Tariff Exemptions for Automakers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-23 17:29:20 EDT</div>

          <p>The White House confirmed that President Trump is considering exemptions for automakers from some tariffs, including those on auto parts imported from China and levies on steel and aluminum. This consideration follows lobbying from automakers and auto policy groups seeking relief from the increasing tariffs impacting the automotive industry. While autos were previously exempted from reciprocal geographical tariffs, the industry still faces levies on steel, aluminum, and imported vehicles. This potential exemption provided a marginal boost to automaker stocks in after-hours trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines announced it will reduce its flight capacity in the second half of the year, citing macroeconomic uncertainty and weaker domestic bookings. The airline expects unit revenue to be flat to down 4% in the second quarter and is not reaffirming its earnings guidance for 2025 and 2026. This decision mirrors similar moves by United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, which have also announced plans to scale back domestic capacity and, in Delta's case, pull its full-year forecast due to the unpredictable U.S. economy.</p>

          <p>A coalition of twelve states, led by New York, filed a lawsuit against President Trump and his administration, challenging the legality of his new tariffs on foreign imports. The states argue that the President lacks the authority to arbitrarily impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

          <p>President Trump and his administration have signaled a desire to deescalate the trade war with China, but are afraid of looking like they're climbing down. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told investors that the current status quo of 145 percent tariffs on China is “unsustainable.” Trump agreed, signaling the tariff levels will come down substantially. Trump started this trade war impulsively, without any larger strategic planning or advance notice for businesses, and it’s becoming undeniable that without change, the US economy is going to start facing very serious problems quite soon.</p>

This time, the trial also includes allegations from former Polish model and actress Kaja Sokola, who has accused Weinstein of sexual assault when she was 16.

          <p>Google is demanding that some remote employees return to the office if they want to keep their jobs and avoid being part of broader cost cuts at the company. Some of those employees were previously approved for remote work. Several units within Google have told remote staffers that their roles may be at risk if they don't start showing up at the closest office for a hybrid work schedule.</p>

          <h2>Tesla Stock Pops Despite Weak Earnings</h2>

          <p>Tesla shares popped 5.3% after CEO Elon Musk suggested he will spend more time at the company and tariff optimism from the White House lifted broader investor sentiment. Shares were initially flat postmarket, jumping on tariff optimism after President Donald Trump ahead of Tesla's earnings call signaled that duties on China will not be as high as 145% and said he has "no intention" of firing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. The electric vehicle maker reported lackluster first-quarter results, which included a 20% year-over-year drop in automotive revenue and a 71% decline in net income. (not investment advice)</p>
