          <p>Police have identified Robin Westman, 23, as the suspect in the Annunciation Catholic School shooting, confirming her past attendance and her mother's employment at the parish. Westman, who died by self-inflicted gunshot, reportedly harbored intense hate and an obsession with previous mass shooters, intending to cause terror for personal notoriety. The attack killed an 8-year-old and a 10-year-old, and injured 18 others, including 15 children, all of whom are expected to survive. Authorities are reviewing extensive evidence, including YouTube videos and writings, while the community and city officials, including Mayor Jacob Frey, call for urgent gun control measures.</p>

          <p>A 36-year-old woman in Kenai, Alaska, sustained serious injuries after a brown bear attacked her near her home, dragging her approximately 100 yards. The incident occurred early Tuesday morning, prompting a search by state troopers and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, though the animal was not found. Authorities are advising residents to remain vigilant, supervise children and pets, and secure attractants like trash. Bear attacks on humans are relatively rare in Alaska, despite a large bear population, with officials emphasizing the importance of living safely in 'bear country'.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's second-quarter financial filing revealed that two unnamed 'direct customers' accounted for a significant 39% of its total revenue, with Customer A comprising 23% and Customer B 16%. This concentration is a notable increase from the previous year and fuels debate among analysts about whether Nvidia's explosive growth is overly reliant on a few large cloud providers. Despite this, Nvidia's finance chief noted that large cloud service providers make up about 50% of data center revenue, and CEO Jensen Huang forecasted $3-$4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the decade's end, with demand remaining high across various customer types.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Americans are increasingly staying in their current positions as the U.S. labor market cools, a trend observed in a Bank of America Institute analysis. The job change rate has declined significantly from its 2022 peak, nearing 2019 levels, as employers scale back hiring and workers become more hesitant to switch jobs. Consequently, the median pay raise for job switchers has also dropped to 7% in July, down from 20% in 2022, indicating a shift in power dynamics back towards employers. This deceleration could have dampening effects on future consumer spending growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cybersecurity expert suggests using email aliases as a simple yet effective method to prevent companies from tracking online shopping behavior and reduce spam. By creating unique, forwarding email addresses for each website, users can fragment their digital identity, making it harder for companies to link activities across platforms. This strategy also helps identify which sites may have compromised data if an alias starts receiving unwanted emails, allowing users to disable the problematic alias. This approach adds a crucial layer of privacy and security in an increasingly tracked online environment.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook's lawsuit challenging her removal by Donald Trump briefly addresses the mortgage fraud allegations, suggesting any discrepancy was a "clerical error." The complaint argues that even if a mistake occurred, it does not constitute "cause" for removal under the Federal Reserve Act, which typically requires inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance. Cook's legal team contends the allegations are a pretext for Trump to stack the Fed Board, while the Federal Housing Finance Agency director, Bill Pulte, maintains Cook has not refuted the claims. The case will likely focus on defining the legal standard for removal.</p>

Ending the rule will subject all such imports to duties and taxes, disproportionately affecting lower-income and minority households.

          <p>Best Buy surpassed Wall Street's Q2 revenue and earnings expectations, signaling a modest sales recovery, but maintained its full-year forecast due to ongoing tariff uncertainty. CEO Corie Barry noted strong customer response to sales events and growth in computing and gaming, particularly driven by the Nintendo Switch 2 launch. Despite these positive trends, the retailer faces challenges from cautious consumer spending on big-ticket items and the impact of tariffs. Best Buy is implementing strategies like a new third-party marketplace and in-store experiences to drive future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's attempt to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud has ignited an "unprecedented" legal battle, potentially requiring Supreme Court clarity on executive authority. Cook's lawsuit argues the allegations are a pretext to undermine the Fed's independence and that her removal lacks "cause" as defined by law. This action is part of a series of aggressive removals by the Trump administration challenging the independence of various agencies. Legal scholars debate whether the Fed's unique structure and monetary powers differentiate it from other agencies in terms of presidential removal powers.</p>

          <p>New research published in Science confirms that the polluted Tijuana River is a source of severe air pollution, with communities like Nestor experiencing extremely high levels of toxic hydrogen sulfide gas. The gas, linked to sewage and smelling like rotten eggs, exceeded California's ambient air-quality standard for hours daily, reaching 70 times the standard at night. Residents report health issues, including headaches and respiratory difficulties. Scientists are calling for urgent measures, such as upgrading river crossings and providing gas-scrubbing air filters, to protect the exposed population, especially children, from this ongoing environmental crisis.</p>

          <p>Dr. Susan Monarez, the recently appointed director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was fired by the Trump administration for not aligning with the president's agenda.

This move has prompted several senior CDC leaders to resign, citing frustration over vaccine policy and planned budget cuts, and Senator Bernie Sanders to call for an investigation.

          <p>The California Attorney General's Office and the Torrance Police Department have entered an "enforceable agreement" to reform the agency following a scandal involving officers who sent racist text messages. The reforms will address use-of-force, internal affairs practices, and biased policing, building on collaborative efforts initiated by former Chief Jeremiah Hart. The scandal, which included officers joking about violence against Black and Jewish people and LGBTQ individuals, led to the dismissal of criminal cases and charges against five officers.

          <p>This editorial argues that Russia's deadly air raids on Kyiv, occurring shortly after a U.S. envoy's visit, demonstrate President Putin's intent to test Donald Trump's resolve and Europe's determination. It criticizes Trump for seemingly setting limits that Putin disregards and for casting blame on Ukrainian President Zelenskyy for the invasion. The article suggests Trump's anger has not translated into effective action, and his recent tariff increase on Indian goods, presented as punishment for Russian oil imports, was likely driven by domestic politics rather than Russia policy. European leaders, it notes, continue maximal efforts despite limited influence on the White House.</p>

This £650m initiative seeks to make EVs more affordable, bringing prices closer to their fossil fuel counterparts.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines three key strategies for Americans to maximize their Social Security retirement benefits, which serve as a vital financial lifeline for many. Delaying claims until age 70 can increase monthly checks by 8% annually, a guaranteed return unmatched by investments. Continuing to work longer helps by replacing lower-earning years in the 35-year calculation. Additionally, married couples can strategically coordinate spousal benefits to ensure the higher earner's benefit is preserved for the survivor. Supplementing Social Security with annuities, reverse mortgages, or retirement portfolios is also recommended for greater financial security. (not investment advice)</p>
