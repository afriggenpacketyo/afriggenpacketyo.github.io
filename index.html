          <p>Police in Belfast have decided not to help dismantle a large bonfire built for annual Twelfth of July celebrations, despite significant safety concerns. The structure is located near a major electricity substation, raising fears of power outages for two major hospitals. After a multi-agency risk assessment, authorities concluded that intervening to remove the bonfire would pose a greater danger than allowing it to proceed. The decision has been criticized by some local politicians, while residents defend the event as a key cultural tradition.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines saw its shares jump after reinstating its 2025 profit outlook and forecasting a stronger summer travel season than anticipated. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while consumer booking patterns have shifted to be closer to travel dates, demand has stabilized, prompting the airline to trim capacity only surgically after the summer peak. The carrier's positive performance, driven by strong sales of premium seats and its American Express partnership, has lifted stocks across the airline industry. The company's updated full-year earnings forecast is now set between $5.25 and $6.25 per share. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Immigrant workers at an Amazon warehouse in Indianapolis have lost their jobs after the Trump administration terminated a humanitarian parole program established under the previous administration. The program had provided temporary legal status and work authorization to individuals from Haiti, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. Affected employees, who were integral to operations, were asked by Amazon to provide updated work permits and were subsequently dismissed when they could not. The terminations highlight the direct impact of shifting federal immigration policies on the lives of workers and the operations of large employers.</p>

          <p>Sweden's migration minister, Johan Forssell, has confirmed that his 16-year-old son was involved with white supremacist groups but has stated he will not resign. Forssell claims he was unaware of his son's online activities until being notified by the security service a few weeks ago and has since acted as a responsible parent. The minister says his son is deeply remorseful and has cut all ties with the extremist groups.

          <p>The very first Hermès Birkin bag, once owned by the late actress and singer Jane Birkin, has set a new record as the most valuable handbag ever sold at auction. The iconic accessory was sold for $10.1 million at a Sotheby's event in Paris after a period of intense bidding. The bag was famously conceived in 1984 during a chance encounter on a flight between Birkin and then-Hermès leader Jean-Louis Dumas. Birkin's complaint about needing a larger, more practical bag led to its on-the-spot design, creating a piece of fashion history.</p>

          <p>Following a solid June sales report, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to remain confident in Costco, suggesting the retailer is well-positioned to combat inflation and potential price hikes from tariffs. While the company's U.S. comparable sales growth was slightly below some estimates, its performance remains strong, with increased international sales and a rising average transaction size. Analysts note that challenges from tough year-over-year comparisons, partly due to previous high-demand gold bar sales, are beginning to ease. The analysis suggests Costco's business model allows it to keep prices low for members, making it a resilient choice in a challenging retail environment. (not investment advice)</p>

The inquiry highlights a sharp increase in physical threats, including at least 15 attempted murders or kidnappings of UK-based individuals, primarily opponents of the Iranian regime, since early 2022. The committee accuses the government of focusing too heavily on Iran's nuclear program at the expense of countering other threats like espionage and cyber attacks.

The piece suggests that the gesture successfully distracted Trump from pressuring Israel into a ceasefire deal.

The law, which falls short of an outright ban sought by advocates, aims to increase transparency for consumers at the point of purchase.

Anthropologists and marketing professors suggest that these stores effectively tap into regional, cultural, and moral values, turning a utilitarian space into a reflection of who we are.

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has reached her first Grand Slam final after a stunning victory over world number one Aryna Sabalenka at Wimbledon. The 13th seed won the thrilling semi-final match in three sets, saving 11 of 14 break points in a grueling two-and-a-half-hour contest. The victory marks a remarkable comeback for the 23-year-old, who took a seven-month break from tennis in 2023 for her mental health. For Sabalenka, the loss is another major disappointment, denying her a spot in what would have been her fourth consecutive Grand Slam final.</p>

          <p>In the wake of devastating floods in Central Texas, false claims blaming the disaster on cloud seeding have circulated widely online. However, meteorologists and weather experts have confirmed that a small cloud seeding operation conducted days earlier had no connection to the catastrophic flooding. Experts state that the weather modification technique is not powerful enough to create or significantly contribute to a storm of that magnitude, which was caused by a convergence of storms and remnants of a tropical storm. The article highlights the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories following major weather events.</p>

          <p>The federal tax credits for electric vehicles, worth up to $7,500 for new cars, are set to expire on September 30th following the passage of President Trump's recent major bill.

Automakers like Tesla are already urging customers to act quickly. Analysts predict that manufacturers and dealers will offer additional incentives to capitalize on this limited-time opportunity, effectively creating a final push for EV adoption under the current federal policy.
