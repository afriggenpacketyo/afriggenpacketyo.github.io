        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a UK Supreme Court ruling defining 'woman' under equalities law as biological sex, Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated he does not believe trans women are women, a shift from his previous stance. This statement has sparked internal unease within the Labour Party, particularly among MPs who have advocated for trans rights, although the party's manifesto commitments to trans-inclusive policies remain. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch accused the Labour government of reversing its position on the issue, while Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson affirmed the government's commitment to protecting single-sex spaces based on biological sex. The debate highlights the complexities surrounding gender identity and legal definitions, potentially leading to further tensions within Labour's ranks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's repeated criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, economists are speculating about the potential ramifications of Trump attempting to influence monetary policy. Experts suggest that even firing Powell might not guarantee the desired interest rate cuts, as the FOMC could still vote against the president's wishes. Some analysts believe that a significant overhaul of the Fed, including replacing multiple board members, could trigger market instability, leading to a weaker dollar and rising long-term interest rates. The speculation has already contributed to investor uncertainty, causing declines in U.S. stocks, bonds, and the dollar.</p>

          <p>A significant measles outbreak in western Texas has surpassed 600 cases, primarily affecting unvaccinated children and teenagers, with a notable number requiring hospitalization. The outbreak is centered in Gaines County, with rising cases also reported in Montana, Louisiana, Missouri, and Virginia, marking their first cases of 2025. Nationally, the CDC has confirmed 800 measles cases across 24 states, with the vast majority occurring in unvaccinated individuals. The resurgence of measles, which was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, is attributed to declining vaccination rates, raising concerns about the potential loss of the elimination status.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has surpassed the $90,000 mark, driven by investors seeking alternative assets amid turbulent stock markets and a weakening U.S. dollar. The cryptocurrency's recent gains coincide with President Trump's increased pressure on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. Bitcoin's decoupling from traditional risk assets and its strong performance in April, outpacing gold, suggest a growing perception of it as a safe-haven asset. While analysts note the resilience of Bitcoin, they also caution that sustained gains above the $93,000 resistance level may require a significant catalyst, such as Fed easing or trade deals.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated in a closed-door meeting that he anticipates a 'de-escalation' in the trade war between the U.S. and China in the near future, citing the unsustainability of the current tariff levels.

          <p>Authorities in Jamaica Beach, Texas, discovered multiple packages of cocaine washing up on the shoreline, believed to be from a ship that was raided offshore. Officials suspect the crew dumped the drugs overboard during the raid, leading to the packages washing ashore. This incident is not isolated, as similar occurrences have been reported in the Florida Keys and off the coast of Alabama, highlighting the ongoing challenges in combating drug trafficking. The United Nations estimates that a significant portion of cocaine consumed in North America originates from Colombia, often smuggled via speed boats and semi-submersible vessels.</p>

          <p>Gold prices experienced volatility, initially rebounding from a near four-week low due to heightened concerns over the U.S.-China trade war, before pulling back as hopes for easing trade tensions emerged. President Trump's repeated attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have also contributed to market jitters, influencing gold's safe-haven appeal. Despite the recent pullback, gold has seen substantial gains this year, supported by central bank purchases and ongoing economic uncertainty. Analysts suggest that gold will continue to serve as an effective hedge amid trade uncertainty, investment demand, and a volatile macroeconomic backdrop.</p>

With the S&P 500 down significantly from its February high, experts caution investors to expect continued volatility due to the administration's unpredictable economic policies.

Top lenders include College Ave, known for its overall offerings; Earnest, for low rates; Sallie Mae, for parent cosigners; Discover, for no fees; Ascent, for students with bad credit; and SoFi, for students with good credit. Experts recommend exhausting federal loan options before considering private loans, as federal loans offer more safeguards and flexible repayment plans.

The order seeks to modify the rules that differentiate between small-molecule drugs and biologic medicines, which the industry argues discourages investment in small-molecule drug development. While this change could increase Medicare prescription drug spending and medication prices, it also includes proposals opposed by the pharmaceutical industry, such as opening a pathway for more drug imports from Canada.</p>

Despite overall positive sentiment towards electric vehicles, many potential customers are more positive about EVs than they are about Tesla.

          <p>Stocks rebounded on Tuesday after a significant sell-off triggered by President Trump's renewed criticism of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average made up for lost ground, rising significantly during midday trading, with similar gains seen in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures. Analysts attributed the rebound to factors such as the potential for a US-India trade deal and support for Fed independence from key Congressional Republicans. Despite the positive day on Wall Street, Trump's trade war continues to impact global markets, with the IMF citing escalating trade tensions and policy uncertainty as factors contributing to a lowered U.S. economic growth forecast.</p>

          <p>Tesla short sellers have gained $11.5 billion in profits this year as the company's stock price has declined significantly. Concerns over President Trump's tariffs, increasing production costs, and competition in China have contributed to the stock's poor performance. Tesla has also faced widespread protests in the U.S. and Europe due to CEO Elon Musk's political involvement. Despite the challenges, Tesla is expected to release its first driverless ride-hailing offering in Austin, Texas, in June, and the company's long-term prospects remain a subject of debate among investors.

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted that President Trump's tariffs will lead to higher inflation and significantly slower global economic growth, reducing the forecast for 2025 to 2.8%. The IMF's report highlighted that the US's high levies on China and Beijing's retaliatory measures are weighing down on global trade growth. The IMF also warned that global tensions, including wars and military conflicts, could make the financial system even more unstable. The report projected zero growth for the German economy in 2025, prompting Mexico to reject the IMF's projections as too pessimistic.</p>
