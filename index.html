        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index reached a new record high, driven by real estate and technology sectors, after the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points. Other Asia-Pacific markets, including South Korea, experienced gains, while Australia, Hong Kong, and mainland China saw declines. The Fed indicated further rate cuts are possible this year and next, framing the initial reduction as a "risk management cut" rather than a response to economic weakness. Asian chip stocks also rose on reports of China banning Nvidia AI chips, while the Bank of Japan began a policy meeting where rates are expected to remain steady. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European stock markets opened higher, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 gaining 0.5%, as traders reacted to the U.S. Federal Reserve's 25-basis-point interest rate cut. Despite the cut, Fed Chair Jerome Powell described it as "risk management," dampening expectations for a rapid series of reductions. European banking stocks, including Santander and Deutsche Bank, saw increases, and Novo Nordisk rose after positive trial results for its Wegovy obesity pill. The Bank of England is also expected to maintain its interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government announced securing £150 billion in U.S. investment, coinciding with President Trump's state visit, expected to create 7,600 jobs. Major pledges come from Blackstone (£90bn), Microsoft (£22bn), and Google (£5bn), primarily in data centers, life sciences, advanced manufacturing, and defense innovation. This influx of capital aims to bolster the UK economy, following recent withdrawals of investment by pharmaceutical companies.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the pervasive anger and political polarization in America, exacerbated by the assassination of Charlie Kirk. It highlights how social media fuels this rage, allowing individuals to express extreme views anonymously. The piece examines how public figures, including Donald Trump and Elon Musk, utilize or contribute to this anger, often for political gain. It suggests that the country's incentive structures reward outrage over reconciliation, leading to a climate where half the nation resents the other.</p>

          <p>The article explores the evolving political climate in Britain, with the rise of Nigel Farage's Reform UK party and a recent right-wing march, drawing comparisons to the U.S. MAGA movement. The author, who moved from the U.S. to the UK, reflects on the surprising speed of this shift and questions the UK's perceived immunity to such populist forces. Despite some crucial differences in national character and political issues, the article suggests a shared underlying sentiment of discontent and a search for radical change among voters.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes the severe political polarization and violence gripping the U.S. following the Charlie Kirk assassination, questioning the nation's ability to reconcile. It highlights how political and media incentives often reward extreme rhetoric, preventing unity even after tragedies. Social media is identified as a major accelerant of division, with figures like Elon Musk and political leaders contributing to the fraught atmosphere. Experts suggest focusing on what makes people "ungovernable" rather than left-right labels, emphasizing the need for courageous leadership to bridge divides.</p>

Located almost 900 miles from the Caribbean's northern Leeward Islands, Gabrielle has sustained winds of 50 mph and is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday. While direct impacts on the U.S. are not expected, it could churn up surf on the East Coast next week. This formation marks the seventh named storm of the season, two weeks later than average, after a period of dry air and strong wind shear suppressed tropical activity.</p>

It argues that the action, prompted by Kimmel's comments on Charlie Kirk's death, represents a worrying trend where political figures use their power to silence dissenting voices. The article suggests this incident is part of a broader pattern where the right aims to control narratives, going beyond traditional "cancel culture" to directly suppress media platforms.

Economists predict a smaller rate cut from the People's Bank of China in the fourth quarter, which is expected to narrow the interest rate gap with the U.S. and ease capital outflow pressures, thereby supporting the yuan.
