        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With CD accounts maturing in a fluctuating interest rate environment, savers are faced with important decisions regarding rollovers. Banks typically auto-renew CDs at current rates, which may be lower than previous yields, prompting savers to consider their options. Experts advise comparing rates and exploring alternatives like high-yield savings accounts or investments, rather than automatically rolling over CDs. While rollovers offer convenience, a proactive approach ensures that funds remain competitive and aligned with financial goals, especially given the expectation of further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

          <p>In New York City, state terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, were dismissed during a pre-trial hearing. While the judge dismissed terrorism charges due to lack of evidence of intent to terrorize the public, Mangione still faces second-degree murder and weapons-related charges in the state case. The defense had sought to suppress evidence, including a gun and notebook, arguing they were obtained without a warrant, and prosecutors requested the defense declare whether they would pursue an insanity defense. Hearings in the case are set to begin in December.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The American Federation of Teachers is challenging the U.S. Department of Education over delays in student loan forgiveness programs, potentially exposing borrowers to significant tax liabilities. A law shielding student loan forgiveness from taxation is expiring at the end of 2025, meaning borrowers whose debt cancellation is delayed by the Trump administration could face federal tax bills starting in 2026. With over 1.3 million borrowers stuck in a backlog of income-driven repayment plan applications, lawmakers are urging the Education Department to act quickly. Borrowers expecting forgiveness should save payment records and plan for potential tax bills, which could be substantial depending on their tax bracket.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 10:13:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rising inflation, partly driven by tariffs, may worsen the economic divide in the U.S., disproportionately affecting lower-income households. Data indicates businesses are passing on the costs of import tariffs to consumers, with prices for tariff-exposed products like clothing and groceries increasing. Lower-income households, who spend a larger portion of their budget on imports, are particularly vulnerable, as they often purchase lower-priced goods subject to tariffs. Some corporate executives have noted this divide, with McDonald's expanding its value menu to attract price-conscious customers, as the economy is essentially in a two-tiered state.</p>

          <p>A framework agreement for TikTok will involve new investors alongside existing investors in ByteDance, with Oracle retaining its cloud deal with the platform, according to sources. The deal, expected to finalize within 30 to 45 days, follows concerns from lawmakers about potential Chinese government access to American user data. Commercial terms have been in place since March, but the Chinese put it on hold after Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff blitz, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Oracle has been a potential investor or buyer for months, with the White House previously selecting them to handle TikTok's data collection and software updates.</p>

However, analysts are skeptical about the likelihood of mass protests due to the recent conflict with Israel and economic hardships. Any new protests are expected to focus on economic issues, social justice, and security, potentially involving marginalized communities and labor sectors, as the Iranian people are in a state of survival rather than direct action.</p>

          <p>Major U.S. comedians scheduled to perform at the Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia are being urged by Human Rights Watch to address the country's human rights abuses. The festival is part of a broader effort by the Saudi government to whitewash its reputation, critics say, particularly following the state execution of journalist Turki Al-Jasser. HRW calls on the entertainers to use their platform to mitigate the positive effect that their presence might have on the country's reputation for human rights abuses, including by "speaking out about the abuses." It is predicted that there will be clear red lines drawn by organizers to prevent any criticism of Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman.</p>

          <p>Scientists have authenticated an ancient carving indicating that China’s first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, sent an expedition to Tibet in search of the elixir of life. The carving, written in the ancient small seal script, was found at a high-altitude site near Gyaring Lake in the Kunlun Mountains. It reads that the emperor commanded a grand master to lead alchemists to collect "yao," which could refer to herbs, animals, minerals with healing power, or the elixir of life. This discovery confirms historical accounts of the emperor's quest for immortality.</p>

The commercial terms have been agreed upon, with Presidents Trump and Xi expected to discuss the deal. Oracle has long been seen as a potential buyer, and has already partnered with TikTok to route U.S. user activity through its servers.</p>
