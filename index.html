          <p>Japanese politician Ishiba has hinted at a potential review of the current policy aimed at adjusting rice output, signaling a possible shift in agricultural strategies.

          <p>The German economy saw an unexpected 0.4% growth in the first quarter of 2025, surpassing expectations. This growth was primarily driven by a surge in exports ahead of anticipated tariffs imposed by the U.S. government. Simultaneously, Germany's new government is considering extending the Bundeswehr's involvement in several foreign missions, indicating a continued commitment to international security efforts. The economic growth provides a positive outlook amidst global trade uncertainties.</p>

This approach, while not a full-throated defense, seeks to highlight potential uncertainties in the prosecution's case.

          <p>The Trump administration has revoked Harvard University's ability to enroll foreign students, citing concerns over antisemitism and alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party. This decision requires current international students to transfer or leave the country, impacting nearly 6,800 students. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that Harvard can regain its certification by providing records on foreign students within 72 hours, including footage of protests or dangerous activity. Harvard has condemned the action as unlawful and retaliatory, vowing to support its international students and defend its academic mission, while China criticized the "politicization" of education.</p>

          <p>President Trump's meeting with South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa took an unexpected turn as Trump focused on a racist narrative of white South Africans facing genocide. The meeting, which could have addressed critical issues such as tariffs and aid cuts, was instead used by Trump to display a video of a South African opposition leader chanting about killing farmers, a claim Trump uses to support his views. The author argues that Trump's actions undermined serious discussion and were aimed at scoring points with his base rather than engaging in meaningful diplomacy. Despite the chaos, Ramaphosa remained composed, extending an invitation for Trump to attend the G20 summit in South Africa later in the year.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's decision to block Harvard from enrolling international students is seen in China as detrimental to one of America's last admired institutions. This move could particularly impact Chinese students, who represent the largest group of international students at Harvard. The action is likely to reshape the relationship between the two countries by diminishing the appeal of American universities, even as other symbols of American culture lose their allure. Some Chinese commentators view this as an opportunity for China to advance its own educational institutions, potentially attracting talent and revenue away from the U.S.</p>

          <p>The UK energy regulator, Ofgem, has confirmed a 7% fall in energy prices starting in July, marking the first decrease in a year. This change will reduce the annual bill for a typical household by Â£129, although charities caution that many still struggle with energy costs and debt. The price cap, which affects 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales, reflects a drop in international wholesale gas prices. While this offers some relief, analysts anticipate little change in prices come October, and many households are burdened by significant debt to suppliers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has accused Columbia University of violating civil rights law by showing "deliberate indifference" to harassment against Jewish students, marking the latest in a series of accusations against the school. This follows previous actions, including the suspension of over $400 million in grants and contracts. While Columbia has generally cooperated with the Trump administration's demands, the accusations raise concerns about academic freedom. The finding cites reports of discrimination from Jewish students to Columbiaâ€™s Task Force on Antisemitism, highlighting ongoing tensions on university campuses.</p>

          <p>North Korea has launched an investigation into an accident that occurred during the launch of its new naval destroyer, with leader Kim Jong Un denouncing the incident as criminal negligence. The probe follows reports that sections of the ship's bottom were crushed during the launch ceremony due to a detached transport cradle. While initial reports described the damage as serious, subsequent inspections revealed that the damage was "not serious" and could be repaired in about 10 days. The investigation underscores the importance of accountability and quality control in North Korea's military programs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Mint is set to discontinue the production of pennies following a decree by President Trump, who deemed the small coin "so wasteful". The decision comes as the penny's production cost exceeds its value, with annual savings estimated at $56 million. Made from zinc with a copper coating, the penny has been a staple of US currency since 1792, but its underutilization has prompted the move. Advocates for eliminating the penny cite its high production cost, while others argue for its usefulness in charity drives and cheaper production compared to the nickel.</p>

After the resumption, the Yamanote Line operated with considerably reduced services, while services on the Keihin-Tohoku Line, which were also suspended, had fully resumed.

The move could force these students to transfer or leave the country, potentially disrupting team dynamics and performance.

          <p>The rise of the "DEI hire" taunt, fueled by MAGA rhetoric, reflects a deeper grievance about job opportunities and identity. This phenomenon was highlighted by the tragic suicide of Wayne Brown, Britainâ€™s first black fire chief, who faced relentless harassment and scrutiny. The use of "DEI hire" is an attempt to undermine individuals from non-traditional backgrounds by suggesting they are unqualified and only hired due to diversity initiatives. The author argues that such rhetoric feeds a climate of prejudice and can erode the confidence of successful individuals from minority groups.</p>
