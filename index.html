            <p>The Trump administration halted the Empire Wind 1 offshore wind project near Long Island, raising concerns about the future of the U.S. clean-energy industry. The decision, initiated by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, cited insufficient analysis during the project's approval despite a thorough environmental review. Experts and industry leaders fear this move signals broader opposition to offshore wind, jeopardizing clean energy goals and union jobs in New York. The halting of the project also raises concerns about meeting growing electricity demands in the region.</p>

            <p>The resentencing hearing for Erik and Lyle Menendez, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, was postponed until May 9 due to disputes between the brothers' attorneys and prosecutors. The hearing was intended to determine if the brothers, serving life without parole, should receive a new sentence that could lead to their release. The delay arose from a request to review a risk assessment report related to a clemency bid and a motion to recuse the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. The situation underscores the ongoing legal battles surrounding the case and the uncertainty of the brothers' future.</p>

            <p>Chinese scientists at Fudan University have developed 'Poxiao,' a revolutionary flash memory capable of erasing and rewriting data in 400 picoseconds. This breakthrough shatters existing speed barriers by 100,000 times, promising to accelerate AI computing power significantly. While the current prototype holds only kilobytes, its design overcomes limitations of both volatile and non-volatile memory. This advancement could blur the lines between memory and computing, marking a significant leap in electron physics.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is targeting Harvard, with President Trump calling for the university's tax-exempt status to be revoked. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is reportedly planning to enact the president’s demand, a move that would cost Harvard millions of dollars each year. This action is part of an ongoing battle, and a significant escalation on Trump’s attack on Harvard and his aggressive, multi-pronged assault on higher education institutions. The White has urged Harvard to change its hiring, teaching and admissions practices to help fight antisemitism on campus.</p>

            <p>Canada faces a severe housing affordability crisis, with home prices far outpacing incomes, particularly in cities like Vancouver and Toronto. The crisis has become a major issue in the upcoming federal election, with young people especially worried about their future housing prospects. The main causes include a supply shortage and restrictive zoning laws. While parties have proposed plans to build more homes, some argue that the wealth accumulated by older homeowners from rising home values is not being addressed.</p>

            <p>The CDC has scaled back its plan to assist Texas schools in curbing measles due to potential layoffs of staff working on the agency's response to the outbreak. The agency had considered expanding its ventilation assessments from hospitals to schools. However, potential layoffs within the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) have disrupted these plans. The move raises concerns about the effectiveness of the CDC's response to the measles outbreak in Texas.</p>

            <p>Bin workers in Birmingham are on strike due to the removal of Waste Recycling and Collection Officers (WRCO) roles, which were paid more than other bin workers. The council wants to cut crews from four to three by eliminating WRCOs, leading to potential pay cuts for some workers. The union claims some workers could face pay cuts of up to £8,000, while the council estimates the maximum loss to be just over £6,000. The dispute centers on safety concerns and potential equal pay claims.</p>
