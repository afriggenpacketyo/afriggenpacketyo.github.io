          <p>A 38-year-old Brooklyn man, Sheldon John, was fatally stabbed on a No. 5 subway train in Manhattan after an argument escalated during the morning rush hour. The altercation began when one man stepped on the other's shoe, leading to a fight that continued onto the platform at the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall station. Officers found John unconscious with multiple chest wounds, and he was later pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital. The assailant stabbed the victim a second time after they exited the train.</p>

          <p>Senators Adam Schiff and Elizabeth Warren are calling for an ethics investigation into President Trump's plan to host a private dinner for top investors in his $TRUMP meme coin. They argue that offering exclusive access to the presidency in exchange for investment raises concerns about potential 'pay to play' corruption, especially given reports that some investors have ties to foreign exchanges or have received funds from crypto platforms banned in the U.S. The senators are questioning whether Trump and his family have received guidance on profiting from digital assets while in office.

          <p>The Trump administration has initiated an investigation into UC Berkeley for allegedly failing to disclose millions of dollars in foreign funding, marking the second such probe this month following a similar investigation into Harvard. This action aligns with a broader effort to scrutinize foreign influence in American research institutions, with the Department of Education thoroughly examining UC Berkeley's apparent failure to accurately report funding received from foreign sources. The investigation revives a 2023 House subcommittee inquiry into the Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute, a partnership between UC Berkeley and China's Tsinghua University.</p>

While acknowledging the importance of a free and independent press, the new policy allows the attorney general to approve efforts to question or arrest members of the news media.</p>

The Justice Department informed a federal court that immigration officials are working on a new system for reviewing and terminating visas, and that records would be restored in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Systems (SEVIS). While ICE retains the authority to terminate a SEVIS record for other reasons, the restoration provides a reprieve for many students who had their status reinstated in SEVIS.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon set up a system in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's office that enabled him to check messages on the encrypted messaging app Signal, bypassing standard Defense Department security protocols. Sources say a computer monitor in Hegseth's office was installed to give him remote access to the Signal app and text messages from his personal cellphone. The office suite is a sensitive compartmentalized information facility, or SCIF, where cellphones are prohibited, raising security concerns.</p>
