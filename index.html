          <p>China's Hainan Island is bracing for the arrival of Typhoon Bualoi, expected to skim the province before making landfall in Vietnam later on Sunday. In preparation, the southern city of Sanya has suspended all flights, and the port in neighboring Haikou has been closed, causing significant travel disruptions. This severe weather event follows closely behind Super Typhoon Ragasa, heightening regional concerns for the populous island and its infrastructure. The China Meteorological Administration has issued a yellow typhoon and heavy rain warning, the third-highest alert level, anticipating further strengthening of Bualoi with heavy rainfall and strong winds. Authorities are implementing extensive safety measures to mitigate potential damage and disruption across the affected coastal areas, emphasizing public safety.</p>

          <p>Graham Potter has been sacked by West Ham after only eight months, marking his second brutal dismissal in the Premier League following a brief stint at Chelsea. His tenure at West Ham saw the team in 19th place after four defeats in five games, a stark contrast to his success at Brighton. Potter, once considered a potential England successor, struggled with chaotic environments at both Chelsea and West Ham, where his meticulous coaching style and low-key personality failed to resonate with demanding fans. This article discusses his spectacular fall from grace and speculates on his future in football management, highlighting his previous achievements at Brighton as a platform for growth.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Nations has reimposed sweeping sanctions on Iran through a "snapback" mechanism, further pressuring the Islamic Republic over its nuclear program. These measures freeze Iranian assets, halt arms deals, and penalize ballistic missile development, exacerbating an already reeling economy where the rial currency is at a record low. This has led to soaring food prices and increased anxiety among citizens about their future and potential conflicts with Israel or the US. Activists also fear a rise in internal repression, as Iran has reportedly seen a surge in executions this year, creating a deeply challenging period for the nation.</p>

          <h2>Swiss Voters Consider Electronic ID Cards Again with Revised Privacy Protections</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 01:27:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Swiss voters are heading to the polls to decide on the introduction of electronic identity cards, a proposal previously rejected in 2021 due to data protection concerns. The revised plan ensures the system remains optional and publicly controlled, with data stored on users' smartphones rather than centrally, aiming to alleviate privacy fears. Supporters argue the e-IDs will streamline bureaucratic procedures, making online interactions like obtaining telephone contracts or proving age much easier. Despite Switzerland's strong tradition of privacy, recent polls suggest a shift in public opinion, possibly influenced by the positive experience with Covid IDs during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United's manager, Eddie Howe, is addressing the team's underperformance in set-piece situations despite possessing tall players and strong delivery. The article highlights the club's efforts to improve this aspect of their game, including the recruitment of set-play coach Martin Mark, known for his success at Midtjylland. While Newcastle has adopted new tactics like long throws, their conversion rate from dead-ball situations remains low compared to opponents like Arsenal, who excel in this area. Howe acknowledges the need for immediate improvement, hoping to leverage set-plays to secure crucial victories in upcoming matches.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump's "framework consensus" deal regarding TikTok may not be a victory for the United States but rather a strategic triumph for China. While the deal appears to place American data, servers, and algorithms under US control, it leaves ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, as the single largest shareholder. The article suggests that global investors already own a significant portion of ByteDance, and the new arrangement merely increases US ownership of the American operation to 80%, leaving ByteDance with just under 20%. This perspective implies that China retains considerable influence, despite the perceived US control.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece by Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett critiques Donald Trump's problematic framing of autism as a disease, arguing that autistic individuals possess qualities he lacks.

It emphasizes the "purest joy" and unique ways autistic people express love, challenging misconceptions and advocating for a more nuanced understanding of autism.

          <p>Hairy crab prices in China are notably lower this year, dropping by approximately 20 yuan per kilogram, just before the significant "super golden week" holiday. Industry insiders attribute this decline to a combination of increased production, a decrease in demand for gift-giving, and broader weak household spending. The upcoming eight-day holiday, combining National Day and the Mid-Autumn Festival, is widely viewed as a critical litmus test for domestic consumer demand across retail, travel, dining, and entertainment sectors. Despite the crabs maturing earlier due to warmer climate conditions, market sentiment remains subdued, reflecting underlying concerns about the nation's consumer economy.</p>

Instead, the author suggests that the US appears to be adopting an approach to political legitimacy and issues of war and peace increasingly similar to China's.

These accusations stem from the brutal crackdown on peaceful pro-democracy protests in the southern city of Daraa, which rapidly escalated into a wider civil war, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths and widespread destruction.

          <p>The UK has successfully grown its first experimental rice crop, a project initially dismissed as a joke, which thrived due to the country's hottest summer on record. Ecologist Nadine Mitschunas and farmers Craig and Sarah Taylor are leading this ambitious trial in Cambridgeshire, testing nine varieties of rice from diverse regions. This initiative, spearheaded by the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, aims to explore future food production and tackle climate change by identifying viable crops for a warming climate. Growing rice on peat soils could help lock in greenhouse gases, offering a potential solution to both food security and environmental challenges as Britain's climate continues to evolve.</p>

          <p>US golfer Keegan Bradley defended American Ryder Cup fans as merely "passionate," despite European counterparts condemning their "unacceptable conduct" during day two at Bethpage Black. Bradley curiously suggested fans were "violent" in Rome two years prior, contrasting sharply with European Captain Luke Donald's criticism of personal insults and deliberate disruptions during players' backswings. While acknowledging that a few fans "cross the line," Bradley refused to condemn the crowd, even amidst accusations that US players had stoked the rowdiness. This article highlights the differing perspectives on fan behavior during the intense tournament, where Europe currently holds a commanding lead.</p>

          <p>Tech billionaire Larry Ellison and his son David are rapidly becoming a new media dynasty, pursuing deals for major companies like TikTok and CNN, potentially rivaling the Murdochs. Larry Ellison's close relationship with President Trump has facilitated these ventures, with Oracle already hosting TikTok's US user data and poised for a greater role. David Ellison's Skydance studio recently acquired Paramount, gaining control of CBS, and is reportedly eyeing Warner Brothers Discovery. These moves, backed by the elder Ellison's immense fortune, raise concerns about media concentration and political influence, prompting investigations into potential anti-bribery law violations and commitments to the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Thousands marched in Buenos Aires, Argentina, demanding justice for three young women—Morena Verdi, Brenda Del Castillo, and Lara Gutierrez—whose torture and murders were reportedly livestreamed on social media. The victims' bodies were found buried after they disappeared, with investigators linking the triple femicide to drug gangs. The livestream, allegedly watched by 45 members, was intended as a "punishment" and "warning" for breaking gang rules. Five suspects have been detained, though the alleged Peruvian mastermind remains at large. This article highlights the horrific nature of the crime and the public's outrage, despite Meta disputing the livestream occurred on Instagram.</p>

          <p>Sean Penn commented on the assassination of conservative podcaster Charlie Kirk, distinguishing it from other recent high-profile killings, including a health insurance CEO and political figures. Penn, while disagreeing with Kirk's views, expressed a belief that society needs figures like Kirk for robust debate, stating, "We need that guy. We need that debate." He reflected on the increasing public polarization and the importance of understanding deeply held, even opposing, beliefs. Penn emphasized that violence is not the answer to disagreements, advocating for civil discourse and compromise to address societal divisions rather than resorting to such extreme acts.</p>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on how smelly shoes impact the experience of using a shoe rack. Their research, initially sparked by observations in university hostels, identified the bacterium Kytococcus sedentarius as the primary culprit behind persistent shoe odor. They subsequently developed a prototype UVC light-equipped shoe rack designed to sterilize footwear, effectively eliminating the unpleasant smell. The study, which meticulously measured odor levels and optimized UVC exposure, highlights a quirky yet inventive scientific endeavor that aims to improve daily life, demonstrating how everyday problems can inspire unconventional research and recognition.</p>

          <p>Starbucks workers in Los Angeles rallied, as part of nationwide protests, to pressure the company into resuming stalled contract talks and addressing new policies implemented without union input. These demonstrations follow Starbucks' recent announcement of hundreds of store closures and layoffs, alongside legal actions by employees over a mandatory dress code without reimbursement. The union, Starbucks Workers United, views these rallies as a "warning shot," indicating preparedness for a strike if necessary. They argue the company's proposals are inadequate despite Starbucks' claims of competitive pay and benefits, highlighting the escalating labor dispute and the union's determination to finalize a fair contract.</p>
