          <p>Russia launched extensive overnight drone attacks across Ukraine, resulting in at least one fatality and multiple injuries, including a pregnant woman, in Kyiv, where debris from downed drones ignited residential building fires. Concurrently, Ukrainian drones caused a fire at the Iisky oil refinery in Krasnodar, Russia, which was swiftly contained without casualties. Explosions were reported in several other Ukrainian cities, prompting neighboring Poland to deploy fighter jets for airspace protection. This article underscores the continued intensity of the conflict, with Russia still occupying a significant portion of Ukrainian territory, despite stalled diplomatic initiatives and international pledges for postwar security.</p>

          <p>The UK's new Home Secretary, Shabana Mahmood, is set to announce human rights law reforms to address the small boats crisis, a move seen as a strategic response to Nigel Farage's growing political influence. This decision, backed by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, may face internal opposition from Labour MPs. Simultaneously, the article highlights significant operational failures within HMRC, which reportedly missed four million business calls, contributing to an estimated £47 billion in uncollected taxes. This substantial deficit underscores a critical challenge for the Treasury, suggesting a potential solution to public finance woes without resorting to tax hikes. The article also briefly touches on the public's unenthusiastic reception to England's recent football World Cup qualifier victory.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers starting pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto was on the precipice of a no-hitter, needing just two outs in the ninth inning, before Baltimore Orioles star Jackson Holliday ended his dream with a home run. Following Yamamoto's departure, the Dodgers' bullpen dramatically collapsed. Blake Treinen allowed runners to load the bases, and Tanner Scott then gave up a two-run single, resulting in a stunning 4-3 walk-off loss for the Orioles. This article details the crushing defeat, highlighting the emotional swing from near-history to a complete bullpen meltdown that left fans furious and the team reeling.</p>

Forecasters anticipate life-threatening surf and rip currents from the storm's swells reaching the Hawaiian Islands by the weekend, continuing through midweek. While Kiko's movement is slow, direct impacts such as strong winds and heavy rainfall are increasingly likely for Hawaii, particularly Maui and the Big Island, starting Monday and peaking on Tuesday. Acting Hawaii Governor Sylvia Luke has declared a state of emergency, urging residents and visitors to prepare and monitor official guidance.</p>

          <p>Linda Stermer, a Michigan woman, is undergoing a second trial for the murder of her husband, Todd Stermer, after her initial conviction for arson and murder was overturned. Authorities allege she set their home on fire and then ran him over with a van as he escaped. Linda maintains her innocence, describing the events as a tragic accident amidst a troubled marriage marked by financial issues and alleged abuse. The case involves conflicting testimonies from family members, a former friend, and fire investigators, with the defense arguing insufficient evidence for arson and potential cross-contamination of gasoline on Todd's clothing. This article delves into the complex legal battle and the deeply divided family's perspectives.</p>

          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method to launch millimeter-scale robots using the energy from rapidly collapsing vapor bubbles. This technique involves heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles. When these bubbles collapse, they release a strong force capable of launching the tiny jumpers up to 1.5 meters into the air. Scientists can precisely control the launch location and even enable the materials to swim by manipulating light flow. This article highlights cavitation as an efficient launching mechanism, detailed in their paper "Launching by cavitation" published in Science.</p>

          <p>China's private holiday accommodation sector, including homestays and guesthouses, is experiencing a significant downturn, causing many operators to regret their investments. Following a brief post-pandemic "revenge travel" boom, an oversaturation of supply, coupled with declining guest spending and fewer bookings, has led to intense price wars and squeezed profits.

          <p>Ukraine is extensively using decoy military equipment, such as inflatable tanks and flat-pack artillery, to mislead Russian forces and conserve valuable ammunition. These full-scale imitations, ranging from small radars to tanks and even soldier dummies, are designed to trick the enemy into wasting resources. For instance, plywood models of M777 howitzers, costing about $500-$600, are frequently targeted by $35,000 Russian Lancet kamikaze drones, demonstrating a significant cost-saving tactic. This article highlights how these decoys are meticulously deployed to recreate real positions, effectively deceiving both enemy surveillance and even some visiting officers.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born teenager who died at 15, is poised to become the Catholic Church's first millennial saint, with his canonization ceremony presided over by Pope Leo. Known as "God's influencer," Carlo created websites documenting miracles to spread Catholic teachings. His canonization was fast-tracked after Pope Francis attributed two miracles to him, including the healing of a woman with breast cancer. His body is preserved in wax in Assisi, a pilgrimage site that has seen increased visitors, as has Our Lady of Dolours Church in London, where he was baptized.

          <p>The US Men's National Team (USMNT) experienced another disappointing result with a 2-0 loss to South Korea, raising alarm bells as the team prepares to host the World Cup in 279 days. Despite coach Mauricio Pochettino's focus on player evaluation, the team's lackluster performance highlighted significant defensive communication failures and missed scoring opportunities. South Korea, energized by a supportive crowd, capitalized on US mistakes, with Son Heung-min scoring the opening goal. This article suggests that while Pochettino believes the team will be ready for the World Cup, the current form indicates a need for substantial improvement to avoid an "ominous" outcome on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Postal traffic into the United States has plummeted by over 80% following the Trump administration's decision to end a tariff exemption for low-cost imports, according to the Universal Postal Union (UPU). The elimination of the "de minimis exemption" for parcels valued at $800 or less, which previously escaped customs charges, has caused major operational disruptions. Eighty-eight postal operators have suspended services to the US due to the new burden of duty collection and remittance falling on carriers or approved parties, a system for which they lacked adequate time and guidance to implement.

          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) this autumn, designed to track non-EU citizens entering and leaving the Schengen Area. This system, which will replace manual passport stamping, aims to enhance security and streamline travel, but concerns exist about potential long queues during initial registration. Travelers from non-EU countries, including the UK, will need to register biometric information, fingerprints, and a photo upon their first use, typically at kiosks at border crossings.
