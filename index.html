          <p>Deliberations have officially started in the sex trafficking and racketeering trial of Sean 'Diddy' Combs in a Manhattan federal court.

Judge Arun Subramanian instructed the jurors to base their verdict solely on the evidence presented during the 35-day trial.

          <p>The Greek government is in crisis following revelations of widespread misuse of EU agricultural subsidies, which is now under investigation by the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO). The scandal involves hundreds of millions of euros paid for non-existent projects, allegedly with the knowledge of former government ministers, two of whom have now resigned. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has acknowledged failure and promised to combat corruption after the EPPO sent a 3,000-page file to the Greek parliament detailing a "criminal organization" of officials and lawmakers who illegally obtained EU funds.</p>

          <p>Analysts at Citi have projected that the price of gold will consolidate, trading in a range of $3,100 to $3,500 per ounce during the third quarter of the year.

Citi believes the market may have already seen its peak price for the year and anticipates the market will weaken as investment demand decreases.

          <p>Julia KlÃ¶ckner, the new conservative president of the German parliament, is facing criticism for a series of provocative decisions that have angered progressive lawmakers. She announced that the Pride flag would not be flown from the Reichstag building during Christopher Street Day and has enforced strict dress code rules, removing one member for wearing a "Palestine" t-shirt. A senior figure in the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), KlÃ¶ckner's actions are seen by critics as partisan and contrary to the traditionally impartial role of the Bundestag president, fueling concerns that she is prioritizing culture war issues.</p>

          <p>An Interpol report reveals that criminal hubs forcing trafficked victims to conduct online scams have expanded from Southeast Asia to become a global crisis. These scam centers are now emerging in the Middle East, West Africa, and Central America, with victims sourced from at least 66 countries. People are often lured by fake job offers, then held captive and forced to run financial fraud schemes under threat of violence. Interpol highlights that this crime is increasingly intertwined with drug and firearms smuggling, and is fueled by emerging technologies like AI.</p>

          <p>An inquest has concluded that James Lee Williams, the drag artist known as The Vivienne, died by misadventure from a cardiac arrest caused by ketamine. The first winner of Ru Paul's Drag Race UK was found deceased in their home near Chester on January 5th. The court heard that the 32-year-old had privately struggled with addiction and had recently relapsed after a period of sobriety. Friends and family described them as an "outgoing character full-of-life" who wanted to make people laugh and help others.</p>

          <h2>Share of First-Time Homebuyers Plummets, Highlighting Difficult Housing Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 11:08:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. housing market remains challenging, particularly for first-time buyers, whose share of home purchases has fallen dramatically. According to an Apollo economist, first-time buyers accounted for 50% of all homes sold in 2010, but that figure has dropped to just 24% today. This decline illustrates the brutal reality of the current market, where stubbornly high prices and restrictive mortgage rates create significant barriers to entry. Despite a recent increase in housing inventory, the stalemate between buyers and sellers persists, locking many aspiring homeowners out of the market. (not investment advice)</p>
