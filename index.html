          <p>With its simple, focused menu of chicken fingers, Raising Cane's has overtaken KFC in U.S. sales, now ranking as the nation's third-largest chicken chain behind Chick-fil-A and Popeyes. The company's system sales reached $5.1 billion last year, driven by rapid expansion and a significant increase in customer traffic. By maintaining a company-owned restaurant model and avoiding limited-time offers, the chain has cultivated a loyal customer base and efficient operations. Founder Todd Graves aims to make Raising Cane's a top 10 restaurant brand with over $10 billion in annual sales.</p>

          <p>Moderna reported that its experimental mRNA flu vaccine demonstrated a stronger immune response than an existing shot in a late-stage trial involving over 40,000 adults. The positive results clear a path for the company to seek regulatory approval for both the standalone flu vaccine and a combination flu-and-Covid shot. The company plans to file for approval later this year, with hopes of launching the products in 2026, which could simplify vaccinations and reduce healthcare system workloads. This development comes as the company navigates an uncertain U.S. regulatory environment.</p>

          <p>Tropical Depression Barry has dissipated after making landfall on Mexico's east coast, though it is still expected to bring several days of heavy rain to the region. The system, which briefly reached tropical storm status, was the second named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters had issued a tropical storm warning, anticipating three to six inches of rain across the states of San Luis Potosi and Tamaulipas. While the storm weakened upon hitting the coast, the threat of flooding remains a concern for the affected areas.</p>

          <p>China's national audit office has uncovered that tens of billions of yuan from the country's 2024 stimulus package were misused by local authorities. The report revealed that nearly 20 billion yuan intended for large-scale equipment renewals and consumer goods trade-ins was either fraudulently claimed or misappropriated. Examples of misuse include a university purchasing gym equipment under the guise of "advanced teaching equipment" and several provinces diverting funds to cover basic public spending like civil-service wages.

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee has warned that the Lifetime Individual Savings Account (LISA) needs reform, as some savers may withdraw less money than they invested. The LISA program offers a 25% government bonus on savings up to Â£4,000 annually for a first home or retirement. However, early withdrawal penalties can result in a 6.25% loss of the saver's own capital. The Treasury Committee report also highlighted that the product's complexity and rules regarding benefit claimants could make it unsuitable for many, raising concerns about potential mis-selling.

While Russian projects like revitalizing a major sugar mill have stalled, China is financing critical infrastructure, including 55 new solar parks to stabilize the country's collapsed power grid. This shift is visible on the ground, with Chinese-funded projects advancing while Russian commitments remain unfulfilled.

The piece highlights the connections between Thiel, Elon Musk, and other influential figures in Trump's circle, suggesting they aim to turn the U.S. away from democracy.

          <p>This long-form article delves into the complex issue of insomnia, blending personal experience with scientific research to challenge common narratives about sleep. The author argues that societal pressures, non-standard work hours, and the digital world make achieving adequate sleep difficult for many, and that individual blame is often misplaced. The piece questions the rigid "eight-hour" rule and the effectiveness of simple sleep hygiene tips for those with chronic insomnia. It also examines the nuances of treatments like CBT-I and the stigma surrounding sleep medications, calling for a more compassionate and less moralizing public conversation.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues Obsessive Step Counting Diminishes the Joy of Walking</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the cultural trend of obsessively tracking daily step counts, arguing that it can turn a simple, enjoyable activity into a source of anxiety and compulsion. While walking is a beneficial form of exercise, the pressure to hit high targets like 15,000 or 20,000 steps, fueled by social media influencers, can be counterproductive. The author notes that research suggests health benefits often plateau around 7,000 to 8,000 steps. The piece suggests that by quantifying every movement, people risk losing the intrinsic motivation and mental health benefits of simply moving for pleasure.</p>

          <p>Consumer advocates and a former executive are sounding the alarm over a recent corporate restructuring by Blue Shield of California, one of the state's largest health insurers. The nonprofit created a new parent corporation, Ascendiun Inc., in Delaware, a move approved by state regulators without public oversight. Critics worry this structure could allow Blue Shield to transfer billions of dollars in assets, accrued under its former tax-exempt status, to an out-of-state entity with little accountability. They are calling for the decision to be rescinded, reviving a long-standing debate over the insurer's obligations to the public.</p>

          <p>A recent boating accident on Lake Tahoe that killed eight people serves as a stark reminder of the importance of heeding weather forecasts and practicing boating safety. This commentary piece, written by a longtime boater, emphasizes that the storm, while intense, was not unexpected, as high winds had been predicted. The author provides basic safety rules, such as avoiding the water when winds are already blowing in the morning and not overloading a vessel beyond its practical capacity.

          <p>Interior designers suggest that bathrooms, often neglected spaces for decor, can be significantly enhanced with the right artwork. The key is to treat the bathroom like any other room in the home, avoiding clichÃ©d "potty humor" and instead choosing pieces that add a focal point and personality. Designers recommend a broad approach, from elegant paintings and personal photos to whimsical prints and even children's art. While moisture is a concern for valuable pieces, well-ventilated spaces can accommodate a variety of art, which can be hung on walls or propped on vanities to elevate the room's aesthetic.</p>

          <p>The Metals Company, led by CEO Gerard Barron, is pursuing plans to become the first to commercially mine the deep ocean floor, targeting a mineral-rich area in the Pacific Ocean. The company argues that extracting polymetallic nodules containing nickel and cobalt from the seabed is less environmentally damaging than land-based mining and can help the U.S. achieve mineral independence. However, scientists and dozens of countries have raised alarms about the potential for irreversible damage to largely unexplored marine ecosystems.

          <p>A new trade agreement between the UK and the US has come into force, providing British car manufacturers with preferential access to the American market. The deal allows up to 100,000 UK-made vehicles to be sold in the US with a 10% tariff, a significant reduction. However, a resolution for UK steel and aluminum exports remains elusive, as they are still subject to a 25% tariff that could double if a deal isn't reached by a July 9 deadline. In return, the UK will scrap tariffs on US beef and ethanol imports, a move that has raised concerns among British farmers and bioethanol producers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong stock exchange surged to become the world's top venue for initial public offerings (IPOs) in the first half of the year, with companies raising a total of US$13.5 billion. This represents an eightfold increase from the same period last year and marks the city's best first-half performance since 2021. According to LSEG data, Hong Kong surpassed both Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange. The resurgence is attributed to increased participation from international investors, significant capital inflows from mainland China, and strong post-listing performance for newly listed companies.

          <p>The Communist Party of China has announced that its membership surpassed 100.27 million by the end of 2024, making it the second-largest political party in the world. The party saw a net increase of 1.09 million members, representing a growth rate of 1.1%, which continues a trend of slowing growth compared to previous years. The data was released ahead of the party's founding anniversary on July 1. Unlike voters in Western systems, party members in China are subject to strict regulations, including paying membership fees and attending regular party activities.</p>
