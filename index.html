          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom, expected to boost relations between the two countries. The agreement, teased earlier on Truth Social, led to gains in the stock market and cryptocurrency values, with Bitcoin approaching $100,000. The deal aims to solidify the relationship between the U.S. and the UK, potentially easing the impact of recent tariff increases and benefiting sectors like the British auto industry. The New York Times reports that Prime Minister Keir Starmer's cultivation of Trump has paid off with this agreement.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Office for Students reveals that over 40% of universities in England anticipate financial deficits by this summer. The decline in international student enrollment, largely due to visa changes, is cited as the primary cause.

Universities UK acknowledges the report's findings as 'deeply sobering,' advocating for government support to address the sector's challenges.</p>

          <p>Experts offer guidance on whether to use an inheritance to pay off credit card debt, advising that the decision depends on individual financial circumstances and goals. Paying off high-interest debt can provide an immediate return and reduce financial stress, but it may not be the best option if balances are low or the inheritance has specific restrictions. Alternatives such as debt management programs and debt consolidation loans are also discussed for those without access to an inheritance.</p>

          <p>A Michigan jury deadlocked in the murder case against Christopher Schurr, a former police officer who fatally shot Patrick Lyoya during a traffic stop in 2022. Judge Christina Mims of the Kent County Circuit Court declared a mistrial after jurors said they were unable to reach a verdict. Schurr testified that he feared for his life when he opened fire at Lyoya, who grabbed his stun gun. Lyoya's death set off protests and heightened racial tensions in Michigan.</p>

          <p>Melinda French Gates reflected on her work with the Gates Foundation, as Bill Gates announced its closure in 2045. French Gates, who exited the foundation last year, expressed her hope that the foundation's legacy would be one of unlocking virtuous cycles, leading to long-term positive change. She highlighted her influence in launching the Giving Pledge, prioritizing gender equality, and investing in opening more offices in other countries. She noted the difficulty of achieving foundation goals, like eradicating polio, given recent cuts to international aid.</p>

          <p>Constance Marten was cross-examined by her partner, Mark Gordon, in their retrial for manslaughter by gross negligence over the death of their baby, Victoria. Marten described how 'all hell broke loose' with her family when she returned from Peru pregnant with her first child in 2017. She also said she had become 'very fearful' after their car 'exploded' in January 2023. Marten said that the police manhunt that began after their car caught fire following Victoria's birth meant that people started recognising them, so they decided to go and sleep in a tent on the South Downs.</p>

          <p>The United States and China are set to resume trade talks, but Trump's negotiating position is weakened by his inconsistent strategy and China's resolve. The Atlantic reports that China has successfully drawn other countries closer while Trump's administration has appeared to vacillate on its goals. Trump continues to overestimate his leverage, while Xi Jinping has worked to reduce China's reliance on the American market. The trade war has created economic pressure for both countries, but Xi has managed to turn the situation to his political advantage.</p>

          <p>Experts discuss whether gold investment allocations should change in response to the current economic climate. While financial advisors generally recommend keeping gold investments to around 10% of a portfolio, the question is whether this conventional allocation is still best. Some suggest increasing allocations due to economic uncertainty, while others recommend maintaining traditional levels. The ideal allocation depends on personal circumstances, risk appetite, and economic outlook.</p>

          <p>Analysts suggest that the prospects of a quick or substantial deal remain remote for trade talks between China and the United States. Points of contention have been numerous, with Beijing claiming Washington blinked first and affirming confidence in the resilience of its domestic economy and the administration of US President Donald Trump doing the same. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng in Geneva during a four-day visit beginning Friday, in what most consider to be at most an overture for a future deal.</p>

          <p>Russia will celebrate the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany's defeat with a large military parade in Moscow. The event is staged as a display of global clout, grandiose and intimidating, and a portent of eventual triumph in the war against Ukraine. The New York Times reports that the Kremlin is trying to link that triumph to the war in Ukraine. The parade is expected to be the largest since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, a commemoration the government and its cheerleaders have used to raise support for the war, conflating what may be the greatest source of national pride with the far more divisive current conflict.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has cut interest rates to 4.25% from 4.5%, citing a slowdown in inflation. Governor Andrew Bailey warned of the unpredictability of the global economy due to US tariffs. The Bank considered a larger cut to 4% but concluded that this would be offset by a drop in energy bills and eventually lower inflation. The decision comes as details of a tariff deal between the UK and US are set to be announced later. Five members voted to cut rates to 4.25%, two voted in favour of a larger reduction to 4% and two voted for no change.</p>
