          <p>Marius Borg Hoiby, the 28-year-old son of Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit, has been formally charged with multiple counts of sexual assault and bodily harm following a ten-month investigation. The charges involve a double-digit number of alleged victims and include one case of sexual assault involving intercourse and several others without. Hoiby, who does not hold a royal title, has previously admitted to violence under the influence of drugs and alcohol. His defense attorney stated that Hoiby takes the accusations seriously but denies wrongdoing in most cases, particularly those involving sexual abuse.</p>

          <p>The NHL's first semi-remote draft in a non-pandemic setting has drawn criticism from some general managers, including the Kings' Ken Holland, for its lack of traditional energy. The new format saw teams making selections from their home cities while top prospects gathered in Los Angeles. The event was marred by technical glitches, such as audio issues during virtual calls with teams, and a slower pace. While some players expressed their honor at being picked regardless of the format, veterans like Holland miss the excitement of having all teams and prospects in a single arena.</p>

          <p>Japanese and U.S. officials have agreed to continue negotiations over tariffs, though significant disagreements remain, particularly concerning the U.S. treatment of Japan's auto industry. The talks in Washington were described as "fruitful," but no immediate breakthrough was announced. This comes as the Trump administration hints at potentially extending a 90-day pause on certain "reciprocal" tariffs, which is set to expire in early July. Japan is facing a potential 14% country-specific tariff, in addition to a 25 percentage point increase on imported passenger vehicles imposed earlier. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team from China's Nankai University has reportedly completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels, avoiding open-skull surgery. This minimally invasive technique involves inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vasculature via a neck vein. In the trial, a 67-year-old patient paralyzed by a stroke was able to regain some limb movement. This approach is presented as a lower-risk alternative to methods like those used by Elon Musk's Neuralink, potentially offering a safer path for neurotechnology applications and faster patient recovery.</p>

          <p>U.S. federal prosecutors have charged 11 individuals in connection with a massive, Russia-based scheme that attempted to defraud the Medicare program of $10.6 billion. The transnational criminal organization allegedly purchased legitimate medical equipment companies and used stolen personal information from over a million Medicare recipients to file fraudulent claims. While the claims were for billions, Medicare paid out approximately $41 million, with supplemental insurers paying an estimated $900 million more. The scheme, allegedly led by an individual in Russia, was uncovered after beneficiaries reported receiving benefit forms for equipment they never ordered.</p>

The author suggests this neoconservative agenda became official U.S. policy following the September 11 attacks.

          <p>China's solar panel manufacturing industry is experiencing a significant downturn, facing a dual crisis of a domestic price war and prohibitive U.S. tariffs. Prices across the solar supply chain have dropped by 60 to 80 percent from their 2023 peak, leading to substantial financial losses for many of the nation's producers. The mood at a recent major industry conference in Shanghai was described as gloomy, with several top companies absent. This slump challenges one of China's key economic drivers and creates uncertainty for the future of its photovoltaic sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canadian businesses are facing significant uncertainty and financial strain due to shifting U.S. tariffs, particularly on metals and automobiles. Business owners express frustration over the inability to plan for the future, describing the unpredictable trade environment as a major killer for small enterprises. Canada's economy, which is heavily reliant on trade with the U.S., has slowed in the first quarter of 2025. While businesses hope for a stable trade agreement to be reached, recent developments, including the U.S. terminating discussions over a digital services tax, have only increased the instability.

          <p>The U.S. Senate voted 53-47 to defeat a resolution aimed at blocking the president from taking further military action against Iran without congressional approval. The measure, introduced by Senator Tim Kaine, was brought forward amid Democratic frustration over the lack of information regarding recent U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. Democrats have questioned the administration's characterization of the damage inflicted on Iran's program, suggesting the public may have been misled. Despite the resolution's failure, the debate highlights the ongoing constitutional struggle between Congress and the executive branch over war powers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Tulane University reveals that parts of New Orleans' post-Hurricane Katrina flood protection system are sinking at an alarming rate, in some places nearly two inches per year. This subsidence is happening faster than sea levels are rising, which reduces the capacity of the concrete flood walls to block storm surges. The research, which used satellite radar data, identified sinking hotspots in certain neighborhoods, industrial sites, and crucial wetlands. These findings serve as a wake-up call for ongoing monitoring and maintenance to ensure the city's flood defenses remain effective.</p>

The GHF, which bypasses the UN, was established by Israel to prevent aid from being seized by Hamas.

          <p>Recent changes to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) are signaling a major shift in U.S. vaccine policy under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. All 17 voting members of the influential panel were recently replaced with new appointees, many of whom are known for their contrarian views on vaccines. At their first meeting, the new committee, chaired by noted COVID contrarian Martin Kulldorff, raised numerous concerns about vaccine safety data and methodology. The meeting's tone and the administration's recent actions suggest a significant recasting of America's approach to public health.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has limited the ability of federal judges to issue nationwide injunctions, which block government policies across the entire country. The 6-3 decision came in a case related to President Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship. While the court did not rule on the constitutionality of the order itself, the majority opinion, authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, argued that such broad injunctions likely exceed the authority granted to federal courts. The ruling is a significant victory for the administration, but dissenters warned it weakens judicial checks on executive power.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has warned that a budget bill being debated in the U.S. Senate could cause as many as 3.4 million Californians to lose their Medi-Cal health insurance. The proposed legislation includes new work requirements for many Medicaid recipients, which Newsom argues would create a "labyrinth of manual verification" and lead to massive coverage losses. He stated the cuts would be "devastating" and could force the closure of rural hospitals. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the requirements would leave 4.8 million Americans uninsured nationwide over the next decade.</p>

The research assessed a diet comprising rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables. The study, which surveyed nearly 12,500 employees, found that those who adhered to this diet were less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms, even after isolating other potential influencing factors. Researchers noted that certain foods in the diet, such as those rich in folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, may contribute to improved mental well-being.</p>
