          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a record high for the third consecutive day, fueled by optimism surrounding ongoing trade discussions with the U.S., even as other Asian markets experienced declines due to banking sector fears and intensifying trade tensions. The Kospi's robust performance, touching an intraday high of 3,794.87, stood out as the only market in positive territory in the region, bucking wider losses on Wall Street. This article highlights a significant regional market strength amidst global economic uncertainties, contrasting with the struggles of other indices like Hong Kong's Hang Seng and Japan's Nikkei 225, which faced losses. Furthermore, specific company news, such as Chinese automaker BYD's large vehicle recall and TSMC's earnings beat, contributed to the mixed regional picture, emphasizing the diverse factors influencing market sentiment.

          <p>Residents of Alaska's coastal communities, including Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, are recounting their harrowing escapes after immense storm surges from Typhoon Halong's remnants flooded their homes, reaching over six feet above normal tide lines. Over 1,000 people have been airlifted to safety in one of the state's largest disasters, with one person dead and two missing, and 121 homes destroyed in Kipnuk alone. Many homes are now uninhabitable, and essential services like water and sewer systems are inoperable, forcing families to lose critical winter food supplies. The article highlights the resilience of the Alaska Native communities, who express gratitude for being alive despite extensive damage and an uncertain future, as the governor requests a federal disaster declaration to address the long-term recovery needs.</p>

          <p>Former members of the UK military are now able to apply for a new digital identity card, which can be downloaded to a smartphone. This initiative, available to approximately 1.8 million veterans, aims to simplify access to various public services such as GP and mental health support, supported housing, careers advice, and reduced entry prices at museums. Ministers view this rollout as a crucial "case study" for a planned broader digital ID scheme for all British citizens and residents, expected to be mandatory for work by 2029. The article emphasizes the optional digital card's role in modernizing public services, reducing red-tape, and addressing legitimate concerns around privacy and security for the wider scheme.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C., advocating for Tomahawk missiles capable of striking deep into Russia, which have a range of 2,500 km. This meeting follows a "very productive" phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, where they agreed to face-to-face talks in Hungary within two weeks. Trump expressed reservations about depleting U.S. missile stockpiles, despite Zelensky's assertion that Moscow is "rushing to resume dialogue" due to the prospect of Tomahawks.

          <p>Admiral Alvin Holsey, head of the U.S. military's Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), announced his retirement, effective mid-December, after 37 years of service. His departure comes as the Trump administration intensifies its anti-drug trafficking mission in the Caribbean, deploying naval warships, fighter jets, and thousands of troops, and conducting at least six strikes against alleged drug-carrying boats. These operations, which have reportedly caused casualties and now include survivors, are justified by the administration as a "non-international armed conflict" with cartels. However, they have raised concerns among some members of Congress regarding legal justification and heightened tensions with Venezuela, whose government is accused of working with cartels. The article notes the unexpected timing of Holsey's retirement amidst escalating regional activity and questions of stability within the chain of command.</p>

The article highlights that this action has rocked the fragile tariffs truce with the U.S., prompting President Trump to threaten additional tariffs and export controls on software.

The article highlights the immense logistical challenges due to the region's remoteness and damaged runways, with officials warning of a "very long-term situation" and comparing it to "Hurricane Katrina, but without roads," exacerbated by prior federal grant cuts for disaster preparedness in these vulnerable Indigenous communities.</p>

          <p>Sol Bashirian, owner of Sunday Gravy, a decades-old Italian restaurant in Inglewood, California, reports being "barely breaking even" due to the combined pressures of tariffs and inflation. Despite a 30% increase in sales, the rising costs of imported ingredients are significantly eroding profits, forcing him to spend thousands more monthly. The article highlights that many restaurants catering to lower and middle-income consumers are struggling, with nearly half planning to raise menu prices if costs continue to climb, potentially by 30.3% just to maintain a thin 5% profit margin. Bashirian has added a 5% surcharge to offset tariffs, but fears further price hikes could drive away customers, underscoring the severe challenges faced by the food industry.

          <p>Venezuelan fishermen, like Wilder Fernández, express profound fear for their lives as U.S. military operations targeting alleged "narco-terrorists" intensify in the Caribbean Sea. With at least six U.S. strikes on suspected drug boats since last month, resulting in at least 27 deaths and now reported survivors, fishermen worry about being caught in the crossfire or mistakenly hit, leading some to refuse to work. The article highlights the human cost of escalating tensions between the U.S. and Venezuela, as the Trump administration accuses President Maduro of drug trafficking and has authorized CIA covert operations. Despite the dangers, some fishermen show defiance, protesting the U.S. military deployment and vowing to defend their homeland, even as they face increased risks and potential recruitment by smugglers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military conducted an airstrike targeting an alleged drug vessel in the Caribbean, with officials confirming survivors for the first time in such operations, a notable shift from previous reports of no survivors. This marks at least the sixth strike against what the Trump administration labels "narcoterrorist" crafts, though no public evidence has been presented to support these assertions. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the strikes as necessary to combat illicit drug trafficking, stating they would continue as part of the president's campaign promise. Venezuela's UN ambassador, Samuel Moncada, denounced the U.S. actions as extrajudicial executions, urging a UN Security Council investigation and reaffirmation of Venezuela's sovereignty, while disputing the U.S. characterization of those killed.</p>

          <p>E-bikes are experiencing a significant boom, becoming a nearly $2 billion market, but this surge in popularity is accompanied by increased safety risks, particularly for younger riders. Emergency room visits among children aged 10 to 17 due to e-bike incidents have more than tripled since 2019, prompting concerns from local officials. Montvale Mayor Mike Ghassali expresses alarm over high-speed e-bikes, which can reach 50 mph, being purchased for children without adequate training, licenses, or insurance, calling them "death traps." The article highlights the patchwork of existing safety regulations and new legislative efforts, such as those proposed by Rep. Josh Gottheimer, to address helmet use for riders under 18 and crack down on unsafe underage riding.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military flew three B-52 bombers near Venezuela's coast, approximately 150 miles north, as the Trump administration continues to pressure President Nicolás Maduro's government. This mission is part of a monthslong increase in military activity in the Caribbean, including the deployment of eight warships, a nuclear submarine, and fighter jets, totaling about 10,000 U.S. forces. The article highlights that these actions, alongside airstrikes on alleged drug boats and confirmed covert CIA operations in Venezuela, escalate tensions with Maduro, who is accused of collaborating with cartels and gangs. Maduro denies these ties, viewing the U.S. actions as attempts at regime change, while the B-52 deployment underscores a significant show of force in the region.</p>

The images show brown mountain peaks, particularly in the Central and Southern Sierra Nevada range, becoming brilliant white with snow, extending into Nevada and Utah. Reservoirs across the state are now at or above historical levels for this time of year, significantly delaying the fire season in Los Angeles for weeks, if not months, as plants absorb moisture. The article highlights how this "weak, or Level 1, atmospheric river" has started the water year on a favorable foot, greatly aiding the state's recovery from drought conditions.</p>

Both patients were hospitalized but are now recovering at home. Clade I is concerning due to its potential for more severe illness and easier transmission through close personal contact, including massage or cuddling, in addition to sex. The article differentiates this from the 2022 Clade II outbreak, which generally causes milder illness, and emphasizes the importance of continued surveillance, early response, and vaccination for at-risk populations, while noting the overall risk to the general U.S. population remains low.</p>

The article highlights Witherspoon's commitment to celebrating strong female characters through her production company, Hello Sunshine, which she started in 2011 to address the lack of complex storytelling for women in Hollywood. She emphasizes the importance of portraying women with unique skillsets and intelligence in media, stating that creativity doesn't stop at any age.</p>

Critics accuse the SFC of abducting, torturing, and killing opposition activists, allegations the unit denies, while some of its officers have been convicted of abusing power. The article highlights growing resentment among regular army generals due to the SFC's disproportionate influence and the promotion of Museveni's son, Gen Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who has also enlisted his own son. Concerns are raised about potential power struggles and instability in a post-Museveni era, drawing parallels to Sudan's civil war, as the SFC's existence was recently legitimized by parliament despite opposition.</p>

An S&P director estimates nationwide primary property sales will fall by 8% in 2025 and between 6-7% in 2026, driven by soft overall demand. This ongoing downturn is expected to maintain significant pressure on Chinese developers, many of whom are already struggling to deliver homes while managing substantial debt obligations.

          <p>President Trump has unusually acknowledged authorizing the CIA to conduct covert operations in Venezuela, an admission typically kept secret, known as a "presidential finding." This grants the agency broad leeway, potentially including lethal strikes against suspected drug traffickers or actions aimed at destabilizing or toppling Nicolás Maduro's regime. The article highlights that such authorizations, which don't require congressional approval to initiate, have historically led to various outcomes, from funding insurgencies to regime change, with a mixed track record in Latin America. Concerns are raised about the lack of limitations, as executive orders governing CIA activities can be easily changed, and the potential for wide-ranging, uncooperative actions against the Venezuelan government, including "manhunting" criminal networks.</p>
