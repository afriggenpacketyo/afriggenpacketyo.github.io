          <p>Two European brown bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon, a conservation charity near Exeter, leading to the park's evacuation. The bears, weighing approximately 397lbs each, made their way to the food store and consumed a week's worth of honey. The park's emergency team, including trained firearms staff, and police were deployed, but the bears remained calm and did not breach any public areas. An investigation has been launched to determine how the bears escaped, and the park has since reopened to the public, with the exhibit secured. The article reflects the zoo's efforts to ensure the safety of the public and the well-being of the animals during the incident.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant drop after President Trump indicated that China could continue purchasing oil from Iran, signaling a potential easing of the U.S.'s pressure campaign on the country after a ceasefire with Israel. Brent crude fell by 5.68% to $67.42 per barrel, while U.S. crude oil decreased by 5.66% to $64.63 a barrel. This decision is seen as a shift in focus towards lowering oil prices, with analysts noting Trump's historical reluctance to remove Iranian supply from the market. The change in policy has led investors to believe that the risk of major supply disruptions in the Middle East has decreased. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has pledged to move forward with planned welfare changes despite significant opposition from Labour MPs, who are rebelling against cuts to disability and sickness-related benefits. The Prime Minister argues that the current welfare system is unsustainable and needs reform to prevent rising costs to taxpayers. Critics, including Labour MP Dame Meg Hillier, cite concerns about the impact on poverty, lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessments. The proposed changes aim to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payments, with the government aiming to save Â£5bn a year by 2030.</p>

          <p>The first RAF evacuation flight carrying 63 British nationals and their families from Israel landed in the UK at Birmingham Airport. Passengers expressed gratitude but criticized the evacuation plan as "shambolic," citing delays and insufficient capacity. Former Labour MP Louise Ellman shared her experience of being stranded in Jerusalem and praised the RAF for their service. The flight occurred after Israeli airspace was closed due to the conflict with Iran, leaving many Britons stranded, but a second evacuation flight has already departed. The passengers sang both the Israeli national anthem and God Save The King on the plane in a moment of unity.</p>

Research indicates a record high in competition for graduate roles, with an average of 140 applications per job in 2024. Morgan believes that artificial intelligence used in resume screening programs may have initially hindered her progress, as her CV required adjustments to be properly read by the systems, but ultimately she prevailed in securing her first job.</p>

He also emphasizes the value of fighting for good relationships, helping those who are sick, and practicing acceptance.

Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson dissented, accusing the government of unlawful conduct and undermining due process. The Department of Homeland Security hailed the ruling as a victory for American safety and security. This decision allows the administration to continue its efforts to deport migrants to countries other than their origin, including arrangements with countries like El Salvador to detain migrants.</p>

These voters cite concerns about Iran's nuclear ambitions and express support for Israel, often influenced by Christian Zionist views.

          <p>A provision in the Senate Republican bill to enact President Trump's agenda would force the USPS to sell its new electric vehicle mail trucks and cancel the contract for the remaining vehicles. The bill aims to cut costs and shift USPS away from environmental initiatives, but the Senate parliamentarian found that the provision violates the Byrd Rule. The USPS estimates it would cost over $450 million to replace the revoked vehicles, and the potential for raising money at auction is "negligible" due to the specialized design of the trucks. Critics argue this move would cripple the USPS's ability to modernize its aging fleet.</p>

          <p>Data indicates a significant increase in ICE detentions of immigrants without any criminal history under the Trump administration, contradicting claims that the agency prioritizes criminals. Since the start of Trump's second term, there has been a 1,271% increase in detained immigrants with no criminal record. Nearly a third of all people arrested by ICE and booked into immigration detention have no criminal history, despite the administration's focus on "criminal aliens." This trend has led to overcrowded detention facilities and sparked protests across the country.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has been escalating deportations and intimidating protesters, enabled by Supreme Court decisions that limit accountability for federal law enforcement officers. Cases like HernÃ¡ndez v. Mesa and Egbert v. Boule have weakened the ability to sue federal officers for violating constitutional rights, particularly the Fourth Amendment. The Republican justices argue that nullifying Bivens suits is necessary to restore a more traditional vision of the separation of legislative and judicial power. These rulings have emboldened officers and undermined the Constitution's protections against unlawful actions.</p>

Dr. Jones encourages celebrating with a purpose, such as visiting a museum to understand the history and lived experience of freedom, and emphasizes the importance of learning about the history behind Juneteenth to understand collective ancestry and sacrifice.</p>

          <p>Several common tax debt mistakes can lead to significant fees and penalties, including assuming the debt is too small to matter and ignoring letters from the IRS. Many taxpayers don't realize the IRS offers payment options like installment agreements and Offers in Compromise, and fail to file on time due to inability to pay, which incurs higher penalties. Hiring unqualified help and believing bankruptcy will wipe out all tax debt are also common errors. Taking a proactive approach and seeking qualified assistance can help avoid these pitfalls.
