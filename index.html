          <p>Local officials in Texas stated they were unprepared for the deadly flash floods that occurred over the July 4th holiday, as torrential rains caused the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes. The event unfolded at night while most residents were asleep, contributing to the high casualty rate. Kerr County's top elected official confirmed the county lacks a river warning system and had no indication that the rainfall would lead to such a catastrophic event. The disaster has prompted a massive search and rescue operation for numerous missing individuals, including many children from a summer camp.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most significant event in world history since the birth of Christ, as it introduced the concept of the citizen. He argued that the era was a bloody civil war, far more divided than the U.S. is today, and that understanding its complexities and the founders' flaws makes its achievements more inspiring. Burns emphasized that America is held together by the words of its founding documents, which he believes offer a path to overcome current divisions by reinvesting in shared principles and the responsibilities of citizenship.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Bogota have arrested the alleged mastermind behind the June 7th shooting of Colombian senator and presidential candidate Miguel Uribe Turbay. The suspect, identified as Elder José Arteaga Hernández, has a criminal history spanning over two decades and was apprehended nearly a month after the attack. Uribe was shot twice in the head during a political speech and remains in intensive care following multiple surgeries. The attack has been widely condemned as a threat to democracy in a nation with a history of political violence.</p>

The demonstrators were protesting in support of Palestine Action, a group that was officially proscribed as a terrorist organization on the same day. This designation makes it a criminal offense to be a member of or show support for the group, punishable by up to 14 years in prison. The government banned Palestine Action following a history of criminal damage, including an incident that caused an estimated £7 million in damages to military aircraft.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is facing backlash for an email claiming a new spending bill signed by President Trump eliminates federal income taxes on benefits for most recipients. Critics, including former agency officials and Democratic lawmakers, have labeled the statement as "blatant misinformation" and a "lie," clarifying that the legislation provides only a temporary deduction, not a full tax elimination.

Doctors state there is no scientific evidence that its ingredients can lower cortisol levels, which are naturally highest in the morning.

Its ingenious design, which breaks down characters by shape rather than sound, is now recognized as a precursor to the predictive text and input methods used in modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean computing today.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's highest-ranking military commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, has warned that Russia may be preparing for a new offensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region. After spending two days assessing the situation and troop needs in the area, Syrskyi stated that Russia appears to be looking to press its advantage in troop numbers. This warning comes as Russian forces have been slowly advancing along various parts of the front line and have already established a small foothold in the neighboring Sumy region. Ukraine is preparing tactical and technological solutions to counter the potential advance.</p>

          <p>After being banned for over 100 years due to pollution, swimming has officially returned to the Seine River in Paris. Following a $1.5 billion cleanup project linked to last year's Olympics, designated swimming areas have been opened to the public. On Saturday, eager Parisians took the plunge into the iconic waterway, an event celebrated by Mayor Anne Hidalgo as the realization of a "childhood dream." While some residents remain skeptical about the water's cleanliness, officials have confirmed that bacteria levels meet safety standards on most days.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Oregon State University's Big Fish Lab are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to better understand ocean health and change the public's negative perception of the creatures. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team catches sharks, examines their stomach contents to assess their diet and water quality, and then releases them. Researchers emphasize that a healthy shark population is a key indicator of a healthy marine ecosystem. Despite public fascination with sharks, the lab has found it challenging to secure financial support for its vital research.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has elaborated on his idea for a new political party, suggesting it could strategically focus on a small number of pivotal House and Senate races. By winning just a few seats, he argues the "America Party" could become the deciding vote in a narrowly divided Congress, ensuring legislation serves the public will. This proposal follows a public feud with President Trump over a new spending bill, which Musk vehemently opposed. A poll Musk posted on his social media platform X showed majority support for creating an alternative to the two-party system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened a large new luxury beach resort in the coastal city of Wonsan, a project that took nearly a decade to complete amid sanctions and pandemic lockdowns. The Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area features high-rise hotels, villas, and numerous amenities, intended to attract tourism and boost the nation's economy. However, the country remains largely closed to foreign visitors, with the exception of small, organized groups from Russia. Analysts view the resort as a sign of the regime's dual pursuit of economic development alongside its military ambitions and international isolation.</p>

          <p>An Arizona man was fined $4,000 by his property management company after posting negative online reviews about his rental experience, which included black mold and unfinished repairs. A clause in his lease prohibited negative reviews, but such "gag clauses" are illegal under the 2016 Consumer Review Fairness Act (CRFA), which protects consumers' rights to share honest feedback. After being contacted by local news, the company, Denali Real Estate, stated it would remove the clause from future contracts. The incident serves as a reminder that businesses cannot legally penalize customers for truthful, negative reviews.</p>

The multistory building collapsed on Friday, and emergency crews have been working with heavy machinery to search for at least eight more people believed to be trapped in the rubble. Such incidents are unfortunately common in Pakistan, where lax enforcement of construction standards and the use of substandard materials often lead to structural failures.

          <p>A doctor working at a public hospital details the severe challenges that new federal work requirements for Medicaid will pose for the country's most vulnerable patients. The physician argues that for many patients who are homeless, disabled, or face language and technological barriers, the bureaucratic burden of proving employment or exemption will be insurmountable, causing them to lose coverage despite being eligible. Citing projections that nearly 12 million Americans will lose insurance, the author contends the policy is engineered to cut costs by disenrolling people who need care the most.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, advocates for a "90-second rule" to better manage anger and stress. Based on neuroscientific findings, the rule acknowledges that the physiological response to an emotional trigger, like a surge of cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this brief period, any continued feeling of anger is a choice sustained by replaying the negative thought. Gawdat suggests using this 90-second buffer to consciously decide how to react, rather than unconsciously renewing the emotional cycle, leading to a more fulfilled life.</p>

          <p>A shopkeeper in Durham, UK, who personally apprehended a man stealing a crate of beer, expressed frustration that the thief faced no significant punishment. After the owner brought the man back to the store, police dealt with the incident through a community resolution, which does not result in a criminal conviction. The offender was required to pay for the stolen goods and was banned from the shop. The shopkeeper argues this lack of legal deterrent sends the wrong signal and fuels the ongoing problem of shoplifting, a crime for which police reports are at a record high.</p>
