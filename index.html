          <p>A decade-long study of parents with high-achieving children identifies five strategies that contribute to their children's success.

The study emphasizes the importance of creating a supportive environment where children feel empowered to pursue their passions. The research also notes a shift in developmental psychology towards fostering a love of learning rather than solely focusing on hard work and grit.</p>

Patients without app access will receive text messages and letters as a last resort, and NHS phone lines will be freed up.
