          <h2>Scientific Explanation for Why Cities Experience More Intense Heat</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 21:23:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the "urban heat island" effect, a phenomenon responsible for cities being significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. Hard, dark surfaces like roads and buildings absorb and retain the sun's heat, which is then slowly released, elevating temperatures. This effect is exacerbated by waste heat from human activities and a lack of cooling vegetation and water, making urban populations more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and increasingly frequent heatwaves.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, UK, is teaching primary school children about sun safety to help reduce future cases of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer. The initiative educates children as young as five on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen, with plans for a nationwide rollout by 2026. Experts emphasize that childhood sunburn significantly increases melanoma risk, and with diagnoses projected to rise, preventative education is seen as a crucial public health measure.</p>

Park visitors were moved to a secure building as a precaution, but the bears were not considered a public threat and eventually returned to their enclosure on their own, with the incident being attributed to an operational error.</p>

          <p>Police in Phoenix, Arizona, rescued a baby who had been left alone in an apartment for several days after the infant's mother passed away. Officers were called for a welfare check and, upon seeing the woman unresponsive on the floor, forced entry into the home. They found the baby on a bed, visibly emaciated, and immediately handed the child over to fire department personnel for life-saving medical care. The baby is now expected to make a full recovery.</p>
