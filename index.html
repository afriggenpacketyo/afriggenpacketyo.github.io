        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba dismissed his agriculture minister after a remark about gifted rice angered the public amidst rising rice prices. The dismissal comes at a sensitive time, with a parliamentary election looming, and analysts suggest it could jeopardize Ishiba's premiership. To mitigate the damage, Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister, hoping his popularity will help restore public confidence. Opposition parties are seizing the opportunity to pressure Ishiba to address high rice prices, further destabilizing his minority government.</p>

          <p>Japan's core inflation accelerated to 3.5% in April, driven by surging rice prices and other factors, marking the highest level in over two years. This development has put the Bank of Japan in a position to consider pausing its rate hike posture to assess the impact of U.S. tariffs. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged to lower rice prices, staking his job on the line, as the country grapples with sustained inflation above the central bank's target. The Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled his stance on intending to raise rates given price trends, while also citing the need to monitor closely the effects of U.S. tariffs.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council approved a $14-billion budget for 2025-26, scaling back Mayor Karen Bass’ public safety initiatives due to a nearly $1-billion budget shortfall. The budget cuts funding for LAPD recruitment, resulting in fewer officers than any point since 1995, and reduces the number of new hires for the Los Angeles Fire Department. The council aimed to spare 1,000 city workers from layoffs, but the budget still faces criticism for potentially making the city less safe.

          <p>Evidence presented by Donald Trump regarding alleged mass killings of white South Africans included images from the Democratic Republic of Congo and footage falsely portrayed as depicting burial sites. The White House claimed the video showed evidence of genocide of white farmers in South Africa. The video prominently featured Julius Malema, a firebrand politician known for his radical rhetoric, but Trump falsely said he was a government official, insinuating his inflammatory slogans reflected an official policy against South Africa’s white minority.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has escalated its conflict with Harvard University by halting its ability to enroll international students and ordering existing students to transfer or lose their legal status. Homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, accused Harvard of “fostering violence, antisemitism and coordinating with the Chinese Communist party on its campus”. Previously, the Trump administration terminated a further $450m in grants to the university in May, after an earlier cancellation of $2.2bn in federal funding.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration revoked Harvard's ability to enroll international students, plunging thousands of students into uncertainty. The decision has been met with fear and confusion as students worry about their degrees and future job prospects. The move is seen as an escalation in the administration's feud with Harvard, following previous funding cuts and a lawsuit filed by the university. The university has faced rapid-fire aggressions since its president, Alan M. Garber, told the Trump administration in April that Harvard would not give in to demands to change its hiring and admissions practices and its curriculum.</p>
