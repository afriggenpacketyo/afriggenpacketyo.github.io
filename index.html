            <p>The Trump administration has exempted smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices from tariffs, including those imposed on Chinese imports. This decision comes after concerns from U.S. tech companies about potential price increases, as many of these goods are manufactured in China. The exemptions, backdated to April 5th, also include semiconductors, solar cells, and memory cards. The White House stated that the exemptions were made to provide companies with more time to move production to the U.S., although these items remain subject to a 20% tariff related to fentanyl.</p>

Parkview Green, known for its art collection, is diversifying its restaurant offerings, while Shanghai K11 is easing tenant criteria due to falling rental income.

            <p>Residents of Wigtown, Scotland, have successfully saved their 200-year-old pub, The Plough Inn, from being converted into flats.

The show will be overseen by SNL creator Lorne Michaels and will feature British comedic talent. While the US show has served as a springboard for comedic talent, it is uncertain whether the UK version will reach the same heights. Previous attempts to translate US late-night shows to the UK have often struggled.</p>

Emergency legislation was passed to enable the government to take control of the plant, and securing raw materials is crucial to maintain operations. Nationalization is becoming increasingly likely as a long-term solution. Jingye had been seeking to sell off to other buyers raw materials already en route to Lincolnshire, which is what convinced the government it had to act and act quickly.</p>
