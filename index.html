          <p>Experts advise homeowners to carefully consider borrowing against their home equity, especially in the current high-interest rate environment. The article suggests shopping around for the best rates and terms from various lenders, understanding all associated fees, and choosing a repayment term that aligns with their financial situation. Homeowners should assess their needs and avoid borrowing without a clear purpose, focusing on long-term value rather than short-term wants. The article concludes that borrowing against home equity can be a beneficial financial tool if used strategically and in accordance with an overall financial plan. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments regarding the Trump administration's attempt to limit the reach of lower court injunctions that blocked the president's birthright citizenship policy. The administration argues that district court judges lack the authority to issue injunctions that extend beyond the parties involved in the litigation. The ACLU contends that restricting nationwide injunctions would make it harder to challenge illegal government actions and protect constitutional rights. The court's decision could significantly impact the ability of judges to block presidential policies nationwide, affecting various aspects of the Trump administration's agenda.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The EPA plans to revise certain limits on PFAS, commonly known as "forever chemicals," in drinking water that were established the previous year. Limits on three types of PFAS, including GenX substances, will be reconsidered, along with a limit on a mixture of several PFAS types. The agency will maintain standards for PFOA and PFOS, setting them at 4 parts per trillion, but will grant utilities an additional two years, until 2031, to comply. This decision aligns with some arguments made by water utilities in their lawsuit against the EPA, while environmental groups criticize the move as illegal and harmful to public health.</p>

          <p>The United States and Britain have announced a preliminary trade agreement to lower tariffs and create export opportunities for American agricultural products. However, differences in food production standards, particularly regarding hormone-treated beef and chlorine-washed chicken, could hinder a more comprehensive trade deal. While U.S. officials aim to increase access for American products, British consumers are wary of American food safety and animal welfare practices. The article notes that British regulations, largely inherited from the European Union, prioritize animal welfare and environmental protection, leading to public resistance against lowering food production standards.</p>

          <p>Walmart reported strong sales growth, particularly in its e-commerce division, but cautioned that tariffs imposed by President Trump will soon lead to higher prices for consumers. The retail giant stated that it cannot absorb the full impact of the tariffs due to narrow retail margins. While Walmart will try to keep food prices low, shoppers may see price increases on general merchandise items as early as the end of the month. Despite these challenges, Walmart maintained its full-year financial forecast, but refrained from projecting profits for the current quarter due to tariff policy uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher due to economic changes and policy uncertainties. He noted that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, and that higher real rates may reflect more volatile inflation. Powell's remarks highlighted the challenges central banks face in balancing employment and controlling inflation, especially with potential supply shocks. While he did not directly mention President Trump's tariffs, he acknowledged they could slow growth and boost inflation, complicating the Fed's policy decisions.</p>

The CFO stated that the magnitude of the increases is more than any retailer or supplier can absorb, and consumers are likely to see higher prices later this month and in June. Walmart expects net sales to increase, but declined to provide earnings guidance due to fluctuating U.S. tariff policy.

          <p>A new analysis reveals that a shortage of affordable homes is preventing many middle-income families from achieving homeownership. Only a small percentage of listed homes are affordable for households earning $75,000 annually, a significant decrease from pre-pandemic levels. Rising home prices and mortgage rates have pushed homes out of reach for many middle-class families, leading to a growing affordability gap. The lack of affordable homes is partly due to a decline in new construction following the 2006 housing crisis, exacerbating the problem of rising prices.</p>

          <p>Walmart has announced plans to raise prices on certain items, despite the U.S. governmentâ€™s lowering of tariffs. The company cites President Trump's trade levies as impeding its ability to keep prices low. CEO Doug McMillon stated that even with reduced tariff levels, higher prices will result. The price hikes are expected to go into effect later this month. However, Walmart emphasized that it will do what it can to avoid passing the import taxes onto customers.</p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States fell significantly last year, marking the strongest sign yet of progress against the opioid crisis. Data from the CDC showed deaths declined in all major drug use categories and in most states. While public health experts are cautiously optimistic, they worry about the impact of proposed cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing the drug crisis. Despite the progress, drug fatalities remain high, and experts emphasize the need for continued investment in treatment and support programs.</p>

If approved, this would be the first time National Guard troops are used to enforce immigration laws within the United States.</p>
