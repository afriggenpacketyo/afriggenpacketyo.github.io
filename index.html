          <p>Chief Justice John Roberts issued a statement criticizing President Trump's call to impeach Judge James Boasberg, who ruled against the administration's deportation plans.  Roberts emphasized that impeachment is not the appropriate response to judicial decisions, and the normal appeals process should be used instead.  Republican Representative Brandon Gill filed articles of impeachment against Boasberg, but House GOP leaders haven't commented on a potential vote.</p>

          <p>Home equity loans generally cannot exceed the equity in your home. Lenders use a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, typically capping borrowing at 80-90% of the home's value minus the mortgage balance.  While some government programs or lenders might offer exceptions, these often come with stricter requirements.</p>
