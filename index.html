Daryl Wilkins, another resident, reports cracks in his home due to vibrations from the construction. The project, while intended to improve connectivity and prosperity, has led to ongoing disputes between residents and the Welsh government regarding compensation and damages.

          <p>Council tax in England is projected to rise by 5% annually to fund local services, including policing, as indicated in the Spending Review documents. This increase, which local authorities can implement without central government approval, is factored into government calculations for a 2.3% annual real-terms increase in police spending power. Chancellor Rachel Reeves clarified that councils are not obligated to raise taxes by the maximum amount, but the increase is intended to support essential services like social care and policing. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government will experience a budget cut, but overall council spending power is expected to rise with the tax increase.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are proposing a plan to penalize colleges and universities whose students accumulate high student loan debt without a corresponding increase in earnings, while rewarding institutions that provide better value for the money. The risk-sharing plan would require schools to reimburse the federal government for a portion of the federal loan debt their students fail to repay. The proposal aims to incentivize colleges to focus on student outcomes and reduce the burden of student loan debt.

The findings suggest that Trump's approach to international relations, including withdrawing from the Paris climate accord and imposing tariffs on allies, has negatively impacted global perceptions of U.S. leadership.

The email said the agency had "revoked" the "upcoming reduction in force" notices the workers had previously received, but it did not explain the reason that HHS appeared to be reinstating hundreds of workers. The reinstated workers include staff from the National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, and the National Center for Environmental Health, raising hopes for the restoration of vital public health programs. While some scientists are excited to resume their work, others express confusion and apprehension about the consequences of the decision.</p>

          <h2>ICE Implements New Strategy for Arrests at Immigration Courts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has adopted a new strategy of arresting migrants at immigration courts after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) dismisses their cases, as part of an effort to meet a steep daily arrest quota. This tactic has caught judges and lawyers off guard, with the Executive Office for Immigration Review detailing the approach for judges in a recent email. The strategy involves quickly deporting individuals without legal status, bypassing traditional legal processes. Critics argue that this approach undermines due process and instills fear among immigrants, while supporters claim it streamlines case processing and aligns with mass deportation efforts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A provision in a House-passed bill threatens to cut deeply into the retirement income of federal employees, specifically eliminating a special retirement supplement for those retiring before age 62. This supplement, intended as a financial bridge between the ages of 57 and 62, is part of the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). The proposed cut has sparked outrage among federal workers, who view it as a betrayal of promised benefits, particularly after many took early retirement due to government downsizing fears. Opponents of the cut argue that it undermines an important retention tool for the government, while supporters claim federal retirement benefits are overly generous.</p>

          <p>The global nuclear watchdog has determined that Iran has failed to meet its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in 20 years, potentially complicating talks between Iran and the US over a new nuclear agreement. The IAEA report cited a lack of cooperation from Iran and raised concerns about undeclared nuclear material in areas under investigation. A resolution passed by the IAEA's board of governors could lead to a referral to the UN Security Council. Despite these findings, Iran maintains that its nuclear activities are peaceful and not intended for developing nuclear weapons.</p>
