            <p>Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) addressed media concerns regarding his El Salvador visit, asserting it was to ensure Kilmar Abrego Garcia's due process rights, not to defend Abrego Garcia himself. Van Hollen emphasized the Trump administration's admission of Abrego Garcia's wrongful detention and deportation, stressing the importance of upholding the rule of law for all. He also cautioned against jeopardizing constitutional rights, stating that denying them to one person endangers everyone. Van Hollen described Abrego Garcia's trauma from imprisonment, particularly his time at the CECOT prison, highlighting the human impact of the case.</p>

            <p>Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan are considering investing in the Alaska LNG project, aiming to secure trade deals and avoid U.S. tariffs. This project, estimated at over $40 billion, involves building a pipeline from Alaska's North Slope to the Cook Inlet for LNG export. Trump has touted the project as a national priority, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested it could aid trade negotiations. The project has the potential to supply 20 million metric tons of LNG annually, and the permits are already in place with construction on the LNG plant expected to begin in late 2026.

            <p>An Israeli military inquiry has concluded that the killing of 14 emergency workers in Gaza last month resulted from an "operational misunderstanding." The IDF claims its troops opened fire believing they faced a threat from enemy forces in a hostile combat zone, citing poor night visibility as a factor in misidentifying ambulances. The report also states that six of the casualties were Hamas members, though evidence was not produced to support any affiliation to Hamas. The deputy commander of the unit involved has been dismissed for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report during the debrief.</p>

            <p>A leaked draft Trump administration executive order proposes a significant restructuring of the U.S. State Department, including cuts to sub-Saharan operations and bureaus related to climate, refugees, human rights, and gender equality. The proposal includes eliminating the Bureau of International Organizations and reducing diplomatic operations in Canada, reorganizing the department into four regional bureaus. The order aims to impose a "disciplined reorganization" and cut waste, with hiring based on alignment with the president's foreign policy vision. While some officials dismiss the draft as a hoax, others fear a more modest but still unpopular reorganization.</p>

The tariffs, potentially reaching 145% on Chinese-manufactured electronics, could incentivize consumers to opt for refurbished options. While some analysts agree tariffs could boost short-term used device sales, they suspect consumers will revert to buying new tech when affordable. The CEO anticipates a shift in Back Market's sales ratio, with U.S. customers accounting for two-thirds of purchases due to tariff-driven savings. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Germany is seeking to deport an American and three EU citizens over alleged actions at pro-Palestinian protests, sparking concerns about freedom of movement and due process. The deportation orders, connected to a protest at Berlin's Free University, instruct the individuals to leave Germany by April 21. Those served with deportation orders say they have no information about charges and are appealing the requirement to leave Germany. The concept of Staatsräson, Germany's responsibility toward Israel, is cited as part of the grounds for the deportation, drawing criticism from lawyers.</p>

            <p>As retirement nears, investors can mitigate the impact of tariff volatility by rebalancing portfolios based on risk tolerance and building cash reserves. Financial planners recommend shifting assets to a 60/40 investment portfolio and keeping two years of income in cash to avoid selling investments during market downturns. Considering a bond ladder can also provide a steady income stream and protect against sequence of returns risk. These strategies aim to "protect your nest egg" and provide confidence during volatile market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

Reflecting on the prevalence of dishonesty in dating, the author questions whether all lies are inherently awful.

The author's initial lie didn't ruin the relationship and was revealed years later, which worked out surprisingly well.</p>

The Justice Department argues that Google should stop making third-party payments to ensure its default search position. The case could redefine digital market regulation and impact tech innovation. The last tech-related government antitrust case of this magnitude was against Microsoft in 1998.</p>

This would strengthen the renminbi's exchange rate and challenge the dominance of the US dollar. The mandatory use of the renminbi would force the US to buy Chinese currency on a large scale, increasing its use and demand. A rapid appreciation in the renminbi would signal strong economic fundamentals and encourage global investors to increase their holdings of renminbi assets.</p>
