          <p>Four survivors have quit a national inquiry into child sexual exploitation, demanding the resignation of safeguarding minister Jess Phillips. They allege Phillips publicly contradicted and dismissed their legitimate concerns regarding the inquiry's direction, scope, and potential chairs' links to policing. This public dismissal has eroded their trust, taking them back to feelings of not being believed. Despite Phillips's defense and support from other survivors, the controversy has created a "highly charged and toxic environment," leading two potential chairs to withdraw.</p>

          <p>French police have discovered DNA traces in a helmet and glove left behind by suspects in the recent $102 million Louvre jewelry heist. This breakthrough comes as the museum's director, Laurence des Cars, revealed her resignation was rejected by lawmakers after she took responsibility for security weaknesses. Des Cars acknowledged the museum's "aging infrastructure" and "underinvestment" in perimeter security, despite internal alarms and cameras functioning. The investigation points to organized crime, but an inside job has not been ruled out.</p>

          <p>Shanghai and Beijing reported GDP growth rates of 5.5% and 5.6% respectively for the first nine months of the year, surpassing China's national average of 5.2%. This growth is primarily fueled by strengthening domestic demand, with retail sales increasing by 4.3% year-on-year, despite a slower start to the year. Hi-tech manufacturing, encompassing AI, integrated circuits, and biotechnology, significantly contributed to the industrial sector's expansion. While the economy shows stronger internal momentum, authorities caution that external uncertainties persist, necessitating further policy support to solidify the recovery.</p>

          <p>Global oil prices, including Brent and US crude, jumped over 5% after the Trump administration imposed new sanctions on Russia's two largest crude companies, Rosneft and Lukoil. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated the sanctions aim to pressure Moscow to end the war in Ukraine and will harm the Kremlin's ability to fund its military. This move follows failed peace talks between President Trump and Russian leader Vladimir Putin. The sanctions also come amidst Trump's efforts to persuade India to reduce its purchases of Russian oil, highlighting escalating economic pressure.</p>

          <p>The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that USA Powerlifting's (USAPL) disqualification of a biological male transgender athlete from women's competition constituted discrimination. USAPL criticized the decision, asserting it acted for "legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons" to ensure fairness, citing scientific research on male physiological advantages. The court's unanimous ruling, sending part of the case back to a lower court to assess USAPL's "legitimate business purpose," has been condemned by Minnesota Republicans.

          <p>England's water companies achieved their worst combined environmental performance score in 2024, with serious pollution incidents rising 60% from the previous year. The Environment Agency rated all but one of the nine companies as "requiring improvement" or worse, with Thames Water receiving the lowest one-star rating amid significant financial troubles. Industry body Water UK acknowledged poor performance but attributed it to a "failed system" before new investments. Environmental Secretary Emma Reynolds vowed decisive action, but campaigners are calling for a complete overhaul of the privatized water model.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An expert analysis of over a hundred past societal crises, spanning two millennia, identifies the "wealth pump" as a recurring mechanism driving instability. This process involves the transfer of wealth from the general population to a concentrated elite, leading to rising economic and political inequality. The wealth pump undermines stability by fostering popular discontent, creating an overproduction of elites competing for power, and increasing the number of frustrated, highly educated youth. Historical resolutions often involved major epidemics, civil wars, or transformative revolutions, but modern societies can learn from past reforms to rebalance wealth and power, requiring decades of political struggle.</p>

          <h2>US Sanctions on Russian Oil Aim to Pressure Moscow to End Ukraine War</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration imposed "tremendous" new sanctions on Russia's largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, to pressure Moscow into ending its war on Ukraine. These measures, targeting firms that fund the Kremlin's "war machine," mark a significant shift in US policy after previous attempts at brokering peace failed. The sanctions are both symbolic and economic, aiming to hurt Russia's economy and coerce it to the negotiating table. However, analysts expect little immediate change on the ground, and ripple effects could impact major Russian oil customers like China and India, potentially leading to secondary sanctions.</p>

          <p>Russian filmmaker Kirill Serebrennikov's new German-language film, "The Disappearance of Josef Mengele," details the Nazi physician's evasion of justice after World War II. Based on Olivier Guez's book, the biopic portrays Mengele's escape to South America and the network of collaborators who protected him. Starring August Diehl, the article aims to explore the nature of evil and the path from an ordinary person to a sadist, inspired by Hannah Arendt's "banality of evil." The film serves as a cautionary tale against ideological extremism, especially relevant amid the reemergence of far-right ideologies globally.</p>

          <p>The US military conducted strikes on two alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Pacific, killing five people, expanding its controversial campaign against narcotics. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth equated drug traffickers to terrorists, stating "there will be no refuge or forgiveness." Colombian President Gustavo Petro condemned the strikes as "murder" and a violation of international law. The Trump administration justifies these actions with a disputed legal theory, claiming cartels are "designated terrorist organizations" involved in a "non-international armed conflict." The CIA is reportedly providing intelligence for these operations, which have drawn widespread condemnation.</p>

          <p>European leaders are poised to endorse a controversial plan to use €140 billion worth of frozen Russian state assets, primarily held by Euroclear, to support Ukraine. Dubbed a "reparations loan," this proposal aims to provide immediate liquidity to Kyiv, with the understanding that Russia would repay it after the war. The plan faces legal complexities and concerns about global financial stability, particularly from Belgium, which seeks shared risk among member states. Russia has reacted angrily, calling it "theft of the century" and threatening retaliation, highlighting the high stakes and potential for further instability.</p>

          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that Israel's parliament advancing a bill for West Bank annexation would jeopardize Washington's Gaza peace plan. Far-right politicians in Israel took a symbolic step towards annexation, despite Prime Minister Netanyahu's previous hesitation due to US and Arab country relations. The move, condemned by the Palestinian foreign ministry, passed narrowly in a preliminary vote. Rubio reiterated US opposition, calling annexation "counterproductive" and "threatening" to the fragile ceasefire. His visit aims to push for the second phase of the peace plan, which includes establishing an interim Gaza government and disarming Hamas.</p>

          <p>Chess's international governing body is considering disciplinary action against Russian grandmaster Vladimir Kramnik for persistently making unproven cheating allegations against American grandmaster Daniel Naroditsky, who recently died at 29. Kramnik had accused Naroditsky of cheating in online chess for a year without substantial evidence, despite Naroditsky's denials and claims that Kramnik was trying to ruin his life. Several grandmasters and the federation president have condemned Kramnik's conduct as harassment, highlighting a "new level of toxicity" in online chess.

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is advising that mail, including ballots and legal documents, may not receive a postmark on the same day it's dropped off, due to recent reorganization plans. This change, which affects areas over 50 miles from new processing centers, could impact deadlines reliant on postmarks. USPS states the postmark date "does not inherently or necessarily align" with the acceptance date. Officials recommend visiting a post office for a manual postmark to ensure same-day dating, a challenge for those without easy access. This issue has prompted warnings for mail-in voters, especially in California.</p>

However, John Glover, CIO at Ledn, believes the current bull cycle has ended, forecasting a bear market into late 2026 with prices dropping to $70,000-$80,000. Others, like Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan, see potential for renewed upside if institutional demand, similar to central bank gold purchases, gains traction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A national shortage of affordable "starter homes" is locking many first-time buyers out of the market, exacerbated by rising construction costs and homeowners reluctant to give up low mortgage rates. Austin, Texas, exemplifies this trend, where median home prices far exceed what average earners can afford, partly due to restrictive zoning and slow approval processes. Experts suggest strategies like working with Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) to improve credit and savings, and considering homes further from city centers. State initiatives, like Utah's subsidized loans, aim to boost construction, offering some hope for future market shifts.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago faces critical legal challenges, including a potential Supreme Court review.

A recent 9th Circuit ruling sided with the administration in Portland, but another restraining order remains, and the 7th Circuit upheld a block in Chicago.
