          <p>Jane Goodall, the world-renowned primatologist and conservationist, has died at 91 from natural causes while on a speaking tour. Her groundbreaking research in Tanzania revolutionized science by demonstrating chimpanzees' tool-making abilities and complex social behaviors, challenging previous understandings of human-animal distinctions. Goodall founded the Jane Goodall Institute in 1977, tirelessly advocating for wildlife protection, environmental restoration, and empowering youth through programs like Roots & Shoots. She was also a UN Messenger of Peace, emphasizing humanity's interconnectedness with the natural world and the urgent need for environmental action.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the deployment of the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, citing escalating 'chaos, death, and destruction' amidst ongoing protests against immigration enforcement. He stated that federal law enforcement has struggled to control 'ANTIFA and Radical Left Anarchists' attacking officers and federal property. A memo confirmed 200 service members are mobilized under federal authority to protect facilities, with Brig. Gen. Alan R. Gronewold emphasizing their duty to follow orders despite potential personal feelings. This action follows Mayor Keith Wilson's earlier claims that Portland was not experiencing lawlessness and that videos of violence were outdated.</p>

          <p>FIFA is likely to schedule 2026 World Cup matches involving major European nations after midnight UK time to mitigate heat issues experienced during the recent Club World Cup. The tournament, hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico, will have 48 teams and 11 days with four games, making 12:00 local time kick-offs common. Concacaf president Victor Montagliani acknowledged kick-off times are a significant concern, especially given summer heat in North America. While some stadiums have roofs, it's impractical for all early games, leading to ongoing discussions with media to balance player welfare with broadcasting needs.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has requested a postponement of all deadlines in the Maryland deportation case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia due to the ongoing government shutdown. An evidentiary hearing was scheduled for Monday, but DOJ attorneys are prohibited from working without appropriations, except in limited emergency situations. Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native wrongly deported to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison despite a 2019 court order, was brought back to the U.S. to face human trafficking charges, to which he pleaded not guilty. He does not consent to the requested stay, highlighting the shutdown's direct impact on individual legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>Activists aboard the Global Sumud Flotilla, carrying symbolic humanitarian aid to Gaza, reported that the Israeli navy began intercepting their vessels in international waters. The flotilla, including figures like Greta Thunberg and Nelson Mandela's grandson, was warned by Israel to change course, citing an active combat zone.

          <p>The Trump administration is proposing a $20 billion loan to Argentina to support its currency and stabilize its economy, a move that contradicts 'America First' rhetoric but aims to bolster free-market and democratic institutions in Latin America. This assistance supports President Javier Milei's radical reforms, which have significantly reduced inflation and revived the housing market. Milei's gamble with peso devaluation, however, led to an overvalued currency and threatened central bank reserves. The proposed bailout would provide time for further devaluation and elimination of capital controls, with the funds coming from a Federal Reserve credit line previously used for allies.

Once considered the soundtrack of the working class, cumbia's infectious rhythm has transformed, absorbing local styles and becoming a symbol of Latin American identity. The series, supported by the National Geographic Explorer Program, features photographers Karla Gachet and Ivan Kashinsky, who spent years capturing the people, places, and cultures sustaining this vibrant genre. It traces cumbia's journey from its Colombian coastal origins through its spread across the continent and beyond, accompanying migrants and adapting to new contexts.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government's prior cancellation of hundreds of office leases, driven by DOGE's cost-cutting efforts, is creating ripple effects in the commercial real estate market. Experts, like Yale's Cameron LaPoint, highlight that these cancellations, while saving the government money, leave landlords without stable 'anchor tenants,' destabilizing property values and the broader commercial lending market. Government leases were traditionally considered safe, often including cancellation clauses rarely invoked until now. This issue affects cities and towns nationwide, with rural areas potentially facing higher risks due to less financial cushioning and a higher proportion of eligible leases for termination.

          <p>The U.S. manufacturing sector has seen a loss of 42,000 jobs since April, with 12,000 shed in August alone, according to a Center for American Progress analysis. This decline is attributed to the Trump administration's steep tariffs, restrictive immigration policies, and tax changes affecting renewable energy. Economists note that uncertainty over tariffs increases costs and discourages hiring, with companies like John Deere citing tariff-related expenses. Additionally, immigration crackdowns reduce labor supply, pushing manufacturers towards automation. These factors contribute to a long-term trend of manufacturing job contraction, despite the administration's stated goals of revitalizing the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Mike Waltz, will not hold a Cabinet position, signaling a decreased importance of the U.N. to the Trump administration. This decision reverses the practice of some previous administrations and President Biden's, and reflects Trump's long-standing criticism of the U.N.'s efficacy and purpose. Waltz, despite being well-received by officials, will likely report through Secretary of State Marco Rubio, limiting his direct access to the president. Trump has previously slashed U.S. funding for the U.N. and withdrawn from several of its bodies, openly questioning its value and expressing satisfaction with the current arrangement.</p>

          <p>The UCLA Anderson Forecast predicts a 'stagflation-lite' scenario for the U.S. economy in the coming months, characterized by modestly elevated inflation and unemployment. This outlook is driven by the Trump administration's tariffs and anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. The report, which predates the current government shutdown, notes a deteriorating labor market and rising inflation. It warns that if President Trump gains more control over the Fed, a 'full-blown stagflation' becomes a significant risk. The forecast expects Q3 GDP growth at just 1%, weakening further as tariffs take full effect, with recovery projected for mid-2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major automakers like GM, Ford, and Hyundai reported robust third-quarter U.S. auto sales, primarily driven by record electric vehicle (EV) sales as consumers rushed to purchase before $7,500 federal incentives expired. GM and Ford saw overall sales increases of approximately 8%, with EV sales more than doubling for GM and rising 30% for Ford. Hyundai recorded a 13% sales increase, also led by doubling EV sales. Automakers anticipate a temporary dip in EV market share after the incentives ended but are implementing strategies, like Hyundai's price reductions and GM/Ford's lease programs, to maintain momentum.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Planned Parenthood clinics in Wisconsin have suspended abortion services, navigating the impact of a new Trump administration tax and spending bill provision. This law blocks abortion providers receiving over $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements from participating in the program for a year, specifically targeting Planned Parenthood. While it's already illegal to use federal Medicaid for most abortions, clinics rely on it for other essential services like cancer screenings and contraception. Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin's temporary halt aims to retain Medicaid eligibility for non-abortion services, a move they describe as the "chaos" intended by the defunding measure, potentially forcing closures in other states.</p>

          <p>A 55-year-old woman, Beth Bourne, will not face criminal charges after stripping down to her bikini at a California school board meeting to protest policies allowing transgender students to use bathrooms aligning with their gender identity. Bourne, an anti-LGBTQ+ activist, claimed middle school students are uncomfortable changing in front of transgender peers. During her public comment, she removed her clothes to illustrate her point, leading the board to recess the meeting. While police responded, no criminal investigation was initiated. Bourne, whose nonbinary child is estranged due to her activism, regularly protests district policies on LGBTQ+ issues.</p>

          <p>The National Park Service will furlough over half its workforce during the government shutdown but plans to keep trails, open-air memorials, and some other areas at least partially accessible to visitors. Parks with accessible fee-collecting areas will use available funds for basic services like restrooms, trash collection, and law enforcement. However, parks without accessible areas will largely not operate, offering no visitor services or maintenance. The Utah Office of Tourism confirmed its five national parks would remain open with reduced services, acknowledging potential revenue losses and damage risks, as seen in past shutdowns where vandalism and sanitation issues occurred.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An AI-generated actor named "Tilly Norwood," created by Dutch producer Eline Van der Velden, has ignited significant backlash in Hollywood as its creator seeks representation. Guilds, actors, and filmmakers protest that AI should not replace human creativity, arguing Norwood lacks life experience and emotion. SAG-AFTRA President Sean Aston emphasized that AI approximations are not real, while Natasha Lyonne called for boycotting agencies that engage with such creations. While AI is used as a tool in film, its role in acting remains contentious, with previous strikes securing safeguards for human likenesses. Van der Velden defends Norwood as a creative work, not a replacement.</p>
