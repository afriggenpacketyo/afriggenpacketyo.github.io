          <p>Following two days of violent disorder in Northern Ireland, particularly in Ballymena, police are deploying a significant number of additional officers.

Assistant Chief Constable Ryan Henderson described the violence as "racist thuggery targeted at ethnic minorities and police officers." There have also been sporadic incidents of disorder in other areas, with homes damaged and vehicles set on fire, being treated as racially-motivated hate crimes.</p>

          <p>A recent survey reveals that 45% of American homeowners have regrets about buying their current home, with the most common complaint being the high cost of maintenance and hidden fees. The average homeowner spends over $18,000 annually on non-mortgage expenses, and in some states, this can reach $29,000. Experts recommend factoring in ongoing homeownership costs into one's budget to avoid financial strain. Without a financial buffer, homeowners may face difficulties in affording necessary upgrades or repairs, potentially leading to debt.</p>
