          <p>Officials have confirmed the recovery of remains belonging to all seven workers who were missing after a massive explosion at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The facility, operated by Devastating Pyrotechnics, was reportedly not permitted to store fireworks at that location. The property is owned by a Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant, whose home was also destroyed in the blast. Federal and state agencies are now investigating the cause of the explosions, which also sparked a significant grass fire.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in Texas's Hill Country have claimed over 100 lives after the Guadalupe River rose 26 feet in just 45 minutes. The disaster, worsened by the region's geography and specific weather systems, has sparked scrutiny over the effectiveness of emergency warnings for residents and summer camps. Officials referred to it as a "100-year flood" that "nobody saw coming," though a proposal for a more robust flood warning system had previously been considered but was not funded due to cost and local resistance.</p>

          <p>The Chicago White Sox paid an emotional tribute to former pitcher Bobby Jenks, who recently passed away at age 44 after a battle with cancer. Before their first home game since his death, the team held a moment of silence and will wear a commemorative number 45 patch for the rest of the season. Jenks was the closer for the 2005 World Series championship team and a two-time All-Star. He is remembered by the organization as an iconic member of the White Sox family.</p>

          <p>A report from the chief inspector of prisons has warned that an overwhelming amount of drugs being smuggled into prisons is destabilizing the system and hindering rehabilitation efforts. Criminal gangs are using methods like drones to supply contraband to inmates, who are often bored due to overcrowding and a lack of purposeful activities. The report found that in many facilities, inexperienced staff are unable to contain the criminality. The failure to address these issues is described as a significant problem that requires high-level government attention.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from revoking Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood. The order freezes a provision in the President's recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" that targets organizations providing abortion services. Planned Parenthood argued in its lawsuit that the provision unconstitutionally singles out the group and would force the closure of health centers that provide a wide range of non-abortion medical care, particularly in underserved areas. The block is effective for 14 days.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Education has formally rejected a Trump administration demand to bar transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports. The refusal defies a deadline set by the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, which found California's inclusive policy to be in violation of female students' rights under Title IX. This confrontation sets up a potential legal battle and the risk of the administration withholding federal funding from the state, a tactic it has threatened over various policy disagreements.</p>

          <p>The deadly flash floods in Texas serve as a stark warning for California, which faces similar dangers from extreme weather, according to experts. Low-lying areas along rivers and creeks in the state are vulnerable to catastrophic inundation, as demonstrated by past events like the 2018 Montecito debris flows. Climate scientists note that while the types of storms differ, California could experience comparable catastrophic impacts from intense atmospheric rivers. Projections indicate that human-caused climate change is increasing the risk and intensity of these extreme flood events.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock value dropped by 6.8%, wiping $79 billion from its market capitalization, as investors reacted to CEO Elon Musk's announcement of a new political party. Analysts suggest shareholders are concerned that Musk's deeper dive into politics will serve as a distraction or invite political retribution against his businesses. The move has already drawn public criticism from President Trump. This development adds to existing investor anxiety over the consumer backlash and political entanglements stemming from Musk's vocal political stances. (not investment advice)</p>
