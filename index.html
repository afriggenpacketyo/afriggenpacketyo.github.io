          <p>Betfred's co-founder, Fred Done, has warned that a potential increase in gambling taxes by UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves could force the closure of all 1,287 of its high street shops, jeopardizing 7,500 jobs. Done stated that even a moderate tax hike would eliminate profitability, echoing similar concerns from other industry players like William Hill. The proposed tax increase, supported by figures like former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, is intended to fund child poverty reduction, but the industry argues it would push bettors towards unregulated offshore markets.

          <p>In China's arid Ningxia region, a decades-long effort has successfully pushed back the encroaching Mu Us Desert by over 20 kilometers, safeguarding the capital city of Yinchuan. The Baijitan National Nature Reserve has spearheaded sand control and afforestation projects since the 1950s, stabilizing vast areas of drifting sands that once threatened the Yellow River and local agriculture. This extensive environmental campaign has transformed the landscape, with only a small portion of the original desert dunes preserved for research purposes, marking a significant victory against desertification.</p>

          <p>A "48 Hours" contributor reporting on the 2023 murder of Washington, D.C. photographer Joe Shymanski discovered a personal connection to the case through the victim's ex-wife, Heather Snyder, whom the reporter knew from high school. Snyder's subsequent boyfriend, Brandon Holbrook, was convicted of the murder, though Snyder herself was never charged despite being a central figure in the investigation and trial. The article details the complex relationships, the trial where Snyder invoked her Fifth Amendment right, and the journalist's surreal experience interviewing a former classmate about the murder.</p>

          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the United States of "murder" and violating national sovereignty after a U.S. strike killed a Colombian fisherman, Alejandro Carranza, in September. Petro asserts the fisherman's boat was adrift with a distress signal and had no connection to drug trafficking. The accusation follows President Donald Trump's announcement of a separate, recent strike on what he described as a "drug-carrying submarine," part of a series of U.S. attacks in the Caribbean aimed at curbing drug flow, which have been criticized by UN experts as "extrajudicial executions."</p>

          <p>The United States has issued a warning based on "credible reports" that Hamas is planning an "imminent" attack on civilians within Gaza, which would constitute a grave violation of the current ceasefire agreement. The State Department stated that such an act would undermine peace efforts and that measures would be taken to protect Gazans if the attack proceeds. This development complicates the fragile truce, which has seen the release of living hostages and the ongoing return of deceased hostages' remains to Israel, while Hamas re-establishes control in the territory.</p>

          <p>German historian Jürgen Matthäus has identified the Nazi gunman in the iconic and harrowing photograph known as "The Last Jew in Vinnitsa" as SS member Jakobus Onnen. The breakthrough came after the discovery of a higher-quality print of the photo, which correctly placed the 1941 execution in Berdychiv, Ukraine, not Vinnitsa. With the help of a relative who recognized Onnen and AI-based facial recognition software, the perpetrator's identity was confirmed with near certainty, marking a significant step in de-anonymizing those responsible for Holocaust atrocities, though the victim remains unknown.</p>

In her new memoir and recent comments, Harris argued that excluding the nation's leading EV manufacturer was nonsensical, even if it was intended as a pro-union gesture, since Tesla is non-unionized. She suggests the snub likely alienated Musk, who subsequently became a major financial backer for Donald Trump and the Republican party, highlighting the political fallout from the decision.</p>

          <p>It is common for sexual frequency to decrease in long-term relationships, a phenomenon largely driven by hormonal changes where bonding hormones like oxytocin suppress sex drive hormones over time. According to psychologists, communication about sexual needs and satisfaction is crucial to maintaining intimacy. Research also highlights a discrepancy between physical and psychological arousal, particularly in heterosexual women, which can be influenced by societal messaging and a lack of prioritization of female pleasure. Experts recommend fostering non-sexual physical affection and making dedicated time for intimacy to counteract this natural decline.</p>

          <p>A major section of the Interstate 5 freeway in Southern California was closed for several hours on Saturday for a live-fire military demonstration at Camp Pendleton, attended by Vice President JD Vance. The event, marking the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Marine Corps, led to significant traffic disruption. California Governor Gavin Newsom sharply criticized the event as an "absurd show of force" and accused the Trump administration of disregarding public safety by firing live munitions over a busy highway. The Marine Corps stated it did not request the closure, which was recommended by the California Highway Patrol for safety reasons.</p>
