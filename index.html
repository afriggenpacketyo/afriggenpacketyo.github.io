          <p>A gunman killed four people, including NYPD Officer Didarul Islam, in a Midtown Manhattan office building before taking his own life. The 36-year-old officer, a four-year veteran and father, was praised by Mayor Eric Adams for his heroism. The suspect used an M4 rifle, attacking people in the lobby and on the 33rd floor of the building on Park Avenue. The incident prompted a massive police response and a lockdown of the area, with officials calling the attack a "violent, despicable act of evil."</p>

Despite the profit drop, the airline noted that demand for air travel and cargo remains strong. However, it acknowledged a volatile operating environment due to geopolitical uncertainties and trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is meeting with Jordan's King Abdullah II to finalize plans for a humanitarian aid airlift into the Gaza Strip. The move comes amid mounting international pressure on Israel to alleviate a worsening humanitarian crisis, with growing concerns of starvation. A recent survey indicates that 74% of Germans support applying more pressure on Israel to address the situation. Germany, traditionally a staunch ally of Israel, is now taking a more active role in providing direct assistance to civilians in the besieged enclave.</p>

          <p>USC offensive lineman DJ Wingfield has filed a lawsuit against the NCAA after the organization denied his waiver request for a final season of eligibility. Wingfield, a transfer who was expected to play a key role for the Trojans, is challenging the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," arguing it is anticompetitive. The lawsuit claims the denial robs him of a significant NIL opportunity and the chance to enhance his career at a major program. His case cites disruptions from the pandemic and a previous season-ending injury as reasons his waiver should have been approved.</p>

Passengers watched as sheriff's deputies and Homeland Security agents boarded the plane and apprehended the 34-year-old from the cockpit. Bhagwagar was arrested on five counts of oral copulation with a child under 10, with bail set at $5 million. The arrest followed a months-long investigation by the Contra Costa County sheriff's office, which coordinated with federal agents.</p>

The lottery is free to enter, and unsuccessful applicants will gain points to improve their chances in future drawings.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argued that the stock market's muted reaction to President Trump's new trade deal with the EU is due to investors having "tariff ennui." He suggests Wall Street is currently more focused on this week's major tech earnings reports, an upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, and Friday's employment data. Cramer believes the pattern of threatening high tariffs before settling for a lesser deal has become predictable. Until the market weathers the storm of earnings and potential Fed-related volatility, trade policy is unlikely to be a primary driver of stock movement. (not investment advice)</p>

The case, which dates back to 2012, has been highly politicized and highlights the enduring legacy of Colombia's long internal conflict.

          <p>This article from The Atlantic argues that President Donald Trump's understanding of complex global events, such as the starvation in Gaza, is heavily influenced by what he sees on television rather than intelligence briefings. Trump's recent comment that he knows there is "real starvation" because "you can't fake that" on TV illustrates his reliance on media imagery. This tendency makes him susceptible to manipulation and narrows his perspective, as his primary information source is often cable news. The analysis suggests this approach is dangerous in an age of misinformation.</p>
