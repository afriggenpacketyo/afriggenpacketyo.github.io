          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has voiced strong opposition to President Trump's plan to federalize 300 National Guard troops in Illinois, coinciding with a reported shooting by US border patrol agents in Chicago. Pritzker condemned the move as an outrageous demand, asserting it's a manufactured performance rather than a serious effort to protect public safety and that it's about control, not safety. The shooting incident involved a woman allegedly named in a Customs and Border Protection intelligence bulletin, with DHS claiming agents felt threatened by approaching vehicles. The governor insists there is no need for troops on the ground in Illinois. Optimism score is relative to the severity of the topic at hand. </p>

          <p>President Trump has stated that Israel has agreed to the initial withdrawal line for the Israel Defense Forces in Gaza as part of a proposed peace plan, urging Hamas to confirm the agreement swiftly. He warned Hamas that delays or outcomes where Gaza remains a threat would not be tolerated, as his envoys travel to Egypt to finalize the deal's technical details. An Israeli official indicated the pause in IDF offensive activity is to facilitate Hamas organizing the hostage release, but Israel will not allow Hamas to exploit the pause. Indirect talks between Israel and Hamas are scheduled to commence in Egypt. </p>

          <p>Liverpool has suffered consecutive defeats in the Premier League and Champions League, exposing defensive frailties despite significant investments in new players. Late goals have cost them crucial points, revealing an unsustainable reliance on dramatic finishes earlier in the season. Manager Arne Slot acknowledged fine margins haven't favored his team, but the influx of new signings and tactical adjustments have left Liverpool unbalanced. Mohamed Salah's struggles further compound the team's issues, while opponents are showing increased determination against the reigning champions. </p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu hopes to announce the release of all hostages from Gaza soon, following Hamas' agreement to elements of President Trump's peace plan. A delegation has been sent to Egypt to finalize technical details, with a goal of concluding negotiations within days, though Netanyahu indicated no full Israeli withdrawal. Hamas agreed to release hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners but wants further negotiation on other aspects, including weapons decommissioning. The United States views Hamas' response as positive, with U.S. envoys set to travel to Egypt for talks. </p>

          <p>Max Verstappen has criticized Formula 1's driver-cooling system before the Singapore Grand Prix, the first race to be declared a 'heat hazard'. The Red Bull driver said he was "not intending to use" the cooling vest "because I don't like it". George Russell said he would run the system, while McLaren's Oscar Piastri, third on the grid, was unsure whether to use it. Verstappen said he felt the system and the rules that come with it were flawed, and the team is making improvements with the car cooling of itself. </p>

          <p>Andrej Babiš, a billionaire and populist leader, has won the Czech Republic's parliamentary election, potentially shifting the country's policies. Babiš' ANO movement captured 34.7% of the vote, defeating the Together conservative coalition. His victory could steer the Czech Republic away from supporting Ukraine and toward Hungary and Slovakia, which have pro-Russian stances. Babiš aims to form a one-party government and may need support from anti-migrant and right-wing groups, potentially altering the country's foreign policy direction. </p>

          <p>The US treasury department is considering production of a $1 coin displaying Donald Trump with a clenched first under an American flag and the words “fight, fight, fight” to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the US’s independence. The words overtly reference what Trump said immediately after narrowly surviving an assassination attempt four months before he won a second presidency. The X post – which boosted another account commenting on the draft design – said Beach looked “forward to sharing more” after the end of the partial government shutdown. Trump’s approval rating on average has plummeted to -9.5%, as his second administration has cut healthcare protections and nutrition assistance that benefits the poor. </p>

The protest occurred on the same day as local elections, which the opposition is largely boycotting following a government crackdown. </p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America is installing the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, marking a significant moment for the predominantly white denomination. Curry succeeds the Rev. Elizabeth Eaton, who served for 12 years and was the first woman to lead the ELCA. As the leader of the largest American Lutheran Church body, Curry will face challenges common to other mainline Protestant denominations, which in recent years have weathered theological disputes over LGBTQ+ inclusion and precipitous membership declines. He is only the fifth presiding bishop of the ELCA, which formed from a merger of denominations in 1988. </p>

Members with a valid prescription can purchase a four-week supply for $499, available only to those paying out of pocket. The move comes as GLP-1 drug prices have soared, with supply increasingly limited, leading some to seek cheaper, compounded versions. Costco's entry into the GLP-1 market could further boost access and demand, especially given that many health plans continue to deny coverage for the drugs. (not investment advice)</p>
