          <h2>Trump Seeks Complete End to Iran's Nuclear Program Amidst Ongoing Conflict with Israel</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump stated his goal is a "real end" to Iran's nuclear program, demanding Tehran completely abandon its enrichment activities, rather than simply achieving a ceasefire with Israel. He refuted claims of seeking a ceasefire, emphasizing the situation is "much bigger than that." Trump suggested Israel would continue its assault on Iran, which has significantly damaged Iran's military command and nuclear program, and previously issued an ominous warning for Tehran residents to evacuate immediately. Despite potential negotiations involving envoys like Steve Witkoff or Vice President JD Vance, Trump expressed reluctance to negotiate, asserting that Iran knows better than to target U.S. forces. The article also mentions differing intelligence assessments on Iran's nuclear capabilities. The ongoing conflict has resulted in casualties on both sides, with attacks continuing and warnings issued to civilians. Optimism for de-escalation is low.</p>

Emergency services responded to reports of a blast with a person trapped inside a house, where they found the 46-year-old woman, who was pronounced dead at the scene. The 44-year-old suspect was hospitalized with slash wounds, while two children were taken to the hospital as a precaution; neighbors described hearing a loud crash and seeing debris scattered across the street. The police have launched an investigation and increased patrols in the area, while the community grapples with the tragic event and its impact on a young family.</p>

He instructed political and legal bodies to manage ethnic and religious affairs lawfully, enhance emergency preparedness, and resolutely combat separatism related to Tibet.

          <p>Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff criticized Red Bull's protest against George Russell as "petty" and "embarrassing" after Russell's victory at the Canadian Grand Prix. Red Bull protested Russell's driving behind the safety car, alleging "unsportsmanlike behavior," but the stewards rejected the protest. Wolff emphasized that the victory was fair and questioned the timing and basis of Red Bull's complaint, suggesting the FIA should review such actions. Christian Horner, Red Bull's boss, defended the team's right to protest, stating they saw something they believed was not quite right, and they have no regrets about raising the issue with the stewards.</p>

          <p>A Reddit user's berry storage hack, involving washing, drying, and storing raspberries in an airtight glass container with a paper towel, has gained popularity online. Food expert Mark Wieser suggests waiting to wash berries until just before eating, gently soaking them in water, and storing them in a paper towel-lined container. He also notes that different berries have different cleaning needs, with blueberries being sturdier than delicate strawberries and raspberries. Wieser also recommends a vinegar bath for commercially produced strawberries to remove pesticide residue, emphasizing the importance of keeping berries cold and dry for optimal preservation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The pharmaceutical industry is optimistic that antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), a class of targeted cancer therapies, could potentially replace chemotherapy due to their ability to deliver potent chemotherapy directly to cancer cells while sparing healthy cells. Companies like AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck are investing billions in developing ADCs, with some showing the ability to replace chemotherapy in certain settings. However, some cancer experts believe more refinement is needed before ADCs can fully replace chemo, citing challenges like the premature release of toxic chemotherapy payloads into the bloodstream and the need for identifying the right cancer-causing proteins to target. Despite these challenges, the ADC field has made significant progress, with more than a dozen ADCs now approved in the U.S. and hundreds more in development.</p>

The decision follows pressure from the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services to reduce artificial dyes, with the FDA planning to phase out petroleum-based synthetic dyes by the end of next year.

          <p>Despite promising "the largest deportation program in American history," President Trump's deportation numbers have not surpassed those of President Obama, who holds the 21st-century record. Obama's strategy involved increasing penalties for unauthorized border crossings and deputizing local law enforcement to target immigrants with criminal records. Trump faces challenges in replicating Obama's strategy due to decreased border crossings and increased opposition in liberal areas to cooperating with federal immigration authorities. While Trump has attempted tactics like workplace raids, these have not matched Obama's deportation pace, though deportations did increase in April, surpassing the previous year's numbers under Biden.</p>

An industry analyst stated that it would be "virtually impossible" to build the handset in the United States. Concerns have also been raised about the ethics of profiting from Trump's name while he is in office. The phone will be offered with a mobile phone service with a monthly fee of $47.45, a reference to Trump serving as the country's 47th and 45th president. The Trump family has not specified which company would manufacture the phone in the United States, but Eric Trump suggested the initial phones may not be entirely manufactured within the country.</p>

          <p>A new book, *Apple in China*, explores how Apple's decision to manufacture in China revolutionized both the company and the country. Terry Gou, head of Foxconn, played a crucial role, offering cheap, high-quality factory work in exchange for learning from Apple. This led to China becoming a manufacturing juggernaut, with Apple investing billions and training millions of workers. The book raises questions about whether Apple inadvertently helped a geopolitical adversary, as China learned to emulate the Apple model and now competes with Western companies. The article suggests that this shift has implications for national security and innovation, as the US may have lost its edge in manufacturing physical goods.</p>

          <p>President Trump is leaving the G7 summit in Canada early to address "important matters," specifically the situation in the Middle East, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt. This schedule change resulted in the cancellation of planned bilateral meetings with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and Mexican President Sheinbaum. Trump stated he was returning to the White House due to "very important" issues, remaining vague about the specifics. Earlier, Trump indicated Iran wanted to "talk" about de-escalation, but said they should have done so before, emphasizing the need for a deal.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) decided to slow the pace of its government bond-buying reduction beyond next year, maintaining its interest rates, reflecting a cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy amid trade and economic uncertainties. Governor Kazuo Ueda expressed concerns about Japan's economic outlook due to U.S. President Trump's tariff hikes, stating downside risks now exceed upside ones for both growth and prices. The BOJ will scale back its debt buying by 200 billion yen per quarter from April 2026, and Ueda warned that the economic impact of Trump's tariffs might intensify later this year, affecting the BOJ's monetary policy. Ueda said the BOJ will continue raising interest rates as needed but noted that trade policies in other countries "pose a downside risk." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Extreme drought and water shortages are increasingly harming crops, the economy, and lives globally, with the effects varying by region and type of drought. Meteorological droughts, defined by precipitation deficits, can lead to agricultural droughts when parched ground impacts farming. Hydrological droughts occur when water levels in rivers and reserves fall, often following longer meteorological droughts. Socioeconomic droughts affect society and the economy, while ecological droughts destabilize ecosystems. Experts emphasize limiting climate change and adapting through efficient water use and infrastructure maintenance to mitigate drought's impacts.</p>

Trump also denied seeking peace talks with Iran, asserting that if they want to talk, they know how to reach him. These remarks come amid the repositioning of U.S. warships and military aircraft in the region, but further active U.S. participation would contradict Trump's campaign promises to avoid foreign wars.</p>

Gould regards many of the key players in that scene with derision bordering on contempt. The reviewer suggests that a more nuanced and knowledgeable portrait of the creative ferment that made the Heads possible can be found in Will Hermes’ 2011 book “Love Goes to Buildings on Fire.”</p>

          <p>ICE raids in Hawthorne, California, have sparked fear and anxiety among the city's Latino community, with some residents afraid to leave their homes. A recent sweep near 120th Street and Hawthorne Boulevard, captured on video, showed federal agents handcuffing a pregnant woman, a U.S. citizen. The incident has led to protests and concerns about the impact on local businesses. Mayor Alex Vargas has not commented on the situation. The community is expressing anger and fear, with some residents reporting that people are going into hiding.</p>
