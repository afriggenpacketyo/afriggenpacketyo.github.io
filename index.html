        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major spending package championed by President Trump passed a critical procedural vote in the Senate, moving it closer to a final vote. The measure advanced 51-49 after several Republican holdouts reversed their positions, avoiding the need for a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President. Democrats have vowed to delay the final passage by forcing a full reading of the 940-page bill. The legislation, which faces a tight path in both chambers, could add nearly $4 trillion to the national debt.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece contends that the United States is critically vulnerable due to its dependence on China for rare earth minerals, which are essential for modern technology and defense systems. The author argues that despite years of warnings, the U.S. has failed to create secure, independent supply chains, allowing Beijing to weaponize its dominance. Recent Chinese export controls and invasive licensing requirements are described as "competitive surveillance." The article calls for a coherent, long-term national strategy to treat these minerals as instruments of geopolitical power. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is moving to dismantle federal energy and water conservation standards for home appliances, including the popular Energy Star program. Following an executive order, the Department of Energy and the EPA are preparing to eliminate or modify dozens of regulations, arguing they increase costs and reduce quality. Consumer groups and some manufacturers warn this could lead to higher utility bills for homeowners and a loss of valuable comparison-shopping information. The move is expected to face legal challenges based on provisions that prevent the rollback of established standards.</p>

          <p>The SÃ¡ttÃ­tla Highlands in northeastern California, a sacred area for the Pit River Tribe, was recently designated a national monument, protecting it from industrial development. However, the Trump administration has signaled its intent to undo this protection, arguing it restricts economic activity, which could set up a significant legal battle. The remote, 230,000-acre wilderness is crucial for the tribe's cultural practices and contains vital water aquifers. Legal experts suggest a president cannot unilaterally abolish a monument, indicating any attempt to do so would likely be challenged in court.</p>

An adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly set to visit Washington for talks, though a key sticking point remains whether a ceasefire would lead to a permanent end to the war. The conflict, which began in October 2023, has resulted in a severe humanitarian crisis.</p>

Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled and that concessions, such as limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only, have put the government in a "better position." Rebel MPs, who were concerned the plans would harm disabled and vulnerable people, have indicated they are now likely to support the bill, averting a major defeat for the Prime Minister.</p>

Researchers found that approximately 17% of the tested products had incorrect levels of active ingredients, which can lead to treatment failure and disease progression for patients. The issue stems from a combination of manufacturing faults, poor storage, and counterfeit products, compounded by difficulties in regulation and testing.

          <p>The upcoming movie "Superman," directed by James Gunn, aims to present a more "down-to-Earth" version of the iconic hero. In a recent interview, Gunn explained that his Superman is not indestructible and that the story explores his loneliness as an alien trying to be part of humanity. Actor David Corenswet, who takes on the role, spoke about the challenge of following Christopher Reeve's definitive portrayal and embracing the character's inherent vulnerability. The film, which features a reported budget of over $225 million, is the first major feature from the newly rebooted DC Studios.</p>

          <p>This article by a psychologist suggests that people who are unhappy in their relationships often answer "no" to four specific questions. These questions probe whether partners feel they are on the same team during conflicts and if they can be their authentic selves with each other. They also assess if a partner shows genuine curiosity about one's inner world and whether they take accountability for their mistakes. The author explains that negative answers to these questions can indicate underlying issues like a lack of intimacy, trust, and mutual respect that contribute to misery.</p>

          <p>A couple from San Francisco, Malana Moberg and Roland Salvato, sold their city apartment to purchase a historic chateau in Druelle Balsac, France, for approximately $835,000. They have since invested over $300,000 into renovating the 12th-century property, turning it into a bed and breakfast and a venue for all-inclusive workshops. While the business is not yet profitable, the income it generates helps cover the chateau's significant expenses. The couple views their role not as business owners seeking profit, but as caretakers of a piece of history for the next generation.</p>

          <p>A 22-year-old man is in critical condition after the car he was in crashed and overturned at Piccadilly Circus in central London early Sunday morning. The black BMW ended up on its roof near the iconic Shaftesbury Memorial Fountain, also known as Eros. A second 22-year-old man in the vehicle was also hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries. Police confirmed that no pedestrians were hurt and no other vehicles were involved in the single-vehicle collision, which has led to significant road closures in the busy area.</p>
