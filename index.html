          <p>Japan's parliament has passed a law mandating 300 to 400 major companies to participate in a carbon emissions trading system, set to begin in fiscal year 2026, in an effort to advance the country's green transformation and decarbonization. The revised law targets companies producing 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide or more annually across various industries, estimating that these companies account for nearly 60% of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Companies will receive a maximum emission allowance, and those exceeding the threshold must purchase carbon credits from companies with a surplus, creating an incentive for emissions reduction. While aiming to lower emissions, the system may result in price increases for consumers as companies pass on decarbonization costs.</p>

Some players even purchase surplus uniforms from military stores that source merchandise directly from Ukrainian battlefields, raising ethical concerns about profiting from real-world conflict.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration pursues a nuclear deal with Iran, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is reportedly considering military action against Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities. This disagreement has led to tension between Trump and Netanyahu, with Israel fearing Trump may allow Iran to keep its enrichment facilities in a deal. Israel destroyed key elements of Iran’s strategic air defense system in October, potentially enabling Israeli aircraft to approach Iranian borders without being targeted. The central point of contention in negotiations is the Trump administration's demand that Iran halt all uranium enrichment, a restriction Iran rejects.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read trial, a crash expert testified that data from Read’s SUV placed her at the scene of John O’Keefe’s death, corroborating the prosecution’s narrative. The expert, Dr. Judson Welcher, stated that while the black box didn't register a collision, this was expected as it only records car-to-car crashes. Welcher matched data from Read's SUV to O'Keefe's cellphone data, indicating the vehicle was present at the location where O'Keefe was found. He also testified that the rapid acceleration of Read's vehicle aligned with O'Keefe's final interaction with his phone, suggesting a connection between Read's actions and O'Keefe's death.</p>

          <p>A British think tank, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), suggests that a People's Liberation Army (PLA) attack on Taiwan is unlikely in the near future, but remains a possibility due to potential miscommunication with the U.S. under a Donald Trump presidency. The report highlights strained U.S.-China relations, characterized by deep mutual distrust and a lack of dialogue mechanisms. While tactical improvements occurred during the Biden administration, the report cautions that these are unlikely to significantly alter the strategic direction of the two great powers during Trump's second term.</p>

The reason for this decision is not explicitly stated, but it is likely driven by venture capital firms seeking liquidity after a period of meager returns.

Haliburton's father was in attendance, and the Pacers are now one win away from their second NBA finals appearance. The Pacers have not lost consecutive games since March 10, and teams leading 3-1 in playoff series have a strong record of advancing.

          <p>A new report from Oxford Economics indicates that recent college graduates are facing increased difficulty finding employment, contributing to a rise in the national unemployment rate. Unemployed recent graduates account for 12% of the increase in the national unemployment rate since mid-2023, despite making up only 5% of the labor force. The report attributes this trend to a mismatch between an oversupply of graduates in fields where business demand has waned, particularly in the tech sector. Economic uncertainty, driven by tariffs, is also slowing hiring and could further increase unemployment among recent graduates. (not investment advice)</p>
