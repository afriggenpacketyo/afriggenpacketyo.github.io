          <p>Jake Wood, the head of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), has resigned, stating the organization's inability to adhere to humanitarian principles of neutrality, impartiality, and independence. The GHF, backed by the US and Israel, aims to distribute aid to Palestinians through designated sites, a plan criticized by the UN. Wood, a former US marine, expressed initial hope in alleviating the Gaza hunger crisis but concluded the plan compromised humanitarian values. Despite Wood's resignation, the GHF intends to proceed with aid delivery, aiming to reach one million Palestinians by week's end, and an Israeli official stated that the goal is to eliminate the Gazan population's dependence on Hamas.</p>

          <p>Sweden-based Volvo Cars will cut approximately 3,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive, following an announcement of an 18 billion Swedish kronor ($1.89 billion) action plan. The job cuts will primarily affect office-based positions in Sweden, representing about 15% of the firm's total office workforce. Volvo Cars President Håkan Samuelsson stated that the automotive industry is facing a challenging period, necessitating improved cash flow and reduced costs. The company will also reduce around 1,000 consultant positions, mainly in Sweden, and has withdrawn its financial guidance for 2025 and 2026 due to tariff pressures. </p>

          <p>At least 54 Palestinians, many sheltering in a Gaza City school, have been killed in Israeli air strikes, according to hospital directors. The Fahmi Al-Jargawi School, housing displaced families from Beit Lahia, was hit, resulting in multiple burned bodies, including children. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed to have targeted a Hamas and Islamic Jihad command center within the school, accusing Hamas of using civilians as human shields. Local reports indicate that the head of investigations for the Hamas police in northern Gaza, along with his family, was among the dead. Separately, a strike on a house in Jabalia killed 19 people, contributing to an escalating Israeli offensive in northern Gaza.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir, India has initiated a diplomatic offensive, sending parliamentary delegations to 33 countries to garner support for its "zero tolerance" policy on terrorism. India attributes the attack to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) group, leading to military strikes on alleged terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir. The Indian delegations are equipped with dossiers detailing Pakistan's alleged history of fostering terrorism and evidence linking the April attack to Pakistan-based groups. Pakistan denies providing support for militant groups and has also engaged in diplomatic outreach to present its case, focusing on issues like alleged ceasefire violations by India. </p>

          <p>President Trump has condemned President Putin's escalation of attacks on Ukrainian cities, calling it "absolutely crazy" and stating he is considering imposing more sanctions on Russia. Trump expressed his displeasure with Putin's actions, particularly as negotiations for a cease-fire were underway, noting that Putin was "sending rockets into cities and killing people." He also criticized Ukrainian President Zelenskyy for his remarks lamenting the "silence of America" in the face of renewed Russian attacks. Trump asserted that Zelenskyy's statements were "doing his country no favors" and reiterated his view that the conflict is "Zelensky's, Putin's, and Biden's War, not 'Trump's.'"</p>

Macron's office initially denied the authenticity of the images before confirming them as genuine, and Macron later told reporters that they were just joking around.

          <p>Russia has escalated its attacks on Ukrainian cities, launching massive aerial bombardments as the United States reduces its involvement in the conflict. Ukraine reported that 355 Russian drones and nine missiles were unleashed in a recent attack, following criticism from President Trump who accused Putin of going “absolutely CRAZY”. Despite condemning the attacks, Trump has not indicated a willingness to provide additional military assistance to Ukraine. Analysts suggest Russia perceives an opportunity as the U.S. pulls back from diplomatic efforts and resists supplying Kyiv with further aid. The Kremlin expressed gratitude for Trump's efforts in pressing negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Senior figures in British business report that diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives are being "rebranded" to avoid unwanted political attention. Companies are reframing DEI policies as "wellbeing," "belonging," and "culture" due to a right-wing backlash. Some US-headquartered firms have scaled back commitments and are less keen to celebrate inclusion work publicly. Experts believe a full-scale rollback is unlikely in the UK due to the Equalities Act and legal risks of discrimination cases, but some companies are disguising DEI work to promote talent and address inequalities.</p>

          <p>A Louisiana family is uniting to support a four-year-old boy who lost both parents in separate car crashes hours apart. Gabriel's mother, Alexus Lee, died in a single-vehicle accident, and his father, John “JR” Collins, died while driving to the scene of her wreck. The couple's survivors have received an outpouring of support and established a GoFundMe campaign to secure Gabriel's future and honor his parents' legacy. Gabriel's aunt, Dominque Lee, is preparing to raise him alongside her own children.</p>

          <p>Japan's government plans to spend 900 billion yen ($6.3 billion) on emergency economic measures to counter the negative impacts of higher U.S. tariffs. The overall relief package is estimated to reach up to 2.8 trillion yen, including spending by local governments, in a bid to tackle a potential downturn in the broader economy. In related news, the University of Tokyo is considering temporarily accepting international students from Harvard University if they are barred from studying at the institute due to U.S. government actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns about democratic erosion, America's democracy is more resilient than many fear, displaying traits that protect it from a Trump-led assault. These include a robust network of advocacy groups, a powerful and independent judiciary, a constitutional system that makes executive preferences hard to entrench, a diverse and free private press, a federal system of government, and a uniquely speech-protective legal tradition. These features empower resistance and provide checks on executive power, making it more difficult for a Trump-like figure to undermine democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>The author discusses the concept of "Agua es vida" (water is life) and explores the idea of recognizing the aliveness of what we have been taught to think of as inert matter. The current environmental crisis is not just about emissions targets but also about the human imagination. The Rights of Nature movement seeks to grant basic rights to nonhuman entities, such as rivers, to evolve our relationship with nature. By spending time and attention in nature, we can learn to recognize the aliveness of what we have been taught to think of as inert matter.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The author argues that Memorial Day should expand its focus to include the far greater number of civilians killed in war, not just fallen soldiers. Historically, war deaths were concentrated among combatants, but the 20th century saw a rise in total war with indiscriminate killing of civilians. While deaths in battle have declined, civilians still bear the brunt of war, and the US has largely been spared the scourge of war on its own soil. The author suggests a new kind of Memorial Day to honor civilian deaths and acknowledge the wastefulness of war.</p>

          <p>Five years after anti-police protests, initiatives for officer mental health are gaining traction, spurred by the killing of George Floyd. Agencies are creating wellness units, and state legislatures are mandating and funding wellness initiatives for first-responders. Research indicates that police officers experience higher rates of depression, burnout, PTSD, and substance abuse. Programs like the Georgia Public Safety Resiliency Program and facilities like Valor Station offer support, but the stigma of seeking help remains a barrier. The goal is to provide coping skills and normalize mental wellness within law enforcement.</p>

          <p>An agreement between Malawi and Israel will see Malawian nurses and midwives sent to Israeli health institutions, addressing high unemployment among healthcare professionals in Malawi. The Malawian government says the deal will provide jobs, new skills, and remittances for the workers, but critics worry about the impact on Malawi's under-resourced health system. Concerns have also been raised about working conditions in Israel, drawing comparisons to a previous deal that saw Malawians exploited in Israel's agricultural sector. Some Malawian officials view the policy as a political move that breaks with SADC trends.</p>

          <p>Conservative former federal judge J. Michael Luttig has criticized President Trump and his administration for "waging war" on the federal judiciary and the rule of law. Luttig took issue with Attorney General Pam Bondi's accusation that judges who have ruled against the president's policies are "deranged." Luttig expressed concern about the president's intent to prosecute this war against the federal judiciary and the rule of law to its catastrophic end, while other legal experts have noted that there is a risk of the current political polarization to affect the impartiality of the judiciary.</p>
