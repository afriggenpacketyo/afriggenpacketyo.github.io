          <p>Despite much of the world moving past the coronavirus pandemic, many hospitals in Japan continue to enforce strict visitation policies, causing distress for families of hospitalized patients. A group of physicians and social workers is now protesting these restrictions, arguing they violate human rights and lack scientific basis. One doctor recounted his family's struggle to visit his wife's terminally ill mother, highlighting the contradictions in hospital policies. The health ministry has recommended balancing visitation importance with infection control, but specific measures are left to individual facilities, prompting calls for public advocacy to ensure consistent easing of restrictions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that dog owners who dwell on work-related stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety onto their dogs. The research found a correlation between owners exhibiting "work-related rumination" and their dogs displaying more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and pacing. This "crossover" effect suggests that dogs are sensitive to their owners' moods and changes in care routines. The study emphasizes the importance of employed dog owners separating work from home life to protect their pets' well-being.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author of "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault," has died at the age of 90. Her groundbreaking book redefined the understanding of sexual assault as a crime of power and violence, not passion, leading to significant legal and social reforms. Brownmiller's work sparked both praise and controversy, challenging long-held myths and sparking debates within the feminist movement. Her legacy includes advocating for an end to the multi-billion-dollar pornography industry and fighting for women's safety and empowerment.</p>
