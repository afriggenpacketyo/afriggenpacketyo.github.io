          <p>The 21st season of 'Strictly Come Dancing' has commenced, revealing the new pairings of celebrity contestants and professional dancers. The launch show featured performances from last year's winners and singer Jessie J, who is returning to the public eye after a recent health diagnosis. Notable pairings include Apprentice star Thomas Skinner with Amy Dowden, who is returning after her own cancer treatment, and model Ellie Goldstein, the show's first competitor with Down's syndrome, with Vito Coppola. The series has also transitioned to a fully online voting system, discontinuing its premium-rate phone lines.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 17:35:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new large-scale study from Denmark suggests that being underweight could be more dangerous than carrying extra weight, particularly for individuals who are considered 'fat but fit.' Researchers followed over 85,000 adults and found that underweight participants had a significantly higher mortality risk compared to those with a normal or overweight Body Mass Index (BMI). The findings challenge conventional wisdom about BMI as the sole indicator of health, emphasizing that factors like body fat distribution and underlying medical conditions are crucial. Experts note that the study supports a more holistic approach to health beyond just weight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to announce the formal recognition of a Palestinian state, marking a significant shift in British foreign policy. The decision follows a previous warning that the UK would change its position if Israel did not meet conditions for a ceasefire and a long-term peace process. The move is attributed to the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza and the expansion of Israeli settlements, though it has drawn criticism from Israel, some Conservative politicians, and families of hostages held by Hamas. This action aligns the UK with several other Western nations that have recently recognized or pledged to recognize Palestine.</p>

Other new laws prohibit immigration agents from entering nonpublic areas of schools and hospitals without a judicial warrant and require schools to notify families of any on-campus enforcement activity.

          <p>In his 200th appearance for Manchester United, captain Bruno Fernandes scored his 100th goal for the club, helping secure a 2-1 victory against Chelsea. Manager Ruben Amorim praised Fernandes for his significant influence on the squad, despite acknowledging that he and the team can still improve. The Portuguese midfielder has been a pivotal player since his 2020 arrival, though his temperament has sometimes been criticized. Amorim has repositioned him into a deeper midfield role this season, which has highlighted both his playmaking abilities and defensive vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at Tampa International Airport discovered human remains, including part of a skull, inside a passenger's luggage. The traveler, who was initially flagged for undeclared items, claimed the bones were intended for ritualistic use. The remains were found wrapped in aluminum foil inside a duffel bag. Citing potential health risks, CBP officials confiscated and destroyed the bones. The transport of human remains into the U.S. is strictly regulated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, typically requiring a death certificate and other official clearances.</p>

          <p>The qualifying session for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix was marked by chaos, running twice its normal length due to a record six red flags caused by numerous crashes. Difficult and windy conditions on the unforgiving Baku street circuit led to accidents involving over a quarter of the drivers. Championship rivals Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri both made errors, qualifying in seventh and ninth place respectively, missing a key opportunity to gain an advantage. Max Verstappen secured pole position, while the mixed-up grid promises an eventful race as top drivers attempt to navigate through the field.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to social psychologist Sara Nasserzadeh, a lack of respect is a major red flag in a romantic relationship that can severely damage a person's self-esteem over time. In her book 'Love by Design,' she explains that disrespect can manifest in various ways, from small inconsiderate actions to larger behaviors like devaluing a partner's priorities or identity. Nasserzadeh emphasizes that respect is a foundational ingredient for a lasting partnership, as people enter relationships seeking to be seen and valued. She advises addressing these behaviors through direct conversation to determine if the relationship can be salvaged.</p>

          <p>Top Democratic leaders Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries have formally requested a meeting with President Trump to negotiate a deal to prevent a government shutdown. In a letter, they accused Republican leadership of refusing to engage in bipartisan talks as the September 30 funding deadline approaches. The House passed a short-term GOP spending bill, but it failed in the Senate, where a competing Democratic bill also failed to advance. With both parties blaming each other for the impasse, the risk of a shutdown is increasing.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is escalating its conflict with sanctuary states, warning California, New York, and Illinois of potential lawsuits and funding cuts for not honoring ICE detainers. Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons sent letters demanding the states comply with requests to hold undocumented immigrants for federal custody, accusing them of obstructing enforcement and releasing criminals into communities. The states argue that detainers are non-binding requests and that compliance could lead to legal liability and erode trust with immigrant communities. The DHS plans to involve the Department of Justice to pursue legal action against the non-compliant states.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has used its 'golden share' rights to block U.S. Steel from idling its plant in Granite City, Illinois, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. These new powers, a condition of the company's recent takeover by Japan's Nippon Steel, grant the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. After Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick intervened, U.S. Steel reversed its decision, ensuring the facility will continue operations. This marks the first use of these national-security-related oversight powers established under the terms of the acquisition.</p>

          <p>British singer Morrissey has canceled two concerts in New England after receiving what a venue described as a 'credible threat' on his life. The threat was reportedly made online by a 26-year-old man in Ottawa, Canada, prior to a festival performance, and the individual has since been charged by local police. Out of caution, Morrissey's scheduled performances at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut and the MGM Music Hall in Boston were canceled. All tickets for the affected shows will be refunded, and his tour is scheduled to resume later in the week in Philadelphia.</p>

          <p>A study from China's Helicopter Research and Development Institute details a new AI-driven system capable of detecting even the most advanced stealth submarines with a reported 95% success rate in simulations. The technology integrates data from multiple sources, such as sonar buoys and water temperature, to create a real-time underwater map and provide simple action points for military personnel. While the development could potentially disrupt the strategic balance of naval power, some Western military experts express skepticism, noting the extreme complexity of the underwater environment and the ongoing arms race between detection and stealth technologies.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon, recently rebranded as the Department of War under the Trump administration, has issued new restrictions requiring journalists to sign a pledge to not report on unauthorized information, including unclassified material. Failure to comply could result in the revocation of press credentials. The memo also formalizes limits on reporters' movements within the building, requiring official escorts in most areas. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth defended the policy, stating the press does not run the Pentagon. Free press advocates have condemned the move as a direct assault on independent journalism and a form of prior restraint.</p>
