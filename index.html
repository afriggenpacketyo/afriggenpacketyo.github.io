          <p>Despite the recent agreement between the US and China to pause tariff increases, analysts caution that long-term confrontations are still on the horizon. The agreement, which rolls back tariffs by 115 percent, is seen as a victory for Beijing's strategy against economic pressure, but observers warn that the 90-day truce will not eliminate the fundamental structural divides between the two nations. Experts advise preparing for persistent sticking points and potential combative volatility from the US, emphasizing that China's firm stance was crucial to achieving the current outcome. The previous imposition of 125 percent reciprocal tariffs significantly hampered trade between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Harvard University researchers have identified a rare 1300 version of the Magna Carta in its collection, initially believed to be a cheap copy purchased for $27.50. The document, issued by King Edward I, is one of only seven known copies and is estimated to be worth millions. Researchers confirmed its authenticity by comparing it to other copies using ultraviolet light and spectral imaging. The document's journey to Harvard was traced back to a World War I flying ace who inherited it from anti-slave trade campaigners, highlighting its historical significance and relevance to contemporary debates on governmental authority and individual liberty.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that longer-term interest rates are likely to be higher as the economy evolves and policy remains in flux. He noted that conditions have significantly changed over the past five years, including a period of surging inflation that led to aggressive interest rate hikes. Powell suggested that the era of near-zero rates is unlikely to return soon, with higher real rates reflecting potentially more volatile inflation due to frequent supply shocks. He has recently highlighted that tariffs could slow growth and boost inflation, although the extent of the impact is difficult to predict.</p>

The issue is particularly sensitive for Republicans in high-tax states, where voters are concerned about double taxation and fairness.

Despite investments in AI and core e-commerce, analysts' high expectations were not met, partly due to macroeconomic volatility and US-China trade tensions.

          <p>The Supreme Court will hear arguments on whether federal judges can block Trump administration policies across the country, a practice that has been a major impediment to the President's agenda. The dispute stems from an executive order signed by Mr. Trump on the first day of his second term that ended the practice of granting citizenship to all children born in the United States. A decision limiting nationwide injunctions could reshape how federal courts handle challenges to Trump’s policies, curbing judges' power and boosting executive power.

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to remove endangered species protections for the lesser prairie-chicken, a groundbird in the southern Great Plains. The administration argues that the Interior Department made an error when listing the bird under the Endangered Species Act. This move raises concerns about prioritizing oil and gas drilling over environmental safeguards, as prairie-chickens overlap with drilling areas. If successful, this delisting would signal that no endangered species is safe, especially those living where fossil fuels are buried, despite the bird's declining population and importance in grassland ecosystems.</p>

          <p>LA28, the committee planning the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, is partnering with Archer Aviation to use electric air taxis to reduce car traffic during the Games. These four-passenger eVTOL aircraft will offer 10- to 20-minute flights between vertiports, including SoFi Stadium and LAX, catering to spectators and VIPs. The initiative is part of a larger effort to create a 'car-free' Olympics, managing the expected 15 million attendees and promoting sustainable transportation.
