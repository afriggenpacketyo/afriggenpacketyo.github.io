          <p>A helicopter crashed in Huntington Beach, Southern California, on Saturday afternoon, leading to the hospitalization of five individuals, including a child. The incident occurred near the intersection of Pacific Coast Highway and Huntington Street, with dramatic social media video capturing the helicopter spinning before it struck palm trees and a pedestrian bridge stairway. Both occupants of the aircraft and three pedestrians on the street sustained injuries, with their current conditions not yet released. Authorities have closed a section of PCH as the Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board investigate the cause, noting an "exclusive helicopter landing party" was hosted nearby.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that democracies must develop more robust mechanisms to protect climate policy from political volatility and populist erosion to effectively compete with China. Despite global energy investment reaching record highs, significant clean energy projects in the US have been canceled or scaled back due to regulatory uncertainty and a decline in political will. The article highlights populism's role in undermining climate ambitions by framing action as incompatible with affordability and energy security. It proposes six steps for democracies to overcome these challenges and achieve their net-zero goals.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden is undergoing radiation therapy and hormone treatment for an aggressive form of prostate cancer, his spokesperson confirmed. Diagnosed in May 2025 with a Gleason score of 9 and bone metastasis, the cancer is reportedly hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management. Sources close to Biden indicate he is responding well to treatment, which began several weeks ago in Philadelphia. This follows his treatment for basal cell carcinoma two years prior, highlighting ongoing health concerns for the 82-year-old former leader.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's rapid ascent has created an unprecedented dominance in Silicon Valley, characterized by its private ownership, secretive financials, and unrivaled spending power.

CEO Sam Altman's aggressive deal-making and product rollouts, including Sora AI video app and Codex, position OpenAI as the defining company of the generative AI era.

          <p>An Indian national, Sahil Majothi, 22, has been captured by Ukrainian forces, becoming the first known Indian detained fighting for Russia. Majothi's mother claims he was coerced into joining the Russian army to avoid imprisonment over drug charges in Russia, where he was studying computer engineering. A Ukrainian army video shows Majothi stating he was given a choice between military service or jail time, sent to the battlefield after just 15 days of training. India's foreign ministry is investigating, as local leaders appeal for his return amidst rising concerns over Indians recruited into the Russian military.</p>

          <p>The Himalayas' autumn climbing season, traditionally known for clear skies, has turned deadly due to extreme weather shifts, with meteorologists noting monsoons now extending into October. A recent shock blizzard stranded hundreds of tourists near Mount Everest, resulting in one fatality and others battling hypothermia. Similar conditions on the Nepal side led to another death and widespread landslides and floods, killing around 60 people. Scientists attribute the increased torrential rains and snowstorms to higher moisture from global warming and earlier westerly disturbances, making mountain weather increasingly unpredictable.</p>

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, there is anticipation that it will redefine the country's infrastructure strategy, moving towards more tech-driven and people-focused projects. Previous plans, like the 2009 stimulus package, spurred massive public works but also contributed to local government debt. Despite these financial pressures, officials still see significant value in infrastructure investments for economic growth. The upcoming blueprint is expected to reflect high-level policy priorities and guide the evolution of spending to meet the demands of a new era. (not investment advice)</p>

She accused Maduro of leading a drug cartel and destabilizing the region by harboring US enemies.

          <p>This opinion article suggests that US partnerships with Gulf nations, particularly the UAE, could impede China's aspirations for AI leadership. While China has made strides with its underwater data center in Hainan, its global AI leadership requires looking beyond its borders for a competitive edge. The Trump administration's multi-billion-dollar deals to advance chip supplies to the UAE, including the Stargate UAE AI data center, demonstrate a strategic convergence between US investment and chip producer Nvidia. This coordinated effort in data center production and chip supply chain demands challenges China's bid for near-term dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deploy the National Guard for patrol duties in Illinois, upholding a lower court's decision. The Chicago-based US Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit deemed such deployment "likely to lead to civil unrest." While the troops can remain under federal control, they are barred from active patrolling. This ruling follows similar legal challenges in other Democratic-led cities like Portland and Los Angeles, where local officials accuse the administration of exceeding its legal authority and using soldiers as "props" against immigration raids.</p>
