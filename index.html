          <p>The second trial of Karen Read, accused of murder in the death of John O'Keefe, is focusing on Read's statements made during an ambulance ride after O'Keefe was found in the snow. A paramedic testified that Read mentioned her "last words" to her 'husband' were an argument, which prosecutors are using to suggest a conflict before O'Keefe's death. The defense is challenging this interpretation, suggesting the statement could refer to an earlier conversation. Read maintains her innocence, while the prosecution alleges she intentionally ran over O'Keefe after a drunken argument.</p>

          <p>Republican leaders in Congress face a significant challenge in unifying their party behind Donald Trump's proposed economic bill, which aims to extend tax cuts, bolster border security, and overhaul social safety net programs. The bill's ambitious scope, potentially adding trillions to the national deficit, has exposed deep divisions within the GOP, particularly regarding spending cuts to programs like Medicaid and food stamps. With slim majorities in both the House and Senate, Republican leaders must navigate conflicting priorities and potential opposition from both moderate and far-right factions to pass the legislation and avoid a potential financial crisis related to the debt limit.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s policies are raising concerns about the future of public health in the U.S., particularly regarding infectious disease prevention and vaccine infrastructure.

Critics argue that these actions undermine critical public health infrastructure and could lead to a resurgence of preventable diseases, while supporters claim the changes prioritize addressing chronic health issues.</p>

          <p>Students at Occidental College have initiated a hunger strike to protest the college's investments in weapons manufacturers with ties to Israel and to demand increased protections for international students. Inspired by similar actions at other universities, the students are calling for divestment from companies that provide arms to the Israeli military. They also seek legal support and the expungement of protest-related conduct charges for international students, citing concerns about visa revocations under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>S&P Global Ratings has lowered the bond ratings for the city of Los Angeles, citing a weakening financial position and an emerging structural imbalance. The downgrade reflects concerns about the city's rapidly declining reserve fund and its ability to manage its budget effectively. Lower bond ratings will increase borrowing costs for the city, further complicating efforts to address its nearly $1 billion budget deficit.</p>

          <p>A Pasadena-based lighting company, Nila, is facing uncertainty due to President Trump's new trade policies, including tariffs on Chinese goods. The company, which designs and assembles specialized LED lights, relies on imported parts from Asia. The tariffs are increasing costs and making it difficult for Nila to plan for the future, leading to customer hesitancy and potential disruptions to multimillion-dollar projects. The company is exploring strategies to mitigate the impact of tariffs, such as shifting production overseas and focusing on international clients.</p>

Despite facing scandal and controversy, McPherson's life and work exemplified the spirit of reinvention that continues to define Los Angeles.</p>
