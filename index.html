          <p>Despite the imposition of US tariffs, China's exports experienced an 8.1% year-on-year increase in April, surpassing market expectations. This growth indicates a degree of resilience in the Chinese economy amidst ongoing trade tensions with the United States. Imports, however, saw a slight decrease of 0.2% compared to the previous year. The trade surplus for China in April was reported at US$96.18 billion, a decrease from the US$102.64 billion recorded in March, reflecting some impact from global economic factors.</p>

          <p>A grand jury investigation into the Hanceville Police Department in northern Alabama has uncovered a "rampant culture of corruption," leading to the dismissal of nearly 60 felony cases. The investigation revealed mishandling and removal of evidence, with an audit finding significant discrepancies in documented evidence, including missing firearms, cash, and drugs. The entire police department was placed on leave and subsequently disbanded, with plans to rebuild it from scratch. The Cullman County District Attorney emphasized the severity of the compromised cases, most of which were drug-related.</p>

          <p>Some Chinese academics are advocating for a revision of World War II history, arguing that the start date should be pushed back to 1931, marking Japan's invasion of Manchuria, rather than Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland. This perspective aims to highlight China's role in the war against fascism. The call comes as countries around the globe commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII. Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to attend a Victory Day parade in Moscow.</p>

          <p>A federal class-action lawsuit accuses UCLA's medical school of using race as a factor in admissions, violating California law and Supreme Court precedent. The lawsuit, brought by activist groups, alleges that admissions officials prioritize race and ethnicity, leading to discrimination against white and Asian applicants. The lawsuit cites unnamed "whistleblowers" who claim that admissions committee members openly discussed race as a factor in admission decisions. The Trump administration is already scrutinizing UCLA and other UC campuses for potential "illegal DEI" practices.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reportedly asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to consider including a tax hike on rich Americans in an upcoming fiscal package. The proposal involves creating a new top income bracket for individuals earning over $2.5 million per year and taxing income above that level at 39.6 percent. This move would partially reverse tax cuts enacted in 2017.
