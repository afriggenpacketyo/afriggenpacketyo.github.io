          <p>Elon Musk, in a subdued tone, addressed Wall Street analysts, indicating a pullback from his extensive involvement with the federal government, though he affirmed his intention to continue advocating for lower tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Musk, who previously held significant influence in Washington, navigating relationships with President Trump, Democrats, and cabinet secretaries, appeared to acknowledge the limitations of his influence on policy decisions. His remarks suggest a recalibration of his role in government affairs amid changing political dynamics. Optimism remains for DOGE.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments in a case concerning religious parents seeking opt-out rights for their children from LGBTQ-themed storybooks in Maryland public schools. The case involves books like "Pride Puppy!" and "Prince & Knight," which the parents argue contradict their religious beliefs, leading to intense questioning from Justice Gorsuch about the books' content and their use in the curriculum. The school district initially allowed opt-outs but later reversed course, citing administrative concerns, raising First Amendment concerns about religious freedom and curriculum control.</p>

          <p>Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and the state's Republican congressional delegation are appealing to President Trump to reconsider the denial of federal disaster relief following severe storms in March. The request for FEMA assistance was initially denied, prompting concerns from state officials about the ability to rebuild without federal support, as the storms caused widespread destruction and multiple fatalities. This situation is unique as it marks the first instance of Republicans publicly challenging a denial of FEMA relief under the Trump administration, especially given Sanders' prior role as White House press secretary.</p>

          <p>A bill in California aiming to reduce energy credits for homeowners with rooftop solar panels is causing conflict between union electrical workers, large utilities, and solar panel owners. Assembly Bill 942, proposed by a former Edison executive, seeks to limit credits to 10 years and end them upon the sale of the house, leading to protests and accusations of favoring utility interests over renewable energy incentives. Supporters argue it addresses inequities in electricity bills, while opponents claim it undermines long-term solar contracts and hinders the state's renewable energy goals.</p>

          <p>England's NHS safety watchdog, the Health Services Safety Investigations Body, warns that extreme tiredness and exhaustion among NHS staff pose a significant risk to patients. The report cites examples of mistakes with pregnancy scans and chemotherapy drugs, attributing them to fatigue and workload pressures. The watchdog emphasizes that exhaustion is also a risk to staff themselves, with some complaining of nodding off at the wheel on the way home, and reports of staff dying in road accidents after work. The watchdog recommends that the government and NHS England introduce better systems to monitor fatigue and work with unions and employers to raise awareness about it.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced a plan to phase out eight synthetic food dyes in the American food supply. While some studies have linked synthetic food dyes to behavioral issues and cancer in animals, experts are divided on their safety. Regardless, most agree that limiting consumption of artificial food coloring is best, while fast-tracking the review of four new natural color additives.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recently ordered modifications to a room next to the Pentagon press briefing room to retrofit it with a makeup studio that can be used to prepare for television appearances. The price tag for the project was several thousand dollars, at a time when the administration is searching for cost-cutting measures. The suggestion for improving the space came from Tami Radabaugh, the deputy assistant to the secretary for strategic engagement and a former producer for Fox News and for CBS News.</p>

          <p>The tariff war between the world’s two largest economies has generated unease in China about travel to the United States. Beijing is urging citizens looking to travel to the US to be cautious and has issued two travel warnings for the United States, citing “the deterioration of Sino-US economic and trade relations, and the domestic security situation” in the country. Canada, Germany, Britain and Australia have updated their travel advisories following reports of their citizens being denied entry or detained at the US border.</p>
