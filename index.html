          <p>Walmart and Target CEOs privately cautioned President Trump that his tariff policies could disrupt supply chains and lead to empty shelves in stores. The CEOs of both companies have publicly stated that tariffs could result in higher prices for consumers. The Trump administration has imposed significant tariffs on goods from China and other countries, sparking fears about rising consumer costs, slower economic growth, and potential shortages in the supply chain. The administration is considering forming a working group to mitigate the impacts of these tariffs.</p>

          <p>Experts are casting doubt on President Trump's claim that finger tattoos prove Kilmar Abrego Garcia's MS-13 membership. Trump shared an image of Garcia's hand with digitally added labels interpreting the tattoos as gang symbols. Experts acknowledge the tattoos could have gang-related symbolism, but say they are not reliable indicators of membership. Abrego Garcia has no criminal record, and his family denies gang involvement. This debate underscores the challenges of accurately identifying gang members and the potential for mislabeling individuals based on limited information.</p>
