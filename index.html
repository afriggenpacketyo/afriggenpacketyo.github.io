          <p>This advice column addresses the issue of moral scrupulosity, where an excessive worry about being a good person can lead to anxiety and paralysis. Drawing on Jewish theological stories, the article suggests that instead of trying to optimize every decision for maximum ethical good, individuals should aim to live in line with their values while practicing self-compassion for inevitable shortcomings. This approach, supported by psychological research, can lead to greater personal responsibility and well-being.</p>

          <p>An organization representing the families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas has publicly accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being the primary obstacle to their return. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum claims that Israel's recent strike on Hamas leaders in Qatar was a deliberate act of sabotage against an approaching deal. They argue that Netanyahu is prolonging the war to maintain his political power, an action they say has already cost the lives of dozens of hostages.</p>

          <p>The Little Arboreal Ladybird, a species typically native to continental Europe, has been officially recorded in the United Kingdom for the first time. Experts believe the insects traveled across the English Channel to England's New Forest region, aided by this year's hot summer weather. This colonization is part of a wider trend of insect species moving north due to warming temperatures, offering a tangible example of climate change's impact on biodiversity and species distribution.</p>

          <p>Residents in the Welsh village of Henllys were confounded after about 20 signs were defaced with the St. George's Cross, the flag of England. The graffiti, which also included swastikas and anti-immigrant slogans, prompted a swift community-led cleanup effort. Gwent Police have opened an inquiry into the incident, which mirrors a recent trend of similar flag displays across England that have been viewed by some as patriotic and by others as provocative.</p>

          <p>A covert police operation successfully dismantled a multi-million pound drug empire run by Robert Andrews Jr., who operated under the guise of an ordinary working man in Newport. The investigation was triggered when police discovered incriminating WhatsApp messages on another gang leader's phone. Subsequent surveillance captured Andrews Jr. conducting large-scale drug deals, leading to his arrest and a prison sentence of over 14 years, effectively collapsing his sophisticated criminal network.</p>

          <p>A new study concludes that women trying to conceive should avoid using cannabis, as its active ingredient, THC, can adversely affect female fertility. The research, which examined women undergoing IVF, found that patients with detectable THC levels had a significantly lower rate of genetically healthy embryos. Laboratory tests further showed that THC exposure can disrupt the development and stability of the egg cell by causing errors in chromosome distribution.</p>

          <p>A growing social media trend is seeing more teenage boys engage in "cutting and bulking," an extreme fitness and diet cycle aimed at achieving a highly muscular physique. The process involves alternating between high-calorie diets to build mass and severe calorie restriction to reduce body fat and enhance muscle definition. Health experts and dietitians express concern over this trend, warning that such intense regimens can be harmful to adolescent growth, hormone health, and may lead to eating disorders.</p>
