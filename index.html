          <p>House Republicans are moving forward with their bill to fund President Trump's agenda, including significant Medicaid cuts, despite facing internal opposition. The bill proposes imposing work requirements for Medicaid recipients, conducting more frequent eligibility checks, and penalizing states offering Medicaid to unauthorized immigrants. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the health portions would save $715 billion over a decade but leave 8.6 million more Americans uninsured. Speaker Johnson faces resistance from within his party, while some moderate Republicans are wary of cutting Medicaid, and Senate Republicans are also expressing concerns about the proposed cuts.</p>

Counter-terrorism police are investigating the fires, treating them as suspicious and exploring potential links due to the properties' connection to Starmer.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. will remove all sanctions on Syria, aiming to give the country a chance at greatness. Speaking in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Trump stated that the decision is intended to support the new Syrian government in stabilizing the country and maintaining peace. Syria has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism by the U.S. since 1979, with additional sanctions imposed in 2004 and 2011 following a crackdown on anti-government uprisings. Trump emphasized his administration's initial steps toward restoring normal relations between the United States and Syria after over a decade.</p>

          <p>An expert argues that President Trump's executive order instructing drug companies to reduce prescription drug prices constitutes price control, potentially leading to shortages. The order directs the Department of Health and Human Services to set price targets for pharmaceutical manufacturers, applying not just to government programs but also to the free market. The White House defends the order as a means of fixing anti-competitive behavior that forces Americans to subsidize healthcare for other developed nations. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America trade group warns the order would harm American patients and reduce investment in new treatments.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite signs of economic improvement, credit card debt forgiveness remains a relevant option for many borrowers struggling with high-interest balances. While inflation may be easing and rate cuts are anticipated, the cost of carrying credit card debt remains high, making it difficult for households to catch up. Debt forgiveness can provide targeted relief by reducing the debt obligation, offering a path out of an otherwise endless debt cycle. However, it comes with trade-offs, such as a credit score hit and potential tax liability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>G.O.P. leaders are exploring cuts to federal aid, leaving some states fearful that their budgets cannot absorb billions of dollars in new costs. State leaders are expressing alarm about the budgetary fallout from President Trump’s economic agenda, warning that they will not be able to pick up the bill if the federal government reduces its funding for major public services. Trump has suggested Washington could provide less to states in response to major storms, and his new budget proposed scaling back federal aid to states on programs varying from public education to mental health. House Republicans also proposed forcing local governments to assume a greater share of the costs for food stamps and other federal anti-poverty programs.</p>

          <p>Inflation retreated to 2.3% in April, driven by lower prices for consumer staples, marking the smallest annual increase since February 2021. However, economists warn that tariffs levied by President Trump may reignite inflation, potentially costing the average U.S. household an extra $2,800. There were potential signs of tariff effects in the CPI report, such as jumps in audio and photographic equipment prices. Economists express uncertainty about future policy and the impact of tariffs on the inflation outlook.</p>
