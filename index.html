The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over key decisions such as relocating headquarters or transferring jobs overseas. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick detailed the government's rights, emphasizing the protection of U.S. Steel's domestic operations. The transaction is described as a "partnership" by Trump, though U.S. Steel will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, pending customary closing conditions.

          <p>Vance Boelter, the suspect in the shootings of two Minnesota legislators and their spouses, will appear in court on Monday, charged with two counts of murder and two of attempted murder. Boelter is suspected of fatally shooting Democratic state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and seriously injuring state senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. Authorities allege Boelter fled on foot after police responded to a shooting at Hortman‚Äôs house, and that he was wearing a police uniform that closely resembled an actual law enforcement uniform. The FBI had issued a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to his arrest and conviction.</p>

          <p>Airbus has surpassed Boeing as the world's biggest planemaker due to Boeing's safety record issues. Boeing's recent struggles include technical failures, production snags, and the Air India crash that killed 270 people. In contrast, Airbus has managed its largest aircraft, the A380, more effectively by ceasing production when it became uneconomical. The rivalry between the two companies has drawn in the WTO and governments, with disputes over subsidies. China's Comac is emerging as a fresh competitor in the aviation market.</p>

          <p>In Hawaii, scientists are using drones to drop live mosquitoes into forests as a method of saving endangered honeycreepers from avian malaria. The mosquitoes are male and contain a strain of bacteria that prevents successful reproduction, reducing the population of biting mosquitoes. This approach has little ecological downside as mosquitoes are not native to Hawaii. The project is testing drones as an alternative to helicopters for releasing the mosquitoes, with the goal of erecting an invisible barrier to protect the birds.</p>

Key sources of methane include oil and gas production, coal mines, and abandoned wells. While low-cost tools exist to halt methane emissions, they are underutilized, and the Trump administration's push for fossil fuel development could exacerbate the problem.</p>
