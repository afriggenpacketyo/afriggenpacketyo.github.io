          <p>An appeals court temporarily blocked a judge's order compelling President Trump to return control of National Guard troops to California Governor Gavin Newsom, following their deployment to manage anti-immigration protests. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals paused the order after an appeal by the Trump administration, scheduling a hearing on the matter. Judge Breyer had previously ruled that the deployment exceeded Trump's authority and violated the Tenth Amendment. Governor Newsom criticized Trump's actions as authoritarian, while the White House defended the deployment as necessary for public safety, arguing that the district court overstepped its authority. This legal battle reflects ongoing tensions between the federal government and California over immigration enforcement. </p>

          <p>Klara Dobrev, a Hungarian MEP, cautions against taking democracy for granted, drawing parallels between Hungary's illiberal drift under Viktor Orban and potential threats in the United States. She emphasizes that illiberal forces attack institutions, checks and balances, media, and freedom of speech, requiring timely reactions to prevent irreversible autocratic shifts. Dobrev highlights the importance of a broad coalition of Democrats, Conservatives, Liberals, Greens, Social Democrats, and Socialists to counter illiberal populists. She also criticizes the EU's past funding of Orban's regime without proper controls, enabling the enrichment of oligarchs and the purchase of media outlets. The current situation is that Hungary needs controls built in so that money remains in Brussels. Optimism is tempered by the recognition of the challenges ahead. </p>

          <p>Democratic US Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed and handcuffed at a news conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in Los Angeles. Senator Padilla interrupted the briefing, which was about immigration enforcement, to ask questions, leading to his ejection by authorities. The incident sparked immediate condemnation from Democratic members of Congress, who called it an "affront to democracy," while LA Mayor Karen Bass described it as "absolutely abhorrent and outrageous". The Trump administration defended the action, claiming Padilla lunged at Secretary Noem, a claim disputed by Padilla's office. Padilla stated he was already in the building for a meeting and sought information on immigration policies. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite rising tensions and Israeli strikes on Iran, analysts believe Tehran is unlikely to block the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. Blocking the strait would disrupt global oil flows and trigger further retaliation, while also angering Iran's largest oil customer, China. The Strait of Hormuz sees roughly 20 million barrels per day of oil and oil products pass through, accounting for nearly one-fifth of global oil shipments. While some disruption is possible through attacks on tankers or mining the strait, a full-scale blockade is considered unlikely due to the presence of the US Fifth Fleet and the potential for Iran to suffer more than its enemies. </p>

Huawei's transition to its own OS began in 2021, intensifying after being placed on the US Entity List in 2019.

          <p>Millions of Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace face potential premium surges next year as enhanced subsidies put in place during the pandemic are set to expire. Low-income enrollees would experience the largest percentage increases, while middle-income enrollees could lose eligibility for subsidies altogether. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that letting the enhanced subsidies expire would increase the number of uninsured people by 4.2 million.

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s overhaul of the CDC's vaccine advisory panel (ACIP) has raised concerns among immunization and infectious disease specialists. Kennedy dismissed all 17 members and appointed replacements, some of whom are known for skepticism toward vaccines and criticism of COVID-19 policies. Experts worry the new committee could downgrade the importance of certain vaccines, affecting insurance coverage and access for low-income children. The ACIP plays a key role in determining recommended vaccines for children and adults, influencing insurance coverage and medical practice. </p>

          <p>Japan has strongly condemned Israel's attack on nuclear and military sites in Iran, calling it an "escalating situation" and pledging diplomatic efforts to prevent further deterioration. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya expressed regret that Israel took military action despite ongoing talks between Washington and Tehran. Japan, highly dependent on crude oil imports from the Middle East, traditionally maintains friendly relations with both Iran and Israel. The government is taking measures to ensure the safety of Japanese nationals in the region. </p>

          <p>India is seeking to develop its domestic rare earth element (REE) supplies in response to China's export restrictions, with the goal of becoming an alternative source. Experts suggest that India could play a key role in diversifying the global REE supply chain, but significant public and private investment is needed. China currently dominates REE production and processing, giving it considerable leverage over these crucial minerals. India has substantial REE reserves but lacks advanced separation and refining technology, as well as specialized expertise and infrastructure. </p>
