        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economy showed signs of faltering in July as key indicators missed forecasts. Retail sales and industrial output grew at a slower pace than anticipated, reflecting persistent weakness in domestic demand and the impact of government policies to curb excess industrial capacity. The urban unemployment rate edged up, and property investment continued to contract, raising concerns about achieving the annual growth target of 5%. While a temporary tariff pause with the U.S. provides some relief, economists warn that underlying trade disputes and a potential slowdown may necessitate further policy support.

          <p>Mali's ruling military junta announced it has foiled a coup attempt, arresting several military officers, civilians, and a French national accused of being a foreign agent. The government claims the plotters had support from unspecified "foreign states" and aimed to destabilize the country. This development occurs amid a broader crackdown on dissent, with critics suggesting the arrests are a tactic to intimidate opponents rather than a response to a genuine threat. The junta, which seized power in 2020, has recently extended its rule and pivoted away from Western allies like France towards Russia.</p>

          <p>Japan's economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' expectations and demonstrating resilience against U.S. trade tariffs. The growth was primarily driven by strong exports, which offset some of the headwinds from the uncertain trade environment. However, on a year-over-year basis, GDP growth slowed compared to the first quarter, and analysts remain cautious about the future. Economists warn that softening investment and the potential for tariffs to impact corporate profits and wages could lead to a renewed slowdown or even a recession in the coming quarters.

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has unveiled a new fleet of branded vehicles for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as part of a high-profile recruitment and visibility campaign. The navy-colored vehicles feature large gold "ICE" lettering, the slogan "Defend the Homeland," and President Donald J. Trump's name on the rear. This public rollout coincides with an intensified federal law enforcement presence in Washington, D.C., under the president's crime crackdown initiative. The campaign aims to bolster ICE ranks with significant incentives and has reportedly generated over 100,000 job applications.</p>

The substance was discovered in five separate letters within the building's mailroom, prompting a large response from fire, police, and hazmat units. At least two people were exposed, but authorities reported no immediate threat to the public, and the situation was quickly brought under control. The letters are being sent to the FBI for further analysis as the investigation into the incident continues.</p>

          <p>A man convicted of murdering British expatriate Emma Lovell during a home invasion in Queensland, Australia, will be eligible for release sooner than his original sentence dictated. The attacker, who was 17 at the time of the 2022 stabbing, had his non-parole period reduced from 70% to 60% of his 14-year sentence by an appeals court. The judges cited his early guilty plea, genuine remorse, and troubled upbringing as reasons for the 17-month reduction in his minimum time served. The murder sparked public outrage and led to stricter youth crime laws in the state.</p>

Critics and data show that violent crime in D.C. actually hit a 30-year low in 2024, contradicting the president's portrayal. The takeover, authorized under the D.C.

This action would only proceed if Texas or another state advances a mid-decade partisan gerrymandering plan, overriding California's independent redistricting commission on a temporary basis.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in London to discuss security guarantees ahead of a critical summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska. The Kremlin confirmed the summit's agenda will focus on the war in Ukraine and economic cooperation, with a one-on-one meeting followed by delegation talks. European leaders, who conferred with Trump virtually, expressed cautious optimism that the meeting could be a path to a ceasefire, though concerns remain that Ukraine's interests could be sidelined.</p>

          <p>Youngstown, Ohio, a city once devastated by the collapse of the American steel industry, is showing signs of a steady revival. Entrepreneurs are repurposing abandoned industrial buildings into new businesses, such as a brewery and a flea market, bringing new life and economic activity to the downtown area. While the city's comeback is not dramatic, its population has stabilized, and the unemployment rate has fallen significantly from its historic highs. This gradual revitalization is driven by local business owners who are forging a new identity for the city beyond its industrial past.</p>

          <p>The state of Louisiana has filed a lawsuit against the online gaming platform Roblox, accusing the company of failing to protect its young users from sexual predators. The suit, brought by Attorney General Liz Murrill, alleges that Roblox prioritizes growth and profit over child safety, creating an environment where harmful content and predators can flourish. The legal action follows similar complaints and lawsuits in other states concerning the platform's safety protocols. Roblox has recently implemented new safety measures, but the lawsuit argues these are insufficient.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll found that a large majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, believe that expectations for tipping have grown in recent years. For many, tipping is seen as a way to show appreciation or supplement service workers' income, but a significant portion views it as an additional mandatory cost. The sentiment that tipping is becoming more prevalent was rarely seen as a positive development by respondents. This perspective may be influenced by broader concerns over rising prices and the general cost of living.</p>

          <p>The British government is collaborating with medical influencers on TikTok to raise awareness about the dangers of traveling abroad for cosmetic surgery. The campaign aims to address the growing trend of "medical tourism," where individuals seek cheaper procedures overseas, sometimes with life-altering negative consequences. The influencers will advise their followers to consult with a UK doctor first, purchase proper travel insurance, and be wary of package deals. This initiative is part of a broader effort to protect patients and reduce the burden on the NHS, which often has to correct botched overseas procedures.</p>

          <p>Four years after famously pivoting to an entirely plant-based menu, the three-Michelin-star restaurant Eleven Madison Park is reintroducing animal products. Chef Daniel Humm, who had previously championed the vegan menu as an ethical and creative necessity, cited a desire for inclusion and flagging business as reasons for the change. The restaurant experienced a decline in wine sales and private event bookings, as clients were reportedly hesitant about a fully plant-based experience. The article frames the reversal as a reflection of the challenges facing high-end vegan dining and persistent consumer preference for meat.</p>

          <p>Nearly two years after the conflict began, Israeli society is deeply fractured over the war in Gaza, contradicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's initial calls for unity. The article highlights a significant divide between a majority of Jewish Israelis who support the military's actions and a growing minority who protest the killing of Palestinian civilians. Polling data suggests most Jewish Israelis are not troubled by Palestinian suffering, a view reinforced by a media landscape that focuses on Israeli trauma. These internal divisions are further exacerbated by political pressures, the ongoing hostage crisis, and a chasm between secular and religious viewpoints.</p>

          <p>As President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin prepare to meet in Alaska, their objectives for the summit appear to be quite different. Putin seeks recognition on the world stage, aiming to show that Western efforts to isolate him have failed, while also pushing for territorial concessions in Ukraine. For Trump, the primary goal seems to be positioning himself as a global peacemaker, fulfilling a campaign promise to end the war, though his vacillating statements have made his precise strategy unclear. The article suggests Putin may leverage the meeting for symbolic and strategic gains, while Trump is driven by a desire for a significant diplomatic victory.</p>

Williams, a two-time U.S. Open champion, received a wild card invitation to participate in her 25th singles championship at the event. Her participation highlights the longevity possible in professional tennis, where many athletes have achieved major victories well into their 30s and 40s. After a period of underwhelming results and injuries, Williams recently became the oldest player to win a WTA singles match since 2004.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing for a significant increase in data centres, with nearly 100 new facilities planned, largely to support the growth of artificial intelligence. This expansion is raising serious concerns about the immense strain these facilities will place on the nation's energy and water resources. Experts warn that the increased electricity demand could drive up consumer energy bills, and water companies are already facing challenges in supplying the vast quantities needed for cooling. While the government views data centres as critical infrastructure, residents and environmental groups are voicing objections over the potential impacts.</p>

          <p>A new AI-driven tool called DeepEditor is changing how foreign language films are dubbed by digitally manipulating actors' lip movements to match the new dialogue. This technology aims to create a more seamless viewing experience, potentially opening up markets like the U.S. that have traditionally been resistant to subtitled or poorly dubbed films. Independent studio XYZ Films successfully used the tool for a Swedish sci-fi movie, securing a theatrical release it otherwise would not have received.
