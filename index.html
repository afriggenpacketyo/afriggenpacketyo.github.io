          <h2>German Polling Shows Support Shifting Towards Conservatives as SPD Falters</h2>

          <p>Recent polling in Germany indicates a continued decline for the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), which would receive only 13% of the vote in a current election. In contrast, the conservative CDU/CSU, led by Chancellor Friedrich Merz, has risen to 30%, while the far-right AfD remains strong at 23%. The survey also reveals public anxiety over war rhetoric and majority support for reintroducing compulsory military service, reflecting a significant shift in the nation's political and security landscape.</p>

          <p>Beijing has lodged a formal protest with New Delhi after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi publicly extended warm 90th birthday wishes to the Dalai Lama. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson urged India to recognize the "separatist nature" of Tibet-related issues and stop meddling in China's internal affairs. The incident underscores the extreme sensitivity surrounding the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, whom Beijing views as a threat to its authority and territorial claims.</p>

          <p>The jury has retired to consider its verdicts in the retrial of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon, who face charges of manslaughter by gross negligence in the death of their newborn baby, Victoria.

Having already been convicted on lesser charges, the jury in their first trial was unable to reach a verdict on the more serious counts.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has launched airstrikes against several Houthi-controlled targets in Yemen, including the ports of Hudaydah and Ras Issa, in retaliation for ongoing missile attacks. The operation, involving about 20 fighter jets, also targeted a cargo ship hijacked by the Houthis, which Israel claims was being used for surveillance. The Houthis reported confronting the attack and subsequently launched their own missiles toward Israel, escalating the regional conflict and signaling a sustained confrontation.</p>

          <p>Twelve Turkish soldiers have died in northern Iraq after being poisoned by methane gas while conducting a search operation inside a cave. The soldiers were looking for the body of a comrade killed by Kurdish fighters three years ago in an area previously used by the PKK as a field hospital. The Turkish Defense Ministry confirmed the deaths, which occurred in the "Claw-Lock Operation region," highlighting the ongoing dangers faced by troops in the long-running conflict.</p>

          <h2>White House Suggests Tariff Deadlines Could Be Extended for Some Nations</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top White House economic adviser has indicated that the impending deadline for new trade deals might be extended for countries that are negotiating "in good faith." While nations not making sufficient concessions could face higher tariffs, those actively working towards an agreement may see their deadlines rolled back, introducing a degree of flexibility into the administration's hardline stance. This suggests a potential two-tiered approach, rewarding cooperative partners while penalizing others as the administration pursues new agreements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With China's GDP deflator remaining negative and consumer prices falling for four consecutive months, economists are calling for more decisive action to combat the country's deflationary spiral. Analysts argue that simply trimming supply and reducing overcapacity has proven insufficient, identifying weak domestic demand as the core issue. The downturn in the property and financial sectors, coupled with diminishing household income expectations, requires stronger government intervention to revive the economy and restore price stability.

          <p>A federal trial is underway to challenge the Trump administration's alleged policy of deporting foreign students based on their pro-Palestinian political speech. The lawsuit, brought by university professor associations, argues this "ideological-deportation policy" is unconstitutional and has created a climate of fear on campuses, chilling academic freedom. The government will have to defend its position that it can deport noncitizens whose presence it deems a threat to U.S. foreign policy, even if they have committed no crimes.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that President Trump is engaged in a long-term project to purge the Republican party of any member who shows dissent, creating a smaller but more compliant base. The recent retirement of Senator Thom Tillis, after he opposed a Trump-backed bill and faced a primary threat, is presented as the latest example of this pattern. The author contends that Trump's goal is not to grow the party but to ensure absolute loyalty, prioritizing personal domination over ideological consistency or electoral strength.</p>

The "Climate Superfund Act" faced fierce opposition and a multi-million dollar lobbying campaign from the oil and gas industry, which argues the bill would kill jobs and raise consumer costs. Proponents contend that taxpayers are unfairly bearing the financial burden of climate disasters, but powerful industry influence has so far prevented the bill from advancing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar has experienced its sharpest six-month decline in over 50 years, prompting concerns about the nation's financial stability. Some analysts attribute the slump to President Trump's chaotic tariff policies and the country's ballooning debt, suggesting it reflects a long-term erosion of global confidence in the U.S. Others argue it is a natural market correction, but the trend has fueled debate over whether the dollar's dominance as the world's reserve currency is beginning to wane.
