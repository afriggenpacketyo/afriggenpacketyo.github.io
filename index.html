          <p>A Cincinnati barbecue restaurant, Lucius Q, is experiencing significant business repercussions after one of its co-owners, Aaron Sharpe, made offensive comments on social media following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Sharpe's posts led to key partners, including the local MLS stadium and a meat supplier, severing ties with the establishment. In response to the widespread public outcry and fallout, the restaurant announced it has parted ways with Sharpe and issued an apology to Kirk's family.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested 22-year-old Tyler Robinson in connection with the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University. The suspect was reportedly turned in by his father after being identified from law enforcement photos.

          <p>A recent academic assessment indicates that U.S. sanctions imposed over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang have had a noticeable negative economic impact, including causing local unemployment.

According to Tuersun Aibai, an associate professor at Xinjiang University, the economic consequences of these sanctions have become increasingly apparent in recent years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked a federal appeals court to lift an injunction that is preventing the president from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The administration is pushing for a decision before a critical Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week where interest rates will be discussed. A lower court had blocked the firing, ruling the president had not shown legally permissible "for cause" removal, which is required for Fed governors who serve 14-year terms to ensure their independence.

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has found former President Jair Bolsonaro guilty of conspiracies related to his 2022 reelection loss, sentencing him to prison and barring him from future office. This opinion piece draws parallels between Bolsonaro and former U.S. President Donald Trump, noting both leaders challenged democratic norms, claimed electoral fraud, and saw their supporters riot. The author suggests Brazil's decisive legal action serves as a potent example of democratic accountability that contrasts with the ongoing political and legal situation in the United States.</p>
