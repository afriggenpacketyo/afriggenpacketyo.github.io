          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz acknowledged Russia's willingness to engage in peace talks with Ukraine as a 'positive sign' but emphasized that it is 'far from sufficient.' Merz stated that European allies are supporting a 30-day truce, which Ukraine has agreed to without reservation, urging Moscow to reciprocate with a ceasefire to enable meaningful discussions. Merz's remarks followed Russian President Vladimir Putin's offer to hold direct talks with Ukraine in Turkey starting from Thursday, indicating a complex diplomatic landscape amidst the ongoing conflict and the need for both parties to de-escalate tensions before negotiations can commence. The article provides context to the international efforts aimed at brokering peace between Ukraine and Russia.</p>

          <p>Following US mediation, India and Pakistan have agreed to a ceasefire over the disputed Kashmir region, ending a period of intense hostilities. Diplomats from both countries express cautious optimism, acknowledging that while the de-escalation is welcome, it doesn't guarantee long-term peace due to deep-seated distrust. Experts highlight the US's role in facilitating the ceasefire, with some suggesting that IMF conditionalities were leveraged to hasten the end of hostilities. Despite the agreement, analysts warn that various issues, including terrorism and water security, continue to pose significant challenges to lasting stability in the region, and continued vigilance along the Line of Control is necessary.</p>

          <p>The new German government under Chancellor Friedrich Merz has implemented stricter border controls, turning away asylum seekers at its borders with other European countries. According to a German newspaper report, 19 people who had applied for asylum were rejected, citing reasons such as invalid visas and fake documents. The government justified the move by stating that Germany is surrounded by safe EU states where migrants should apply for refuge, aiming to curb illegal migrant entries. This decision has faced criticism from politicians and neighboring EU countries, raising concerns about compliance with European law and the potential for border congestion.</p>
