        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Canada has announced its intention to formally recognize a Palestinian state in September, following similar recent declarations by the UK and France. Prime Minister Mark Carney stated the move is contingent on the Palestinian Authority implementing democratic reforms and holding elections without the involvement of Hamas. This policy shift is driven by the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and the expansion of Israeli settlements, which Carney argues are eroding the viability of a two-state solution. Israel's foreign ministry criticized the decision, calling it a "reward for Hamas," while Canada's opposition party also voiced disapproval.</p>

          <p>According to a hospital in Gaza City, more than 50 Palestinians were killed and hundreds injured after Israeli forces allegedly fired upon crowds waiting for food aid near the Zikim crossing. The Hamas-run Civil Defence agency reported the incident, while the Israeli military stated its troops fired only "warning shots" and was unaware of casualties from its fire. The event occurred as U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff arrived in Israel for talks amid a dire humanitarian crisis, with the UN warning that famine is currently unfolding. This incident highlights the extreme desperation and danger surrounding aid distribution in the war-torn territory.</p>

          <p>An Indian court has acquitted Sadhvi Pragya Thakur, a Hindu nationalist nun and former member of parliament, along with six other individuals, in a deadly 2008 bombing case. The attack, which killed six people and injured over 100 near a mosque in Malegaon, was allegedly carried out to incite religious tensions. The judge ruled that the prosecution failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove the terrorism and criminal conspiracy charges against the accused. The verdict has been called disappointing by critics, who allege the investigation was deliberately shoddy and that the victims were targeted for their religion.</p>

          <p>Comcast is set to report its second-quarter earnings, with investors closely watching its broadband customer numbers, a key area of concern for the company and its cable industry peers. In recent years, cable companies have faced a slowdown in broadband growth due to heightened competition from alternatives like 5G fixed wireless services. This trend has negatively impacted stock prices, as seen with Charter Communications' recent historic stock drop after reporting worse-than-expected broadband losses. During its first-quarter call, Comcast executives acknowledged a need to adjust their broadband strategy to address price transparency and ease of business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CVS Health reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street expectations, prompting the company to raise its adjusted profit outlook for the fiscal year. The positive performance was driven by strength in its retail pharmacy operations and improvements within its Aetna insurance division, which has been managing higher medical costs. CEO David Joyner highlighted the success of a multi-year recovery effort at Aetna and new efficiencies in the retail pharmacy sector. However, the gains in these areas were partially offset by a decline in the company's health services segment. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite systems returning to normal, travel experts warn that the knock-on effects could last for days during the busy summer holiday season as airlines work to reposition aircraft, crew, and stranded passengers. Airlines are demanding answers following a similar major outage in August 2023.</p>

          <p>Former San Jose State volleyball co-captain Brooke Slusser has made new allegations regarding a conference investigation into her transgender former teammate, Blaire Fleming. Slusser claims a witness directly told investigators about Fleming's alleged plot to have her intentionally injured during a match, which she argues should have constituted sufficient evidence. The Mountain West Conference's investigation, conducted by a law firm also defending the conference in a related lawsuit, concluded without finding enough evidence. Slusser and her family detailed the emotional toll of the situation, which involved threats and harassment, ultimately leading her to leave campus and finish her degree online.</p>

          <p>This article explores the growing disconnect between the Democratic Party's establishment and its voters regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Recent polls show a dramatic shift, with a strong majority of Democratic voters now sympathizing more with Palestinians, a stark reversal from less than a decade ago. Despite this, the party's leadership has largely maintained its pro-Israel stance, approving billions in military aid and hesitating to endorse pro-Palestinian candidates. The piece attributes this inertia to the powerful influence of pro-Israel lobbying groups like AIPAC, the conflation of anti-Zionism with antisemitism, and the generational divide on the issue among politicians.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of President Donald Trump's use of tariffs as a central component of his international trade policy, with new duties set to take effect on August 1. Trump argues these import taxes protect American jobs and manufacturing, but they have caused global economic volatility and led some firms to raise prices for U.S. consumers. The tariffs include broad taxes on goods like steel and cars, as well as country-specific rates targeting nations like China, Mexico, and EU members. Critics accuse the president of using tariffs as a negotiating tactic to secure more favorable trade deals for the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

The lack of any substantive announcements indicates that the talks were likely difficult, with an extension of the current 90-day tariff pause seen as the most optimistic outcome. According to Matteo Giovannini of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the current situation underscores a strategic shift in how both Beijing and Washington are approaching their complex economic relationship. The outcome of these ongoing talks could significantly reshape the existing global trade order. (not investment advice)</p>

Texas accounted for nearly a quarter of all arrests, followed by Florida and California. Overall, ICE arrests have increased by 120% compared to the same period in 2024 under the Biden administration.

This follows several previous ARM investigations revealing horrific cruelty at other Fairlife suppliers, despite the brand's initial promises of humane treatment and transparency.

          <p>This review praises the new "The Naked Gun" film as a brilliant career move for Liam Neeson, allowing him to successfully pivot from a string of repetitive action roles to self-mocking comedy. Neeson plays Frank Drebin Jr., son of the original character, in a sequel that honors the franchise's legacy of slapstick, wordplay, and non-sequitur humor while updating it for a modern audience. Directed by Akiva Schaffer, the film is described as hilarious and cleverly written, with Neeson fully committing to the deadpan delivery required for the role.

          <h2>Health Experts Question Viral 'Japanese Walking' Fitness Trend</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fitness trend known as "Japanese walking," which involves alternating between fast and slow walking for 30 minutes, has gone viral on social media with claims it offers the benefits of a 10,000-step walk. The routine is based on a small 2007 Japanese study that showed improvements in blood pressure and aerobic capacity for participants. However, health experts are skeptical, pointing to potential flaws in the original study and the lack of robust evidence to support the sweeping claims. While they agree that any form of activity, especially vigorous intervals, is beneficial, they caution against over-hyping the trend and advise consulting a doctor before starting new exercise routines.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This contributor argues that the Trump administration's practice of withholding or rescinding congressionally appropriated funds is both irresponsible and illegal. The author draws parallels to President Nixon's impoundments, which were unanimously found unlawful by the Supreme Court, and notes that even Justice Clarence Thomas supported a ruling against a similar presidential power. The piece criticizes the administration for ignoring the Impoundment Control Act and engaging in "pocket rescissions" to defund programs it dislikes. The author concludes that these actions undermine the legislative process and do little to address the massive deficit created by recent tax cuts.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that California must act quickly to take advantage of federal clean energy tax credits before they expire at the end of 2027, following their repeal by the Trump administration. The author warns that the loss of these incentives could cause state electricity rates to spike by up to 11% by 2035. To avoid this, the article suggests an innovative approach called "surplus interconnection," which involves building new solar and wind projects at the sites of existing gas-fired power plants to use their underutilized grid connections. This could rapidly add significant renewable capacity and save Californians money, but requires immediate action from state officials.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the US government consistently avoids addressing its fiscal challenges by obscuring the true cost of its programs from taxpayers. The author contends that neither raising taxes on the wealthy nor economic growth alone can solve the nation's debt crisis, as tax revenues have historically remained stable as a percentage of GDP regardless of tax rates. The piece suggests that if voters were fully aware of the taxes required to fund current spending levels, they would demand significant cuts to entitlements and subsidies. The author concludes that continuing to promise benefits without a realistic funding plan is a form of intergenerational theft. (not investment advice)</p>

The Sacramento pair was last seen after a doctor's appointment in Fresno, and their vehicle was last detected by a license plate reader in Atwater. With no clues or signs of foul play, the family is left to wonder what happened, fearing a possible medical emergency as Owen had a history of high blood pressure. Owen's mother and partner have been tirelessly searching, putting up fliers, and spreading the word on social media in a desperate attempt to find them.</p>

          <p>Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has become the first House Republican to use the term "genocide" to describe Israel's actions and the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Her statement marks a significant deviation from the standard Republican party line of unconditional support for Israel and follows growing global outrage over mass starvation in the enclave. Greene's comments were partly a rebuke of a fellow Republican who dismissed images of starving children as propaganda. This shift in rhetoric from a prominent MAGA figure coincides with France and 14 other nations calling for the recognition of a Palestinian state to address the escalating crisis.</p>

          <p>After a deadly shooting in New York, the gunman, Shane Tamura, left a note claiming he suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) due to playing high school football. While it is not confirmed if he had the degenerative brain disease, his claim has intensified questions about the health risks of youth contact sports. Experts state that CTE risk is correlated with the number of seasons played, and that even four years of high school football could pose a danger. The incident highlights the ongoing debate over youth tackle football, with California lawmakers having previously limited full-contact practices to improve safety for young athletes.</p>

However, data also shows a significant 49% increase in planning applications for new homes outside London in the first half of 2025 compared to the previous year. While the rise in applications signals future intent, experts warn that lengthy decision times could delay construction for years. The government maintains it will meet its target of building 1.5 million homes by the next election, despite acknowledging that current completion figures will likely remain low for some time.

With two more executions already scheduled for August, Florida has executed more people this year than any other state.

          <p>Shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world's largest brewer, fell sharply after the company reported a second-quarter volume decline of 1.9%, significantly worse than the 0.3% drop analysts had forecast. The decrease was primarily driven by weak performance in China and Brazil, where the company cited industry underperformance and adverse weather. Despite the falling volumes, the maker of Budweiser and Corona saw its operating profit and revenue increase due to higher prices. However, analysts suggest the scale of the volume miss is likely to overshadow the profit growth and weigh on the company's stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of 43 distinguished British lawyers and peers has warned the UK government that its plan to recognize a Palestinian state could violate international law. In a letter to the attorney general, they argue that Palestine does not meet the statehood criteria set out in the 1933 Montevideo Convention, citing a lack of defined borders and a single, effective government. The government has defended its plan, noting that the UK is not a signatory to the convention and that 147 other UN members already recognize Palestine. The move comes after Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced the UK would proceed with recognition unless Israel meets certain conditions.</p>

The settler, Yinon Levi, was taken into custody after the death of Awdah Hathaleen, an activist featured in the Oscar-winning documentary "No Other Land." Last year, the Biden administration imposed financial sanctions on Levi for allegedly inciting violence against Palestinian civilians, but President Trump reversed the sanctions with an executive order shortly after taking office.

Despite the administration's stated support for persecuted Christians, its broader overhaul of the asylum and refugee systems has created significant challenges. For example, Iranians who fled religious persecution and entered legally through a now-shuttered app have been told to self-deport. Advocates and faith leaders are calling for protections, noting that many who saw the U.S. as a symbol of religious freedom now face the fear of being sent back to the dangerous situations they escaped.</p>
