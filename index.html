            <p>Several UK newspapers lead with the Supreme Court ruling on the definition of a woman, focusing on Prime Minister Starmer's response and potential ministerial actions. The Times reports the UK will increase munitions production to reduce reliance on the US and France, while the Financial Times highlights rising threats to global growth due to US-driven trade shocks. Other stories include concerns over cancer treatment access post-Brexit, the sale of trophy hunting trips, and a young Elvis impersonator's invitation to Graceland. The Daily Express reports that campaigners who won the landmark Supreme Court ruling on the definition of a woman are facing a campaign of "death threats and abuse".</p>

            <p>US Vice President JD Vance is visiting India to meet with Prime Minister Modi and discuss a bilateral trade deal, amidst escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The visit aims to review progress on trade and defense partnerships, focusing on fairness in trade. While Modi and Trump have a good relationship, the US has labeled India a "tariff abuser," and India hopes to secure a trade deal within a 90-day pause on tariffs. The US is India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $129 billion in 2024.</p>

            <p>China has warned countries against appeasing the US in trade talks over President Trump's tariffs, stating that "appeasement cannot bring peace, and compromise cannot earn one respect." This comes as the US administration is engaging in tariff negotiations with various trading partners, reportedly pressuring them to restrict trade with Beijing in exchange for tariff exemptions. Trump has imposed significant tariffs on Chinese imports and other countries, aiming to encourage domestic consumption and investment. However, critics argue that bringing manufacturing back to the US is complex and could take decades.</p>

China's economy has shown better-than-expected performance, allowing the central bank to maintain steady rates.

            <p>Nonsexual "friendship marriages" are gaining traction in Japan, offering partnership and social security benefits outside traditional societal norms. These arrangements cater to individuals whose sexual orientation or personal preferences don't align with conventional marriage expectations. A Tokyo-based marriage agency has facilitated over 300 such unions in the past decade, driven by factors like wanting a life partner or appeasing parents. While diverse values are spreading in Japan, the lack of same-sex marriage recognition reinforces the belief that men and women should marry and have children, making friendship marriages a "desperate measure" with practical rewards.</p>

            <p>Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating a 30-hour "Easter truce" announced by President Putin. Zelensky stated Russian troops violated the ceasefire nearly 3,000 times, while Russia's defense ministry claimed to have repelled Ukrainian assaults and accused Kyiv of launching drones and shells. President Trump expressed hope that Russia and Ukraine will make a deal this week. Despite the ceasefire announcement, both sides reported continued fighting and shelling, highlighting the ongoing conflict and distrust.</p>

            <p>An opinion piece suggests that Trump's tariffs may force China to resolve its economic weaknesses and become faster, leaner, and stronger. China recognizes that the US goal is to systematically strangle its economic rise, not merely rebalance trade. While fiscal stimulus could mitigate the immediate impact, the key is resolving domestic market fragmentation. The US is imposing increasingly strict export controls, particularly on advanced technology. China is digging in for a long fight.</p>

            <p>Despite government efforts to expand free childcare in England, parents still face challenges finding nursery places, particularly in deprived areas. The rollout of the "free hours" scheme aims to provide 30 hours of childcare per week for eligible working parents, but demand is increasing, and experts are concerned about a widening gap between those who are eligible and those who are not. Private nurseries face rising operating costs, and some are threatening to withdraw from the scheme. The system is under strain, needing more staff and places to work effectively.</p>

            <p>This article outlines five ways for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder, including starting to save early, looking at low-deposit mortgage options, exploring shared ownership, considering an 'income boost' mortgage, and professional mortgages. Experts recommend maximizing savings through Lifetime ISAs and exploring low-deposit mortgages from building societies. Shared ownership allows buyers to purchase a share of a property and pay rent on the remainder, while an 'income boost' mortgage enables family members to increase borrowing potential. These are potential steps to home ownership (not investment advice).</p>

            <p>Men are less likely than women to seek medical help, often delaying visits until symptoms become unbearable, which impacts their health outcomes. Factors contributing to this include societal pressure to "tough it out," concerns about appearing weak, and appointment systems that don't fit their working patterns. Unlike women, men are not forced to engage in the health system as frequently, and tend to view healthcare as treatment rather than prevention. To improve men's health, it's crucial to address these barriers and redesign services to meet their needs.</p>
