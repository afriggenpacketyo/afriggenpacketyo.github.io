          <p>Pizza Hut's UK restaurant operator has entered administration, leading to the closure of 68 restaurants and 11 delivery locations, resulting in 1,210 job losses. This move comes after the chain has faced significant financial struggles, including a previous administration period in January. However, Pizza Hut's global parent company, Yum! Brands, has stepped in to save 64 other UK locations, which will preserve approximately 1,276 jobs and maintain a portion of the brand's presence in the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's proposal to impose a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the U.S. could severely impact the British film industry, which is already facing challenges from post-pandemic recovery and streaming competition. The UK's film and television sector is heavily dependent on American investment, with U.S. studios accounting for 65% of production spending last year. While some industry experts question the practicality of such a tariff, others worry it could force UK filmmakers to seek more co-production opportunities with European and Asian partners to secure financing.</p>

Citing the urgency of a "space race against China," Duffy announced he plans to open the lunar lander contract to other companies to ensure the mission's progress. He specifically mentioned Blue Origin as a potential competitor, aiming for a moon landing in 2028, a slight delay from the previously announced 2027 target for the Artemis III mission.</p>

          <p>Following a contentious meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President Trump has publicly suggested that the war in Ukraine should end with Russia retaining control of the territories it currently occupies. The meeting, described as a "shouting match," reportedly ended without Ukraine securing the long-range Tomahawk missiles it had requested. Trump's proposal involves freezing the current battle lines and has been met with concern from Ukraine and its allies, signaling a potential major shift in U.S. foreign policy on the conflict.</p>

          <p>While a short government shutdown is unlikely to severely impact air travel, a prolonged one could cause significant disruptions for passengers. Most TSA officers and air traffic controllers are deemed essential and must work without pay, but a lengthy shutdown could lead to increased sick calls and staffing shortages, as seen in 2018-2019. This could result in longer security lines and potential flight delays, and it would also halt the hiring and training of new air traffic controllers at a time when the nation is already facing a shortage.</p>

          <p>In a challenging housing market, prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance can expect to see average 30-year mortgage rates around 6.46% and 15-year rates at 5.81% as of mid-October. Refinance rates are slightly higher, with a 30-year average at 6.50%. To secure the best possible rates in the current environment, experts advise strengthening one's credit profile, aiming for a score in the mid-to-high 700s, and shopping around with multiple lenders to compare offers, as terms can vary significantly.

The discovery was made after a related fund was sued for fraud by another bank, prompting Zions to conduct its own investigation and charge off most of the loan amount. (not investment advice)</p>

Major forecasters like the Mortgage Bankers Association and Fannie Mae project that 30-year rates will hold steady around 6.4% to 6.5% by year-end, though a significant drop in 10-year Treasury yields could push them lower.

          <p>A Columbia University business psychologist argues that mastering certain social skills is more crucial for career success than simply "being yourself." The three essential skills identified are being receptive to critical feedback, cultivating social awareness by focusing on others' needs, and demonstrating adaptability by stepping out of one's comfort zone to learn new things. Practicing these skills, which are components of high emotional intelligence, can make an individual more employable and effective in the workplace by improving interpersonal dynamics and fostering personal growth.</p>

          <p>The article examines the narrative of a "Christian genocide" in Nigeria, which has been amplified by some international figures, and contrasts it with the Nigerian government's denial. While acknowledging the severe security problems and attacks on Christian communities, especially in the Middle Belt region, it suggests the violence is driven by a complex mix of factors. These include long-standing land disputes between farmers and herders, climate change, poverty, and weak governance, rather than a purely religious or state-sponsored campaign of extermination, affecting both Christians and Muslims.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing trade dynamics, China has significantly increased its soybean imports from South American countries, particularly Brazil, while its orders from the United States have fallen to zero. In September, China's total soybean imports rose 13% year-over-year, with Brazilian soybeans accounting for over 85% of that volume. This shift highlights China's strategy to diversify its suppliers and reduce reliance on U.S. agriculture, a move that has major implications for global trade flows and American farmers who have long depended on the Chinese market.</p>

He compares trading these highly volatile stocks, like GameStop, to a game of musical chairs, where many investors are left with significant losses when the speculative frenzy ends. Instead, Cramer advocates for a strategy of buying and holding shares in fundamentally strong, best-of-breed companies that can compound wealth over time, while reserving only a small portion of a portfolio for well-researched speculative picks.
