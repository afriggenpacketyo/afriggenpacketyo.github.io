          <p>Treasury yields experienced volatility as Trump proposed tariffs on the EU and Apple, leading investors to seek safety in bonds. The 30-year Treasury yield decreased by 4 basis points to 5.028%, while the 10-year Treasury yield fell by 6 basis points to 4.491%. Trump's recommendation of a 50% tariff on the EU and a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the U.S. sparked concerns among traders.

          <p>Harvard University has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, challenging the ban on enrolling international students, citing violations of the First Amendment, Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The Trump administration barred Harvard from enrolling international students after revoking its ability to use the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated the decision was due to Harvard's refusal to comply with information requests and its perceived unsafe campus environment, citing antisemitism and racist policies. The university's president, Dr. Alan M. Garber, condemned the action as unlawful and unwarranted, stating it imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars.</p>

          <p>President Trump has escalated trade tensions by threatening a 50% tariff on EU goods starting June 1 and a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured in the United States. Trump stated that discussions with the EU were unproductive and insisted that Apple manufacture iPhones in America. This announcement has rattled world leaders, as it could make it more expensive for businesses to sell goods in the U.S., the world's largest economy. Volvo's CEO suggested customers would bear most of the tariff costs, potentially limiting sales of its Belgium-made electric vehicle in the U.S.</p>

          <p>With persistent inflation impacting savings, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn returns that outpace inflation while locking in high rates for the CD's term. National average CD yields range from 1.69% to 1.99% APY for 1-year to 5-year terms, while top CDs offer rates between 4.00% and 4.41% APY for 6-month to 5-year terms. Online banks often provide the most competitive rates due to lower overhead costs, and strategies like CD laddering can help savers take advantage of both short-term and long-term rates.

          <p>Research reveals that clownfish can shrink in response to severe heat waves, potentially as an adaptation to survive hotter ocean temperatures. During a heat wave in Papua New Guinea, scientists measured 134 clownfish and found that most of them got shorter by a few millimeters. The study suggests that shrinking may help clownfish meet their bodies' energy requirements more easily in a hot climate, with fish that shrank having a higher chance of survival.</p>
