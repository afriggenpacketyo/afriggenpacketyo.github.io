          <p>U.S. Treasury yields decreased on Thursday after new labor market data revealed a higher-than-expected increase in weekly jobless claims. First-time filings for jobless benefits reached 247,000, surpassing the Dow Jones estimate of 236,000. The 2-year yield fell by more than 2 basis points to 3.848%, and the 10-year Treasury yield dropped by more than 3 basis points to 4.328%. This decline follows disappointing U.S. data from the previous day, including weaker services sector activity and lower-than-expected private sector payroll increases, raising concerns about a weakening labor market (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's new travel ban affecting numerous countries, exceptions are in place for specific groups. World Cup athletes, individuals holding dual citizenship, and those with existing U.S. visas are permitted entry. This decision aims to balance national security concerns with the need to allow participation in major sporting events and maintain existing travel arrangements. The policy reflects a nuanced approach to travel restrictions, targeting specific nationalities while accommodating others based on their circumstances and contributions to the United States. The implementation of these exceptions demonstrates a consideration for international events and pre-existing legal permissions. Optimism here is based on the idea that international relations are not completely cut off. </p>

          <p>Proposed tariffs by President Trump could substantially raise the prices of imported goods like clothing and shoes, according to a CNBC report. A retail consultancy group, AlixPartners, created pricing models that show potential price increases for men's sweaters and shoes made in China and Vietnam. Under current tariffs, prices could rise by about 19% for Chinese-made items and 8% for Vietnamese-made items; however, retailers are exploring strategies to mitigate these costs, such as absorbing some of the tariffs or negotiating lower rates. The models illustrate the potential impact on consumers, but final prices may vary depending on retailer strategies and final tariff rates. This report highlights the potential economic consequences of tariffs on everyday consumer goods (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The traditional concept of the "summer body" is fading, replaced by a year-round fitness culture driven by social media trends and weight-loss drugs. The pressure to constantly fine-tune one's appearance has intensified, with social media platforms flooded with workout routines and wellness content. Gyms are consistently crowded, and fitness has become a larger part of social life, including running clubs and Pilates classes. The rise of GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic has further fueled this endless pursuit of thinness, raising expectations and creating a feeling of exclusion for those who cannot afford or tolerate these medications.
