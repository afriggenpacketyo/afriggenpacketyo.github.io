          <p>Former President Donald Trump has escalated his rhetoric on crime in Washington, D.C., demanding the city's homeless population leave "immediately" and promising they will be given places to stay far from the capital. This comes despite Justice Department data showing a 30-year low for violent crime in the city. Trump's renewed focus on the district follows an assault on a former administration official and is part of a broader plan to increase federal law enforcement presence. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has criticized his language as hyperbolic and false.</p>

          <p>In the men's Hundred cricket tournament, the Southern Brave secured a decisive nine-wicket victory over the Birmingham Phoenix. Bowlers Jofra Archer and Michael Bracewell were instrumental, restricting Phoenix to a low score of 106-7. Archer claimed two key wickets, showcasing his form for England. The Brave's batsmen, Leus du Plooy and James Vince, then comfortably chased the target with 19 balls remaining. This win places the Southern Brave at the top of the league table alongside the Oval Invincibles, while the Phoenix remain winless.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Texas Republican Representative Tony Gonzales defended Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) against criticism, arguing that enforcement protects Americans from criminals. He acknowledged that data shows many deportees are not violent offenders but expressed optimism that new funding from the '$45 billion one big, beautiful bill' will allow DHS to create task forces to target more dangerous individuals like pedophiles and murderers. Gonzales also addressed the use of Fort Bliss for housing migrants, expressing concern about the cost to the Department of Defense but viewing it as a necessary short-term solution.</p>

The priest is currently in serious condition at a Belfast hospital. The local community and political leaders have expressed their horror and sadness over the violent events.</p>

          <p>NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte stated that the upcoming summit between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin in Alaska is an important opportunity to test Putin's seriousness about ending the war in Ukraine. Rutte emphasized that any potential deal must respect Ukraine's sovereignty and its right to decide its own future. In contrast, former national security adviser John Bolton expressed criticism, arguing the summit legitimizes a pariah leader and gives Putin a strategic advantage. Rutte countered by highlighting Trump's actions, such as tariffs on India and supplying weapons to Ukraine, as evidence of maximum pressure on Russia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former baseball star David Justice recently opened up about his divorce from actress Halle Berry in the 1990s, attributing their split to his lack of wisdom about relationships at a young age. Speaking on a podcast, Justice explained that his traditional expectations of a wife, involving cooking and cleaning, clashed with Berry's burgeoning Hollywood career. He reflected that they never had issues related to infidelity and suggested that therapy might have saved their marriage. Justice, a World Series champion, married Berry in 1993, and their divorce was finalized in 1997.</p>

          <p>A demonstration in London supporting the recently banned group Palestine Action resulted in 532 arrests, the largest number by the Metropolitan Police on a single day in a decade. The majority of arrests were for displaying placards supporting the group, which was proscribed under the Terrorism Act in July, making such support a criminal offense. The protest, organized by Defend Our Juries, saw hundreds of activists simultaneously reveal signs in Parliament Square. While the Home Secretary defended the ban, civil liberties groups like Amnesty International criticized the mass arrests as a threat to freedom of expression.</p>

          <p>A political battle is intensifying over a Republican-led effort to redraw congressional maps in Texas, which Democrats have labeled as 'cheating.' Democratic lawmakers fled the state to deny Republicans the necessary quorum to pass the new maps, which could give the GOP five additional House seats. Illinois Governor JB Pritzker defended the protesting Democrats, while Texas Governor Greg Abbott has threatened to have them arrested upon their return and to call indefinite special sessions. Prominent Democrats like Senator Bernie Sanders and Governor Kathy Hochul have called for fighting back against the move, which they attribute to Donald Trump's influence.</p>

The Labubu toy, created by Chinese company Pop Mart, has seen a massive surge in global popularity, becoming a billion-dollar industry. Marketing experts attribute their appeal to a 'blind box' sales model and their status as collectible accessories, which creates rarity and high demand in the resale market.</p>

          <h2>Expert Argues Personal Branding is a Crucial Tool for Introverts in the Workplace</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Branding expert Goldie Chan, a self-described introvert, argues that building a personal brand is essential for career success, especially for those who are naturally less outspoken. She suggests that a personal brand is simply what people know you for, and it allows individuals to shape their own professional narrative rather than being underestimated. Chan advises starting with small, consistent actions, like sending one networking email a month or posting one weekly update online, to build confidence. She emphasizes that branding happens both online and through real-world interests, which can create unexpected career opportunities.</p>

          <p>An environmental scientist has effectively debunked a common climate change myth in a viral TikTok video. Responding to a comment, she clarified that while the Earth naturally goes through warming and cooling cycles, the current rapid warming is undeniably influenced by human emissions. She presented charts from the EPA and other institutions showing how burning fossil fuels has drastically accelerated this natural cycle, leading to more extreme weather and threatening global ecosystems. The video emphasizes that this is a well-documented scientific consensus, not a political belief.</p>

          <p>In her upcoming memoir, former Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon suggests that her predecessor, Alex Salmond, may have leaked details of the sexual misconduct investigation against him. Allies of the late Salmond have dismissed this claim as a "fabrication" and "hypocrisy." Salmond was cleared of 13 sexual offense charges in 2020, and the government's handling of the probe was later ruled unlawful. The journalist who broke the original story stated he finds Sturgeon's theory not credible, adding it highlights the deep rift that formed between the two former leaders.</p>

          <p>US fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology following criticism that a shoe he designed for Adidas culturally appropriated a traditional Mexican sandal. The Oaxaca Slip-On was inspired by huaraches made by Indigenous artisans but was reportedly produced in China without their involvement. The controversy drew comments from Mexico's president, who is exploring legal options to support the affected communities. Chavarria expressed deep regret that the design was not developed in a meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community, and promotional images of the shoe have been removed.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to a summit in Alaska, a high-stakes move aimed at fulfilling his campaign promise to end the war in Ukraine. The decision has alarmed Ukraine and European allies, who fear Trump might concede Ukrainian territory to secure a deal. The meeting was arranged after back-channel discussions led by envoy Steve Witkoff, as Trump grew frustrated with Putin's reluctance to negotiate. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who was not invited, has condemned the idea that Ukraine's future could be decided without its participation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiologists are advising individuals with high blood pressure to avoid taking licorice root supplements. The supplement contains a compound called glycyrrhizin, which can dangerously raise blood pressure by causing the body to retain sodium and lose potassium. This imbalance puts significant strain on the cardiovascular system and can lead to serious complications, including headaches, fluid retention, and arrhythmias. Experts emphasize consulting a doctor before starting any new supplement and recommend focusing on proven methods like the DASH or Mediterranean diets to manage blood pressure.</p>
