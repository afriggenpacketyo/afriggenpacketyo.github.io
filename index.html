          <p>Following comments made by U.S. President Donald Trump regarding ‚Äúunification‚Äù in the context of trade talks with Beijing, Taiwanese authorities have moved to reassure the public. Trump's statement, made after trade talks, sparked unease in Taiwan despite a U.S. State Department spokesperson clarifying that Trump's remarks were related to the U.S.-China trade relationship. The Taiwanese presidential office emphasized Washington‚Äôs commitment to Taiwan remains strong and that Taiwan-related issues were not discussed during the trade talks, urging the public to remain confident in the administration's handling of international economic changes.</p>

          <p>The New York Times won a legal battle against the European Commission, compelling the bloc to disclose text messages exchanged between Ursula von der Leyen and Pfizer's CEO during Covid-19 vaccine negotiations. The European Union's second-highest court ruled that the commission should not have denied a journalist's request for the texts, arguing they could contain important information relevant to the vaccine procurement deal, which was one of the largest in EU history. This decision could set a legal precedent for what is considered an official document in the EU and increase transparency in negotiations that involve taxpayer money and shape public policy. The ruling emphasizes the importance of public access to government documents for democratic oversight.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced the removal of all U.S. sanctions on Syria, aiming to give the country a chance at greatness following years of war and instability. Trump stated his administration has already taken steps to restore normal relations between the United States and Syria, which has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism since 1979. The removal of sanctions is intended to foster economic progress and facilitate humanitarian assistance, which had been hindered by the stringent U.S. measures. Syria is currently led by President Ahmed al-Sharaa, a former al-Qaeda member who now leads the country's transitional government, after the Assad regime was toppled during a shock offensive by anti-Assad militia groups in December of 2024.</p>

          <p>Burberry announced organizational changes that may lead to the reduction of approximately 1,700 roles globally as part of its ongoing turnaround efforts. These measures, aimed at cutting costs across procurement and real estate, are expected to save the company ¬£60 million ($79.9 million) and represent the latest phase of CEO Joshua Schulman's strategy to revive the brand. The job cuts will impact about 20% of Burberry's overall headcount, primarily affecting office-based roles, stores, and its factory in Castleford, England. Despite a difficult macroeconomic backdrop, Schulman remains optimistic about Burberry's future and its ability to achieve sustainable profitable growth.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a rise of over 3.5% due to the announcement of a share buyback program worth up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion) and better-than-expected operating income. The company's operating income for the last quarter beat analyst estimates, although it was lower compared to the same period last year. Sony also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of the shares to shareholders through dividends. Despite the positive news, Sony's outlook for the current financial year ending in March 2026 was lackluster.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Pennsylvania has approved the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan citizens identified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang. Judge Stephanie Haines, a Trump appointee, ruled that the administration can use the Act to remove Venezuelans in the U.S. without legal status who are members of the gang, while also mandating a 21-day notice period for those facing deportation. This decision follows President Trump's proclamation declaring Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization, but other federal judges have temporarily blocked the use of the AEA in other regions. The ruling highlights ongoing legal debates regarding the scope and application of immigration laws.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's policies, including proposed tariffs and rhetoric against wind energy, are injecting uncertainty into the U.S. renewable energy sector. Despite incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act, the administration's hostility towards clean technologies is causing concern among investors and developers. Proposed tariffs, particularly those targeting Southeast Asia, could significantly impact the solar industry by increasing the cost of critical components. While the president has temporarily paused many tariffs, the instability and anti-renewables sentiment are causing project cancellations and hindering the growth of clean energy in the United States.</p>

          <p>State Farm customers in California are facing a 17% increase in home insurance premiums following a judge's ruling, which was adopted by California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara. The increase is meant to alleviate the company's financial strain following the destructive Los Angeles-area wildfires, providing a $400 million cash infusion from its parent company. This decision has faced criticism from fire survivors and state senators, who argue it disregards the hardships faced by fire victims. The approval is part of an effort to address a statewide insurance crisis affecting millions of Californians, with State Farm agreeing to refrain from implementing new block non-renewal programs through the end of 2025.</p>

          <h2>Oyster Fossil Data Challenges Beliefs About Cretaceous Period Climate</h2>

          <p>Climate data from oyster fossils challenges the belief that Antarctica was ice-free during the Cretaceous period, suggesting icy interludes in the dinosaurs' greenhouse world. The research indicates that the mid-latitudes of the southern hemisphere experienced seasonal temperature changes comparable to today, with the presence of polar ice. Scientists suggest these findings offer insight into present-day climate change, particularly regarding the reduction of Arctic and Antarctic ice due to ongoing global warming. The study highlights the transition from a world with perennial glacier ice to one with only seasonal ice, impacting the Earth's climate dynamics.</p>

          <p>British businesses are warning that the UK government's plans to tighten immigration rules on foreign workers will lead to labor shortages, particularly in sectors like health and social care. The government's proposals include raising English-language requirements and skill levels for migrants, aiming to 'back British workers over cheap overseas labor.' However, businesses fear that British personnel cannot or will not fill the gaps created by likely worker shortages, especially in roles traditionally reliant on migrant staff. The government has come under increasing pressure to tackle immigration amid record migration figures, particularly with the strong performance of anti-immigration parties.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, setting the stage for their potential release after more than three decades behind bars for killing their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion. Judge Michael V. Jesic cited the brothers' rehabilitation, support from corrections officials, and acceptance of responsibility for the crimes. The brothers, now middle-aged men, appeared remotely from prison, expressing remorse and apologizing to their relatives. The decision is a remarkable turn in a saga that has gripped the nation‚Äôs attention for decades, though the final decision rests with Governor Newsom and state parole officials.</p>

          <p>A charter plane carrying 59 white South Africans arrived in the U.S. as refugees, fast-tracked by President Trump due to concerns about racist policies and a 'genocide' against white farmers. This decision has sparked controversy, with critics arguing that there is no persecution of white Afrikaners in South Africa and that such claims are based on lies and false narratives. The South African government denies any persecution and insists that crime affects everyone regardless of race, while others view Trump's actions as a means of positioning himself as a savior of white privilege and Christianity globally.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington‚Äôs demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to American envoy Steve Witkoff in Oman, suggesting Iran would enrich uranium to a low grade and ship it to Arab countries for civilian use. The proposal entails a three-country consortium with representatives from other countries, potentially including the U.S., to provide oversight. While the U.S. has denied the proposal, Iranian officials claim the joint venture plan would be permanent, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>

Despite the decline, prices remain near historic highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu wiping out flocks of egg-laying hens.
