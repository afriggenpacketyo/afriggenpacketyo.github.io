        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has rejected the Trump administration's request to unseal grand jury materials related to the Ghislaine Maxwell case. Judge Paul Engelmayer stated the government's premise was "demonstrably false," as the records contain no significant new information about the crimes of Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein. The judge criticized the motion as potentially "disingenuous" and suggested it might be an attempt at diversion rather than genuine transparency. Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year sentence for her role in the sex trafficking scheme.</p>

          <p>Prominent venture capitalist Mike Moritz has publicly supported Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan following President Trump's call for his resignation. In a Financial Times piece, Moritz described Trump's attack as "artless bullying" and a "vindictive political sideshow." He urged the Intel board to show "backbone" and stand by Tan, whom he praised for his past success in turning around Cadence Design Systems. The controversy stems from concerns raised by Trump and Senator Tom Cotton regarding Tan's alleged ties to Chinese companies.</p>

Grant, who started the business in 1981, said this move preserves the company's family-oriented values, which would have been at risk in a conventional sale. The new structure will allow staff to receive a share of the profits and have a say in the company's governance. The decision has been praised by employees as a reflection of Grant's long-standing commitment to their welfare.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers in Texas are advancing a new bill that would permit civil lawsuits against anyone involved in the manufacturing, prescription, or distribution of abortion-inducing medication. The proposed "Women and Child Protection Act" also aims to enable wrongful death lawsuits if the medication harms a fetus or the mother. This legislation seeks to counteract "shield laws" in other states that protect doctors who prescribe the pills via telemedicine to patients in states with abortion bans. Critics argue the bill is an attempt to interfere with safe and legal reproductive healthcare nationwide.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski has indicated he is not yet ready to name a starting quarterback for the regular season, fueling further speculation. The intrigue follows an impressive preseason debut by rookie Shedeur Sanders, who threw for 138 yards and two touchdowns. While veteran Joe Flacco is still considered the likely starter, Sanders' performance has intensified the competition. Stefanski stated he would have a clearer plan later in the week ahead of the next preseason game against the Philadelphia Eagles.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he will hold a press conference to address violent crime in Washington, D.C., following a White House directive to increase federal law enforcement presence in the city. The move comes after a former government official was assaulted, prompting Trump to threaten federalization if local leaders do not act. D.C. officials, including Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, have condemned the action as an overreach and an encroachment on the district's "home rule." Critics point out that official data shows violent crime in the city has actually been decreasing.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant rally, with Bitcoin's price approaching its all-time high, trading near $120,000. Ether also reached its highest level since 2021, briefly breaking the $4,000 resistance level before a slight pullback. This surge is attributed by some analysts to increased buying during Asian trading hours, fueled by the rapid expansion of U.S. debt. The market's upward momentum has also boosted shares of related companies like Coinbase and MicroStrategy, signaling strong investor confidence in digital assets. (not investment advice)</p>

Furthermore, having a few original, impactful ideas and, most importantly, the underrated ability to reliably execute tasks are critical drivers of success. Welch advises individuals to focus on their inherent strengths, such as being a strong implementer, rather than conforming to a universal definition of leadership.</p>

          <p>A new executive order from President Trump, titled "Improving Oversight of Federal Grantmaking," is drawing sharp criticism from the scientific community for threatening research independence. The order gives political appointees the authority to overrule scientific peer review and control decisions on federal research grants, potentially based on political ideology rather than scientific merit. Nobel laureate Victor Ambros described the move as a "Soviet-style politicization of American science."

This deal allows the companies to sell their H20 and MI308 chips, which were designed for the Chinese market to comply with U.S. export controls. From an investor's perspective, the deal is seen as a net positive, as securing 85% of revenue is preferable to being completely shut out of the lucrative market.

For a travel card to be worthwhile, users should avoid carrying a balance, as high interest rates can quickly negate any rewards earned.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of enterprise AI company C3 AI dropped 30% after it released preliminary first-quarter financial results that CEO Thomas Siebel called "completely unacceptable." The company projected revenue well below the previous year's figures and a significantly wider operating loss. Siebel attributed the poor performance to a disruptive sales organization restructuring and his own ongoing health issues, which limited his active participation in the sales process. The company has completed its restructuring and is actively searching for a new CEO to accelerate future growth.</p>

          <p>Money psychology expert Morgan Housel argues that investors, particularly highly educated ones, often overcomplicate their strategies, which can lead to worse results. He, along with experts like Warren Buffett, recommends a simple, "boring" approach centered on passive investing in low-cost index funds. This strategy aims to match average market returns over a long period, which historically outperforms the majority of active fund managers. The key to long-term success is not chasing the highest possible returns but achieving sustainable returns over the longest possible time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a move described by trade experts as "unprecedented," the U.S. government will receive 15% of the revenue from Nvidia and AMD's sales of certain advanced chips to China. This quid pro quo arrangement was made after the Trump administration reversed a ban on these specific chips, which were developed to navigate earlier export restrictions. The deal raises questions about the consistency of U.S. national security policy and sets a potentially worrying precedent for other American companies doing business with China. Critics are concerned about the lack of clarity on how the collected funds will be used.</p>

While the exchange rate is more market-based, it remains heavily managed. The key challenge for the next decade will be to further internationalize the yuan and allow for more market-driven pricing without causing destabilizing fluctuations in its value.
