          <p>Jake Haro, 32, and Rebecca Haro, 41, have been charged with felony murder and filing a false police report in connection with the disappearance of their 7-month-old son, Emmanuel, in Southern California. The couple initially reported Emmanuel kidnapped on August 14th, but investigators found inconsistencies in the mother's account, leading them to believe the child is deceased, although his remains are yet to be recovered. Jake Haro had a prior conviction for child cruelty in 2018. The parents were taken into custody after they stopped cooperating with authorities. They are currently held on $1 million bond each, with their arraignment scheduled for September 4th.</p>

          <p>Graham Simpson, a Conservative Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Central Scotland, has officially defected to the Reform UK party, appearing alongside leader Nigel Farage. Simpson cited a desire to "create something new, exciting and lasting" that prioritizes people's needs over the system, calling the departure from his long-time party an "enormous wrench." This move makes him Reform's sole MSP and the second defection from the Scottish Conservative group in a week. Reform UK's platform includes plans to deport 600,000 migrants over five years, a policy that has generated significant political debate and criticism from other parties.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle rose approximately 5% after the apparel company announced a limited-edition collaboration with NFL star Travis Kelce's sportswear brand, Tru Kolors. The announcement came strategically just one day after Kelce and singer Taylor Swift revealed their engagement, generating global buzz. This partnership, which has been over a year in the making, features vintage-inspired T-shirts and reimagined varsity jackets. The stock bump mirrors a similar surge seen after a previous collaboration with actress Sydney Sweeney, highlighting the significant market impact of celebrity endorsements and timely marketing.</p>

          <p>Fire crews battling a vast 10-square-mile moorland blaze on Langdale Moor in the North York Moors National Park have been severely hampered by exploding World War Two bombs and tank shells. Chief Fire Officer Jonathan Dyson reported over 18 explosions as the fire burned down through the peat, exposing previously hidden explosives. The incident, now classified as a "significant wildfire," has prompted requests for national assistance, with the blaze more than doubling in size due to challenging wind and temperature conditions. Firefighters are working intensely to minimize further spread and contain the dangerous and unpredictable fire.</p>

          <p>Kohl's shares surged over 20% after the retailer significantly surpassed Wall Street's fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, despite an overall decline in sales. The company tightened its full-year sales guidance to reflect the higher end of its previous range and revised its adjusted earnings per share outlook upwards. Interim CEO Michael Bender attributed sales challenges to lower and middle-income customers trading down, but highlighted strategic efforts like reintroducing petite sections and jewelry, overhauling discount strategies, and focusing on lower-priced exclusive brands. The company successfully reduced inventory, and sales trends showed improvement throughout the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has implemented a sweeping global program of tariffs, aiming to boost American manufacturing, protect jobs, and reduce the trade deficit. Tariffs are taxes on imported goods, typically a percentage of their value, paid by importers who may then pass the increased costs to consumers. Trump views these measures as a negotiating tactic against "cheaters" and "pillagers." While some tariffs have been amended or delayed, they have caused volatility in global stock markets and are contributing to rising prices for US consumers on various items, including clothing and electronics.

This unique find represents the oldest known ankylosaur and features metre-long spikes fused directly onto its neck bones, a characteristic unprecedented in any known animal, living or extinct. Researchers are now re-evaluating theories on ankylosaur evolution, suggesting that early armored dinosaurs might have developed elaborate defenses primarily for display before these structures became co-opted for protection against later, larger predators.

          <p>Denmark's foreign minister has summoned the top US diplomat in the country following a report by Danish public broadcaster DR, alleging that at least three individuals connected to President Trump are conducting covert influence operations in Greenland. These operations reportedly aim to weaken Greenland's relationship with Denmark and support Trump's stated desire to annex the vast, strategically important Arctic territory. Sources suggest efforts include identifying pro and anti-annexation citizens and cultivating contacts with local politicians and businesspeople. Denmark considers any interference in its internal affairs unacceptable, especially given Greenland's critical geopolitical position.</p>

While D.C. police data already showed a downward trend, the White House reports over 1,094 arrests, including gang members, and 115 firearms seized.
