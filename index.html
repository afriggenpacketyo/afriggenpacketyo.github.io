          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that the company has not observed any decrease in consumer demand despite the imposition of tariffs by President Trump. During Amazon's shareholder meeting, Jassy noted that they also haven't seen significant increases in average selling prices. This contrasts with warnings from other retailers, such as Walmart, who anticipate consumers may soon experience price increases due to the tariffs. Trump responded to Walmart urging them to absorb the tariffs rather than pass the cost onto consumers. The situation is ongoing as retailers assess the impact of the tariffs on consumer behavior and pricing strategies.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price reached a new all-time high before experiencing a slight dip due to rising Treasury yields impacting risk assets. The cryptocurrency had been steadily climbing in May, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation data, de-escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have been substantial, and on-chain data suggests reduced selling pressure and increased liquidity in the crypto market. Investors are anticipating regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments to further boost Bitcoin's price, with public companies significantly increasing their Bitcoin holdings this year.

The meeting also addressed trade and tariffs, but the refugee issue took center stage, with Trump claiming a "genocide" against white farmers, a claim not supported by South African police data. Organizations have formed to support Afrikaners seeking resettlement, though some activists prefer Trump address their concerns within South Africa.</p>

          <p>Residents of an Echo Park neighborhood are complaining about the surge of delivery drivers and associated issues since the opening of a ghost kitchen, Echo Park Eats, in 2023. The facility, part of CloudKitchens, houses 26 different food vendors, leading to increased traffic, parking problems, and suspected rise in theft. Councilmember Hugo Soto-MartÃ­nez is exploring solutions, including creating a specific land-use designation for ghost kitchens and implementing geofencing technology to manage driver loitering. Residents worry that geofencing may simply displace the problem to other neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston ruled that the Trump administration violated a previous order by deporting a group of migrants to a third country without allowing them the opportunity to object. The judge, Brian E. Murphy, criticized the administration's actions as "unquestionably violative" and indicated potential criminal contempt penalties. Homeland Security officials disclosed that eight immigrants were deported on a flight to a third country but refused to specify the destination. The flight reportedly landed in Djibouti, raising concerns about the migrants' safety and legal rights.</p>

          <p>President Trump's criticism of South Africa's land seizures from white farmers is juxtaposed with his administration's use of eminent domain to acquire land for the U.S.-Mexico border wall. Trump has accused South Africa of systemic persecution of Afrikaners, while his administration has pursued land acquisitions in Texas, often against the will of landowners. The article highlights the hypocrisy of Trump's stance, noting his past support for eminent domain as a developer and president. It features the story of a Texas farmer who reluctantly agreed to allow the government to build on his land, despite his support for Trump's border security goals.</p>

          <p>The US House of Representatives worked through the night in an attempt to pass President Trump's tax and spending bill, facing dissent from both hard-line Republicans and those seeking larger tax cuts. The bill, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," includes extensions to tax cuts, healthcare cuts, and increased spending on defense and border security. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add $2.3 trillion to the national debt. Trump visited Congress to urge Republicans to support the bill, but opposition remains strong, with the House Freedom Caucus pushing for deeper spending cuts.</p>

The story follows Alfie Byrne, a Wilde disciple who decides to stage "Salome" with his amateur troupe, causing conflict within his community. The musical celebrates the stage and how art lifts the spirits of everyday people, and this modest musical is at its most touching when chronicling the ways art lifts the spirits of everyday people who are blessed with no spectacular gifts yet nevertheless possess the inner lives of theatrical giants.</p>
