          <p>Multiple individuals were shot at the Sky Meadow Country Club in Nashua, New Hampshire, on a Saturday evening, leading to a swift police response. Authorities initially reported two suspects but later confirmed only one shooter, who is now in custody. The incident, which left at least one person critically injured, prompted a temporary shelter-in-place order in nearby Massachusetts towns. The exact circumstances and motive behind the shooting at the private club remain under active investigation by local and state police. American Medical Response is transporting patients to area hospitals.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the nomination of White House aide Lindsey Halligan as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, hours after Erik Siebert's abrupt departure. Siebert reportedly resigned amid pressure from the administration to bring criminal charges against New York Attorney General Letitia James in a mortgage fraud investigation. Halligan, who previously represented Trump in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, is tasked with leading an office in turmoil. This move follows Trump's public statements expressing a desire for Siebert's removal and his belief in a 'great case' against James, who has denied the allegations.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reiterated his intention to regain control of Afghanistan's Bagram Air Base, stating it is strategically important due to its proximity to China's nuclear weapons facilities. This push has sparked swift objections from both Beijing and the Taliban government, who emphasize Afghanistan's sovereignty and regional stability. China's foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, warned against escalating tensions in the region. The move highlights a potential new flashpoint in the ongoing US-China rivalry, with implications for regional peace and the future of Afghanistan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut to 4.00%-4.25% was met with record stock highs, but surprisingly, long-term bond yields and mortgage rates subsequently increased. This inverse reaction is attributed to bond traders 'selling the news' after recent gains, and concerns that the Fed's easing might overlook persistent inflation above its 2% target. Analysts suggest the bond market is signaling caution against aggressive rate cuts when inflation remains elevated and the economy appears stable. Rising long-term yields could impact the costs of mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, potentially hindering economic activity. (not investment advice)</p>

The states argue that ICE detainers are voluntary requests and that complying without judicial warrants raises constitutional concerns and potential liability. This standoff highlights a fundamental disagreement over state sovereignty versus federal immigration authority, with the administration vowing to pursue all available measures.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has reiterated his prediction that by 2030, intelligent robots will largely replace human jobs, leading to a future of 'universal high income' and 'sustainable abundance.' He envisions a society where everyone enjoys the best medical care, food, housing, and transport, with humanoid robots serving personal and industrial needs. Musk argues that a mere universal basic income won't suffice when machines handle most labor, advocating for a far more generous system. Skeptics question the financial and political feasibility of such a radical economic restructuring, especially given current government funding challenges for existing social programs.</p>

          <p>A growing number of university students in the UK are forced to work extensive hours alongside their studies because maintenance loans fail to cover basic living costs. Research indicates that maximum annual loans cover only about half of what freshers need for a 'socially acceptable standard of living.' Students like Tianna Hunkins wear work uniforms to lectures and Faith Webb commutes 1.5 hours daily to save money, often sacrificing academic opportunities and social life. Universities are observing an increase in commuting students and requests for assignment extensions, prompting calls for the government to reintroduce maintenance grants and increase loan amounts with inflation.</p>

Gabbard asserted her actions were directed by President Trump to address 'politicization or weaponization of intelligence.'

Critics accuse the administration of intentionally hindering the ability to measure hunger and assess the impact of its policies, drawing parallels to non-democratic practices.
