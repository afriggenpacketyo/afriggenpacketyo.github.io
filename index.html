            <p>The Trump administration is threatening to ban Harvard University from enrolling foreign students after the institution refused to comply with demands to change hiring, admissions, and teaching practices related to antisemitism on campus. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has requested records on the activities of foreign student visa-holders, citing concerns over "illegal and violent" behavior. Harvard President Alan Garber has stated the university will not surrender its independence or constitutional rights, leading to a potential loss of billions in federal funding and tax exemptions. Trump has intensified his attacks, claiming Harvard can no longer be considered a decent place of learning, as part of a broader crackdown on universities perceived as hostile to conservatives.

            <p>The Texas House has approved a controversial bill that would provide eligible families with public funds, specifically $10,000 per student, to help pay for private school tuition, marking the first time since 1957 that the Texas House has approved legislation making state money available for families to use on their children's private schooling. The bill, which passed after nearly 11 hours of debate, faced strong opposition from Democrats who criticized it as "welfare for the rich" and expressed concerns that it would harm public school districts by diverting funds. Governor Greg Abbott and House Speaker Dustin Burrows praised the bill as a victory for parental choice and an investment in public education. President Trump also voiced his support for the bill, congratulating Abbott, Burrows, and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick for its passage. Optimism score: 55</p>

            <p>President Trump has publicly criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, stating that his "termination cannot come fast enough" and urging him to cut interest rates, particularly after the European Central Bank (ECB) lowered rates. Trump's comments followed Powell's warning about the potential consequences of the Trump administration's trade war, which could lead to stagflation, where economic growth falters while price hikes accelerate. While Powell has defended the Fed's independence, Trump's remarks highlight the ongoing tension between the White House and the central bank over monetary policy. Despite Trump's criticisms, legal experts note that presidents cannot directly fire or demote the Fed chair, whose term extends until May 2026. Optimism score: 35</p>

            <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren has warned that U.S. markets would "crash" if President Trump were to fire Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, emphasizing the importance of the Fed's independence from political influence. Warren, a frequent critic of Powell, acknowledged her disagreements with him on regulations and interest rates, but stressed that the perception of the Fed's autonomy is crucial for maintaining stability in the stock market and the global economy. A senior White House official downplayed Trump's criticism of Powell, stating that there were no plans to end his term early. Powell has previously asserted that the president does not have the power to fire him. Optimism score: 40</p>

            <p>UnitedHealth Group's stock experienced a significant drop of 20% after the company slashed its annual profit forecast due to higher-than-expected medical costs in its Medicare Advantage plans, sparking concerns for other insurers. Analysts suggest these results could be a warning sign for other companies with similar Medicare plans, especially after a turbulent year for health insurers marked by lower government payments and soaring medical expenses. The rise in care utilization, particularly in doctor and outpatient services, has exceeded the company's projections, leading to speculation about the industry's ability to manage costs effectively. UnitedHealth is also reportedly facing government scrutiny regarding its Medicare billing practices, adding to the challenges facing the company. Optimism score: 45</p>

Other European politicians have expressed concerns that Trump might use the meeting to undermine EU unity, but EU officials have welcomed the dialogue.

Officials are reminding golfers and club committees about the proper implementation of the system through social media and e-newsletter campaigns, aiming to ensure that the rules of handicapping are viewed with the same seriousness as the rules of golf.

While ESOP growth has been stagnant due to regulatory complexity and tax issues, there's bipartisan support in Washington, D.C., for updates to federal law governing ESOPs. BDO USA's CEO, Wayne Berson, highlights the firm's decision to transition to an ESOP, resulting in lowered turnover rates and increased engagement among workers.

            <p>A new CDC study indicates that one in 31 children, or more than 3% of kids, have been identified with autism, marking a significant increase in prevalence. While experts acknowledge improved screening and access to autism services as contributing factors, they also note an underlying increase in cases over time. The study found consistently higher autism prevalence among Asian, Black, and Hispanic children compared to White children, potentially due to factors like disparities in preterm birth and lead poisoning. The CDC's report comes as federal spending on autism research has surged, with scientists linking up to 90% of autism to genetic traits, although environmental factors are also suspected to play a role.

            <p>Angel City FC has named Alexander Straus, currently with Bayern Munich, as their new head coach, filling the vacancy since Becki Tweed's departure in December. Straus, who will join the club on June 1, brings a successful track record, having led Bayern to a 54-2-7 record and potentially winning his third straight Frauen-Bundesliga title. The hire marks the first under sporting director Mark Parsons, who emphasized Straus's dominant style of play, winning record, and focus on player development. Angel City is currently unbeaten in four games under interim coach Sam Laity. Optimism score: 85</p>

            <p>The Crucible curse refers to the historical trend that no first-time champion has successfully defended their World Snooker Championship title since the tournament moved to Sheffield's Crucible Theatre in 1977. Nineteen winners have failed to retain their crown, with only two reaching the final in their attempt. Luca Brecel's defence of the trophy ended in the first round in 2024, adding to the mystique surrounding the curse. The Crucible Curse is a quirky and interesting bit of trivia, but does not carry much weight in terms of actual negative consequences. Optimism score: 60</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's most frightening power grab involves seizing the power to arrest individuals and send them to El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center, denying them American legal protections. Trump claims that requesting the return of a prisoner he paid El Salvador to take would violate that country’s sovereignty, an absurd conceit that neither Trump nor Bukele bothered to make plausible. This trapdoor is wide enough to swallow the entire Constitution, enabling Trump to imprison any dissident, judge, journalist, or member of Congress with the cooperation of a foreign strongman. The author argues that this is the most frightening element of his administration’s plan to crush liberal democracy itself. Optimism score: 5</p>
