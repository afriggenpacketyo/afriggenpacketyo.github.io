          <p>Singapore's economy grew 1.4% in the second quarter, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after a contraction in the previous quarter. The growth, which surpassed analysts' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong performance in the manufacturing sector. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry expressed caution, highlighting significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy due to U.S. tariff policies. This economic context has led the country's central bank to loosen monetary policy in response to potential volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article recounts a horrific domestic violence incident where an 11-year-old boy, Jayden Perkins, was stabbed to death while protecting his mother from a violent ex-boyfriend.

          <p>Prosecutors in Colorado are set to dismiss charges against a registered sex offender accused of attempting to kidnap an 11-year-old boy from an elementary school. The decision was made after a mental competency evaluation determined the 33-year-old suspect was unfit to stand trial, leaving the district attorney's office with no legal path to proceed. The incident, which was captured on video, had previously caused significant community fear and led to an administrative overhaul and security enhancements at the school involved.</p>

The announcement comes amid the president's growing frustration with the lack of progress toward peace and follows a recent, temporary pause on some arms shipments to Kyiv due to dwindling U.S. stockpiles.</p>

          <p>A new climate report from the Met Office has concluded that the United Kingdom's weather is now "notably different" from just a few decades ago, with extreme heat and rainfall events becoming the new normal. The country is warming at a rate of approximately 0.25°C per decade, resulting in more frequent heatwaves, fewer frosts, and significantly wetter winters. The report underscores the urgent need for the UK to adapt to the clear and escalating impacts of climate change, including increased risks of flooding and drought.</p>

          <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, a figure admired by many international conservatives, is encountering a significant political challenge from within his own country. A new rival from the center-right, Peter Magyar, has gained considerable support by focusing on domestic issues like corruption and the deteriorating state of public services. While Orbán has long maintained his grip on power by championing nationalist and conservative values, growing public discontent over the economy and governance is creating a more competitive political landscape ahead of the 2026 election.</p>

          <p>A protracted and severe drought in northern Mexico is inflaming a water-sharing dispute with the United States. Under a 1944 treaty, Mexico is required to send a specified amount of water from the Rio Grande to Texas but is currently in significant arrears. The Trump administration has threatened retaliatory measures, while Mexican farmers in the drought-stricken state of Chihuahua argue their reservoirs are critically low and they cannot provide water they do not have, leading to high cross-border tensions over the vital, dwindling resource.</p>

          <p>The White House has defended President Trump's decision to impose a new 50% tariff on Brazil, framing it as part of a comprehensive global strategy to reduce the U.S. trade deficit and onshore production. Economic adviser Kevin Hassett argued the move was necessary for national security, despite the U.S. currently running a trade surplus with Brazil. The justification was met with skepticism, particularly as the president's announcement also referenced the ongoing criminal case against his political ally, former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
