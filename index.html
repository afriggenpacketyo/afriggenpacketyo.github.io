          <p>Tens of thousands of supporters, including former President Trump and Vice President Vance, attended a memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. Many attendees wore merchandise honoring Kirk and carried American flags, forming a line that stretched over a mile. The service featured remarks from various GOP leaders and Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, who was recently named the new CEO of Turning Point USA, the influential youth conservative organization he founded. The large-scale event underscored Kirk's significant impact on the modern conservative movement and his role in mobilizing young voters.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings cornerback Isaiah Rodgers made NFL history during a dominant 48-10 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. In an unprecedented performance, Rodgers became the first player ever to record a pick-six, a fumble-return touchdown, and two forced fumbles all within a single game, accomplishing the feat entirely in the first half. His 87-yard interception return and 66-yard fumble return for touchdowns were pivotal in building the Vikings' insurmountable lead. The game marked a significant defensive showcase for Minnesota and a difficult start for Bengals' backup quarterback Jake Browning, who is filling in for the injured Joe Burrow.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are expected to be part of an investment group aiming to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as likely participants, describing them as "American patriots." The potential deal is a response to a 2024 law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its U.S. arm over national security concerns regarding user data. The White House has suggested a deal is imminent, with Oracle set to manage U.S. data and privacy, and Americans controlling the algorithm.</p>

          <p>At a memorial for Charlie Kirk, Donald Trump Jr. delivered an emotional eulogy, describing the late conservative activist as being "like a little brother" to him. He called for Kirk's supporters to continue his work, leading the crowd in a chant and declaring, "when they took his life a million more Charlie's stepped up to film the void." The event also saw former President Trump and Elon Musk sitting together in a secure suite, marking a notable reunion after a public falling out between the two influential figures earlier in the year. The service highlighted Kirk's status as a martyr figure within the conservative movement.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Reportedly Plans to Announce Potential Link Between Tylenol Use in Pregnancy and Autism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 17:32:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is expected to announce a potential link between the use of Tylenol (acetaminophen) during pregnancy and autism. According to reports, federal health officials may warn pregnant women against using the painkiller unless necessary for a fever, while also highlighting a form of folate as a potential treatment. The announcement, anticipated by President Trump, follows speculation that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would release a report on the matter. Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, has strongly disputed any causal link, stating that decades of scientific research show no credible evidence and that there are few safe alternatives for fever reduction during pregnancy.</p>

          <p>A 64-year-old man, Anibal Hernandez-Santana, has been arrested after allegedly firing multiple shots into the lobby of the ABC10 television station in Sacramento. The incident, which occurred on Friday, resulted in no injuries but caused damage to the building's windows. Sacramento police initially arrested the suspect on state charges, but after he was released on bail, the FBI took him into federal custody for violating a statute related to interference with broadcasting stations. The motive remains under investigation, though the shooting follows recent controversy surrounding ABC's suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after comments about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro has urged Americans to "universally condemn political violence" following the recent killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and a separate deadly shootout in his state. Speaking on NBC's Meet the Press, Shapiro described the nation as being at an "inflection point" and referenced his own experience with political violence, including a firebombing at the governor's mansion in April. He emphasized the legal distinction between protected, albeit hateful, political speech and illicit incitement to violence. Shapiro called for a focus on shared values and healing to counter the divisive and dangerous political climate.</p>

Later, in the ninth inning, he made a leaping grab at the fence to rob Francisco Álvarez of a potential game-tying home run. The loss was a significant blow to the Mets' playoff hopes, dropping them into a tie with the Cincinnati Reds for the final NL wildcard spot.</p>

Similarly, the Cleveland Browns rallied to beat the Green Bay Packers 13-10 after blocking a last-minute field goal attempt, setting up their own game-winning kick.

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary, Heidi Alexander, has officially approved a £2.2 billion project to build a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport. The plan involves converting the airport's existing northern runway, currently used for taxiing, into a fully operational runway for regular use, which could significantly increase flight capacity. The government and airport officials champion the privately-financed project as a major opportunity for economic growth and job creation. However, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups and local campaigners concerned about increased noise, traffic, and climate impacts, arguing it contradicts the UK's legally binding climate commitments.</p>

          <p>Protests have erupted across all 26 states of Brazil against legislative efforts that could pardon former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies convicted of attempting a coup. The demonstrations were sparked by a fast-tracked bill in the lower house that could grant amnesty to those involved in the January 2023 uprising, which included a plot to overthrow the government. Bolsonaro was recently sentenced to over 27 years in prison for his role. Prominent cultural figures, including music legends Caetano Veloso and Chico Buarque, joined the protests, arguing that the proposed laws undermine democracy and shield politicians from accountability.</p>

          <p>Iranian labor rights activist Sharifeh Mohammadi is facing execution after the country's Supreme Court upheld a death sentence against her for the third time. Accused of "armed rebellion against the state," Mohammadi was arrested in December 2023 for her work with a committee supporting labor organizations, which the government deems an "opposition group." Human rights organizations have condemned the proceedings as a politically motivated trial with serious procedural flaws, noting that she has no connection to armed actions. Her case has drawn fierce international criticism and growing condemnation within Iran, with unions and activists calling for her immediate release.</p>

          <p>Mandy Damari, the mother of a British-Israeli hostage who was held by Hamas for 15 months, has accused the UK government of "rewarding" the militant group by formally recognizing a Palestinian state. Damari argued that the decision is inappropriate while hostages remain in captivity, the war is ongoing, and Hamas retains power in Gaza, calling Prime Minister Keir Starmer's belief in a two-state solution a "delusion." Her daughter, Emily, was released in January after being kidnapped during the October 7, 2023 attack. The criticism reflects the sentiment of some hostage families who feel the diplomatic move emboldens Hamas rather than promoting peace.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris managed to gain only six points on his championship-leading teammate Oscar Piastri at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, a weekend where Piastri uncharacteristically struggled. Piastri crashed in qualifying and again early in the race, failing to finish. Norris, however, could only manage a seventh-place finish, a result he attributed to a difficult qualifying session where he also made an error. While Norris felt he maximized his race potential from his starting position, the weekend is viewed as a missed opportunity to significantly close the gap in the title race, with Red Bull's Max Verstappen taking a dominant victory.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice under the Trump administration reportedly shut down a public corruption investigation into Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar." According to sources, the probe involved an FBI sting operation where Homan was allegedly recorded accepting $50,000 in cash from undercover agents posing as executives seeking future government contracts. The investigation, which began under the previous administration, was closed after internal discussions about the legal viability of the case. In a statement, administration officials confirmed the probe was reviewed and closed after finding "no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing," while critics raised concerns about political interference.</p>

          <p>Gary Cohn, former National Economic Council director and current IBM vice chair, stated that the U.S. job market has degraded, citing a slowdown in job creation from over 100,000 to less than 50,000 per month. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Cohn explained that companies, facing rising input costs, are cutting back on labor expenses to protect their margins, shifting from hoarding labor post-COVID to aggressively managing human capital. He suggested this trend is occurring across all business sectors, not just tech, and that the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut reflects an acknowledgment of this cooling labor market.

          <p>President Trump appeared to dismiss concerns over new Pentagon restrictions that severely limit journalists' ability to report on U.S. military matters. When asked if the Pentagon should control what reporters can cover, Trump responded, "No, I don't think so," adding, "Nothing stops reporters." The new directive from the Department of War, led by appointee Pete Hegseth, requires journalists to pledge not to gather any information not officially authorized for release. Press freedom advocates have condemned the policy as a direct assault on independent journalism and a form of prior restraint on publication, which violates First Amendment principles.</p>

          <p>London's Mayor, Sadiq Khan, has initiated a one-day trial banning vehicle traffic from a section of Oxford Street, describing it as the day "the fight back began to rescue this street." The long-term goal is to permanently pedestrianize the stretch between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch to increase footfall and improve the shopping experience. The proposal has been met with mixed reactions; while many pedestrians welcomed the car-free environment, some local groups and councillors have raised concerns about traffic being diverted to smaller side streets and potential accessibility issues for people with mobility challenges. A formal consultation on the detailed plans is expected later this year.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has strongly criticized Charles Kushner, the U.S. Ambassador to France, for publicly accusing his government of not doing enough to combat antisemitism. Macron called Kushner's published letter an "unacceptable statement for somebody who is supposed to be a diplomat," stating that it was a misuse of taxpayer money and a breach of diplomatic protocol. Kushner had linked France's foreign policy, including gestures toward recognizing a Palestinian state, to a rise in violence against Jews.

          <p>A cyber-attack targeting a widely used check-in and baggage system has caused significant disruption at several major European airports, including Heathrow, Brussels, and Berlin. The attack on the Muse software, owned by RTX's Collins Aerospace, forced airports to resort to manual, paper-based check-ins, leading to long queues and hundreds of flight delays. Brussels Airport has asked airlines to cancel half of their departing flights for Monday, as there is no clear timeline for when a secure version of the system will be restored. The incident highlights the vulnerability of the aviation industry to failures in critical, interconnected digital systems.</p>
