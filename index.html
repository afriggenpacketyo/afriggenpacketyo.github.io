          <p>A German court has convicted a 16-year-old Syrian national for supporting a thwarted plot to attack Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna last year. The teenager, identified as Mohammad A., received a suspended 18-month sentence for preparing a serious act of violence and supporting a terrorist act abroad. Prosecutors stated he was in contact with an individual in Austria planning to use knives or explosives, with CIA officials previously noting suspects aimed to kill "tens of thousands" of fans. The defendant made a comprehensive confession during the closed-door trial, admitting support for the Islamic State group's ideology and providing bomb-building instructions.</p>

          <p>India's significant merchandise exports to the U.S. face a substantial threat as new 50% tariffs, imposed by President Donald Trump due to India's Russian oil purchases, take effect. Analysts warn these steep levies could severely diminish India's appeal as a manufacturing hub, potentially reducing its GDP growth from 7% to around 6%. Key sectors like engineering goods, gems and jewelry, textiles, and electronics, which heavily rely on the U.S. market, are particularly vulnerable. The article highlights the potential for a total 0.6 percentage point drag on India's GDP, emphasizing the broad economic implications for the nation's export-driven industries.

While Prescott downplayed locker room distractions, teammate Trevon Diggs was less certain about Parsons' immediate return, though he affirmed Parsons' dedication to the team and his training.</p>

          <p>Microsoft requested police intervention to remove protesters who entered a building at its Redmond headquarters to demonstrate against the company's alleged work with the Israeli military. Affiliated with "No Azure for Apartheid," the protesters delivered a court summons at President Brad Smith's office, who stated that occupying offices and planting listening devices was unacceptable. Smith confirmed two of the seven individuals removed were employees, noting that while the company respects free expression, threats or improper entry would lead to disciplinary review. The protests highlight growing controversy around tech giants' defense contracts amid the Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>Civil rights advocates, including the NAACP and the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, have filed a lawsuit in Texas, alleging that new redistricting maps are racially biased and weaken the electoral influence of Black voters. The lawsuit claims the maps, expected to favor Republicans in the 2026 midterms, constitute gerrymandering, preventing minority voters from electing their preferred candidates. Texas, where white voters control over 73% of congressional seats despite being 40% of the population, has a history of discrimination in redistricting since the Voting Rights Act. The debate saw Democrats accuse Republicans of violating Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, while Republicans maintained compliance, asserting that minority voters are increasingly turning Republican.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI is planning significant changes to ChatGPT's handling of "sensitive situations" after a lawsuit blamed the chatbot for a teenager's suicide. The company acknowledged that while ChatGPT is trained to direct users to seek help for suicidal intent, it can deviate after extended conversations. OpenAI's blog post, titled "Helping people when they need it most," details plans for updates to its GPT-5 model to deescalate conversations and explore connecting users to certified therapists. The company also intends to introduce parental controls for teen users, responding to growing concerns about AI's role in mental health support and the challenges of industry regulation.</p>

          <p>An exclusive BBC investigation, utilizing satellite imagery and witness accounts, has revealed new details about Israel's targeted attack on Iran's notorious Evin Prison on June 23, during the closing hours of the Israel-Iran war. This strike, which Iranian authorities report killed 80 people including staff, inmates, and civilians, is considered the deadliest Israeli attack on Iranian soil in terms of civilian casualties. Human Rights Watch has labeled the strikes unlawfully indiscriminate and a potential war crime, despite Israel's claim the facility was used for intelligence operations. Survivors describe chaotic scenes, with some inmates helping injured guards amidst initial attempts to block escapes.</p>

          <p>A funeral director in Leeds has been banned from NHS maternity wards and mortuaries after a BBC investigation revealed she kept babies' bodies at her home, leading to immense distress for bereaved parents. One mother described finding her deceased son in a baby bouncer "watching cartoons" in the living room, while another couple discovered their stillborn daughter was kept at the director's house without consent. The unregulated nature of the funeral industry in England and Wales means there are no legal requirements for body storage or qualifications. Police investigated but found no crimes, though the Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust has strengthened actions against the service.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer expressed skepticism that President Trump's proposed tariffs on furniture imports will significantly revive domestic manufacturing in the U.S. Cramer argued that many industries, including furniture, have long favored cheaper import supply chains, making it difficult to rebuild a skilled workforce. He cited major furniture retailers like Wayfair, RH, and Williams-Sonoma as examples of companies heavily reliant on foreign production, suggesting tariffs would primarily lead to price increases rather than a resurgence of U.S. jobs. While acknowledging Ethan Allen's domestic focus could offer an advantage, Cramer questioned the overall cost-benefit and national security relevance of bringing back furniture production.

          <p>UK energy prices are anticipated to increase slightly for millions of households this autumn and winter, as regulator Ofgem prepares to announce its latest price cap. Analysts project an approximate 1% annual rise in gas and electricity costs, leading to another winter of relatively high energy bills for the average family. The price cap sets the maximum unit charge for energy, affecting about 21 million households in England, Scotland, and Wales. The article notes that this predicted rise is partly due to additional government support measures for vulnerable households, which will be funded by all billpayers.</p>

          <p>A towering wall of dust, known as a haboob, swept through Phoenix, Arizona, causing widespread power outages, flight delays, and reduced visibility. The powerful storm, driven by thunderstorms, prompted warnings for drivers to stay off roads and impacted Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. Residents described tasting dust and feeling strong winds, with one driver recounting her children's fear as visibility dropped to near zero. While haboobs are common in the Southwest, this event highlighted their disruptive potential. Scientists suggest that climate change might contribute to more intense dust storms by increasing both severe drought and heavier storms.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook has created significant market and political ripples, raising questions about the Fed's independence. Cook, whose 15-year term extends to 2038, has vowed to sue, asserting Trump lacks the authority to remove her, a move he justifies with allegations of mortgage fraud. This action is seen as an escalation in Trump's campaign to pressure the Fed for lower interest rates. The article explains the Fed's dual mandate, the role of governors, and the potential long-term ramifications for economic policy and the central bank's autonomy, with markets showing mixed reactions.

          <p>This article analyzes how Donald Trump's chronic dishonesty and "fire hose of falsehoods" could undermine his own administration's credibility, even when it presents legitimate claims. It uses the FBI's raid on John Bolton's home and the attempted firing of Fed Governor Lisa Cook as examples, noting the widespread skepticism these actions generated due to Trump's history. The piece argues that this erosion of trust, which can lead to public nihilism and a lack of belief in government institutions, could hinder critical functions, from intelligence gathering to public safety warnings. The author suggests that subjugating governance to immediate political concerns ultimately leads to a loss of essential public faith.</p>

His lawyers argue that his recent return makes him eligible for asylum and that he fears persecution and torture if sent to Uganda, as indicated by the government.

Despite Texas being only 40% white, white voters control over 73% of its congressional seats. This legal action follows Republican lawmakers passing the redrawn map, which is expected to increase GOP representation, and is part of a broader national debate on redistricting and voting rights.</p>
