          <h2>Infected Blood Scandal Victims Face Further Harm from Compensation Delays, Inquiry Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 07:48:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The chair of the public inquiry into the UK's infected blood scandal stated that thousands of victims are being “harmed further” by significant delays and “obvious injustices” in the government's compensation scheme. An estimated 30,000 people were infected with HIV and hepatitis from contaminated NHS blood products in the 1970s and 80s. Despite a £11.8 billion fund, only 460 people have received full compensation so far, prompting criticism that the government is failing to provide a fair and fast settlement for the aging and ill victims.</p>

          <p>An Iranian mother who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years was released from ICE detention following advocacy from House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. Mandonna Kashanian, 64, was detained in her New Orleans yard shortly after the U.S. conducted bombing raids in Iran, despite having no criminal record and regularly checking in with immigration authorities for decades. Her release was spurred by significant community support, but her long-term legal status remains uncertain as she reapplies for asylum. The Department of Homeland Security maintains that she is in the country illegally.</p>

          <p>A tentative agreement has been reached between the City of Philadelphia and the union representing nearly 10,000 blue-collar employees, ending a more than weeklong strike. The work stoppage, which began on July 1, had halted residential trash pickup and closed most city libraries and pools. The new three-year contract, which must be ratified by union members, will result in a 14% pay increase over four years, addressing the union's demands for better pay and benefits.</p>

The shift is attributed to a combination of factors such as persistent economic inequality, extreme political polarization fueled by social media, and the use of legal systems for political ends, known as "lawfare." The article argues that progressive governments have struggled to address these deep-seated issues, creating an opening for right-wing, "anti-politician" figures to gain power.</p>

          <p>State records reveal that inspectors from the Texas Department of State Health Services signed off on Camp Mystic's emergency plans just two days before a catastrophic flood killed 27 campers and staff. The July 2 inspection report found the youth camp to be in compliance with regulations, noting that disaster plans were in place and staff had been briefed on them. This revelation raises serious questions about the adequacy of the camp's preparations and the state's oversight process in the face of such a devastating and foreseeable tragedy.</p>

          <p>A tragic midair collision involving two Cessna planes has resulted in the deaths of two student pilots from the Harv's Air pilot training school in Manitoba, Canada.

In a move to rebalance its portfolio amidst global uncertainty, the firm also conducted its largest divestment in over two decades, selling off SG$42 billion in assets while investing SG$52 billion.

The $9 charge for vehicles entering lower Manhattan has cut traffic delays by 25% and boosted subway ridership. Despite these tangible benefits and growing public support, the program continues to face determined opposition and legal challenges from the Trump administration, which seeks to dismantle it.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the recent deadly Texas floods and Los Angeles wildfires reveals that communities are dangerously ill-prepared for worsening climate disasters, even when advance warnings are issued. In both catastrophic events, clear alerts from the National Weather Service about life-threatening conditions failed to trigger sufficiently urgent and effective local responses, such as pre-deploying firefighters or issuing timely evacuation orders. These tragedies highlight a systemic failure to translate meteorological forecasts into life-saving action on the ground, prompting calls for major reforms.</p>
