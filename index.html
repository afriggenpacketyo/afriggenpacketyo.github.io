          <p>Singapore's Changi Airport has begun construction on its fifth terminal, expected to be operational in the mid-2030s, as Asia prepares for a travel boom. The new terminal will nearly double the airport's existing area, increasing its capacity to handle 140 million passengers annually. Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong highlighted that the expansion will connect Changi with 200 cities, up from the current 170, boosting industries like tourism, aerospace, and logistics, which contribute 5% of Singapore's GDP. Airport Council International projects nearly 7% air travel growth over the next 25 years, driving extensive airport development in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East.</p>

          <p>A manuscript acquired by Harvard Law School in 1946 for just $27.50, once believed to be an unofficial copy of the Magna Carta, has been identified as a genuine original from 1300. UK academics, Professors David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent, authenticated the document after seeing digitized images of it on Harvard's website. They believe it originates from Appleby, Cumbria, and traces back to the Lowther family and abolitionist Thomas Clarkson. The document is now considered one of the world's most valuable, with similar originals fetching millions at auction.</p>

          <p>Two British academics have determined that a manuscript held in Harvard Law School's library for 80 years is an original 1300 version of the Magna Carta, one of only seven such documents still in existence. The manuscript, purchased for $27.50 after World War II, was confirmed as authentic through ultraviolet photography and spectral imaging. The professors, David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent, compared it to six other known originals, verifying its text, dimensions, and handwriting. The discovery is considered timely, given Harvard's recent challenges, as the Magna Carta symbolizes the rule of law and protection against unjust rule.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Eurovision Song Contest winners since 2000 reveals key strategies for success, including singing about personal liberation and self-empowerment. The article suggests that entries should allude to folk music without being purely folk, and advises against dramatic key changes, a once-essential element. The piece emphasizes the importance of staging and pyrotechnics, but warns against novelty acts that are too silly. Singing in English is also a key factor for success, as demonstrated by the data collected in the article.</p>

          <p>During Karen Read's murder trial, a Massachusetts State Police Crime Lab expert testified that blood evidence collected in red Solo cups was never tested in the death of John O'Keefe. The expert, Maureen Hartnett, found broken glass, scratches, and a dent on Read's SUV, as well as blood and debris from O'Keefe's clothes, but the substance in the cups was never identified as blood. A retired NYPD investigator suggested that testing the evidence could provide crucial context, especially if it matched someone else at the scene. The article also notes police handling of evidence has faced scrutiny throughout the trial.</p>

          <p>Japan's antitrust watchdog has released draft guidelines to regulate smartphone software services by Google and Apple, seeking to foster competition among smaller firms. The new law, effective in December, prohibits the tech giants from blocking competitors' access to their app stores and from using app store data for their own products. The law also aims to prevent unfair treatment of software suppliers during app transitions between stores. The commission hopes that promoting competition will lower prices and improve access to convenient apps for consumers.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing major legislation to enact President Trumpâ€™s agenda, approving cuts to taxes, Medicaid, and food assistance after extensive debates. The legislation aims to extend Trumpâ€™s 2017 tax cuts and enact pledges not to tax tips or overtime pay, offset by cuts to social programs. Despite committee approvals, Republican leaders face dissent within their party over the scope of Medicaid cuts and the state and local tax deduction. The plan also faces opposition in the Senate, creating uncertainty for its passage.</p>

The yacht's single mast, one of the tallest in the world, increased its vulnerability to capsizing. Experts questioned the boat's stability, noting its high center of gravity.</p>
