          <p>Tesla's board of directors has introduced a highly ambitious pay package for CEO Elon Musk, potentially valued at over $1 trillion, which would be contingent on the company achieving extremely aggressive growth targets over the next decade. The proposal requires Tesla's market capitalization to reach at least $8.5 trillion by 2035, a significant increase from its current valuation. This move is intended to secure Musk's long-term commitment to the company and steer its focus towards AI and robotics. However, the plan has sparked debate among analysts regarding corporate governance and its unprecedented scale. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant fire occurred at the BBC's former headquarters, the Television Centre in west London, prompting a large-scale response from the London Fire Brigade with approximately 100 firefighters and 15 engines. The blaze originated in a restaurant within the nine-story building, which now contains apartments, television studios, and commercial spaces. While there have been no reported casualties, authorities evacuated an unspecified number of homes as a precautionary measure. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation, and nearby roads have been closed as the incident remains ongoing.</p>

          <p>Scotland secured a valuable point in their World Cup qualification campaign with a hard-fought draw against Denmark in Copenhagen, a result praised as a solid and promising start. Manager Steve Clarke's team demonstrated significant work-rate and defensive resolve, with standout performances from players like Grant Hanley and Aaron Hickey. This result puts pressure on Denmark, a key rival in the group, and provides Scotland with a hopeful foundation for their upcoming matches. The performance is seen as a positive turn after previous disappointing qualification campaigns and recent poor form.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, Colombian goalkeeper René Higuita performed his legendary 'scorpion kick' save during a friendly match against England at Wembley Stadium, cementing his place in football history. The audacious maneuver, where he cleared the ball by kicking it over his own head with his heels, stunned spectators and has become an iconic moment. The article reflects on Higuita's flamboyant and risk-taking style, which earned him the nickname 'El Loco' (The Madman). His career was also marked by scoring 43 goals, pioneering the 'sweeper-keeper' role, and a controversial off-field life, including a prison sentence.</p>

          <p>The Durham City Council has unanimously passed a resolution declaring the city a "Fourth Amendment Workplace," aimed at protecting undocumented immigrant workers from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) actions. The measure instructs city staff to uphold the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, requiring warrants for federal agents to access non-public city workspaces. This resolution follows a recent incident involving ICE agents at the Durham County Courthouse that caused fear in the community.

Chicago's police superintendent and Illinois' governor have questioned the legality and effectiveness of such a deployment, arguing that troops lack police powers.

          <h2>Scientific Community Responds to Speculation Over Tylenol's Link to Autism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reports that the U.S. Health Secretary may announce a potential link between Tylenol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy and autism have drawn responses from medical experts and the drug's manufacturer. The Department of Health and Human Services has called the reports 'speculation' ahead of its official findings. Medical groups like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists state there is no clear evidence of a direct relationship, emphasizing that the causes of neurodevelopmental disorders are complex. Researchers note that studies on the topic have yielded conflicting results, making it difficult to separate the medication's effect from the underlying maternal health condition requiring treatment.</p>

          <p>China is actively engaging in party-to-party diplomacy, a key component of its foreign policy strategy, as demonstrated by President Xi Jinping's recent meetings with leaders from the world's other remaining communist countries. This diplomatic channel is managed by the Communist Party's International Department, which has established connections with hundreds of political parties globally. While distinct from state-level relations, these interactions serve to build political trust and advance Beijing's strategic interests. This approach has been increasingly used to enhance engagement not only with fellow communist states but also with parties in other regions, such as the Middle East.</p>

          <p>An immigration raid at a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia resulted in the arrest of 475 workers, mostly South Korean citizens, who were found to be working illegally in violation of their visitor visas. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) stated the operation was part of an ongoing criminal investigation and necessary to protect American jobs. The raid has prompted a diplomatic response from South Korea, which has significant investments in U.S. industries. Hyundai and its partner LG Energy Solution clarified that the arrested individuals were not their direct employees but worked for partner companies.</p>

          <p>A fast-moving brush fire, named the Pyrite fire, ignited near Jurupa Valley in California's Inland Empire, quickly growing to 200 acres and forcing evacuation orders for nearby communities. The fire was reported on Friday evening and burned through light, dry vegetation, prompting a response from nearly 300 firefighting personnel, including ground crews and helicopters. An evacuation center has been established for displaced residents. As the fire moved toward the San Bernardino County line, authorities closed roads to allow emergency access but assured residents in the adjacent city of Fontana that they were not immediately threatened.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, dropped sharply following a report that an upcoming U.S. government study will suggest a potential link between the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and autism. In response, Kenvue asserted its belief that there is no causal link and that the product is safe, a position supported by the FDA and other medical organizations. The Department of Health and Human Services stated that any claims about the report's contents are 'speculation' until its official release. This development occurs as Kenvue already faces numerous lawsuits alleging a connection between the popular pain reliever and neurodevelopmental disorders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NeueHouse, a members-only co-working club with locations in Los Angeles and New York, suddenly ceased operations, citing severe financial challenges. The company announced the closures on its website, giving members and employees less than 48 hours' notice to collect their belongings. The shutdown has left members, some of whom had recently paid thousands of dollars in annual fees, feeling blindsided and angry. Employees were also reportedly let go without severance pay. NeueHouse, which aimed to blend shared office space with the exclusive amenities of a social club, is the latest casualty in the struggling co-working industry.</p>

          <p>For the second time in two days, Venezuelan military aircraft have flown in close proximity to a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Jason Dunham, in international waters. Pentagon officials described the actions as a 'game of chicken' and a 'highly provocative move' intended to interfere with U.S. counter-narcotics operations in the region. The F-16 fighter jets were within weapons range of the American warship, but the destroyer did not engage. The incident escalates tensions between the two nations, following President Trump's recent warning to Venezuela regarding such actions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Chinese yuan has experienced a recent rally, a move that analysts attribute primarily to stronger guidance and intervention from China's central bank rather than natural market forces. This strengthening occurred even as the U.S. dollar index remained relatively stable, suggesting a deliberate policy decision by Beijing. However, this period of appreciation is expected to be carefully managed, as a significantly stronger yuan could negatively impact the competitiveness of Chinese exports. The central bank's actions highlight its continued tight control over the currency's value amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>
