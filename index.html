          <p>General Motors exceeded Wall Street's expectations for the first quarter but is currently reassessing its full-year financial guidance due to potential cost increases and uncertainties surrounding ongoing auto tariffs initiated by Donald Trump. The company is suspending additional stock buybacks until there is more clarity on the economic and regulatory environments. While GM believes it can offset a portion of the North American tariffs, significant changes to manufacturing plans will be deferred until there is greater certainty. The company's first-quarter results showed a decrease in profit margins compared to the previous year, citing negative impacts from foreign exchange rates and increased labor and warranty expenses.</p>

          <p>President Trump has made progress on some of his 2024 campaign promises during the first 100 days of his second term, primarily through executive orders. He has granted clemency to individuals convicted of crimes related to the January 6th riot and released government documents related to the JFK assassination. However, promises such as ending the Russia-Ukraine war and making IVF free have not yet been fulfilled, and some initiatives like banning TikTok have faced delays. The administration has also aggressively pursued deportations and imposed tariffs on countries perceived to have unfair trade practices with the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a record number of 142 executive orders during the first 100 days of his second term, surpassing previous records held by other presidents. The administration defends this heavy reliance on executive actions as necessary to deliver on campaign promises quickly amid congressional gridlock. However, many of these orders have triggered controversy and legal challenges from Democratic groups, federal workers' unions, and immigration advocacy groups. Critics argue that this approach sidelines legislative oversight and expands executive power.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk, leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has played a significant role in the Trump administration's efforts to cut government spending and reduce the federal workforce.

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring ways to encourage Americans to marry and have more children, including proposals like a lump-sum "baby bonus." Trump has expressed support for the idea of a $5,000 payment to mothers after giving birth. Baby bonuses, which are used in countries around the world, could provide financial relief to new parents during a period of reduced working hours and increased expenses. However, critics view these discussions as a distraction from the administration's broader agenda, which includes potential cuts to social safety nets and a focus on traditional gender roles.</p>

          <p>Neil Gorsuch's long-held belief in limiting executive power may be the key to saving America from President Trump's chaotic policies. Gorsuch, along with other conservative justices, has championed the "major questions doctrine," which allows the Supreme Court to strike down executive actions deemed too ambitious. This doctrine could be used to challenge Trump's tariffs and other policies. While the Court has been deferential to Trump in some cases, the justices may prioritize traditional conservative principles over loyalty to the president.</p>
