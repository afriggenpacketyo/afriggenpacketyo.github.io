            <p>Japan's Prime Minister Ishiba sent an offering to the Yasukuni Shrine, which is linked to war. The shrine honors war dead, including convicted war criminals, making it a controversial symbol, particularly in relations with China and South Korea. This act could strain diplomatic ties, as neighboring countries often view such gestures as a lack of remorse for Japan's wartime past. The move comes amid ongoing tensions in the region, adding another layer of complexity to international relations.</p>

            <p>Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating a 30-hour Easter truce announced by Vladimir Putin, with both sides reporting attacks and shelling. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russian troops violated the ceasefire over 2,000 times, while Russia's defense ministry claimed to have repelled Ukrainian assaults. Despite the announced truce, both sides continue to engage in military actions, reflecting the deep-seated conflict and lack of trust between the two nations.

The deputy commander of the unit involved was dismissed for providing an incomplete and inaccurate report, while another officer will receive a reprimand.

            <p>Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee warned that President Trump's tariffs could lead to an "artificially high" start to economic activity followed by a summer drop-off. Businesses are already stockpiling inventory and consumers are accelerating purchases in anticipation of the tariffs. Goolsbee suggested this preemptive buying could inflate economic activity in the short term but lead to a slowdown in the coming months. Sectors like the auto industry, heavily reliant on imported components, are particularly vulnerable to these effects.</p>

            <p>Chinese airlines have started returning Boeing aircraft to the U.S., with a 737 Max landing back in Seattle, following China's order to halt further deliveries of Boeing planes. This move is linked to the U.S. imposing 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, escalating trade tensions between the two countries. The halt in deliveries could significantly impact Boeing, a major U.S. exporter, which has been aiming to expand its presence in the Chinese market. The trade war is disrupting airline operations and potentially damaging Boeing's business in China.</p>
