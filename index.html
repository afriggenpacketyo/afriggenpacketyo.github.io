          <p>Top administration officials have clarified that the U.S. will impose previously announced tariffs on trading partners who fail to secure a deal by an August 1 deadline. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett stated that while some deals are being finalized, letters are being sent to countries where progress is deemed insufficient. The administration asserts that this aggressive trade strategy and the threat of tariffs are successfully incentivizing companies to move their operations and create jobs within the United States.

          <p>Catastrophic flash flooding in central Texas has resulted in the deaths of at least 70 people, including many children, prompting a major disaster declaration for the region. The Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes, inundating communities and a summer camp, from which several campers are still missing. Federal and state emergency responders, including the U.S. Coast Guard, are engaged in extensive search and rescue operations, desperately searching for survivors amid the widespread devastation.</p>

          <p>At a summit in Rio de Janeiro, leaders of the expanding BRICS group of nations called for strengthening multilateral diplomacy, with Brazilian President Lula da Silva criticizing what he called the "unparalleled collapse of multilateralism." The summit was notable for the physical absence of China's President Xi Jinping and Russia's President Vladimir Putin, who participated via video. Putin used his address to claim the model of liberal globalization is becoming obsolete as global economic power shifts toward emerging markets.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees captain Aaron Judge suffered a minor injury, receiving a small cut near his eye after being hit by an errant warm-up throw from a teammate. The incident compounded a difficult period for the team, occurring during their sixth consecutive loss, a 12-6 defeat to the New York Mets. This marks the first time since the 2000 season that the Yankees have experienced two separate six-game losing streaks within the same year.</p>

          <p>A significant malfunction in Wimbledon's new electronic line-calling system caused controversy during a fourth-round match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal. The automated system failed to call a ball out on a crucial point, forcing the umpire to replay it, which Pavlyuchenkova argued cost her the game. Despite her frustration and the fact she ultimately won the match, the incident has raised questions about the reliability of removing human line judges in favor of the new technology.</p>

          <p>President Trump's signature domestic policy legislation, the "One Big Beautiful Bill," has ignited a fierce debate over its economic consequences. The White House projects the bill's tax cuts and spending plan will stimulate enough economic growth to reduce the federal deficit. However, critics, including Democrats and non-partisan budget analysts, warn that the legislation will add trillions to the national debt, fuel inflation, and potentially cause millions of Americans to lose their health insurance coverage.</p>

          <p>According to an article in the official PLA Daily, Chinese military experts are advocating for structural reforms within the People's Liberation Army to better address the threat of drones in modern combat. Citing the crucial role of unmanned aircraft in recent conflicts like the war in Ukraine, the experts suggest the likely formation of specialized counter-drone units capable of rapid response. This reflects a long-term strategic adjustment to integrate more advanced and dedicated anti-drone capabilities into China's armed forces.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed documentary filmmaker Ken Burns has labeled recent White House-led efforts to cut federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as "shortsighted" and "foolhardy." Burns, whose work has been a staple of PBS for decades, defended public media as a vital American institution, particularly for rural areas that rely on its educational, safety, and cultural programming. He argued that eliminating funding for the system would be a profound loss and that he could not have produced his long-form documentaries anywhere else.</p>

          <p>The European Union is confronting a critical deadline to avoid significant U.S. tariffs, revealing internal divisions on the best path forward. Some member states, like Germany, are pushing for a swift agreement to prevent a trade war, while others, such as France, advocate holding out for a more balanced deal. With the prospect of a comprehensive agreement fading, Brussels is now reportedly aiming for a less-detailed framework deal to extend negotiations and mitigate the immediate economic impact of the threatened tariffs.</p>

          <p>In a harrowing first-person account, an NPR producer in Gaza describes the life-threatening ordeal of obtaining food from a new distribution site, which the UN has called a "death trap." The report details a journey through Israeli military fire, confrontations with armed private contractors, and violent crowds fighting over rations, only to be robbed by masked thieves. The story paints a grim picture of widespread hunger and a complete breakdown of law and order, where the daily quest for food is a gamble with death.</p>

          <p>A significant archaeological discovery has been made in Peru with the uncovering of Peñico, a 3,500-year-old city believed to have been a crucial trading hub for early American civilizations. Located north of Lima, the site contains ceremonial temples and residential complexes, and likely served as a connection point between coastal, mountain, and Amazon basin societies. Researchers say the discovery provides important insights into the societies that emerged after the decline of the Caral, the oldest known civilization in the Americas.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis argues that the conflict in Gaza is causing a fundamental breakdown of the post-WWII international order, eroding established principles from the laws of armed conflict to free speech protections in Western democracies. The article suggests that the lack of international resolve to hold Israel accountable has shifted the boundaries of acceptable state conduct, normalizing policies like the use of mass starvation as a weapon. This collapse of legal and political norms is seen as having profound and dangerous implications globally.</p>

According to a leader from the China General Chamber of Commerce, U.S. city leaders remain receptive to Chinese-funded projects, especially in the manufacturing sector, to help stimulate their local economies. This local-level openness persists even as geopolitical risks make potential Chinese investors more cautious about entering the U.S. market. (not investment advice)</p>
