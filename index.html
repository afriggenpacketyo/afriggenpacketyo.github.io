          <p>A shooting at a Lexington, Kentucky church resulted in the deaths of two worshippers and the suspect. The incident began after the suspect shot and wounded a state trooper during a traffic stop near the local airport. The gunman then fled to the Richmond Road Baptist Church, where he killed two individuals and wounded two others before being fatally shot by police. Officials suggest the shooter may have had a connection to the victims at the church.</p>

          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino declared the revamped Club World Cup a major financial success, reporting over $2 billion in revenue. The tournament's final, which saw Chelsea defeat Paris Saint-Germain, highlighted the financial benefits for top clubs, with FIFA also promising a solidarity payment to clubs worldwide. However, the event faced criticism from figures like Jürgen Klopp over player exhaustion, which was intensified by extreme heat during matches. The tournament also underscored the growing relationship between Infantino and former President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Chelsea secured the inaugural 32-team Club World Cup title with a decisive victory against Paris Saint-Germain. Attacking midfielder Cole Palmer was the star, scoring two nearly identical goals and assisting a third before halftime. Despite PSG's efforts in the second half, they were unable to overcome the early deficit created by Chelsea's clinical and well-executed game plan. The match concluded with a red card for PSG's João Neves after a scuffle on the pitch.</p>

          <p>A year after the assassination attempt on Donald Trump, Senator Rand Paul suggested the shooter's motive may never be fully understood. In an interview, Paul, who chairs a key Senate committee, stated he believes investigators have done their best but have not found a clear motive. His committee's report heavily criticized the Secret Service for what it termed "inexcusable negligence" and systemic failures that allowed the attack to occur. The report highlighted how the gunman was spotted hours before the shooting and that warnings from the crowd were not acted upon quickly enough.</p>

          <p>A 57-year-old Mexican farmworker, Jaime Alanis, has died from injuries sustained after falling from a greenhouse roof during an immigration raid in California. The incident occurred as ICE agents swept through two large cannabis farms, arresting around 200 people. President Trump's "border czar," Tom Homan, called the death "unfortunate" but defended the agents, stating they were doing their job and that Alanis was not in their custody when he fell. The raid and resulting death have drawn scrutiny amid the administration's intensified immigration enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>A Senate committee report reveals that the U.S. Secret Service denied or failed to fulfill at least ten requests for additional security resources for Donald Trump's 2024 campaign prior to the assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania. The report accuses the agency of "inexcusable negligence" and communication breakdowns, and states that then-Director Kimberly Cheatle falsely testified to Congress that no requests had been denied. The denied resources included enhanced counter-drone systems and additional counter-sniper personnel, highlighting systemic failures that contributed to the near-fatal security breach.</p>

The 27-year-old has reportedly already agreed to personal terms on a five-year contract with the London-based club.

          <p>Following the deadly floods in Texas, Senator Maria Cantwell has emphasized that improving the nation's weather warning systems is a "national responsibility." The Washington Democrat, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, stated that forecasting is not a local issue but requires a robust federal system that can provide timely and accurate information to local responders. She plans to send President Trump bipartisan recommendations for upgrading forecasting infrastructure, including better radar and data analytics. Cantwell warned that proposed budget cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) could undermine this critical mission.</p>

The administration has targeted a Fed headquarters renovation project as a potential justification, with OMB Director Russell Vought accusing Powell of mismanagement.

This decision came after President Trump sent a letter threatening new 30% tariffs on EU goods, citing a persistent trade deficit. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that while the bloc prefers a negotiated solution, it will remain prepared to implement countermeasures if a deal is not reached.

As of late June, over 71% of the nearly 58,000 people in ICE detention had no criminal record. Non-public data also shows that of those with convictions, most were for nonviolent offenses related to immigration or traffic. This analysis suggests a significant disconnect between the administration's public justification for its aggressive deportation program and the reality of who is being targeted and detained.
