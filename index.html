            <p>Hewlett Packard Enterprise shares experienced a significant surge after Elliott Investment Management acquired a stake exceeding $1.5 billion, signaling potential discussions to enhance shareholder value. The activist investor aims to collaborate with HPE on strategies to boost its market performance, which has seen a decline this year. While Elliott Management refrained from commenting, HPE has yet to respond to inquiries regarding the investment. Despite exceeding quarterly revenue expectations, HPE's fiscal year guidance was weak, compounded by challenges like higher discounting and anticipated price adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Protect Democracy, a non-profit watchdog group, has initiated legal action against the Trump administration for dismantling a public tool that tracked government spending. The OMB defended its decision, citing concerns over disclosing sensitive information, but the lawsuit alleges this violates federal law mandating transparency in apportionment documents. The GAO also challenged the OMB's reasoning, stating that apportionments are legally binding and cannot be considered predecisional. Congressional Democrats have also voiced concerns, asserting that the removal of the tracker obscures government spending from the American public and Congress.</p>

            <p>Several Republican politicians are pushing to ban the purchase of soda using food stamps, aligning with a policy previously championed by Michael Bloomberg. This shift represents a change from past Republican stances defending soda consumption, with proponents now citing health concerns and the desire to reform the welfare state. However, critics argue that these efforts may be a veiled attempt to cut SNAP benefits and unfairly target low-income individuals' food choices. The USDA is expected to approve state requests for these pilot programs, potentially setting new limits on what can be bought with food stamps.</p>

            <p>LVMH shares plummeted following a weaker-than-expected first-quarter sales report, causing it to temporarily lose its position as the world's largest luxury firm to HermÃ¨s. The decline in LVMH's sales was attributed to weaker demand in the U.S. and China for cognac, as well as a slowdown in the fashion and leather goods division. Analysts cited trade tensions and tariffs as potential headwinds for the luxury sector, which relies on global supply chains and U.S. consumer demand. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has launched a tourism campaign aimed at encouraging Canadians to visit the state, following a decline in Canadian tourism attributed to concerns about President Trump's policies. The campaign emphasizes California's welcoming environment and diverse attractions, while distancing itself from the Trump administration's actions. Newsom is also working to strengthen economic and political ties between California and Canada. The campaign aims to mitigate an expected decline in tourism revenue due to a decrease in international visitors.</p>

            <p>Allison Riggs, a Democratic justice on the North Carolina Supreme Court, is fighting to retain her seat after a court ruling paved the way to potentially overturn her election victory. The ruling orders the state board of elections to give certain overseas voters additional time to prove their eligibility, a move that could impact the election results. Riggs views the challenge as an existential threat to democracy, fearing it could set a precedent for selectively challenging election outcomes. She has asked a federal court to intervene and halt the ruling.</p>

            <p>With tariffs creating economic uncertainty, some financial experts recommend keeping a small amount of physical cash at home for emergencies. While not every planner considers it essential, having $500 to $1,000 on hand can be wise in case of power outages, natural disasters, or payment disruptions. Experts caution against hoarding excessive cash, as it is not FDIC-insured and does not earn interest. Discretion and secure storage are important when keeping cash at home.</p>

The CDC's workforce is being reduced by 2,400 people, with the goal of streamlining divisions and eliminating redundancies.</p>
