          <p>Oliver Widger, known online as "sailing_with_phoenix," completed his journey from Oregon to Hawaii with his cat Phoenix, receiving a warm welcome from fans and Hawaii's Governor Josh Green. Widger, who quit his tire company job and used his retirement savings to buy a sailboat, gained a large social media following documenting his trip. Diagnosed with Klippel-Feil syndrome four years ago, Widger was inspired to pursue a life he enjoyed, teaching himself to sail via YouTube and refitting his $50,000 boat. He plans to repair his boat and possibly travel to French Polynesia next, expressing gratitude for the support he received during his journey.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to raise the annual salaries of chefs at its overseas diplomatic missions to over 6 million yen (approximately $41,000) to attract talent as Japanese cuisine gains global popularity. The chefs, who often serve as live-in staff, will also have the option of government-covered rented accommodation. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasized the significant role these chefs play in hosting foreign dignitaries and promoting Japanese food, adding that recruiting qualified staff has become increasingly difficult. The ministry hopes the improved conditions will encourage chefs to proactively promote Japanese cuisine as 'food diplomats'.</p>

The man, who is gay, had been protected from being returned to Guatemala under a U.S. immigration judge's order. However, the U.S. sent him to Mexico, a removal the judge found likely lacked due process. The man has since been returned to Guatemala, where he is in hiding, as he also fears returning to Mexico, where he was previously sexually assaulted and held for ransom.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has pledged to fully reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and scrap the two-child benefit cap if the party gains power. The party plans to fund these policies by cutting net-zero projects and eliminating hotels for asylum seekers. This announcement highlights the growing divisions within the Labour party regarding these policies, as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer faces pressure to change his approach. The winter fuel payment provides a lump sum to pensioner households, while the two-child benefit cap restricts means-tested benefits for families with more than two children born after April 2017.</p>

"Against Our Will" offered a comprehensive history of sexual assault and contributed to legal reforms, including the criminalization of sexual assault within marriage and the implementation of rape shield laws.

          <p>North Korea has detained three shipyard officials following an accident during the launch of a new warship. The incident, which involved damage to the 5,000-ton destroyer, was described by leader Kim Jong Un as a "criminal act". The detained officials include the chief engineer of the Chongjin shipyard, the construction head, and an administrative manager, all deemed responsible for the accident. An investigation is underway as the North Korean leader has ordered the ship restored before a ruling party meeting in June.</p>

Renewed military action against Hamas has included a blockade of Gaza, with limited aid trickling in. Allegations have also surfaced accusing the Israeli military of using Palestinians as human shields, which Israel denies.</p>

French authorities suspect arson after a fire at an electrical substation weakened the grid, followed by a high-voltage line collapse.

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament, signaling Canada's sovereignty and independence against threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. The move is seen as an affirmation of Canada's unique traditions, distinguishing it from the U.S., and is a stark contrast to Trump's suggestions of Canada becoming a 51st state. This invitation comes after Trump imposed tariffs that threatened Canada's economic stability. While much of Canada's population is indifferent to the British monarchy, Carney's government is signaling a stronger support for the Crown.</p>
