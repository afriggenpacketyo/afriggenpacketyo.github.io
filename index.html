          <p>Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was interrupted at a town hall event by a protester who was shouting about the "genocide" in Gaza, which occurred shortly after the event began. The protester, who claimed to be a healthcare worker, demanded to know what AOC was doing about the situation, leading to shouts of "Shame!" from the audience. Ocasio-Cortez responded by emphasizing the importance of following ground rules and allowing everyone to have a chance to speak, and then the protester was escorted out of the event. The article also highlights AOC's recent fundraising success, which has totaled $9.6 million over the past three months.</p>

          <p>Due to staffing shortages at an air traffic control center, United Airlines is reducing its schedule at Newark Liberty International Airport by 35 roundtrip flights per day, approximately 10% of its daily schedule, starting this weekend. CEO Scott Kirby attributed the disruptions to air traffic controller staffing shortages and the FAA's technology problems, noting that 20% of the controllers for Newark had recently left their jobs. The FAA said that staffing issues were delaying operations at Newark, and Kirby said that the airline is urging the agency to establish flight restrictions like those in place at other congested facilities. The New York Times article emphasizes the effects of a runway closure as well, contributing to the flight delays.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in a general election where major issues include the high cost of living and housing shortages, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor Party seeking a second three-year term. The election is taking place against a backdrop of what both sides of politics describe as a cost of living crisis, and soaring prices are a big headache. The central bank reduced the inflation rate by a quarter percentage point in February to 4.1%, and housing prices and rents have also soared as builders have gone broke because of inflation absorbing profit margins. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange endorsed Albanese on the eve of the election.</p>

          <p>A suspect fleeing from police after a grand theft incident in Camarillo, California, died in a crash on the 210 Freeway after a pursuit that reached speeds of 115 mph.

The driver, who was the only occupant of the car, was pronounced dead at the scene, and no one else was injured.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Perkins Coie is unconstitutional, permanently blocking the administration from enforcing it. Judge Beryl Howell found that the order, which sought to punish the firm for representing Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and hiring Christopher Steele, violates the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The ruling is a significant victory for Perkins Coie and a rebuke of the president's use of government power to target lawyers for their representation of disfavored clients.</p>

Chinese officials proposed special envoys appointed by Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, but the US prefers direct negotiations between Trump and Xi. A lack of bilateral trust is fueled by disputes over China’s role in producing ingredients used in the illegal manufacturing of fentanyl, leading to tariff escalations and a decline in trans-Pacific shipments.</p>

          <p>Kevin De Bruyne scored the only goal in Manchester City's 1-0 Premier League victory against Wolves, which may ensure City play Champions League football next season. The midfielder is bidding an emotional farewell after 10 trophy-laden years at the club, and the Belgian soaked up the acclaim by taking the long route around the pitch before heading down the tunnel. De Bruyne said last month he was surprised not to be offered a new contract, and wanted to make a point about his abilities after the game.</p>

          <p>After the Trump administration dismissed nearly 400 scientists working on the nation's climate change report, two scientific groups, the American Geophysical Union and the American Meteorological Society, announced a plan to publish a special collection focused on the subject. This is meant to ensure the scientists' work can be accessed. The groups say their collection isn't meant to replace the National Climate Assessment, but would complement it, since the dismissal of hundreds of scientists suggests that the next National Climate Assessment may not be as extensive as the previous ones.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will require new vaccines to undergo placebo testing, marking what a department spokesperson called "a radical departure from past practices." The policy change would force vaccines, in order to be approved for human use, to undergo studies in which half of individuals in a study receive a placebo to compare results against the vaccine. It remains unclear what HHS considers a "new" vaccine and whether that includes the flu and COVID vaccines, which are updated on an annual basis to better protect against currently circulating strains.</p>

Harvard signaled that it would resist the threat, stating that there was “no legal basis” for the move and that it would endanger the university’s ability to carry out its educational mission. The intensifying standoff between the Trump administration and Harvard is part of a broad pressure campaign against elite universities.</p>

His argument was so convincing that it vaulted Benjamin to top place among the more than 70 competitors in the trials.</p>
