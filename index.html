          <p>A CBS News/YouGov poll reveals mixed opinions among California voters regarding potential 2028 presidential campaigns for Governor Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris. While a majority of California Democrats support a Newsom run, overall state opinion is split, and support for Harris is lower. The survey also indicates that Californians view their state as a leader in technology and culture but not in housing, taxes, or economic policy, reflecting widespread concern over the high cost of living. This sentiment provides context for the upcoming 2026 gubernatorial race, where many voters remain undecided.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially endorsed former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the race to succeed him, positioning Cuomo against Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Adams, who dropped his own reelection bid amid low polling and a federal indictment that was later dismissed, framed the endorsement as a necessary move to protect the city's future. The endorsement follows a contentious race, with Mamdani leading in recent polls and criticizing the alliance as a continuation of corrupt politics. The final debate highlighted key city issues like immigration, policing, and housing.</p>

          <p>A federal indictment against former NBA player Damon Jones suggests he leaked non-public information about LeBron James's injury status to sports bettors. While affiliated with the Los Angeles Lakers, Jones allegedly texted a co-conspirator to place a "big bet" on the Milwaukee Bucks before a February 2023 game, revealing that James would not be playing. James, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, did sit out that game, which the Lakers lost. The charges are part of a broader investigation into illegal gambling operations connected to the NBA.</p>

          <p>Average 30-year mortgage rates have dropped for the second consecutive week to 6.19%, nearing a three-year low and offering a potential opportunity for prospective homebuyers. Experts advise buyers to remain cautious, as rates are declining gradually and could reverse course due to various economic factors, similar to previous fluctuations this year. The current environment may present a window with less competition compared to the anticipated spring 2026 market. Acting now could be advantageous, but buyers should carefully weigh affordability and market volatility before committing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold prices have experienced significant fluctuations, recently dropping from over $4,300 per ounce to around $4,000 before rebounding, driven by conflicting market forces like Federal Reserve rate cuts and a strong stock market. This volatility presents opportunities for investors who can act strategically. The article suggests three approaches to capitalize on these swings: trading gold mining stocks for leveraged exposure, using gold ETFs or futures for short-term plays, and buying physical gold during price dips for a long-term hedge. These methods allow investors to adapt to rapid market changes. (not investment advice)</p>

The U.S. government views quantum computing as critical for national security, especially in competition with China. This strategic importance continues to fuel investor interest, despite the technology not yet being commercially viable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>State agencies are warning that the federal government shutdown could halt Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) payments for over 40 million Americans starting in November. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has informed states that funds will be insufficient if the shutdown continues, instructing them to pause benefit processing. This potential disruption could force recipients, many of whom live at or below the poverty line, to make difficult choices between food and other necessities. While the USDA has a multi-billion dollar contingency fund, it remains unclear if the administration will use it to prevent the lapse.</p>

These actions are not defiance for its own sake but rather a toddler's way of establishing independence and understanding their identity in relation to the world. Experts advise parents to reframe this boundary-pushing as a learning process. They recommend strategies such as offering limited choices, modeling desired behaviors like sharing, and clearly stating what to do instead of what not to do, helping to navigate this challenging yet vital phase.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Melissa is slowly moving through the central Caribbean and is forecast to intensify into a major hurricane by early next week. The National Hurricane Center has issued warnings for Jamaica and Haiti, which, along with the Dominican Republic, are expected to receive 6 to 12 inches of rain through the weekend. This heavy rainfall poses a significant risk of life-threatening flash floods and landslides in the region. While the storm is not expected to have a major impact on the U.S. mainland, its slow movement over warm waters is expected to fuel its significant strengthening.</p>

          <p>Colombian artist-producer Ela Minus has earned a Latin Grammy nomination for her song "QQQQ," a recognition of her unique journey in the music world. Starting as a punk drummer in Bogotá at age 12, she later studied at Berklee College of Music, where she delved into jazz drumming and music synthesis. Her solo career is defined by a blend of dark, synth-powered electronic beats and vulnerable, candid lyrics. Her latest album, "Día," was created during a nomadic period of her life and reflects a journey through personal reckoning, capturing a sound that is both apocalyptic and hopeful.</p>

The legislation, which now heads to the president's desk, addresses complaints that current notices for simple clerical mistakes are often confusing and do not adequately explain how to correct the error or the consequences of not responding within the 60-day deadline. While the bill won't reduce the number of errors made on returns, lawmakers say it will make the process of resolving them more straightforward for ordinary taxpayers without needing professional help.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has imposed new sanctions on Russia's two largest oil companies, Rosneft and Lukoil, causing global oil prices to jump by more than 5%. The Treasury Department stated the sanctions were a response to Moscow's failure to engage in a serious peace process to end the war in Ukraine. This move marks a significant escalation of economic pressure on the Kremlin and is reportedly linked to the recent cancellation of a planned summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin. The sanctions aim to curtail Russia's revenue for funding its military efforts. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific report published in the journal Science details the devastating impact of the 2023 marine heat wave on Florida's coral reef. The prolonged, extreme heat caused the worst mass bleaching event in Caribbean history, resulting in the near-total loss of staghorn and elkhorn corals. These two "reef-building" species are now considered functionally extinct in the region, meaning their populations are too small to perform their vital role in the ecosystem. Some corals died so quickly from the heat stress that they did not even have a chance to bleach, with their tissue simply melting away.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The functional extinction of elkhorn and staghorn corals from Florida's reef system represents a critical loss of natural infrastructure that protects coastal communities. These species grew in shallow waters, forming complex structures that could reduce a hurricane's wave energy by up to 97%, averting an estimated $675 million in flood damage annually. With these natural barriers now gone, coastal Florida is more vulnerable to storm surge and flooding. The loss also threatens the state's multi-billion dollar fishing and tourism industries, which depend on the healthy reef ecosystem that these corals once anchored.</p>

The White House has dismissed these concerns but has not yet submitted construction plans to the National Capital Planning Commission for approval.

The study, published in the journal mBio, suggests that UTIs should be considered a food safety issue, not just a personal health problem.

Russia has condemned the sanctions as an "unfriendly act," with some officials calling it an "act of war."
