          <p>The Justice Department, under the Trump administration, is retracting its support for police reform agreements with Minneapolis and Louisville, established after the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor respectively. These consent decrees aimed to address systemic civil rights violations within the police departments, but the DOJ now deems them too punitive and an overreach of federal power. Despite the federal government's change of heart, officials in both Minneapolis and Louisville have stated their commitment to continue with the reforms outlined in the agreements. The article also notes that the DOJ plans to close investigations into several other police departments and retract findings of widespread misconduct made during the Biden administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed tax cuts and tariff policies are causing turmoil in the bond market, raising concerns about the sustainability of America's debt load. Investors are worried that the tax cuts, without corresponding spending cuts, will increase the federal deficit and lead to higher interest rates. The article notes that Treasury yields have already spiked, reflecting these deficit worries, and analysts suggest that the bond market could sway Washington decision-makers. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, cautioned that Treasury market volatility could heighten economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump, accompanied by Elon Musk, held a meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the White House to discuss strained relations between the U.S. and South Africa.

The U.S. has granted refugee status to some White Afrikaners, further complicating relations. Senator Tim Kaine challenged the administration's prioritization of Afrikaners, questioning whether they are more persecuted than other groups seeking refuge.</p>

          <p>Vani Hari, formerly known as the Food Babe, has become a major voice in the Trump administration's healthy-food agenda. Hari, who started as a blogger dispensing tips on diet and fitness, is now working with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on initiatives like eradicating petroleum-based food dyes. Her rise to prominence has thrilled her followers but surprised food industry executives and scientists who have criticized her methods. This transformation of the food-policy landscape has prompted questions about whether liberals and MAGA loyalists can unite behind her mission.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) indicates that five-day in-office mandates are based on outdated assumptions about productivity, culture, and resilience. The report highlights the advantages of telework, including reduced turnover, cost savings, and increased productivity, when leaders embrace strategic culture-building and robust performance tracking. Companies that ignore these insights risk talent attrition and reduced agility. Flexibility is now a key driver of talent acquisition and retention, with remote work removing geographic barriers and improving work-life balance for employees.</p>

          <p>Callable CDs offer potentially higher interest rates compared to traditional CDs, but come with the risk that the bank can redeem the CD before its full term. These can be a worthwhile consideration if you can get a very high rate, notably higher than what banks are offering on traditional CDs. Alternatives to callable CDs include traditional CDs and high-yield savings accounts. Before investing in a callable CD, it's crucial to have a reinvestment strategy in place should the CD be called early. (not investment advice)</p>
