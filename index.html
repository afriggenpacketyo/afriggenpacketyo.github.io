          <h2>Japan Considers Increasing Tariff-Free Rice Imports From the US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-22 07:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating expanding tariff-free imports of U.S.-grown rice amidst negotiations regarding higher levies imposed by Washington. The proposal suggests increasing the amount of rice imported from the United States to approximately 410,000 tons, up from the current 350,000 tons. This consideration arises amid growing domestic calls for more affordable imported rice, as prices surge due to supply shortages, despite government efforts to ease market strain, additionally Trump has been pushing for Japan to ease non-tariff barriers. Optimism surrounding tariff talks is high, with the U.S. envoy expressing positive sentiments during a meeting with Japan's Prime Minister. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvard University is suing the Trump administration, alleging attempts to control academic decision-making by threatening to withhold federal funding. The suit follows Harvard's refusal to comply with demands that included appointing an outside overseer to ensure viewpoint diversity. The administration has painted campus protests as anti-American and antisemitic, prompting Harvard to push back against government interference. The White House maintains that taxpayer funds are a privilege, and Harvard has failed to meet the conditions required to access that privilege.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece criticizes recent remarks by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. regarding autism, arguing that his rhetoric reduces complex human stories to simple tragedy. The author, Veronica A.

She advocates for investment in services, housing, and employment pathways, and rejects rhetoric that stigmatizes difference and isolates those who live it.</p>

          <p>The publication of Joan Didion's therapy session notes, addressed to her husband John, raises questions about whether the intensely private author would have wanted such personal reflections shared publicly. The notes, documenting her struggles to help her daughter Quintana, reveal Didion's insecurities and ambivalence about motherhood. While literary scholars may find the notes insightful, the author questions whether making these intimate details public respects Didion's desire for privacy, ultimately thickening the mystery of who Joan Didion truly was.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Southeast Asian immigrants in Los Angeles and Orange counties, with long-stayed deportation orders, are being detained and deported after routine ICE check-ins. These individuals, primarily from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, were convicted of crimes after arriving in the U.S. and allowed to remain under the condition that they checked in with ICE regularly. The Trump administration's increased deportation efforts are suspected to be the cause of this policy shift, possibly influenced by looming tariff threats that have made some countries more willing to cooperate.</p>

          <p>Chinese solar panel manufacturers are exploring alternative factory locations in response to the U.S. imposing tariffs on solar cell imports from Southeast Asia. American trade officials finalized steep tariffs that could reach over 3,500 per cent for products made in Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia. The inconsistent tariff policies from US President Donald Trump have added to the uncertainties of any long-term investment plans, according to industry insiders. Southeast Asia has become a major destination for Chinese solar firms transferring production capacity overseas in recent years – seen as an attempt to bypass US tariffs on direct imports from China.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed the Pentagon to re-evaluate missile defense, with a focus on creating a "Golden Dome" system potentially incorporating space-based interceptors.

Experts believe the system would need space-based interceptors to strike ICBMs early in flight.
