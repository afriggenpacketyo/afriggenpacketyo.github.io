          <p>Bitcoin reached $100,000 following President Trump's announcement of a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking its highest level since February. The price of Bitcoin increased by over 4%, while other cryptocurrencies like Ether, Solana, and Dogecoin also experienced rallies. The announcement boosted stocks broadly, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising nearly 400 points. Since early April, Bitcoin has risen by approximately 16%, outperforming gold and the S&P 500, indicating renewed investor confidence and market momentum.</p>

          <p>A Standard Chartered analyst apologized for his previous prediction of Bitcoin reaching $120,000 by the second quarter of 2025, stating that this target now appears too low. The analyst noted that U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds have seen significant inflows, indicating growing institutional investment. Factors such as MicroStrategy's increased Bitcoin purchases and investments from sovereign wealth funds are driving the cryptocurrency's price surge. This revised outlook reflects a shift in market dynamics, with flows now dominating the Bitcoin narrative.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England reduced interest rates to 4.25% from 4.5% and signaled potential further cuts in the coming months. The decision was influenced by concerns about the global trade war's potential impact on UK economic growth, although the recent UK-US trade deal was welcomed. While the rate-setting committee was divided on the extent of the cut, the overall path for rates is expected to be downwards. This move aims to balance tackling inflation with supporting economic growth, providing relief to mortgage holders but also impacting savers.</p>

          <p>An autopsy report suggests that the firing squad execution of Mikal Mahdi in South Carolina may have been botched, leading to prolonged suffering. The report indicates that the bullets missed the intended target area, resulting in a slower death process. Mahdi's lawyers have filed a notice of botched execution with the state Supreme Court, raising concerns about the training and oversight involved in the process. The autopsy revealed only two distinct wounds from the three shooters, and witnesses reported Mahdi crying out and groaning after the shots were fired.</p>

          <p>The Seoul High Court postponed the trial of Lee Jae-myung, the opposition Democratic Party's presidential candidate, until after the June 3 election, a move seen as a potential lifeline for his campaign. Lee faces charges of violating election laws and other offenses, which could disqualify him from running if convicted. Critics argue that the ruling undermines the judiciary and could guarantee Lee's victory, while supporters believe it ensures stability in South Korean politics.

          <p>President Trump criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for keeping interest rates steady, calling him a "fool" for acting "too late" in cutting rates. Trump inaccurately claimed there is "virtually NO INFLATION," despite inflation rising 2.4% annually in March, above the Fed's 2% target. Powell has stressed the Fed's independence, aiming to make decisions based on economic data rather than political pressure. The Fed's independence allows it to pursue its dual mandate of low inflation and full employment.</p>

          <p>Relations between India and Pakistan are strained after a series of attacks in Kashmir, a disputed territory between the two countries. The conflict has impacted cricket relations, with the teams not facing each other outside of global events organized by the International Cricket Council (ICC). India has blocked the accounts of current and retired Pakistani cricket stars, and the coach of the Indian men's team has said there "should not be anything between India and Pakistan" until the situation is resolved.</p>

          <p>As of Wednesday, U.S. travelers flying domestically are required to show a Real ID at airport checkpoints. Despite the new security requirement, operations at many airports have remained normal, with some websites reporting short wait times at security checkpoints. TSA employees at Newark Airport said they were pleasantly surprised by how prepared passengers were. Officials advised travelers to arrive at least three hours before a domestic flight, especially if they don't have a Real ID.</p>

          <p>More than four in 10 universities in England are expecting to be in a financial deficit by this summer, according to a new report from the Office for Students (OfS). Universities are closing courses and selling buildings to cut costs, but "significant reform and efficiencies" are needed to turn the tide. A drop in international students coming to the UK is the main reason for the worsening financial position.</p>

          <p>The EU is considering imposing tariffs on US aircraft and car exports in a fresh attempt to persuade Donald Trump to drop his current and proposed tariffs against the EU. Brussels has launched a consultation with member states on potential litigation against the US over the blanket 20% reciprocal tariffs the US president announced last month. The new list of potential tariff targets was designed as preparation for a scenario in which some or all US tariffs remained after July.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts say that using an inheritance to pay off credit card debt could make sense, but it's not always the best option. If credit cards are charging over 20% interest, and long-term market returns are averaging 8% to 10%, paying off the debt offers an immediate and higher return. But if balances are low, on a 0% promotional rate, or being managed effectively, the money might be better used to build savings, invest, or tackle other financial priorities.</p>

The report notes that the wounds were on the lowest area of Mahdi’s chest, near the abdomen, and that the bullets had a “downward” trajectory that mostly missed the heart.</p>
