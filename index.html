          <p>A 20-foot Minke whale died after being struck by a boat in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey. The collision caused a passenger to be thrown overboard, though they were recovered safely. Officials from the Marine Mammal Stranding Center confirmed the whale's death after it was found resting on a shallow sandbar. Due to tidal conditions and the need for heavy equipment, a necropsy to determine the exact cause of death is scheduled for a later date. Authorities have advised boaters to exercise caution in the area.</p>

The majority of the infections occurred in the city of Foshan, prompting a visit from the head of China's CDC to coordinate efforts. The viral disease, transmitted by mosquitoes, causes high fever and severe joint pain but cannot be spread through person-to-person contact. Officials have stressed the need for swift action to contain the outbreak and protect public health, though no severe or fatal cases have been recorded.</p>

Bryant described an incident from 1978 when he was 16, stating he felt he had no choice but to comply with Croft's sexual demands. The National Youth Theatre issued a statement apologizing to Bryant and other victims of the same perpetrator.

          <p>To combat rising knife crime, the Australian state of Victoria has rolled out over 40 machete disposal bins at police stations. This initiative precedes a statewide ban on the weapons set to begin on September 1. The government is providing an amnesty period until November 30 for citizens to surrender machetes without penalty.

          <p>The U.S. Senate has confirmed Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News host and county prosecutor, to serve as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. The confirmation came after President Trump's first nominee, Ed Martin Jr., was withdrawn due to a lack of Republican support. Pirro, who previously co-hosted "The Five" and was involved in a defamation lawsuit from Smartmatic over 2020 election claims, has significantly more courtroom experience than her predecessor. Her ex-husband received a presidential pardon from Trump in the final moments of his first term.</p>

          <p>An Arizona woman, Christina Chapman, has been sentenced to eight years in prison for her part in a sophisticated scheme that helped North Korean IT workers secure remote jobs at major U.S. companies. Chapman acted as a U.S.-based facilitator, managing "laptop farms" and stolen identities to make the overseas workers appear to be American citizens. The operation generated millions of dollars, which U.S. authorities say were funneled to support North Korea's nuclear weapons program.

          <p>This article suggests that world No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler, despite his dominance, has a public image as an emotionless and somewhat unexciting athlete. However, his recent cameo in the movie "Happy Gilmore 2" could change that perception. In the film, Scheffler delivers a self-effacing and funny performance, even referencing his real-life arrest at the PGA Championship. The author argues that this role presents a more relatable and fun-loving side of the golfer, which could enhance his appeal to fans and be a positive development for the sport.</p>

          <p>The UK is bracing for Storm Floris, with an amber weather warning issued for most of Scotland due to expected strong winds and potential danger to life. The Met Office warns of gusts reaching 70mph inland and up to 90mph in exposed coastal areas, which could cause damage to buildings and topple trees. A less severe yellow warning is in place for northern England, north Wales, and Northern Ireland. Ferry services have been canceled, and rail and road travel are expected to be disrupted during the storm, which is the first named storm since January.</p>

          <p>The BBC has launched an investigation and hired an external law firm to probe allegations of cocaine use by two unnamed stars on its popular show, "Strictly Come Dancing." The claims were reportedly first raised in a legal submission to the broadcaster in March on behalf of a former celebrity contestant. The BBC stated it has clear protocols for handling serious complaints and encourages people with concerns to come forward. This investigation adds to a series of recent controversies surrounding the behavior of professionals and guests on the long-running program.</p>

          <p>The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) has accused the Israeli military of a deliberate attack on its headquarters in Khan Younis, Gaza, which killed one staff member and injured three others. The humanitarian group stated the attack sparked a fire and that its facility was well-known and clearly marked with the protective red emblem. In response, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had no knowledge of any artillery or air strikes in that area. The incident occurs amid growing warnings about the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with hundreds of Palestinians reportedly killed while seeking aid.</p>

His remarks are likely to intensify accusations that Israel is pursuing a policy of ethnic cleansing.

          <p>The Czech Republic has amended its criminal code to outlaw the promotion of communist ideology, placing it on the same legal footing as Nazi propaganda. Signed into law by President Petr Pavel, the amendment carries a penalty of one to five years in prison for supporting movements that aim to suppress human rights. The move was supported by the country's pro-European government but has been condemned by the Czech communist party as a political attack. The law could potentially lead to a ban on the party, which recently gained a seat in the European Parliament.</p>

          <p>A new study led by Chinese and Canadian researchers suggests that earthquakes can provide a crucial energy source for life in Earth's deep, dark biosphere. The research found that seismic activity along fault lines can produce significant amounts of hydrogen gas. This hydrogen can then be used by microbes as fuel for chemosynthesis, a process similar to photosynthesis but without light. This discovery helps explain how a vast and active microbial ecosystem, estimated to contain a fifth of Earth's total biomass, can survive in the planet's most isolated environments.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This historical essay reflects on the crucial, yet often overlooked, period in 1775 when George Washington took command of the Continental Army outside Boston. The author argues that Washington's greatness was demonstrated not in dramatic battles, but in the quiet, difficult work of forging a unified American army from disparate colonial militias. By transcending his own prejudices, establishing discipline, and recognizing talent in subordinates from different backgrounds, he laid the foundation for eventual victory. The essay laments that modern political divisions and academic trends often obscure the importance of Washington's character and judgment.</p>

          <p>The complex and often beneficial relationship between Donald Trump and media mogul Rupert Murdoch has soured, highlighted by a $10 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Trump against Murdoch's Wall Street Journal. The suit concerns a report about an alleged letter from Trump to Jeffrey Epstein, which Trump denies. This legal battle exposes the tensions between the two titans, even as Murdoch's Fox News remains a key platform for Trump's political base. The article traces their half-century history, noting Murdoch's past attempts to back other candidates and his desire to be seen as a kingmaker, not a subordinate.</p>

          <p>Peter Guralnick's new biography, "The Colonel and the King," provides a comprehensive and often sympathetic look at Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis Presley's controversial longtime manager. The book delves deep into Parker's hidden past as a Dutch immigrant who reinvented himself in America, using his carnival-hustler skills to build the Elvis empire. While the review praises Guralnick's exhaustive research and passion, it notes that the book reads at times like an apology for Parker's more criticized decisions, such as preventing Elvis from touring internationally. It is recommended for those seeking a definitive study of the man behind the King.</p>

          <p>A report from California's highly competitive 13th Congressional District reveals a rare point of bipartisan agreement: voters want the government to release all files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Despite deep divisions over President Trump, interviews with dozens of Democratic, Republican, and independent voters showed a shared belief that the public deserves full transparency about Epstein's crimes and his powerful associates. Many voters recalled Trump's campaign promises to release the files and expressed frustration with what they see as subsequent backpedaling, insisting that anyone implicated should be held accountable.</p>

          <p>In a drastic move to combat extreme cartel violence and corruption, the new mayor of Celaya, Mexico, has fired over half of the city's police force. The city, which has one of the world's highest homicide rates, replaced the local officers with federal troops and members of the national guard. This militarized approach reflects a broader trend in Mexico, where trust in local police has collapsed. While officials report a drop in homicides since the change, high-profile violence continues, and critics question the long-term effectiveness of using soldiers for civilian policing.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece critiques a recent ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals under the Trump administration, which holds that gender cannot be the basis for defining a "particular social group" for refugee protection. The author argues this decision is a major setback that effectively returns U.S. refugee law to an era when violence against women was dismissed as a private matter. This move reverses decades of legal progress that recognized gender-based persecution, such as domestic violence and honor killings, as valid grounds for asylum, making it far more difficult for women and girls to find safety in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's escalating trade war and new tariffs, the U.S. economy has remained surprisingly resilient, with stock markets near record highs and recent GDP growth surpassing expectations. This article analyzes the reasons, including businesses stockpiling goods to delay price hikes and multinationals spreading tariff costs across global markets. However, it warns that this resilience may be temporary, as worrying jobs data and the eventual exhaustion of stockpiles could lead to higher inflation and slower growth. The average U.S. tariff rate is now at its highest level since the 1930s, posing a significant long-term risk. (not investment advice)</p>
