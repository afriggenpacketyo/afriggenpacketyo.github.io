            <p>Major stock markets in Asia and Europe experienced gains following the U.S. announcement of temporary tariff exemptions for key consumer electronics. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index led the regional gains, and European markets also saw significant increases. The news suggested possible relief for tech companies concerned about Trump's tariffs on goods from China. However, President Trump indicated that any reprieve would be temporary, with specific tariffs to be imposed on goods under a new national security classification (not investment advice).

            <p>A report by MPs found that police forces were unprepared for the violence that broke out in riots following the murder of three children in Southport. The report said officers were exposed to "significant risk" in disorder that saw attacks on mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers. However, the report found no evidence to support claims of "two-tier policing", finding instead that such commentary "undermined" the efforts of the officers. The report commends the bravery and professionalism of the officers. Optimism Score: 60</p>

            <p>Singapore eased its monetary policy for the second straight time, as the city-state sees zero growth this year as a possibility after posting a lower-than-expected GDP expansion of 3.8% for the first quarter. The country's Ministry of Trade and Industry downgraded its GDP forecast to 0%-2% for 2025, down from its previous outlook of 1%-3% due to the sweeping tariffs imposed by the U.S., as well as the U.S.-China trade war. The MAS said it would reduce the rate of appreciation of its policy band known as the Singapore dollar nominal effective exchange rate. Optimism Score: 50</p>

            <p>Sony hiked the price of its flagship PlayStation 5 console in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, citing a "challenging economic environment" behind its move. In Europe, the PS5 Digital Edition will now cost 499.99 euros ($569.9), Sony said in a blog post on Sunday. There is no price increase for the PS5 with HD Blu-ray disk drive in Europe and the U.K, while the PS5 Pro, an upgraded model of the console which was launched last year, was also spared hikes. Global financial and currency markets have been volatile since U.S. President Donald Trump announced so-called "reciprocal tariffs" on more than 180 countries earlier this month.
