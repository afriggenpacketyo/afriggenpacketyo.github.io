          <p>Following his recent passing at the age of 97, this article pays tribute to Apollo astronaut Jim Lovell, a pivotal figure in American space exploration. It highlights his remarkable career, including his role as commander of the perilous Apollo 13 mission, famously turning a near-catastrophe into a successful recovery. The piece also revisits a 2018 interview where Lovell and his Apollo 8 crewmates recounted their historic 1968 mission, during which they became the first humans to orbit the Moon. Their Christmas Eve broadcast and the iconic "Earthrise" photograph they captured are remembered as unifying moments for humanity.</p>

          <p>This article examines the rising popularity of ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response), the tingling sensation some people experience from specific auditory or visual triggers. It profiles Maria Viktorovna, known as the "ASMR queen," whose "Gentle Whispering" videos have amassed a huge following, and speaks with physiology professor Craig Richard about the physical effects of the phenomenon. The report describes ASMR as a "brain massage" and explores its transition from an internet curiosity to a mainstream wellness practice, even leading to the creation of dedicated ASMR spas. The piece provides context on why these gentle sounds are making so much noise in popular culture.</p>

          <p>A CBS News feature delves into the enduring legacy of folk singer Woody Guthrie and his iconic anthem, "This Land Is Your Land." The segment explores how the song, crafted as a response to "God Bless America," has become a powerful symbol of the nation's promise of inclusivity and equality for all its citizens. The report includes insights from Guthrie's daughter, Nora, who recounts discovering the original, more political, handwritten lyrics. It highlights the song's journey from a piece of personal commentary to a universally recognized American folk standard, celebrated for its vision of a land truly made for everyone.</p>

          <h2>Author David Sedaris Contemplates the Complexities of Modern Tipping Culture</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 10:24:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Humorist David Sedaris offers a witty commentary on the evolving and often confusing nature of tipping, particularly with the rise of digital payment screens. He recounts a personal experience at an airport breakfast spot where he was prompted to tip 22% for minimal service, sparking an internal debate about the value of labor and social obligation. Sedaris humorously contrasts this with the physical effort of carrying a heavy bag of cat litter, questioning the logic behind pre-programmed gratuities for tasks he largely performs himself. The piece weaves in reflections on immigrant labor and personal guilt, capturing the awkward and complicated emotions many face in everyday transactions.</p>

          <p>The UN Security Council is holding an emergency session to address Israel's widely condemned plan to reoccupy Gaza City. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defends the new offensive as the quickest way to end the war, while facing international criticism and domestic opposition from hostage families. The situation remains volatile, with Palestinian Islamic Jihad launching missile attacks and Israel's far-right ministers advocating for a more decisive victory. The article also notes a recent German poll indicating that a majority of its citizens now support the formal recognition of a Palestinian state, reflecting shifting public opinion on the conflict.</p>

The article follows journalist Jefferson Morley, who has spent 30 years pushing for the documents' release, arguing the CIA concealed its extensive surveillance of Lee Harvey Oswald prior to the event. While the official conclusion remains that Oswald acted alone, the new files suggest the CIA withheld information from the Warren Commission. Former CIA Director Leon Panetta acknowledges the agency's concerns about protecting assets but does not rule out more sinister motives for the secrecy, leaving many questions unanswered.</p>

It also covers the film's successful transition to the stage as an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, recently revived with a Tony-winning performance by Nicole Scherzinger. Through interviews with original cast member Nancy Olson and modern star Scherzinger, the piece explores why the story of a faded star's tragic comeback attempt continues to resonate with audiences today.</p>

She suggests that introverts can start small, such as sending one networking email a month or posting one professional update a week, to build confidence and visibility. The article emphasizes that a brand isn't just an online presence but is also built through offline activities and interests, which can lead to unexpected career opportunities.</p>

          <p>This article details the complex negotiations and political dealmaking that led to the passage of President Donald Trump's $3.3 trillion legislative package. The bill, which extends the 2017 tax cuts and includes provisions on border security and defense, was the result of over a year of behind-the-scenes work by Senate Republicans. The process involved overcoming internal party divisions, particularly concerning Medicaid cuts, which required creating a $50 billion rural hospital fund to secure votes. The report highlights the pressure tactics and last-minute huddles that were necessary to unify the party and push the massive bill through Congress before a self-imposed deadline.</p>

          <p>A new biography, "Electric Spark: The Enigma of Dame Muriel," examines the life of the renowned British novelist, focusing on the deep religious underpinnings of her famously witty and acerbic work. The article explains that Spark, a Catholic convert, used narrative structure and authorial omniscience to explore theological themes, particularly the relationship between an all-knowing God and flawed humanity. Her work was heavily influenced by the Book of Job and her own experiences, including a nervous breakdown and working in British psychological warfare during WWII. The review highlights how Spark's fiction often blurred the lines between the mundane and the supernatural, making her one of modern literature's most important religious writers.</p>

Allies of Salmond have vehemently dismissed this claim as a "fabrication" and hypocritical. The controversy stems from a 2019 government investigation into Salmond that was later deemed unlawful, and a subsequent 2020 trial where he was cleared of all charges. The dispute reignites the bitter feud that shattered the leadership of the Scottish National Party and continues to cast a shadow over Scottish politics.</p>

          <p>US fashion designer Willy Chavarria has issued an apology following accusations of cultural appropriation over a shoe he created with Adidas Originals. The footwear, called the Oaxaca Slip-On, was heavily criticized for borrowing its design from traditional Mexican huarache sandals without consulting or crediting the Indigenous communities who originated them. The controversy drew comments from Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum, who stated her government was exploring legal options to support the affected artisans. In his statement, Chavarria expressed deep regret that the shoe was not developed in a "direct and meaningful partnership with the Oaxacan community," and promotional images have since been removed.</p>

          <p>Xenobe Purvis's debut novel, "The Hounding," is a dark, historical tale set in 18th-century England about five enigmatic sisters accused of witchcraft. The book review explains that the story directly engages with the historical trope of femininity being perceived as a menace, as the villagers become convinced the sisters can transform into dogs. Told from the perspective of outsiders, the novel explores why female bodies and sisterly bonds are often seen as conduits for unnatural forces. While the reviewer finds some of the feminist commentary predictable, they praise the novel's lush, violent prose and its compelling, if unsettling, exploration of how fear can curdle into persecution.</p>

The White House has indicated it is open to a joint meeting, but the summit remains bilateral at Putin's request.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police arrested 474 people at a demonstration in Parliament Square for supporting the recently banned organization Palestine Action. The protest was organized to challenge the government's decision to proscribe the direct-action group under the Terrorism Act, which makes public support for it a criminal offense. The mass arrests, the largest on a single day in a decade, have been described as "deeply concerning" by Amnesty International, which argues the law is overly broad and threatens freedom of expression. The government banned Palestine Action following acts of sabotage against what the group claims are sites linked to the Israeli military.</p>

Urakawa suffered the same injury during a knockout loss on the same card and also passed away after an unsuccessful craniotomy. In response to the tragedies, the Japanese Boxing Commission has announced that all regional title bouts will be reduced from 12 to 10 rounds and has launched an investigation into the deaths.</p>

          <p>Devastating floods in Texas Hill Country that washed away homes and debris have also revealed a significant prehistoric discovery: a set of 110-million-year-old dinosaur tracks. A volunteer assisting with cleanup efforts found 15 large, three-clawed footprints in the Sandy Creek area of Travis County. Paleontologists from the University of Texas at Austin have identified the tracks as belonging to a large bipedal carnivore similar to an Acrocanthosaurus. The floodwaters eroded layers of dirt and gravel that had concealed the footprints in the Glen Rose Formation limestone, offering a rare glimpse into the region's ancient past amidst a modern disaster.</p>

          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending several dividend-paying stocks for investors seeking stable income. Energy giant Chevron (CVX) is highlighted for its strong shareholder returns and the expected positive impact from its recent acquisition of Hess. Asset manager Rithm Capital (RITM) is favored for its high dividend yield and its strategic pivot towards an alternative investment model. Finally, telecom company AT&T (T) is noted for its better-than-expected subscriber growth and a revised free cash flow outlook that supports its dividend while allowing for reinvestment into long-term growth projects like its fiber network.

Palantir's government contract revenue grew 53%, while private prison operators Geo Group and CoreCivic noted their detention facilities are fuller than ever. This financial boom comes as Congress provides a massive cash influx to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to further expand its detention network, signaling future growth for these contractors.</p>

          <p>In 2025, 19 U.S. states are offering temporary sales tax holidays, waiving taxes on specific categories of goods like back-to-school supplies, clothing, and disaster preparedness items. While politically popular, tax experts note the benefits can be limited, as consumers often just shift the timing of planned purchases rather than boosting overall economic activity. Research also suggests that wealthier taxpayers, who have more flexibility in their spending, may benefit most. However, many middle and lower-income families strategically plan for these events to save on major expenses, especially as rising costs and potential tariffs put a strain on household budgets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of negativity bias, the human evolutionary trait that makes us more attuned to threats and bad news than to positive developments. This psychological quirk, combined with the media's tendency to function as a watchdog focused on problems, can create a skewed and overly pessimistic view of the world. The author argues that consciously seeking out stories of progress, such as falling murder rates or declining deaths from extreme weather, is not naive but necessary. Cultivating realistic optimism can provide the resilience and motivation needed to believe that large-scale problems are solvable and inspire action.</p>

With the help of local researchers and community members, the vessel has been identified as the 275-year-old Earl of Chatham. Further investigation revealed the ship was originally the HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy ship built in 1749 that was deployed by the British during the American Revolution. After its naval service, it was sold and repurposed as a whaling ship before sinking in the North Sea in 1788, with all 56 crew members surviving.</p>

The event was widely witnessed, with hundreds of people across Georgia and nearby states reporting a fireball and a loud boom.

However, investigators discovered a small, round metal piece from the door's lock on the floor underneath Pennig's head. This led them to conclude that Ecker must have broken the door open before the shot was fired, causing the piece to fall, with Pennig then falling on top of it, contradicting his entire narrative and leading to his conviction.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains why the Airbus A340 was designed with four smaller engines instead of the two larger ones found on its sister aircraft, the A330. The primary reason was to appeal to airlines, particularly in Asia, that preferred the redundancy of four engines for long-haul flights over open oceans in an era before twin-engine jets had proven their modern reliability. However, as twin-engine aircraft received higher ETOPS ratings, allowing them to fly further from diversion airports, the need for four-engine jets diminished. The A340's higher operating and maintenance costs ultimately led to its decline in popularity, with very few remaining in passenger service today.</p>
