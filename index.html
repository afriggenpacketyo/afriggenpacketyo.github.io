            <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration must "facilitate" the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident wrongly deported to El Salvador. The court directed a lower court to clarify its order, balancing its authority with the executive branch's foreign affairs conduct. While acknowledging Abrego Garcia's contested status as an alleged MS-13 gang member, the court emphasized his illegal removal to El Salvador, as he was under an order to be removed from the U.S., but not to that specific country. Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson reaffirmed due process for all migrants in U.S. custody. </p>

Infants should receive an early first dose, followed by two more doses. This updated guidance contrasts with the previous recommendation that one dose was sufficient for most adults.</p>

            <p>New York City's Garment District is bracing for the impact of President Trump's tariffs, which are expected to increase costs for fabric importers and clothing manufacturers. Some Chinese goods are subject to tariffs reaching as high as 145%. The Alessi sisters, fabric importers, predict higher costs for businesses and consumers. Karen Sadaka, a co-owner of Apparel Production, fears the shift is "too much, too fast." (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>A federal judge is allowing the Trump administration to move forward with a requirement that noncitizens in the US must register with the federal government. The administration argued they were simply enforcing an already existing requirement for everyone in the country who wasn’t a US citizen to register with the government. Failure to register is considered a crime, and people will be required to carry registration documents with them or risk prison time and fines. The plaintiffs say this registration process is expressly to facilitate Donald Trump’s aim of carrying out mass deportations of people in the country illegally.</p>
