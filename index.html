          <p>Hurricane Erick, a Category 3 storm, made landfall on Mexico's Pacific Coast in the state of Oaxaca, bringing sustained winds of 125 mph and heavy rainfall. The hurricane, which had briefly intensified to a Category 4, is expected to weaken as it moves inland, but is still forecast to produce heavy rainfall and trigger life-threatening flash flooding and mudslides. President Claudia Sheinbaum reported damage mainly to the coast of Oaxaca and the Costa Chica of Guerrero, with 14 municipalities affected by the rain and winds. While there have been no immediate reports of deaths or injuries, authorities are urging residents to take precautions as the storm sweeps across the region.</p>

          <p>Oil prices rose nearly 3% after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered intensified attacks on Iran, raising concerns about potential disruptions to global oil supplies. U.S. crude oil closed up $2.06 to $77.20, while Brent crude added $2.15 to $78.85 a barrel, marking its highest close since January 22. The escalation follows an Iranian missile strike on a hospital in Beersheba, prompting threats from Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz against Iran's leader. JPMorgan warned that regime change in Iran, a top OPEC producer, could lead to sustained higher oil prices due to supply disruptions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>International calls for restraint are being ignored as the conflict between Iran and Israel intensifies, with the world watching to see if President Trump will deepen U.S. involvement through direct military strikes. The White House has stated that Trump will decide within two weeks whether to attack Iran, prompting warnings from the Kremlin about a potential ‚Äúterrible spiral of escalation.‚Äù As diplomacy appears increasingly unlikely, leaders from both sides show no signs of backing down from the escalating conflict.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is facing mounting pressure both domestically and internationally as he considers potential military action against Iran. While hawkish Republicans are urging aggressive action, others are calling for restraint, creating a divide within Trump's base. Democrats are raising concerns over Trump's war power authority, and international actors are split on whether the U.S. should intervene. Trump says he will make a decision at the last possible moment, as circumstances can change quickly, especially during war.</p>

          <p>Roberto Minervini's new film, "The Damned," explores the Civil War through a naturalistic, observational lens, focusing on the psychological and existential experiences of soldiers rather than traditional battle scenes. The film, set in the winter of 1862, follows a group of volunteer soldiers in the U.S. Army as they carry out mundane military tasks. By stripping away the tropes of war films, Minervini highlights the senseless brutality and thwarted masculinity that continue to plague the nation. The director subtly pinpoints the economic inequalities that will bedevil the nation for the next 160 years.</p>

          <p>Tariffs are driving up the cost of materials used in home renovation projects, causing homeowners to reconsider their plans. Suppliers of materials such as lumber, steel, and aluminum have already raised prices for builders, resulting in an average price increase of around $10,000 per home renovation project. Experts recommend pre-ordering materials, prioritizing exterior repairs, and postponing the purchase of new appliances as strategies to mitigate the impact of tariffs on remodeling costs.
