          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has urged Prime Minister Starmer to clarify "unanswered" questions surrounding the dropped espionage charges against two men accused of spying for China. The case collapsed because the government reportedly withheld evidence classifying China as a national security threat, a claim disputed by former Conservative ministers. Badenoch's letter criticizes the government's shifting narrative and demands a senior minister address Parliament, suggesting a failure to confront Beijing on national security. The controversy highlights ongoing political tensions regarding the UK's stance on China and intelligence matters.</p>

The former defensive lineman, now a CBS analyst, has previously drawn attention for his new hairstyle.
