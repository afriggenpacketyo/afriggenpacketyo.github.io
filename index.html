          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering converting grants from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act into a 10% equity stake in Intel, which could make the U.S. government the chipmaker's largest shareholder. This move is part of a broader effort to revitalize the nation's domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities and bolster a key company that has fallen behind global competitors. While discussions are ongoing and no final decision has been made, the proposal aligns with the administration's strategy of creating government-backed national champions in strategic industries.

Although her attacker was successfully prosecuted and jailed in the UK, her claim was rejected because the crime occurred on a foreign-registered aircraft. Her lawyers are now calling for a change in the law, arguing it is irrational that UK courts can prosecute such crimes but the victims are ineligible for support, creating a significant gap in justice for individuals assaulted on international flights bound for the UK.</p>

          <p>A growing travel trend known as "coolcations" has tourists increasingly choosing cooler, quieter, and less crowded destinations over traditional summer hotspots in Europe. This shift is driven by concerns over record-breaking heatwaves and wildfires, prompting travelers to visit places like Scandinavia, the Baltics, and the Scottish Highlands. While this trend may alleviate overtourism in southern Europe, it also poses significant economic challenges for countries like Greece and Spain, which are heavily reliant on peak-season tourism.</p>

          <p>Air Canada has resumed talks with the union representing 10,000 striking flight attendants, whose walkout has entered its fourth day, causing the cancellation of hundreds of daily flights. The core of the dispute is the union's demand for flight attendants to be paid for ground duties, such as boarding passengers, which is not current practice. The ongoing strike has created a three-way standoff between the airline, its workers, and the Canadian government, which is urging a swift resolution to end the significant disruption to travelers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered that tiny flatworms, known as planaria, react to psychiatric drugs like haloperidol in a manner similar to lab rats and mice. This finding suggests the worms could serve as a valuable and more ethical model for studying treatments for mental health disorders such as schizophrenia and drug addiction. Using these regenerative worms in preliminary research could significantly reduce the number of rodents used in scientific testing, offering benefits for both scientific development and animal welfare.</p>

          <p>Feeling the effects of social isolation from the pandemic and remote work, many Gen Z professionals are actively seeking out structured, in-person events to make friends and build a sense of community. Companies and organizations are responding by offering activity-based gatherings, such as cooking classes and pub quizzes, which provide a less awkward environment for socializing than traditional networking. This trend reflects a broader rejection of purely digital connections as young people yearn for real-life interactions to combat a declared loneliness epidemic.</p>

          <p>After meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders, U.S. President Donald Trump announced he had spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin to begin arranging a direct meeting between the two warring leaders. Trump stated that this bilateral meeting would be followed by a trilateral summit including himself, aimed at resolving the nearly four-year-long conflict.

          <h2>India Has the Highest Number of Seafarers Abandoned by Shipowners</h2>

          <p>India leads the world in the number of sailors abandoned on vessels by shipowners who fail to pay wages or cover repatriation costs, leaving crews stranded for months. The issue is largely attributed to the widespread use of "flags of convenience," where ships are registered in countries with lax regulations, making it difficult to identify true owners and enforce labor protections. This practice traps seafarers, many of whom cannot leave their ships without forfeiting their owed salaries.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece warns that the growing trend of Hong Kong residents seeking medical care in mainland China poses a long-term threat to the city's own healthcare system. While mainland services may offer greater convenience and clearer pricing, the author argues that this reliance amounts to an "unofficial outsourcing" of healthcare. This shift could ultimately weaken Hong Kong's medical sector by diminishing its patient base, hindering talent development, and reducing its capacity for clinical innovation.</p>
