            <p>The Federal Trade Commission has filed a lawsuit against Uber, accusing the ride-hailing giant of deceptive billing and cancellation practices related to its Uber One subscription service. The FTC alleges that Uber misled consumers about the benefits of Uber One, made it difficult to cancel memberships, and charged users without their explicit consent. FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson emphasized the agency's commitment to protecting consumers from unwanted subscriptions, highlighting this as the first major action against a tech company during President Trump's second term. Uber has not yet issued a formal response to the lawsuit.</p>

            <p>President Trump has escalated his attacks on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, labeling him a "major loser" and warning of economic slowdown if interest rates aren't immediately lowered. Trump asserts that low inflation justifies preemptive rate cuts, despite Powell's concerns about potential inflationary impacts from tariffs. This pressure comes amid reports that Trump's team is exploring the legality of firing Powell before his term expires in 2026, a move that analysts predict could trigger significant market instability. The independence of the Federal Reserve is a critical aspect of economic stability.</p>

            <p>Researchers exploring the wreckage of the USS Yorktown, a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier sunk during the Battle of Midway in WWII, discovered a vehicle inside the ship's hangar. The NOAA Ocean Exploration team used a remotely operated camera to make the find, identifying the vehicle as potentially a 1940-41 Ford Super Deluxe "Woody." Theories suggest the car may have belonged to Rear Admiral Frank Fletcher or was brought aboard for repairs after damage sustained at the Battle of Coral Sea. The USS Yorktown was first located in 1998 and has been well-documented, but this new discovery adds another layer to its history.</p>

            <p>President Trump's economic approval rating has fallen to its lowest point during his presidency, according to a recent CNBC survey, reflecting widespread discontent over tariffs, inflation, and government spending. The survey indicates a decline in economic optimism since Trump's reelection, with more Americans anticipating a worsening economy and a pessimistic outlook on the stock market. While Trump's Republican base remains supportive, Democrats and independents express significantly negative views on his economic policies. Tariffs appear to be a major source of public disapproval, impacting even some Republicans.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, a case challenging the authority of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (PSTF) to mandate coverage of preventative care under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett seemed inclined to vote against the challenge, potentially securing at least five votes to preserve the ACA's requirement for insurers to cover preventative services. The case hinges on whether PSTF members are properly classified as "inferior officers" supervised by a Senate-confirmed official. A ruling is expected that will impact access to healthcare.</p>

            <p>Pope Francis died at the age of 88 after experiencing several health issues in recent years. His death follows a period of hospitalization for bronchitis and pneumonia, during which he faced respiratory difficulties and kidney problems. In March, it was revealed that he had been close to death on two separate occasions during his hospitalization. The Vatican has not yet released the official cause of death, but the Pope had a history of respiratory illnesses and had part of one lung removed as a young man.</p>

            <p>President Trump has voiced his support for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth after reports surfaced of a second Signal chat where military attack details were allegedly shared, this time including Hegseth's wife and brother. This follows a previous incident where a journalist was inadvertently added to a Signal chat discussing plans to attack Houthi rebels. Hegseth dismissed the reports as "anonymous smears" from disgruntled former employees, while Trump expressed his continued confidence in the Defense Secretary, and the White House has played down the reports.</p>

This comes after reports that xAI was seeking up to $6 billion in funding at a $50 billion valuation to acquire Nvidia chips.</p>
