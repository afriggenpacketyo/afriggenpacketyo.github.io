          <p>SpaceX launched its ninth integrated flight test of the Super Heavy-Starship rocket, encountering issues after previous failures. The Super Heavy booster experienced a catastrophic failure during its descent, while the Starship upper stage reached its planned sub-orbital trajectory. However, a door malfunction prevented the deployment of simulated Starlink satellites, and a propellant leak caused the Starship to spin out of control, leading to an uncontrolled reentry and likely disintegration over the Indian Ocean. SpaceX will review the data to improve Starship's reliability for future missions aimed at making life multiplanetary.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's ninth Starship test flight reached orbit but experienced a propellant leak, causing the spacecraft to spin out of control and reenter Earth's atmosphere at an unfavorable angle. This resulted in the likely disintegration of the vehicle over the Indian Ocean, despite achieving its planned trajectory. The company stated that data from the test will help improve Starship's reliability, as they continue their iterative engineering approach. While the vehicle reached orbit, the mission failed to deploy a set of mock Starlink satellites due to a door malfunction.</p>

Musk, who previously led the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), stated that the bill undermines the work of the DOGE team, as it increases the deficit by $3.8 trillion by 2034 according to the Congressional Budget Office. The bill includes extensions of Trump's 2017 tax cuts, border security spending, work requirements on Medicaid, and rollbacks of clean energy tax credits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has ordered US embassies to temporarily halt scheduling appointments for student visas, citing plans to expand social media vetting of applicants. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the pause would last until further guidance is issued, with the goal of stepping up screening for student and foreign exchange visas. This move comes amid Trump's criticism of elite colleges, which he accuses of being too left-wing and enabling antisemitism. The administration has also frozen funding for universities and moved to deport students, actions often blocked by the courts.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine indicates a significant decline in the mental health of mothers in the United States from 2016 to 2023. The percentage of mothers rating their mental health as "excellent" decreased sharply, while those reporting "poor" mental health increased, especially among single parents and those with uninsured children. Researchers suggest factors like high housing costs, rising child care expenses, and lack of paid parental leave contribute to this decline. While COVID-19 exacerbated the issue, the decline predates the pandemic, reflecting broader societal trends.</p>

          <p>A Delta flight from Detroit to Los Angeles made an emergency landing in Minneapolis due to a sick dog in the cabin. A veterinarian on board volunteered to provide emergency care, prompting the decision to divert the flight. Medical personnel met the dog and its owner upon arrival in Minneapolis, and the plane resumed its journey to Los Angeles after a 2½-hour delay. The incident occurred on Memorial Day, a day notorious for travel delays, and was among 7,691 flights delayed to, from, and within the U.S.</p>

Lau seeks unspecified damages for alleged violations of her dignity and privacy, as well as the anxiety she has faced since the investigation was revealed.</p>

The cost-cutting measures come during a challenging period for Six Flags, which posted a net loss of $220 million in the first quarter, citing weather variability and economic uncertainty.

          <p>Nitrous oxide, or "laughing gas," is increasingly misused in the US, fueled by the rise of vaping and easily accessible large canisters. The Annual Report of America's Poison Centers shows a 58% increase in reports of intentional exposure to nitrous oxide between 2023-2024. Regular inhalation can lead to hypoxia, nerve damage, and paralysis. The gas is legally sold as a culinary product, and companies market it in colorful canisters with flavors, contributing to the rise in misuse. While some states have outlawed recreational use, the loophole remains open, prompting concern and calls for stricter regulations.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that only about a fourth of mothers in the United States report having "excellent" physical and mental health, with significant declines in self-reported maternal mental health from 2016 to 2023. The study, which examined nearly 200,000 mothers, found that "excellent" mental health declined from 38.4% to 25.8%, while "fair/poor" mental health rose from 5.5% to 8.5%. Declines occurred across socioeconomic subgroups, but were more pronounced among single female parents, those with lower education, and those with publicly insured children. Researchers point to limited access to mental health care, social isolation, and broader stressors as potential causes.</p>
