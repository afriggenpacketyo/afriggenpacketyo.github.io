          <p>The weakening U.S. dollar is creating both opportunities and challenges for central banks globally, as they grapple with currency appreciation, inflation, and trade competitiveness. While a weaker dollar can ease debt burdens and lower import costs, potentially allowing for rate cuts, it also complicates export competitiveness, especially amidst renewed U.S. tariffs. Some emerging markets may be hesitant to cut rates due to concerns about capital flight and debt burdens, while others, like the Swiss National Bank, may need to take drastic measures to devalue their currency if capital inflows persist. Central banks are generally avoiding currency wars, seeking to maintain stability in the global economy.</p>

          <p>U.S. stocks and the dollar experienced a significant decline following President Donald Trump's intensified criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering interest rates preemptively.

Gold prices, however, surged to a record high as investors sought safe-haven assets amidst economic uncertainty.</p>
