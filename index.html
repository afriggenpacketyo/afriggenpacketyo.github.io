          <p>United Kingdom inflation fell to 2.8% in February, lower than anticipated, primarily due to decreased clothing prices from numerous sales.  This drop, while significant, is still above the Bank of England's target, and future increases are expected due to upcoming tax rises and increased living wages.</p>
