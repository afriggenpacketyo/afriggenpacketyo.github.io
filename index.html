          <p>A drone launched by Houthi militants from Yemen successfully struck the Ramon International Airport near Eilat, Israel, marking a notable breach of the country's air defenses. The attack, which caused minor injuries and limited damage to the passenger terminal, was hailed by the Houthis as a direct response to recent Israeli strikes in Yemen. While Israel intercepted most of the drones in the barrage, this direct hit on a significant infrastructure target represents a serious escalation in the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed group, which has intensified since the start of the war in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump made his first appearance at the U.S. Open in a decade, attending the men's singles final in New York. Accompanied by several members of his staff, he watched the match from a luxury suite at Arthur Ashe Stadium. His presence drew a mixed response from the audience, with reports of both cheers and boos when he was shown on the stadium's screens.

          <p>Actor Ryan Reynolds shared an anecdote about a moment he infuriated Denzel Washington while filming the 2012 movie "Safe House." During an emotionally intense death scene for Washington's character, Reynolds' cell phone went off, playing his Frank Sinatra ringtone and ruining the take. Reynolds humorously recalled pretending the phone belonged to someone else to deflect the legendary actor's anger. The story was told during a discussion at the Toronto Film Festival, offering a lighthearted glimpse into the pressures of filmmaking.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that the U.S. government could be forced to issue refunds totaling between $750 billion and $1 trillion if the Supreme Court strikes down President Trump's tariffs. The administration is seeking an expedited ruling from the court after a federal appeals court found the tariffs illegal, arguing a delayed decision would cause significant economic disruption. While expressing confidence in a favorable outcome, officials are also preparing alternative plans to implement levies through other legal authorities should the court rule against them.

          <p>Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth condemned President Trump's recent statements about sending troops to Chicago, stating he has "essentially just declared war on a major city in his own nation." Duckworth emphasized that such a move would constitute an illegal order and noted there are currently no indications of an actual military deployment being prepared. She criticized the administration for not coordinating with local law enforcement, suggesting a lack of genuine interest in fighting crime. Her comments respond to the president's escalating threats to intervene in Democrat-led cities.</p>

          <p>A contentious decision by the McLaren Formula 1 team became a major talking point at the Italian Grand Prix. After a slow pit stop dropped Lando Norris behind his teammate and championship rival Oscar Piastri, the team ordered Piastri to let Norris back through to restore the pre-stop running order. The decision was justified by the team principal as consistent with their principles of fairness, as the position change was due to a team error.

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that he is ready to move to a "second phase" of sanctions against Russia, indicating a potential escalation of economic pressure on Moscow. While he has threatened such measures before, his latest comments suggest a more aggressive posture as the war in Ukraine continues. The new sanctions could reportedly include secondary tariffs targeting countries that purchase Russian energy exports, such as India and China. The move aims to cripple the Russian economy and force President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's defence secretary confirmed that the government is considering an expansion of its plan to use military sites for housing asylum seekers. The initiative is part of a broader effort to end the costly and controversial use of hotels for accommodation. With the new Home Secretary expected to announce formal proposals soon, officials are assessing additional military and non-military locations for temporary housing. The policy shift comes as the number of people crossing the English Channel continues to rise, posing a significant challenge for the government.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Rand Paul sharply criticized Vice President JD Vance for his comments supporting a recent U.S. military strike that killed 11 alleged drug traffickers. Vance had called the action the "highest and best use of our military," a sentiment Paul labeled as "despicable and thoughtless" for glorifying killing without a trial. The public disagreement highlights a significant rift within the Republican party over the administration's increasingly militarized approach to combating drug cartels. The controversial strike has also heightened tensions with Venezuela.</p>

The alert caused brief pauses at sporting events and other public gatherings but was declared a success by the government. The system has been used for real warnings five times since its first national test in 2023.</p>
