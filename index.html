          <p>An opinion piece discusses China's significant investments in Africa and the resulting misunderstandings. The author suggests China should experiment with a non-governmental organization (NGO) model to improve its soft power and build human connections. Unlike Western nations with vibrant NGO ecosystems, China relies heavily on centralized state power for aid, leading to perceptions of neocolonialism. The author believes an NGO approach could address cultural clashes and social isolation experienced by Chinese nationals working in Africa, fostering compassion and shared humanity.

          <p>President Trump appealed to Vladimir Putin to stop the war in Ukraine following a deadly attack on Kyiv. Trump, who promised to end the war in 24 hours during his campaign, expressed his desire to reach a ceasefire agreement before his 100th day in office. Simultaneously, a federal judge blocked Trump's attempts to alter voting requirements, which were criticized for potentially disenfranchising millions of voters.

          <p>Robert Crimo III, the perpetrator of the 2022 Highland Park July 4th parade mass shooting, was sentenced to seven consecutive life sentences without parole. He killed seven people and wounded 48 others. Crimo did not attend the sentencing hearing. The sentence provides a sense of closure for the victims' families, but does not equate to true justice. The attack led to Illinois banning assault weapons.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is dismantling the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), a foreign aid agency started by George W. Bush. The agency, which focuses on boosting economic growth in low- to middle-income countries through private sector investments, faces major staff cuts and termination of existing grants. DOGE officials did not provide specific reasons for the cuts, contrasting with the administration's rationale for cutting USAID. The move raises concerns about the loss of an effective foreign aid model.</p>

          <p>The US and China are providing conflicting accounts regarding the status of trade talks, as President Trump claims active discussions while China denies any negotiations on tariffs. This disagreement comes amid an ongoing trade war, with the US imposing high tariffs on Chinese goods and China retaliating with tariffs on US goods. Experts suggest that the Trump administration may be softening its stance due to market volatility and economic concerns. However, China appears to be maintaining a firm position, demanding the US roll back tariffs before engaging in negotiations.</p>

          <p>Just Stop Oil (JSO) announced that it will end its campaign of civil disobedience due to tough new policing powers. The group claims it has achieved its goal of securing a government commitment to no new oil and gas licenses. However, the end of JSO raises questions about the future of climate activism and whether more radical and clandestine actions will emerge. Critics argue that JSO's disruptive tactics alienated the public, while others believe the legal changes amount to an attack on democracy.</p>
