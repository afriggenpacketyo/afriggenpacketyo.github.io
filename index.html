          <p>President Trump has publicly praised Elon Musk as a "patriot" and "brilliant guy" despite Musk stepping back from his role at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Trump defended Musk's work on federal reform, highlighting his contributions to both the campaign and DOGE, which aims to cut waste and streamline federal agencies. These remarks come amidst heightened tensions for Tesla, including a firebombing incident and security threats. Trump expressed hope for Musk's continued involvement, acknowledging his technological contributions, including SpaceX and Starlink.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed executive actions focused on education, including measures aimed at curbing Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives in colleges and K-12 schools. One order targets college accreditors, alleging abuse of authority through discriminatory DEI standards, while another seeks to revise school discipline guidance to emphasize objective behavior over DEI considerations. Education Secretary Linda McMahon stated these orders aim to invite more competition in higher education accreditation, ensure transparency in college finances, and support new technologies in the classroom. These actions reflect Trump's broader conservative agenda in education, including rolling back policies from the previous administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized Ukrainian President Zelenskyy for refusing to recognize Russian control over Crimea, suggesting it hinders peace negotiations. Trump hinted the U.S. might be willing to formally recognize Russia's annexation of Crimea as part of a peace deal, a proposal Zelenskyy has rejected as unconstitutional. US Vice-President JD Vance outlined a vision for a deal that would "freeze the territorial lines" close to where they are today, but did not elaborate on the specifics of the geographic concessions that would need to be made. Trump stated his priority was to end the war and not to take sides.</p>

          <p>President Trump's job approval rating has steadily declined during his first three months in office, according to a New York Times polling average. His approval rating has fallen to approximately 45%, down from 52% one week after his inauguration. This decline is slightly faster compared to his predecessors, and about half of the country now disapproves of his performance.

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aiming to reform college accreditation based on "results" rather than "woke ideology." The order directs the Department of Education to hold accreditors accountable and recognize new ones, targeting agencies that require schools to engage in unlawful discrimination under the guise of DEI. Trump also signed an order to enforce laws requiring universities to disclose foreign gifts, specifically calling out Harvard for alleged violations. The administration believes accreditation entities have become too focused on ideology instead of merit and actual results.</p>

The discovery highlights a predator-prey relationship between dinosaurs and mammals 125 million years ago.

The bill would limit energy credits to 10 years, half the originally promised 20 years, and end incentives upon the sale of the house.

          <p>England's NHS safety watchdog warns that extreme tiredness and exhaustion among NHS staff pose a significant risk to patients. Common problems include medication errors, impaired decision-making, reduced attention, and disrespectful behavior. The Health Services Safety Investigations Body cited examples of mistakes made with pregnancy scans and chemotherapy drugs, with fatigue identified as a contributing factor. The watchdog recommends better systems to monitor fatigue and increased awareness among staff and employers.</p>

          <p>Water companies in the UK are proposing a third-party monitoring system for sewage pollution levels to rebuild consumer trust, acknowledging that self-monitoring is ineffective. This proposal is part of a submission to the government's review of the water sector. Campaigners have long criticized self-reporting, claiming it conceals the true extent of pollution. The industry also requests universal water meters to ensure fairer billing and encourage water conservation. This comes after incidents of misreporting by water companies uncovered by regulators.</p>
