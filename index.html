          <p>A cyberattack on Collins Aerospace, a check-in technology provider, caused widespread disruptions and cancellations at several major European airports, including Heathrow, Berlin, and Brussels. The incident highlighted the aviation industry's vulnerability to supply chain cyberattacks, as reliance on shared digital systems creates far-reaching ripple effects when one vendor is compromised. Efforts are ongoing to resolve the issues, with some airports asking airlines to cancel flights and revert to manual check-in processes. Cybersecurity experts emphasize the need for regular software updates, robust backup systems, and improved information-sharing to enhance resilience against such threats.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation prohibiting most local and federal law enforcement, including US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, from wearing face masks while on duty, effective January 2026. This measure aims to increase transparency and protect residents from what Newsom termed "secret police," following incidents of masked federal agents during immigration raids in Los Angeles. While exceptions exist for undercover operations, disease prevention, or wildfires, federal officials have criticized the ban, asserting California lacks jurisdiction over federal agencies and that agents will continue to protect their identities. The new laws also require officers to identify themselves and restrict federal agents' access to schools and hospitals without warrants.</p>

Williams, who won back-to-back Women's Super League titles under Beard, praised him as a mentor and friend who profoundly impacted her career and the broader women's game. Colleagues and players remember Beard for his warmth, non-judgmental nature, and dedication to developing individuals and the sport.

          <p>Dwayne Johnson is taking on his most ambitious role yet, portraying real-life MMA fighter Mark Kerr in the dramatic film "The Smashing Machine," a significant departure from his usual action-oriented projects. Johnson underwent extensive makeup and prosthetics daily to transform into Kerr, who battled drug addiction and depression, a role he says allowed him to "rip myself open" emotionally. This shift reflects his desire for artistic fulfillment beyond box office success, drawing on personal trauma from his youth. Director Benny Safdie paired Johnson with Emily Blunt, with the actor acknowledging initial fears about tackling such a raw and vulnerable character.</p>

          <p>Great Britain and Northern Ireland concluded the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo without a gold medal for the first time in 22 years, marking their worst performance in two decades. The team secured a total of five medals, tying their lowest return since 2005, and finished 21st in the medal table, significantly missing their top-eight target. This outcome represents a notable decline from their previous championship, where they equaled their best haul of 10 medals. The women's 4x100m relay quartet, Olympic silver medalists, narrowly missed a podium finish, symbolizing the team's struggles.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government has firmly rejected former U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion to reestablish an American presence at Afghanistan's Bagram Air Base, four years after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal. Trump had renewed his call to retake the sprawling military facility, hinting at ongoing discussions and potential unspecified actions if denied. Chief Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid urged the U.S. to adopt "realism and rationality," citing the Doha Agreement's pledge against using or threatening force against Afghanistan's territorial integrity. The Taliban emphasized that ceding any part of their soil is "out of the question."</p>

          <p>A child psychologist, drawing on research from over 200 parent-child relationships, outlines nine essential practices for raising children with exceptional social skills, emphasizing emotional safety and authentic connection. These practices include openly discussing feelings, modeling empathy, fostering genuine confidence, teaching conflict resolution, and validating children's emotions. The article stresses the importance of helping kids recognize social cues, allowing them to resolve minor conflicts independently, and treating mistakes as learning opportunities. Ultimately, listening more than lecturing enables children to become empathetic, resilient, and capable of forming strong, healthy relationships throughout their lives.</p>

While the ruling did not immediately eradicate all forms of segregation, it served as a monumental step towards achieving civil rights and pushing the United States closer to its foundational ideals of equality.

The piece argues that while these movements offer an illusion of domestic bliss, they often obscure policies that undermine women's autonomy, economic independence, and access to social safety nets.

          <p>Anne Applebaum and Garry Kasparov express grave concerns about the erosion of democratic norms in the United States, drawing parallels to Russia's slide into autocracy, notably the silencing of political satire.

Both emphasize the profound urgency of the 2026 midterm elections, labeling them a critical "battlefield" for the future of American democracy. The article underscores the need for active citizen engagement and resistance to counter these authoritarian tendencies, warning that inaction could lead to irreversible changes.</p>

          <p>Evelyn Palla, currently the head of DB Regio, Germany's regional rail division, is reportedly set to be appointed as the new CEO of the struggling national railway, Deutsche Bahn.

Her appointment comes as Deutsche Bahn faces a significant crisis, marked by notorious unreliability, with only about 60% of its long-distance trains running on time recently. Transportation Minister Patrick Schnieder has proposed Palla for the role, with a new strategy to address the railway's issues expected soon.</p>

Critics, including Scottish Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth, argue there is a "moral imperative" to keep families together, especially given the hardships endured in Gaza.

          <p>Donald Trump's repeated attempts to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence, including efforts to fire Governor Lisa Cook and demands for aggressive interest rate cuts, are drawing strong warnings from economists. They argue that political interference in central banking has historically led to disastrous consequences, such as high inflation and economic damage, citing examples like Turkey's recent economic crisis. The article emphasizes that Trump's actions, driven by a desire for short-term economic boosts, risk backfiring by causing higher inflation and unsettling financial markets.

However, long-term residents in traditionally working-class neighborhoods like Crown Heights view these spaces as "harbingers of gentrification" and a threat to local culture. Concerns include rising rents, potential displacement of existing residents, and the transient nature of co-living tenants, who often stay for less than a year.
