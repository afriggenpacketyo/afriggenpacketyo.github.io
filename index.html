          <p>President Trump and Russian President Putin are holding a high-stakes summit in Alaska, with discussions expected to span several hours, focusing primarily on the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Trump conveyed his openness to exploring business opportunities with Russian delegates once the war concludes, a point he believes Putin is eager to pursue. However, Trump also noted that Russia's recent overnight attacks on Ukraine, including ballistic missiles and numerous drones, actually weaken Putin's negotiating stance rather than strengthening it. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, excluded from the summit, emphasized his reliance on the United States and called for a trilateral meeting to achieve a just and lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Bryan Kohberger, convicted in the 2022 murders of four University of Idaho students, is reportedly being subjected to continuous taunting by fellow inmates at a maximum-security prison. Sources indicate that prisoners are yelling through air vents into his cell day and night, significantly impacting his ability to sleep. The Idaho Department of Correction confirmed awareness of Kohberger's complaints, noting that he is housed alone in a restrictive unit for his safety. Experts suggest this constant heckling likely deprives Kohberger of the control and infamy he may have sought, presenting a unique psychological challenge within the prison environment.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 experienced mild pressure, yet the healthcare sector saw a notable rebound, boosted by UnitedHealth's significant jump after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a major stake. This market rotation occurred as momentum stocks like Palantir and GE Vernova faced declines. Meanwhile, consumer sentiment for early August worsened due to concerns over future inflation and the economy, despite consumers discounting the worst-case scenario for tariffs. HSBC also downgraded Cisco Systems, although the CNBC Investing Club highlighted the company's growing traction in AI infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb has filed a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's federal takeover of the city's police force, labeling the actions as "brazenly unlawful" and an infringement on D.C.'s self-governance. The suit seeks a temporary restraining order to halt U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi's directive appointing Drug Enforcement Administrator Terry Cole as head of the D.C. police. District Court Judge Ana Reyes has scheduled a hearing on the request, as Mayor Muriel Bowser has already declared Bondi's order unlawful and instructed Police Chief Pamela Smith not to comply. The lawsuit also seeks a declaration that Trump's executive order violates the Constitution's separation of powers.</p>

This article explains how credit card minimum payments are calculated, typically ranging from 1% to 3% of the balance, plus interest and fees; for a $3,000 balance at 24% APR, this could mean $55 to $85 monthly. Paying only the minimum can trap individuals in long-term debt due to compounding interest. To escape this cycle, strategies like balance transfers, debt consolidation loans, debt settlement, credit counseling, and hardship programs are recommended to help regain financial control.

          <p>Calls are intensifying to prosecute starvation as a war crime, a phenomenon experts say is resurging in conflicts globally, from Sudan to Gaza. While categorized as a war crime under international law, including the Geneva Conventions and Rome Statute, it has never been prosecuted as a stand-alone offense in an international court. Challenges include proving intent and jurisdictional complexities, though legal views are evolving to include "indirect intent." Recent developments, such as UN resolutions and the ICC's first stand-alone warrants for starvation against Israeli officials, mark a historic shift, raising cautious optimism that perpetrators may finally face justice.</p>

          <p>Technology analyst Gil Luria asserts that U.S. government intervention in struggling chipmaker Intel is "essential" for national security, following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in the company.

Discussions reportedly involve using funds from the CHIPS Act, which has already allocated billions to Intel. The analyst likened the importance of domestic chip production to the necessity of producing shell casings for nuclear arsenals, highlighting the strategic imperative given the rise of superintelligent AI.</p>

The U.S. National Hurricane Center is urging residents in the northern Leeward Islands to monitor its progress due to potential heavy rainfall and dangerous surf conditions.

The bitter power struggle between President Luis Arce and former President Evo Morales has fractured the dominant Movement Toward Socialism party, offering the opposition its best chance in two decades.

          <h2>Trump's Potential Fed Chair Picks Signal Shift Towards Lower Interest Rates</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's expanding list of potential candidates for Federal Reserve chair, including current and former Fed officials and prominent economists, signals a strong inclination towards lowering the central bank's benchmark interest rate. Many candidates, such as Kevin Warsh, advocate for "regime change" or aggressive rate cuts, believing current rates are "too high." Others, like Kevin Hassett and Larry Lindsey, criticize the Fed's lack of transparency and "intellectual diversity." This suggests that a new Fed chair under Trump could bring significant changes to monetary policy and the central bank's operational approach, impacting the broader economy.</p>

          <p>U.S. shoppers are driving a jewelry splurge, contrasting sharply with weaker consumer sentiment in Europe and China, according to Danish brand Pandora. Pandora's CEO noted an 8% rise in U.S. sales while reporting declines in China and several European markets. Despite this current strength, tariffs, particularly on products manufactured in Thailand, are emerging as a significant future headwind for jewelry brands. Pandora has updated its tariff guidance, anticipating substantial hits in 2025 and 2026, which, alongside a weakening dollar and rising silver prices, could undermine the current robust U.S. consumer demand.</p>

          <p>With Federal Reserve interest rate cuts likely in September, certificate of deposit (CD) account holders whose accounts are maturing soon should take proactive steps to maximize their earnings. Savers are advised to research competitive rates, especially from online banks, before their current accounts automatically roll over into potentially lower-yield options. Re-evaluating personal budgets is crucial to determine if more funds can be locked into new, potentially longer-term CDs to capitalize on still-elevated rates. Communicating plans with banks and considering a financial advisor can ensure continued interest-earning success amidst changing rate climates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Alaska summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin highlights their complex and evolving relationship, a dynamic that Trump previously characterized as strong but has recently described as "crazy" due to Russia's intensified attacks on Ukraine. Despite past praise for Putin, Trump has expressed disappointment and frustration, leading to a tempered approach to the summit, now framed as a "feel-out meeting." While Trump has supplied American weapons to Ukraine and imposed indirect pressure on Moscow, questions remain about his willingness to push Putin for an end to the conflict, especially given Putin's history as a "shrewd manipulator."</p>

          <p>The High Court is deliberating on an injunction sought by Epping Forest District Council to prevent the housing of asylum seekers at The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, citing "unacceptable" risks to public safety. The council argues that the hotel's use for asylum accommodation has fueled "community tension" and violent protests, which escalated after a man living there was charged with sexual assault, though he denies the allegations. The council contends the hotel is no longer a true hotel and poses a risk due to its proximity to three schools. Lawyers for the hotel owner argue an injunction would cause hardship and set a dangerous precedent.</p>

          <p>This article argues that liberal politicians and journalists who downplay Washington D.C.'s crime rates inadvertently bolster President Trump's narrative, despite the dubious nature of his federal police takeover. While D.C.'s violent crime rates have fallen, the murder rate remains disproportionately high in historically marginalized, predominantly Black neighborhoods. The author emphasizes that dismissing these real dangers, particularly for working-class and poor residents, creates a vacuum that Trump can exploit by appearing to address their concerns, however cynically. The piece underscores the importance of acknowledging the grim realities of crime in certain areas, regardless of political affiliations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's federal takeover of law enforcement in Washington, D.C., is simultaneously viewed as an authoritarian menace and a farce, according to this analysis. While it normalizes abuses of power and sets concerning legal precedents for potential future expansions, its current execution appears "impotent" and "haphazard," lacking the systematic planning for effective repression. The article emphasizes that Trump's "ad hoc authoritarianism" asserts powers conveniently but has not yet fundamentally compromised democratic functions or civil rights. The key question remains whether this initial incompetence will evolve into a more serious and effective campaign of repression, making the situation both absurd and dangerous.</p>

Many institutions face deficits, driven by rising tuition fees and a decline in international student numbers.
