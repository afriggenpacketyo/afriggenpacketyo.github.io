        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oxford Economics projects an $8.5 billion decrease in spending from international tourists in the U.S. this year, attributing the decline to negative perceptions related to trade and immigration policies. This decrease is expected to result in a 9% drop in international arrivals. The World Travel & Tourism Council estimates an even larger potential economic loss of $12.5 billion for the U.S. economy in 2025, impacting communities, jobs, and businesses nationwide. The article highlights that flight bookings to the U.S. are down 11% year-over-year, with significant lags in bookings from Europe and Canada, suggesting travelers are opting for alternative destinations.</p>

          <p>Tesco has introduced AI-powered cameras at self-checkouts to combat shoplifting, which has seen a record rise in the UK. The cameras identify when an item isn't scanned correctly and display a replay for the customer. While some shoppers have mocked the technology, comparing it to VAR in football, others are concerned about the invasive nature of the surveillance. One Tesco worker expressed relief, citing the pressure of monitoring multiple checkouts alone. Some customers have expressed that they would not use the self-checkouts again as a result of the implementation of the new technology.</p>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship successfully reached orbit during its ninth test flight, marking progress toward sending humans to Mars, but experienced a propellant leak that led to loss of control. The spacecraft re-entered Earth's atmosphere at an uncontrolled angle and mostly burned up, with remaining debris expected to fall into the Indian Ocean. SpaceX plans to review data from the flight test to improve Starship's reliability, and this test included modifications based on previous flight failures. The company aims for Starship to be fully reusable, capable of launching, landing, and flying again with minimal maintenance.</p>

          <p>The Defense Department has ceased requiring civilian employees to submit weekly reports detailing their accomplishments, a practice initiated by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Instead, employees are now asked to contribute at least one idea to enhance efficiency or eliminate waste within the department. Other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, have also discontinued the weekly reports. The initial requirement, influenced by Elon Musk and DOGE, aimed to eliminate waste by having employees justify their employment with a list of five weekly achievements.</p>

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation stated that the needs on the ground are great, and the volume of people at the southern Gaza distribution site was so overwhelming that it had prompted the foundation’s team to retreat. The Israeli military said troops fired warning shots in the area outside the compound. The new system has also raised concerns from Palestinians and the international community that the approach, which concentrates sites in southern Gaza, will forcibly displace residents into a single area of the enclave.</p>

          <p>The German government has agreed to suspend family reunification for refugees with subsidiary protection status for at least two years, primarily affecting Syrian families. This decision is based on claims that the country's ability to integrate refugees has reached a breaking point, with cities and municipalities reportedly at their limit. Critics argue that separating families can cause significant psychological strain, hindering integration and potentially leading to irregular immigration. The German Cabinet approved the restrictions on family reunification, but the draft bill must still be passed in the Bundestag.</p>

Sir Mark also highlighted the need for radical reform in policing, including fewer policing organizations and a proper national police agency.

The government maintains that many of their concerns have been addressed, and the Ministry of Justice said they will never put the public at risk by running out of prison places again.

The water industry regulator stated the company had failed its customers and the environment, and confirmed the fines will be paid by the company and its investors, not customers. Ofwat's investigation revealed that three-quarters of Thames Water's storm overflows were spilling routinely, not just in exceptional circumstances. The regulator also fined Thames an additional £18.2m for "undeserved" payouts to shareholders that did "not properly reflect the company's delivery performance."</p>

Cuomo's proposal aims to raise wages for roughly 800,000 workers and combat assertions that he is more attuned to business interests than those of the working class.

          <p>The Haitian government has contracted with Erik Prince, founder of Blackwater, to combat gangs terrorizing the nation. Prince's team is reportedly deploying drones to target gang members and recruiting Haitian American military veterans. The involvement of private military contractors marks a significant escalation in Haiti's crisis, exacerbated by the failure of a U.N.-backed police mission. Concerns are raised about the lack of oversight and the potential for civilian casualties, and the full terms of the Haitian government's arrangement with Mr. Prince, including how much it is paying him, are unknown.</p>

The reinstallation emphasizes the diversity and complexity of the art, incorporating sound and visual elements to enrich the experience. This is the first time in a long time that there has been this much emphasis on the importance of art of the African, Pacific, and American continents, as the rest of the world is slowly beginning to value the art for what it is.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the evolution of the word "pride" from its early association with arrogance and sin to its current use as a symbol of LGBTQ empowerment. The shift began in the 14th century, and the concept of gay pride emerged before the Stonewall Uprising in 1969. The late organizer L. Craig Schoonmaker advocated for "pride" as a unifying slogan for the movement, emphasizing self-esteem rather than power. Despite progress, the LGBTQ community faces ongoing challenges, including anti-LGBTQ legislation and corporate backlash, making the word's meaning more relevant than ever.</p>

Home prices are up nearly 50% since before the pandemic, and mortgage interest rates have increased. The tariff drama under President Trump has made it more expensive to build new homes and increased uncertainty for potential homebuyers. Many Americans have postponed home purchases due to concerns about job loss, high mortgage rates, and stock market volatility, resulting in a "holding pattern" for the housing market.</p>
