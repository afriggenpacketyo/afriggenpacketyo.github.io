        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has revised its economic growth forecast for China downwards to 4.3% for the coming year, citing ongoing trade disputes and increasing barriers. The report highlights that substantial trade barriers, diminishing confidence, and heightened policy uncertainty are collectively putting downward pressure on global economic growth rates, with China expected to be significantly affected. The OECD anticipates that Chinese exports will be curbed due to newly imposed tariffs, while imports will decrease as production becomes more localized, disproportionately affecting private companies, including foreign entities, that are major exporters.

The artifact was found in rubble near former infantry barracks by a couple who have volunteered at excavations for two decades. Experts believe the stone was part of a larger, brightly painted work, possibly adorning an ornamental arch and gate at the barracks, which were built in 213 A.D. The discovery highlights the grandeur and symbolism present in Roman forts and will be displayed at the Vindolanda museum next year.</p>

Despite the May rebound, Tesla's total sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to the same period last year.

          <p>The United States has doubled its tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%, increasing trade tensions and overshadowing an OECD ministerial meeting. This action has strained U.S. ties with trading partners and prompted a flurry of negotiations to avoid the duties. The OECD has cut its global growth forecast due to the Trump levies, which are affecting trade, consumption, and investment. Despite some legal challenges, the tariffs remain in place for now as an appeals process proceeds.</p>

She took time out as she struggled with fatigue in the build-up to Euro 2022, while another knee injury, that required surgery, forced her to miss the 2023 World Cup.</p>
