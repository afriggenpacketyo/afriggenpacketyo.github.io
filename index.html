          <p>The European Commission's plan to phase out Russian gas, nuclear energy, and liquefied natural gas imports by 2027 has drawn criticism from Eastern European nations, particularly Slovakia and Hungary. These countries, traditionally reliant on cheaper Russian energy supplies, argue that the move is a 'serious mistake' that threatens the region's energy security and economy. Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico characterized the EU's proposal as 'economic suicide,' warning of higher energy prices for consumers and the creation of a new Iron Curtain between the West and Russia. Despite the EU's strategic goal to reduce energy dependence, these nations emphasize the potential harm to their economies.</p>

Timpson also acknowledged the ongoing 'crisis' in prisons, with overcrowding and rising violence, while refuting claims that gangs control major jails.

The UK, which currently has a trade deficit with the U.S., was subject to a baseline 10% levy but spared from higher tariffs.

          <p>An online writing course featuring an AI-recreated Agatha Christie has ignited a debate about the ethics of using artificial intelligence to resurrect deceased figures. While Christie's estate approved the project, ensuring her own words were used, some ethicists argue that it is problematic to put words in her mouth without her consent. The course, created by BBC Maestro, combines academic research and a 'digital prosthetic' to teach aspiring writers, raising questions about authenticity and the potential for blurring boundaries between fact and fiction. This development is part of a growing trend of using AI to create avatars of deceased individuals, prompting discussions about the implications for legacy, consent, and artistic integrity.</p>

          <p>In the Karen Read trial, a second forensic expert, Jessica Hyde, testified that Jennifer McCabe's Google search for hypothermia symptoms occurred after John O'Keefe's body was discovered, contradicting the defense's claim that it happened earlier. Hyde's testimony supported that of another expert, Ian Whiffin, using technical terms to explain how phone data is extracted and interpreted. The defense questioned Hyde's credibility, while the prosecution aimed to establish a firm timeline of evidence collection. The trial continues with Read pleading not guilty to charges related to O'Keefe's death.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers are utilizing advanced instruments, including the world's largest radio telescope and a state-of-the-art radar system, to locate water ice at the moon's south pole. The study estimates that ice constitutes no more than 6% of the lunar soil's top 10 meters and is found in fragmented chunks buried 5-7 meters underground. The findings are intended to assist in selecting landing sites for future lunar missions and inform the design of a China-led research base on the moon. The research aligns with previous findings and offers new insights into the abundance of water ice on the moon.</p>
