          <p>Wesley Yates III, a promising freshman guard for USC, has entered the transfer portal despite earlier indications of his commitment to return for his sophomore year. Yates' departure is a significant setback for USC's backcourt plans, as he was expected to play a key role alongside other talented players. His decision comes amid the evolving landscape of college athletics, with revenue sharing and NIL opportunities influencing player movement. During his freshman season, Yates established himself as a top young scorer, averaging 16.7 points per game and shooting 43% from 3-point range after being inserted into the starting lineup in December.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the influence of online "manfluencers" and the need for Gen X men to engage in conversations about manhood and sexuality with younger generations to counter toxic masculinity. It highlights the contrast between traditional values of responsibility and the self-centered, often misogynistic messages promoted by figures like Andrew Tate and others in the manosphere. The author urges Gen X men to share their experiences and insights on healthy relationships, sexuality, and personal responsibility to inoculate boys against harmful online influences.

          <p>Economists are raising concerns about the formula used by President Trump to calculate tariff rates, arguing that it is based on flawed assumptions. The formula, which divides the country's trade deficit by its exports and then divides by two, is said to inflate tariff rates. Economists argue that the elasticity rate used in the formula is too low, leading to higher tariff rates than are warranted. If the elasticity assumptions are adjusted, no country's tariff would exceed 14%, according to experts.</p>

          <p>With the announcement of sweeping tariffs, U.S. consumers are rushing to buy goods before prices increase. However, experts caution against panic buying and going into debt to beat the tariffs. While stocking up on some items may make sense, consumers should only buy what they can afford and consider their long-term financial situation. Experts do not anticipate any shortages and emphasize that the supply chain is in much better shape than it was during the pandemic. Consumers should avoid making hasty purchases that could worsen their debt situation.  \</br>\<i> (not investment advice) \</i></p>
