          <p>Google is rolling out its Gemini artificial intelligence assistant to its Chrome browser for all Mac and Windows users in the U.S., intensifying its competition with AI startups like OpenAI and Perplexity. The integration allows users to interact with Gemini to understand webpages, manage tasks across tabs, and access Google apps like Calendar and YouTube without leaving their current page. Google is also introducing new "agentic" capabilities, enabling Gemini to perform tasks like booking appointments or ordering groceries. This move places the browser at the center of the battle for consumer AI dominance.</p>

          <h2>Study Quantifies Animal Suffering, Suggests Slower-Growing Chicken Breeds Could Prevent Pain for Pennies</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new paper in the journal Nature Food argues that the severe suffering of chickens raised for meat can be significantly reduced at a minimal cost. Researchers calculated that the average factory-farmed chicken endures approximately 700 hours of pain in its short life due to rapid-growth breeding. The study proposes that switching to slower-growing chicken breeds, a key part of the Better Chicken Commitment, could prevent hours of disabling pain for just a few cents per pound. This approach faces resistance due to slightly higher production costs and environmental trade-offs, sparking a debate on balancing animal welfare with economic and climate concerns.</p>

          <p>In Long Beach, Minnesota, one of the smallest towns in the U.S. with that name, a community landmark combines a tiny chapel and a vibrant garden. The Morning Glory Gardens were established in the 1960s to beautify a swampy area, and the historic Morning Glory chapel was moved to the site in 1981. The chapel, which seats about 12 people comfortably, hosts several weddings each year and serves as a place for quiet reflection for visitors. Maintained by volunteers, the intertwined garden and chapel provide a cherished piece of tranquility for the local community.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, which has lowered conventional mortgage rates, retirees considering reverse mortgages face a more complex situation. Unlike traditional mortgages, reverse mortgage rates are influenced by multiple factors beyond Fed policy, including lender margins and investor appetite, so they may not fall as quickly. However, lower rates can still be beneficial, as they can increase the total amount of home equity a retiree is eligible to borrow. The article advises retirees to shop around for rates and carefully consider whether a fixed-rate or adjustable-rate product best suits their financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hedge fund billionaire David Tepper commented that while the Federal Reserve could implement a few more interest rate cuts, easing monetary policy too aggressively could push the economy into "danger territory." Speaking after the Fed's recent quarter-point rate reduction, Tepper cautioned that further cuts risk reigniting inflation and creating asset bubbles in an already highly valued market. He described his own stance as "constructive because of the easing right now, but also miserable because of the levels," indicating he is wary of high valuations and potential economic risks.

          <p>The United Nations is preparing to cut $500 million from its 2026 budget and reduce its workforce by 20%, which could mean over 3,000 job losses, due to significant funding reductions from the Trump administration. The cuts are forcing the international body to undergo a major review of its sprawling bureaucracy to eliminate overlapping mandates and inefficiencies. This funding crisis affects not only the UN's core budget but also its peacekeeping, humanitarian, and health agencies, with officials warning of a severe impact on global aid programs. The move reflects a broader trend of U.S. withdrawal from multilateral organizations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from deporting a group of unaccompanied Guatemalan children, stating the government's justification for the action "crumbled like a house of cards." The administration had attempted to expel over 70 minors over Labor Day weekend, claiming it was reuniting them with their families at the families' request. However, Judge Timothy Kelly found no evidence that any parents had sought their children's return. The ruling halts the deportations of these children, many of whom have pending immigration cases and are entitled to special protections under U.S. law.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered prehistoric insects, including beetles, flies, and wasps, preserved in 112-million-year-old amber in Ecuador, a first for South America. This finding helps fill a major gap in the fossil record, as most ancient amber has been found in the Northern Hemisphere. The specimens date back to the Cretaceous period, a time when flowering plants were beginning to diversify. The amber provides a "little window into the past," allowing researchers to better understand the ancient rainforest ecosystem and the evolving partnership between insects and plants during the age of dinosaurs.</p>

          <p>An in-depth analysis of fighter compensation challenges the narrative about the pay gap between boxing and the UFC. While top-tier boxers earn significantly more than their UFC counterparts, with just a few boxing stars' earnings matching the UFC's entire roster payout over several years, the distribution of money differs. Data shows that the UFC pays a lower percentage of its revenue to athletes (under 20%) compared to boxing promoters (often over 60%). However, the UFC's structure provides higher minimum pay and spreads compensation more evenly down the fight card, meaning its undercard fighters often earn more.</p>

These attacks are designed to disrupt the Russian economy and hinder its war-making capabilities by targeting the oil and gas industry, which is a critical source of revenue for the Kremlin.
