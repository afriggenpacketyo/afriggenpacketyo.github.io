          <p>The article reports on the UK local elections, where Reform UK made significant gains, challenging the dominance of the Conservative and Labour parties. Reform secured its first Parliamentary by-election victory in Runcorn and Helsby, and Andrea Jenkyns won the mayoral position of Greater Lincolnshire. While Labour retained mayoralties in North Tyneside, Doncaster, and the West of England, Reform performed strongly, coming in second in all three regions. The results indicate a shift in British politics, with Reform appealing to voters dissatisfied with the established parties, particularly on issues such as immigration.

          <p>This New York Times article discusses Reform UK's narrow victory in a parliamentary special election in Runcorn and Helsby, signaling a potential shift in British politics. Sarah Pochin, Reform's candidate, won by just six votes, seizing a seat previously held by Labour. This win, along with potential gains in mayoral and local council elections, could accelerate the country's move toward a more polarized, multiparty system. The article also notes that Reform capitalized on anti-incumbent sentiment and concerns about immigration to win support from traditional Labour voters.</p>

          <p>Temu, the shopping platform owned by PDD Holdings, is adapting its US business model by shifting to a "local fulfillment model" in response to tariffs imposed by President Trump. This means that sales to American customers will now be handled by US-based sellers, with orders fulfilled from within the country. Temu has been actively recruiting US sellers to join the platform, aiming to mitigate the effects of tariffs and the end of the "de minimis" duty exemption policy. The company lists its principal office as based in Boston, and is potentially phasing out China-based merchants.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has permanently barred the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans deemed criminals. The judge, Fernando Rodriguez Jr., ruled that the White House's use of the statute was illegal, as it improperly stretched the meaning of the law, which is intended for times of declared war or military invasion. This decision, while limited to the Southern District of Texas, could influence other cases challenging the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act.
