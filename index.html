          <p>During a major military parade in Beijing commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, Chinese President Xi Jinping stated the world is at a crossroads between "peace or war." The event, attended by leaders like Russia's Vladimir Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong Un, showcased China's advanced military hardware and growing regional influence. In response, U.S. President Donald Trump accused the leaders of conspiring against America, highlighting the escalating geopolitical tensions between the global powers. The parade served as a demonstration of China's military prowess and its ambition to defend its sovereignty.</p>

          <p>English flanker Abi Burton has made an emotional debut at the Rugby World Cup, marking a remarkable comeback just three years after a rare medical condition left her in a coma. Diagnosed with autoimmune encephalitis, Burton was placed in a medically-induced coma for nearly four weeks and had to relearn how to walk and talk upon waking. Her journey from intensive rehabilitation to signing with a professional club and ultimately representing her country highlights an incredible story of resilience and determination against overwhelming odds. The moment was especially poignant for her family, who supported her through the ordeal.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are anticipated to open higher, rebounding from a previous session where fiscal concerns in the U.K. and France drove bond yields to their highest levels in decades. The rise in borrowing costs, such as the U.K.'s 30-year bond yield hitting a 1998 peak, has created market nervousness. This trend is also influenced by global factors, including uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade tariffs and their potential impact on the American fiscal situation. Investors are closely monitoring these developments while awaiting new corporate earnings and inflation data. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a major military parade in Beijing, former U.S. President Donald Trump accused Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un of conspiring against America. In a social media post, Trump sarcastically extended his regards to the leaders as they gathered for the event commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. The statement underscores the adversarial stance Trump has taken towards the growing alignment between the three nations. The parade itself was a significant display of China's military strength and its deepening ties with Russia and North Korea.</p>

          <p>The lively and sometimes boisterous crowds at the US Open in New York have reignited discussions about on-court etiquette within the world of professional tennis. Incidents involving underarm serves, reactions to net-cord winners, and heated exchanges between players have highlighted a cultural clash over sportsmanship. Some players, like Stefanos Tsitsipas, have expressed frustration with tactics they view as disrespectful, while others see them as legitimate strategies in a high-stakes environment.

          <p>Most Asia-Pacific markets experienced losses as investors reacted to rising global bond yields and ongoing uncertainty related to international trade policies. In China, markets fell even as the country's services activity index reached a 15-month high, with focus remaining on the geopolitical implications of its large-scale military parade. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a significant drop, and yields on Japanese Government Bonds rose to multi-year highs. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also declined sharply, reflecting broader regional concerns about economic stability in the face of persistent tariff-related tensions and shifting monetary conditions.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump cannot utilize the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of individuals his administration accuses of being members of a Venezuelan gang. A panel for the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with lower court decisions that the law, intended for use during declared wars, does not apply to modern criminal organizations like Tren de Aragua. This ruling represents a significant legal obstacle for a key administration immigration policy. The administration had argued that courts should not second-guess the president's determination of a national security threat.</p>

          <p>Australia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded by 1.8% year-over-year in the second quarter, surpassing economists' expectations and marking the quickest growth rate since September 2023.

This positive economic data comes after the Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut interest rates and adopted a more optimistic tone regarding the economy's resilience.

          <p>Baroness Sue Gray, a former senior civil servant and ex-chief of staff to Keir Starmer, has questioned the UK government's decision to restrict a civil service internship program to students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Arguing from her own working-class background, Gray stated that she benefited greatly from exposure to people from different walks of life and questioned the evidence for the new policy. The government contends the change will widen the talent pool and help the civil service better reflect the country. However, critics argue it discriminates against some applicants and undermines the principle of merit-based selection.</p>

          <p>An Alabama man was arrested after allegedly sending threatening emails to St. Michael's Abbey in Orange County and then making further threats in person at the location. The Orange County Sheriff's Department identified Joshua Michael Richardson as the suspect after being alerted by a priest at the church. Upon his arrest for making criminal threats, deputies discovered body armor, high-capacity magazines, and other weapons in his vehicle.

          <p>The U.S. Congress has returned from its August recess with a packed and contentious agenda, headlined by an urgent need to pass funding legislation to avert a government shutdown by the end of September. Lawmakers also face debates over several Republican priorities, including a crime crackdown, the potential extension of federal control over Washington D.C.'s police, and efforts to expedite President Trump's nominees. Adding to the tense atmosphere is the ongoing controversy surrounding the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Deep partisan divisions suggest a chaotic session ahead as these critical issues come to a head.</p>

          <p>Nine former directors of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have co-authored a scathing op-ed criticizing Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., accusing him of "endangering every American's health." The piece, published in The New York Times, condemns Kennedy's recent firing of CDC Director Dr. Susan Monarez and other actions they claim undermine the nation's public health system. The former leaders, who served under both Democratic and Republican presidents, argue that these politically motivated decisions are unprecedented and will severely hamper the agency's ability to protect Americans from health threats.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated he plans to send National Guard troops to Chicago to address violent crime, stating, "We're going in." This potential move follows similar controversial deployments of federal forces in Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. While Trump suggested he hopes for a request from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, he asserted his right to act unilaterally to protect the country. Pritzker strongly rebuked the idea, calling the president's comments "unhinged" and vowing to fight any such deployment in court. The situation sets up another potential legal and political battle over the use of military personnel for domestic law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A California jury has cleared rapper Cardi B of liability in a lawsuit brought by a security guard who alleged she was assaulted by the artist in a Beverly Hills medical building in 2018. The guard, Emani Ellis, claimed that Cardi B, who was pregnant at the time, spat on her and cut her face with a fingernail during a heated argument. Cardi B acknowledged the verbal dispute but denied any physical contact, stating she was concerned the guard was violating her privacy. After a short deliberation, the jury found in favor of the rapper, absolving her of all claims.</p>
