          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating New York Attorney General Letitia James, issuing subpoenas concerning her office's civil fraud case against Donald Trump and its corruption case against the NRA. A source indicates the probe, led by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of New York, is examining potential civil rights violations. James's attorney condemned the move as political retribution by the Trump administration, calling it a dangerous weaponization of the justice system. The attorney affirmed they are prepared to cooperate and present the facts.</p>

          <p>Crocs' CEO has announced plans to cut back on orders for the latter half of the year, citing a cautious consumer environment. The company observes that shoppers are hesitant with discretionary spending due to price increases, leading retail partners to reduce future orders. In response to a weaker-than-expected forecast, the company's stock experienced its most significant single-day drop since 2011. Crocs is implementing cost-saving measures and adjusting inventory for its Heydude brand to protect long-term profitability amid these headwinds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has voided a judge's contempt order against Trump administration officials regarding the deportation of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador. The case stems from the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove alleged gang members, which a lower court had temporarily blocked. Despite the injunction, planes carrying the migrants landed in El Salvador, prompting the initial contempt finding for "willful disregard" of the court's order. The 2-1 appellate decision represents a significant victory for the administration, with the majority citing concerns about judicial overreach into executive functions.</p>

          <p>House Majority Whip Tom Emmer has sharply criticized Minnesota Governor Tim Walz following the release of David Brom, who murdered his family with an axe as a teenager in 1988. Brom was granted supervised work release after serving 37 years, a decision made possible by a 2023 state law that limited life sentences for juvenile offenders. Emmer accused the governor of enacting soft-on-crime policies that endanger Minnesotans and undermine the justice system. The law, signed by Walz, applies retroactively and allows certain juvenile offenders to seek release after 15 years.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has issued a stark warning against judicial interference with his tariff policies, claiming they are a "huge positive" for the U.S. economy and stock market. Writing on social media, he argued that a court ruling against the tariffs at this stage would be impossible to recover from and could trigger a severe downturn comparable to the Great Depression of 1929. The comments come as a federal appeals court considers legal challenges to the tariffs, which argue the president has exceeded emergency powers granted by Congress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The predictable four-year price cycle of bitcoin, historically centered around its "halving" event, appears to be breaking down due to fundamental market shifts. Previously, bitcoin would rally to new highs post-halving, but the recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. caused a price surge before the event. This influx of institutional investment, combined with a more supportive regulatory environment, is altering the cryptocurrency's behavior. Analysts suggest that the era of massive 80% price crashes may be over, replaced by more stable, macro-correlated movements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a significant surge over the past two years, the price of gold could see a temporary decline, offering a potential buying opportunity for investors. One key factor is cooling inflation; since gold is often used as an inflation hedge, a decrease in the inflation rate could lead to a corresponding drop in its price. Similarly, an easing of geopolitical tensions, which have historically driven demand for safe-haven assets, could also cause its value to retreat. A combination of these factors might reduce overall investor demand, creating downward pressure on the currently high prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Byron Allen's Allen Media Group has agreed to sell 10 of its network-affiliated television stations to Gray Media in a deal valued at $171 million. The sale includes stations in markets across Alabama, Indiana, Louisiana, and Kentucky and is part of a strategic retrenchment for Allen's company. After a period of rapid expansion aimed at becoming the largest independent TV operator, the company faced significant debt in a challenging broadcast television market. Allen Media Group continues to own other assets, including the Weather Channel, while Gray Media expands its presence.</p>

          <p>A High Court in Pretoria has ordered that the remains of former Zambian President Edgar Lungu be returned to Zambia for a state funeral, ruling against the wishes of his family. Lungu, who died in South Africa while receiving medical treatment, had a tense relationship with his successor, President Hakainde Hichilema. Lungu's family wanted him buried in South Africa, stating he did not want Hichilema involved in his funeral. However, the court determined that the state's right to honor a former head of state with a state funeral supersedes the family's personal wishes.</p>

          <p>Fashion retailer River Island has received court approval for a major restructuring plan to prevent its collapse, which includes closing 33 UK stores. The company cited a shift to online shopping and rising operational costs for its financial difficulties, warning it could run out of cash without the plan. In addition to the closures, the brand will seek rent reductions at 71 other locations and make around 110 head office roles redundant. The chief executive stated the move will align the company's store portfolio with customer needs and provide a platform for its transformation.</p>

          <p>German football club Bayern Munich has altered its partnership with Rwanda, ending the commercial sponsorship aspect that promoted the country's tourism. The move follows months of pressure and criticism related to Rwanda's alleged support for the M23 rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The new arrangement will now focus exclusively on football development through the club's youth academy in Kigali, rather than displaying "Visit Rwanda" advertising. The club had previously sent employees to monitor the situation after receiving a letter from DR Congo's foreign minister.</p>

Primary Health Properties (PHP) had its £1.7bn deal to acquire Assura put on hold by the Competition and Markets Authority over concerns it could reduce competition. Meanwhile, U.S. private equity firm KKR, the rival bidder, is urging Assura's board to accept its slightly higher all-cash offer, arguing it faces no such regulatory hurdles. Assura, which owns over 600 medical properties across the UK, stated its board still supports PHP's offer.</p>

          <p>Gold futures surged to a new record after it was revealed that the U.S. has applied its 39% tariff rate to imports of certain cast gold bars from Switzerland. A U.S. Customs ruling clarified that 1kg and 100-ounce bars, primarily used to back commodity exchange contracts, are not exempt from the steep duties. The move is a significant blow to Switzerland, which dominates the global gold refining industry and saw a massive increase in gold exports to the U.S. this year. The Swiss precious metals association stated the tariff makes these exports economically unviable. (not investment advice)</p>

This divergence places the U.S. in a "completely separate world" legally, ignoring a growing global consensus that climate inaction violates fundamental human rights.</p>
