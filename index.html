          <p>President Donald Trump announced his administration is contemplating a ban on cooking oil imports from China as a retaliatory measure against Beijing's refusal to purchase U.S. soybeans. Characterizing China's actions as an "Economically Hostile Act," Trump suggested that this potential embargo is one of several forms of retribution being considered to support American soybean farmers. The threat has introduced further uncertainty into the ongoing trade negotiations between the two economic superpowers. The announcement immediately impacted financial markets, causing the S&P 500 stock index to fall by the end of the trading day.</p>

This new "Instant Checkout" feature aims to transform e-commerce from a reactive search-based model to a proactive, AI-driven experience that predicts customer needs. The collaboration positions Walmart to compete with other tech giants like Amazon, which is also developing its own AI-powered shopping assistants. The move reflects a broader industry trend toward integrating conversational AI into the consumer purchasing journey to create a more seamless and personalized shopping process.</p>

          <p>A U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has commenced, marked by the return of the final 20 living hostages to Israel in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. As part of the agreement, Israeli forces have withdrawn from parts of Gaza, allowing humanitarian aid groups greater access to deliver critical supplies to hospitals and residents. Former President Donald Trump, addressing the Israeli Knesset, stated that Hamas would be disarmed, by force if necessary. Despite the ceasefire, the situation remains tense as both sides begin to address the widespread destruction from the two-year conflict.</p>

          <p>A family has filed a lawsuit against gaming platform Roblox and chat service Discord, alleging their 13-year-old son was targeted and extorted by a sexual predator he met in a game. The lawsuit claims the predator, posing as a teenager, coerced the boy into sending explicit photos in exchange for in-game gift cards and later threatened to expose him. This case is one of many legal challenges from families and state attorneys general accusing the platforms of failing to protect children from exploitation. In response, Roblox has highlighted new safety features, including age verification and increased chat monitoring, to prevent such incidents.</p>

          <p>U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll revealed a modernization strategy focused on equipping every infantry soldier with a personal drone, inspired by their effectiveness in the conflict in Ukraine. Speaking at the Association of the United States Army conference, Driscoll emphasized that drones and counter-drone technologies are now core components of military planning. He also announced the Janus Program, a partnership with the Department of Energy to install small nuclear microreactors on Army bases. This initiative aims to create self-sufficient, resilient power sources for critical installations, reducing dependence on vulnerable fuel supply chains.</p>

          <p>U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer stated that the Trump administration's threat to impose 100% tariffs on Chinese goods could be enacted by November 1, depending on China's response to a dispute over rare earth mineral exports. China recently announced sweeping export restrictions on these critical materials, which are vital for U.S. defense, technology, and automotive industries. Greer emphasized that the U.S. cannot allow China to have veto power over global high-tech supply chains. Despite the escalating rhetoric, high-level talks between the two nations are reportedly still scheduled to take place.</p>

          <p>An elite military unit in Madagascar has declared it has taken control of the government from President Andry Rajoelina, who is reportedly in a "safe place" after an alleged assassination attempt. The move follows weeks of youth-led protests against the government over corruption, high unemployment, and the cost-of-living crisis. The military leader, Col. Michael Randrianirina, announced the suspension of democratic institutions and promised to form a new government that includes protest leaders, with elections to be held within two years. The African Union and other international bodies have expressed concern and warned against an unconstitutional change of government.</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has drawn criticism from medical experts after suggesting a possible link between childhood circumcision and autism, connecting it to the unproven theory that Tylenol use causes the disorder.

Experts, including pediatricians and public health officials, have strongly refuted the claims, stating there is no credible scientific evidence establishing a causal relationship between circumcision, Tylenol, or vaccines and autism.</p>

A study found that Gen Z prioritizes self-care, authentic self-expression, and helping others, whereas hiring managers value achievement, learning, and hard work. This disconnect has led to frustration on both sides, with some executives labeling the younger generation as "unemployable" while Gen Z questions the validity of older, hustle-centric work ethics.

An expert outlines a five-step process that includes verifying prescription drug coverage, confirming that doctors and hospitals remain in-network, and assessing the plan's maximum out-of-pocket costs, which have been steadily rising. It is also crucial to check for changes in copay structures and evaluate the value of supplemental benefits like dental and vision coverage. Proactively shopping for the best plan can prevent unexpected expenses and ensure access to necessary care.</p>

          <h2>Fed Chair Powell Signals More Rate Cuts Likely Amid Concerns Over Slowing Job Market</h2>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank is likely to implement two more interest rate cuts this year, citing the growing economic risk posed by a significant slowdown in hiring. Powell stated that while tariffs have slightly increased inflation, there are no broader pressures that would justify keeping rates high, shifting the Fed's focus toward protecting the job market. He also suggested that the Fed may soon cease shrinking its balance sheet. This stance suggests that lowering borrowing costs for consumers and businesses is a priority to stimulate economic activity and employment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant escalation of trade tensions, China has sanctioned five U.S. subsidiaries of South Korean shipbuilding giant Hanwha Ocean and launched an investigation into the U.S. logistics sector. The move came on the same day that new U.S. fees on Chinese-built ships docking at American ports took effect. China views South Korea as a U.S. proxy in the conflict, as Hanwha has close ties to the American shipbuilding industry and military. The sanctions and investigation represent a direct retaliation against U.S. trade policies, further complicating the relationship between the world's two largest economies.</p>

The situation adds financial stress to an already high-pressure job and exacerbates an existing nationwide shortage of trained controllers.

During the journey, the victim was allegedly tortured by being burned with cigarettes and a curling iron.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, savers are reassessing the returns offered by high-yield savings accounts. While the peak rates of over 5% or 6% are now largely unavailable, consumers can still find competitive rates in the 4.20% to 4.30% range, particularly with online banks. This is still substantially higher than the national average rate for traditional savings accounts, which currently sits at just 0.40%. Unlike CDs, these accounts provide the benefit of liquidity, allowing savers to access their funds without penalty, making them an attractive option even in a changing rate environment.
