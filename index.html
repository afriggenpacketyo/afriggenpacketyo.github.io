          <p>Donald Trump is scheduled to host two crypto-focused dinners this month, one targeting wealthy political donors and another aimed at meme coin millionaires, with the goal of raising millions of dollars. The first event, a $1.5 million-per-plate fundraiser, will feature David Sacks, who has been influential in shaping crypto and AI regulations. The second dinner will be held at Trump National, where access is granted based on the number of $TRUMP tokens held, offering the top 220 holders a chance to dine with Trump himself. The crypto community views Sacks' influence as a shift away from President Biden's policies.</p>

          <p>Small business owners are struggling with the uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariff policies, which threaten their survival. With taxes on imported goods in effect, businesses are finding it difficult to set prices that cover the increased costs without deterring customers. Many are forced to raise prices, with 30% planning to do so, while others consider reducing labor costs, leading to a decline in employment at small businesses. The article highlights how smaller establishments are particularly vulnerable, lacking the resources to stockpile inventory like larger businesses, with some owners fearing they may have to close.</p>

          <p>Jury selection has commenced in the federal trial of Sean "Diddy" Combs in New York, where the hip-hop mogul faces accusations of sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy, and transporting individuals for prostitution. The indictment alleges that Combs used violence and intimidation to coerce victims into sexual acts and control them, promising career advancement for compliance or resorting to violence if they resisted. Combs' attorney acknowledges issues with drug use and toxic relationships but asserts that all sexual activity was consensual. The trial is expected to last at least six weeks, with an anonymous jury selected from a pool of 150 potential jurors.</p>

The program, administered through the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's "Home" app, aims to provide a safer and more cost-effective way for individuals to leave the country, with DHS claiming it saves taxpayers 70% compared to arresting, detaining, and removing undocumented immigrants. Participants will also be deprioritized for detention and removal while arranging their departure, potentially keeping the door open for legal immigration in the future.

          <p>Homeowners seeking to borrow money may find a home equity line of credit (HELOC) an affordable option, but qualifying involves meeting lender requirements. Lenders typically look for sufficient home equity (at least 15% to 20%), a strong credit score (620 or higher), a low debt-to-income ratio (below 43%), and stable income and employment history. Homeowners can improve their chances by checking their credit report, lowering their DTI ratio, shopping around for lenders, and considering a co-applicant. The article advises that understanding these factors and preparing accordingly can help homeowners successfully tap into their home equity.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced a new plan involving a “forceful entry” into Gaza and the relocation of Palestinians to the south, following approval from his security cabinet. The plan involves deploying tens of thousands of additional soldiers to seize and hold territory in Gaza. Netanyahu stated that military officials recommended an “intensive” escalation to bring home the hostages still held in Gaza. Critics argue the expanded military campaign would endanger the hostages and not fundamentally alter the situation, while Israeli officials claim the offensive aims to increase pressure on Hamas to release hostages and destroy their infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Poachers in South Africa killed more than 100 rhinos in the first three months of this year, primarily inside national parks, highlighting the ongoing struggle to protect the endangered species. Environment Minister Dion George announced that 65 of the 103 rhinos were poached in national parks between January 1 and March 31. The average of more than one rhino killed a day is consistent with last year's count, underscoring the persistent threat to wildlife. South Africa has the largest rhino population globally, but poaching for rhino horn remains a significant issue, driven by demand in Asia.</p>

UnitedHealth has requested that the district court reject their request for an injunction against repayment of loans, arguing that they did not have the right to interfere in its business with thousands of other loan recipients.</p>
