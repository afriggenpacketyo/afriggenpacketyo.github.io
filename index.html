            <p>U.S. stocks experienced a significant downturn, reversing gains from the previous day, as President Trump's trade war continues to loom over the economy. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq all saw substantial drops, influenced by China's countermeasures and the White House's clarification of increased tariffs on Chinese imports. Market analysts cite persistent volatility due to unpredictable trade policies and ongoing tariff battles between the U.S. and China, despite positive inflation data indicating progress towards the Federal Reserve's target. This uncertainty leaves investors wary about potential recession risks and the full impact of tariffs on the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>Lawyers for Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil argued that the government has failed to present evidence justifying his deportation based on adverse foreign policy consequences. The government presented a memo signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, asserting that Khalil's presence in the U.S. compromises foreign policy interests due to his alleged role in antisemitic protests. Khalil's attorneys criticized the memo, arguing that it infringes on First Amendment rights and lacks connection to foreign policy.

Experts caution that inflationary risks remain a threat, particularly with some of Trump's tariffs still in place or merely delayed. The Federal Reserve is expected to remain cautious at its next meeting, with potential interest rate cuts anticipated later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court will require the Trump administration to facilitate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was sent to El Salvador in error. The order properly requires the Government to 'facilitate' Garcia’s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador. The court acknowledges that the status of Garcia as an alleged MS-13 gang member -- and potential threat to the American public -- remains contested. It also makes clear he is under an order to be removed from the U.S. — but expressly not to El Salvador.</p>

Rose, on the other hand, delivered a strong performance, signing for a 65 and showcasing his experience at the venue. Scottie Scheffler also played well, finishing with a 68.</p>

            <p>President Trump is facing accusations of manipulating stock markets through his social media posts about tariffs. After share prices plummeted due to tariff fears, Trump posted "THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!!" followed by an announcement pausing the harshest tariffs, causing stocks to skyrocket. Some Democratic lawmakers and ethics experts are calling for investigations into whether Trump attempted to deliberately manipulate the markets or enable insider trading. Critics argue that senior officials, including the president, should not comment on stock prices while making decisions that impact them.</p>

            <p>A pioneering project at the University of Bristol is tracking the brain development of babies and toddlers to understand how they develop key skills. Researchers are using specially designed games and brain-scanning 'hats' to measure skills like inhibitory control, working memory, and processing speed. The study is unique because it tracks children whose mothers were part of a previous project that monitored their health since the 1990s, providing a lifetime of data to reveal links between brain development and parental health.</p>

            <p>A tattoo belonging to a man from Derbyshire has appeared in a US government document used to identify members of a notorious Venezuelan gang - despite the man having no connection to the group. Pete Belton, 44, from Ilkeston says he was shocked to find his forearm featured in a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) document used to help identify alleged members of Tren de Aragua (TdA), a transnational criminal organisation. The tattoo - a clock face with the date and time of his daughter's birth - was included in a set of nine images for "detecting and identifying" TdA members.</p>

            <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is now recommending an additional measles vaccine shot for some travelers within the United States, in response to record outbreaks of the highly contagious virus this year. Visitors to areas affected by measles outbreaks within the United States should follow stepped up vaccination guidance issued by local authorities. This means that adult and teen travelers to some counties in Texas and Kansas should get a second dose if they have not received two doses already or get two doses if they are unvaccinated. Infants should get an early first dose before the typically recommended age of 12 months old, followed by two more doses, and children over 12 months old should get an early second dose if they already have one, or two doses if they are unvaccinated.</p>

Brown, now 92, was forced out of her branch in County Durham in 2003 after she and her late husband spent over £50,000 to cover non-existent shortfalls caused by faulty software. While her offer has increased from 29% to 60% of her claim, she believes it remains far less than what she is owed, highlighting ongoing issues with compensation for victims of the scandal.</p>

The states argue that the administration's decision to rescind the funds is arbitrary and illegal, violating the Administrative Procedure Act.</p>

While Chinese consumers are not rushing to Apple stores to pick up iPhones over fears of price hikes – most iPhones are not subject to Beijing’s retaliatory 84 per cent tariffs on US goods – there are signs of mounting concerns about supply disruptions and rising costs generally. The iPhone 17 series could see higher prices as part of a global adjustment.</p>
