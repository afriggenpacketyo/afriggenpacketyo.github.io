          <p>A gunman opened fire in a Midtown Manhattan office building, killing four people, including an NYPD officer, before taking his own life. The shooter, identified as Shane Tamura, was reportedly targeting the NFL's headquarters located in the building. A note found on his body indicated he believed he suffered from the brain disease CTE and blamed the NFL for his condition, despite never having played in the league. The incident has prompted responses from city officials and the NFL, which has advised its New York employees to work from home.</p>

          <p>The parents of Jaysen Carr, a 12-year-old boy who died from a rare brain infection caused by the Naegleria fowleri amoeba, are speaking out to raise awareness. They emphasized that they were unaware of the risks of swimming in the South Carolina lake where their son was likely infected and do not want his death to be in vain. Health officials and the CDC advise taking precautions like holding one's nose or using nose clips when in fresh water to reduce the risk of this often-fatal infection. This was the first known case in the state since 2016.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has initiated a process to draft a rule that would ban law enforcement officers, including federal ICE agents, from wearing masks or otherwise concealing their identities. The move responds to recent immigration raids where agents were often unidentifiable, which supervisors called a violation of civil rights. While the county's authority over federal agents is questionable and a legal challenge based on the Constitution's supremacy clause is expected, officials have stated they are prepared for a court battle.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed repealing its 2009 "endangerment finding," a determination that greenhouse gases threaten public health and form the legal basis for their regulation under the Clean Air Act. This move could dismantle numerous federal climate regulations but may also create an opportunity for states like California to assert stronger authority. California officials and environmental advocates have condemned the proposal, while experts suggest it could paradoxically strengthen the state's legal standing to implement its own aggressive climate policies.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump claimed his falling out with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was because Epstein "stole" employees from his Mar-a-Lago club. Speaking to reporters, Trump suggested that prominent accuser Virginia Giuffre was one of the young women hired away from the club's spa. This account contrasts with previous White House statements that Trump broke with Epstein for being a "creep." The claim also complicates the timeline, as Giuffre was hired away in 2000, yet Trump praised Epstein publicly in 2002.</p>

          <h2>Experts Suggest Link Between Extreme Heat and Rise in July Drug Overdose Deaths</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 17:45:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Public health data from Los Angeles indicates that July is the deadliest month for drug overdoses, and experts suggest extreme heat is a likely contributing factor. Substances like opioids can impair the body's ability to regulate temperature and reduce perspiration, while users may be too sedated to seek shade or help. Experts also note that official heat-related death tolls are likely severe undercounts because heat's role in exacerbating conditions is often not recorded, hindering effective public health responses.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the European Union has marginalized itself on the world stage by failing to develop a coherent, autonomous policy toward China. The author contends that by submitting to U.S. pressure and prioritizing transatlantic loyalty over its own strategic interests, Brussels has lost leverage with both Beijing and Washington. The recent EU-China summit is presented as evidence of this irrelevance, with Europe gaining little of substance and confirming its diminished role in great-power competition.</p>

While the administration says it is addressing root causes, critics worry the new policy will fail to solve them and could lead to harmful outcomes.</p>
