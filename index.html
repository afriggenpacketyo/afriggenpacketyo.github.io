          <p>China has revealed its YJ-19 hypersonic cruise missile, showcasing significant advancements in its aerospace and military technology. The missile is believed to operate using a scramjet engine, which allows for sustained high-speed flight by taking in air for combustion. This design provides both immense speed and continuous maneuverability throughout its flight path, distinguishing it from hypersonic glide vehicles that follow a more predictable trajectory after an initial boost. The development of the YJ-19 demonstrates China's growing capability in creating sophisticated and cutting-edge strategic weapons systems for modern warfare scenarios.</p>

          <p>A recent survey conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Center indicates a strong sense of nationalism among the Chinese public. The majority of respondents believe China should play an active role in global affairs and see their country's international standing as strong and likely to improve. However, opinions are divided on whether China or the United States is the dominant world power, suggesting a continued wariness of U.S. influence. This sentiment aligns with President Xi Jinping's muscular foreign policy, contrasting with a growing isolationist trend in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Poland's new president, Karol Nawrocki, is visiting Washington to reinforce the bilateral security alliance with the United States. The discussions are expected to center on maintaining the presence of approximately 10,000 U.S. troops in Poland and continuing significant arms purchases, including F-35 jets and Abrams tanks. This visit occurs amidst a contentious domestic political climate, with President Nawrocki in conflict with the government led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk. The power struggle has spilled into foreign policy, creating a tense backdrop for a trip aimed at securing Poland's position on NATO's eastern flank.</p>

          <p>Apollo Global CEO Marc Rowan contends that the traditional investment model centered on public markets is fundamentally flawed. He argues that the stock market has become dominated by passive indexing and a few mega-cap tech stocks, limiting diversification and true exposure to the broader economy. Rowan suggests that private markets, particularly private credit, offer more robust opportunities and that the old notion of public markets being inherently safer is outdated. As institutional and retail investors seek better returns, he foresees a major, permanent shift in capital allocation toward alternative investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alternative asset manager Blue Owl Capital is increasing its brand visibility through unconventional marketing, notably by sponsoring professional tennis players. This strategy aims to familiarize high-net-worth individuals with the firm as the private markets industry seeks to attract a broader investor base beyond traditional institutions.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard troops for law enforcement duties in California is illegal. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer stated the action violated the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which restricts the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. The ruling specifically bars troops from making arrests, conducting searches, or engaging in crowd control within the state. Judge Breyer warned that allowing such deployments would effectively create a "national police force with the President as its chief," setting a dangerous precedent for executive power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Treasury yields increased significantly after a federal appeals court ruled that most of the Trump administration's global tariffs are illegal. The decision raised concerns that the government might have to refund billions in collected tariff revenue, which would worsen the national budget deficit and potentially lead to a surge in Treasury issuance. The 30-year Treasury yield surpassed 4.97%, its highest since late July, reflecting market anxiety over the country's fiscal stability. This development adds pressure as investors await key economic data, including the upcoming non-farm payrolls report for August. (not investment advice)</p>

While a potential Federal Reserve rate cut could bring some relief, persistent inflation and a strong labor market create significant uncertainty.

However, those with more flexibility or who are casually searching might benefit from waiting, as rates could potentially dip below 6.5% later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

This rise reflects growing investor concerns about the stability of the UK's public finances and expectations of potential tax increases to meet fiscal rules.

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a prominent New York Democrat and the longest-serving New Yorker in the House, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026. At 78, Nadler stated his decision was driven by the "necessity for generational change in the party," a conclusion he reached after observing recent political events. First elected in 1992, Nadler has had a significant career, including chairing the House Judiciary Committee and serving as a manager during President Trump's first impeachment. His retirement opens up a key congressional seat and marks the end of an era in New York politics.</p>

          <p>Three scientists who discovered they carry two copies of the APOE4 gene variant, which confers a 60% chance of developing Alzheimer's, are using their knowledge to advance research and advocacy. One participant joined a clinical trial exploring the effects of intense mental and physical exercise on brain health. Another, a neuropsychologist, now focuses his career on running clinical trials for drugs that could specifically benefit this high-risk group. A third has become a public advocate, educating others and pushing for more research funding, transforming a personal genetic diagnosis into a broader mission.</p>

This extended naval activity has been described by Japanese media as having "almost completely circled" the country's main islands. The maneuver is seen as another demonstration of China's expanding naval presence and capabilities in the region.</p>

          <p>As savers contend with persistent inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) have become an attractive option, with many accounts offering rates that outpace the current inflation rate. While national average yields for CDs remain modest, top rates from online banks are significantly higher, particularly for short-term CDs with terms of six months to one year. This phenomenon, known as an inverted yield curve, means savers can currently secure better returns on shorter-term commitments. Experts suggest strategies like CD laddering to take advantage of high short-term rates while maintaining a long-term savings plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An international coalition of more than 85 climate scientists has published a detailed critique of a recent Department of Energy report, labeling it as biased, error-filled, and "not scientifically credible." The government report, authored by five hand-picked researchers, downplayed the economic damage of climate change and suggested mitigation efforts could be harmful. The scientists' 439-page review argues that the DOE document misrepresents scientific literature, cherry-picks data, and makes a "mockery of science."

          <p>Financial experts are pointing to a "golden opportunity" for investors to pay 0% on long-term capital gains, thanks to new tax deductions introduced for 2025. The 0% capital gains bracket applies to individuals with taxable income up to $48,350 for single filers or $96,700 for married couples filing jointly. With an increased standard deduction and other new tax breaks, more investors may fall into this bracket, allowing them to sell profitable assets without incurring taxes. This creates strategic possibilities for "tax-gain harvesting" or resetting an asset's cost basis for future tax savings. (not investment advice)</p>

While some experts acknowledge that pure, additive-free tequila may be better tolerated due to fewer congeners, they caution that no alcohol is a health drink or truly hangover-proof.
