          <p>President Trump announced sweeping tariffs on imported goods, imposing a 10% baseline tariff on all imports and higher rates on specific countries deemed "worst offenders." This action marks a significant escalation of trade tensions and could trigger a global trade war, potentially leading to higher prices for American consumers and slower economic growth.  The move was met with immediate market reactions, with Asian markets opening lower the following day.  Economists widely warn of potential negative economic consequences.</p>
