          <p>The Trump administration has announced its intention to designate Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, with an executive order expected to be signed shortly. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the plan, stating it is part of a broader effort to address what the administration describes as political violence from left-leaning groups. However, this move faces legal hurdles, as current federal law does not have a mechanism for designating U.S.-based organizations as domestic terrorist groups. The announcement signals a continued focus on prosecuting political rivals and restoring order from the administration's perspective.</p>

          <p>The White House has outlined a plan to move TikTok's U.S. operations into a new American-based joint venture to address national security concerns. Under this proposed structure, a majority of investors and board members would be American, with software company Oracle serving as the security provider to monitor the app's algorithm and data. While the administration expresses confidence that China has approved the framework, Beijing has not publicly confirmed the agreement, leaving the finalization of the deal uncertain. The move is intended to prevent an outright ban of the popular social media app in the United States.</p>

          <p>As mortgage rates continue a downward trend, prospective homebuyers anticipating further cuts from the Federal Reserve in October are advised to take preparatory steps. Financial experts recommend getting a mortgage pre-approval after carefully checking one's credit report for any inaccuracies to ensure the best possible loan terms. Additionally, researching and selecting an experienced real estate agent can provide a competitive edge in a potentially more crowded market. Comparing lenders and their terms in advance will also position buyers to act quickly and effectively if more favorable rates become available. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning to announce a link between acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, and an increased risk of autism in children when used during pregnancy. In response, Tylenol's manufacturer, Kenvue, and major medical organizations have strongly refuted these claims, citing extensive research that shows no credible evidence of such a connection. Health experts warn that this announcement could cause unnecessary fear and lead pregnant women to use riskier pain relief alternatives or leave dangerous conditions like high fevers untreated. The administration is also expected to promote a drug called leucovorin as a potential autism treatment.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked a Trump administration stop-work order, allowing Danish company Orsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind farm off the New England coast. The project, which is 80% complete and set to power over 350,000 homes, was halted by the Interior Department in August. Judge Royce Lamberth issued a temporary injunction, stating that Orsted was likely to succeed in its lawsuit arguing the order was unlawful and issued in bad faith. This ruling marks a significant setback for the administration's stated goal of shutting down the U.S. offshore wind industry.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive analysis of 25 studies reveals that interventions designed to reduce partisan animosity in the U.S. yield only modest and temporary results. Researchers found that while approaches like correcting misperceptions about political opponents can slightly increase warmth towards the other side, these effects typically fade within two weeks. The study suggests that individual-level interventions are not a magic bullet for the country's deep political divides. The authors argue that lasting change will require systemic shifts that alter the incentives for political and media figures who often fuel partisan conflict.</p>

In the email, she referred to Epstein as her "supreme friend" and appeared to apologize for publicly distancing herself from him, contradicting her previous statements. A spokesperson for the duchess claimed the email was sent under duress to fend off a defamation lawsuit threat from Epstein. Charities including the Teenage Cancer Trust and the British Heart Foundation have severed ties, stating her continued involvement was inappropriate.</p>

          <p>A report has revealed that White House border czar Tom Homan was the subject of an FBI undercover operation in which he allegedly accepted $50,000 in cash after discussing future government contracts.

The White House has dismissed the probe as politically motivated entrapment by the "Biden Department of Justice."

A $100,000 home equity loan with a 10-year repayment term now averages a monthly payment of around $1,236, while a 15-year term would cost about $974 per month. This article breaks down how these costs compare to previous months and discusses the differences between fixed-rate home equity loans and variable-rate HELOCs.

          <p>Michelob Ultra has officially become the best-selling beer in the United States, overtaking Modelo Especial, according to new retail data. This shift marks a significant comeback for parent company Anheuser-Busch, whose Bud Light brand lost the top spot to Modelo two years ago following a controversial marketing partnership. Modelo's decline in popularity is attributed to several factors, including tariffs and reduced spending among its core Hispanic consumer base, which parent company Constellation Brands has linked to the administration's immigration policies. The change in rankings reflects dynamic shifts in consumer preferences and market pressures within the U.S. beer industry.</p>

          <p>A violent clash between rival gangs at a prison in Machala, Ecuador, has resulted in the deaths of 13 inmates and one prison guard. The riot involved the use of firearms and explosives, and an undetermined number of prisoners managed to escape during the chaos, though 13 have since been recaptured. This incident highlights the ongoing crisis within Ecuador's overcrowded and gang-controlled prison system, which has been under military control since a state of "internal armed conflict" was declared earlier in the year. The violence is attributed to a power struggle between the Los Choneros and Los Lobos gangs.</p>

          <p>A nationwide strike in Italy, organized by trade unions in solidarity with Palestinians, saw thousands of protesters take to the streets, resulting in clashes with police in Milan. The protests disrupted public transport and ports as demonstrators called for a ceasefire in Gaza. The event occurred as Italy's government, led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, faces criticism for not joining other European nations like France in formally recognizing a Palestinian state. French President Emmanuel Macron described his country's decision to recognize Palestine as a "necessity," further isolating Italy's position among some of its key allies.</p>

          <p>The UK health and beauty chain Bodycare will shut down all of its 56 remaining stores after administrators failed to find a buyer for the business. The closures, which will result in the loss of 444 jobs, were deemed necessary due to stock shortages and significant operating costs that made continued trading unviable. Founded in 1970, the company has faced intense competition from larger retailers like Boots and Superdrug, as well as supermarkets and online sellers. Administrators stated they are still exploring options for the company's assets, including the Bodycare brand name itself.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced it will discontinue its annual Household Food Security Report, a survey that has tracked hunger and access to nutrition for 30 years. The administration called the report "redundant, costly, politicized, and extraneous." Anti-hunger advocates and policy experts criticized the decision, stating the data is critical for understanding the scale of hunger and shaping effective policy. The cancellation comes after the administration expanded work requirements for the SNAP food aid program, a move expected to increase food insecurity, leading critics to suggest the survey is being scrapped to avoid documenting the negative consequences of this policy change.</p>

          <p>Stephen Miran, a new Trump appointee to the Federal Reserve's board, is advocating for more aggressive interest rate cuts, positioning himself as a dissenting voice within the central bank. After voting for a half-point cut instead of the quarter-point reduction approved by the board, Miran argued that rates should be below 3% by year-end. He dismissed concerns that tariffs are fueling inflation and suggested that rising housing costs will cool due to the administration's immigration policies. His stance contrasts sharply with that of Fed Chair Jerome Powell, signaling a potential for increased political influence over monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged to a new all-time high, exceeding $3,700 per ounce as investors seek safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainty. Bullion has gained over 40% this year, driven by expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and consistent purchasing by global central banks. For investors looking to gain exposure to the precious metal, financial experts typically recommend using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of physical gold, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). This approach is generally considered more efficient and cost-effective than purchasing and storing physical gold bars or coins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration prepares to suggest a link between paracetamol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy and autism, a review of scientific evidence shows no causal connection. While some studies have shown a correlation, they have been unable to rule out confounding factors such as genetics or the underlying illness for which the drug was taken. A large-scale Swedish study involving 2.5 million children found no increased risk of autism from paracetamol use when comparing siblings. Health authorities, including those in the UK, continue to recommend paracetamol as the safest painkiller for pregnant women, warning that avoiding it could lead to greater harm.</p>
