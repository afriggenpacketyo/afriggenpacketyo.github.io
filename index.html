          <p>Zhou Xianwang, the former mayor of Wuhan, is under investigation for corruption by China's top anti-graft body. He gained international attention in early 2020 for his public defense of the city's handling of the initial COVID-19 outbreak. In a rare admission for a Chinese official, Zhou stated that he was only able to disclose information about the virus after receiving authorization from higher authorities. This probe revisits a critical period of the pandemic, focusing on the actions of a key figure at the epicenter of the global health crisis.</p>

          <p>Fast-fashion giant Shein has reportedly filed confidentially for an initial public offering in Hong Kong, a move seen as an attempt to pressure UK regulators who have been slow to approve its London listing. The company has faced significant hurdles, particularly regarding disagreements between UK and Chinese regulators over risk disclosures in its prospectus. These disclosures concern Shein's supply chain in China's Xinjiang region, which is under scrutiny for alleged human rights abuses. This dual-filing strategy highlights the complex geopolitical and regulatory challenges the retailer faces in its quest to go public. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that East Asian economies like Japan and South Korea can learn from China's approach to navigating trade pressures, particularly from the United States. While Japan and South Korea built their manufacturing prowess on homegrown technologies, China has evolved from an original equipment manufacturer to a leader in automation and robotics. The article suggests that China's robust supply chain and strategic shift towards high-tech sectors, such as electric vehicles, position it as a formidable global competitor. It frames regional cooperation as a key to sustaining technological innovation and economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study has identified Virginia as the top state for french fry consumption in the United States. Based on a poll of 5,000 adults, the average Virginian reports eating approximately 21 pounds of fries annually. Following closely are Alabama, Georgia, and Maryland, with residents consuming about 20 pounds per year. The research, commissioned by McCain Foods ahead of National French Fry Day, estimates that Americans collectively eat over 5.6 billion pounds of fries each year, highlighting the enduring popularity of this side dish across the nation.</p>

          <p>Lord Norman Tebbit, a prominent and often controversial cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher, has passed away at the age of 94. Remembered as a key architect of "Thatcherism," he was known for his staunch self-reliance philosophy and his role in implementing laws to curb trade union power. His political career was marked by his plain-spoken, uncompromising views and his personal courage, particularly after he and his wife were severely injured in the 1984 IRA bombing in Brighton. Often depicted as a tough enforcer, he remained an influential voice on the right wing of the Conservative party long after leaving government.</p>

This policy shift comes after days of intense Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities and appeals from President Zelensky for continued support.

The company argues that mining seabed minerals like cobalt and nickel is crucial for national security and the green energy transition.

This proposal is a compromise, aiming to rapidly boost armed forces numbers if needed without fully restoring the compulsory military service that was suspended in 2011.

While recent monthly inflation data was generally in line with forecasts, the bank noted the figures were slightly stronger than anticipated.

          <p>A Q&A article addresses the controversy surrounding a penalty given to McLaren's Oscar Piastri at the British Grand Prix, which cost him a victory. The incident, involving braking behind a safety car, drew comparisons to a similar situation with Mercedes' George Russell in Canada, where no penalty was applied. This has sparked debate among drivers and teams about the consistency of stewards' decisions, a persistent issue in Formula 1. The article explores the subtle differences between the two events, including braking pressure and weather conditions, while noting that key figures like Max Verstappen find the differing outcomes strange.</p>

          <p>Officials have confirmed that the remains of all seven workers who were missing after a massive explosion at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California, have been located. The Yolo County coroner's office is now working to formally identify the victims through autopsies and DNA testing. The fatal blast occurred at a facility owned by Devastating Pyrotechnics, which a county official stated was not permitted to store fireworks at that location. The incident, which also sparked an 80-acre grass fire, is now the subject of a multi-agency investigation involving state and federal authorities.</p>

          <p>The UK is bracing for its third heatwave of the summer, which is forecast to be the most widespread and sustained one yet. High pressure is expected to build, bringing hot air from continental Europe and pushing temperatures to a peak of 33°C (91°F) in England over the weekend. Unlike previous heatwaves that were concentrated in the south and east, this event is likely to bring very warm or hot conditions to all four nations, including Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland.

          <p>Public records reveal that officials in Kerr County, Texas, had discussed the need for an improved flood warning system for years prior to the recent deadly floods. An analysis of meeting minutes shows that as early as 2016, county commissioners acknowledged being "very flood prone" and recognized the existing infrastructure was inadequate. A 2016 engineering study recommended a nearly $1 million project to enhance flood monitoring and public warnings, noting the region's high risk of flash flooding. These past discussions highlight long-standing concerns about the area's vulnerability, which have now been tragically realized.</p>

          <p>Brazilian club Fluminense has made an unexpected run to the Club World Cup semi-finals, where they will face Chelsea. The team's success is largely attributed to the leadership of veteran defender Thiago Silva and manager Renato Gaúcho. The 40-year-old Silva has been instrumental in the team's solid defensive performance, organizing the back line and providing crucial on-field guidance. The semi-final will be a special occasion for Silva, who won the Champions League and a previous Club World Cup with Chelsea, as he now leads his boyhood club against his former team in a high-stakes match.</p>

          <p>Beijing's recent implementation of export controls on rare earth elements has intensified global efforts to diversify supply chains and reduce dependence on China for critical minerals. In response, international companies are accelerating exploration and development projects in other countries, such as Brazil and Kazakhstan, to establish alternative sources. China has long dominated the rare earths market, a position that gives it significant leverage in global trade and technology sectors. Analysts note that while the push for diversification is gaining momentum, building a new supply chain is a long-term challenge, leaving Beijing with a strong hand for the foreseeable future.

          <p>Over five million people in Yorkshire will be affected by a hosepipe ban starting this Friday, the first such restriction declared in the UK this year. Yorkshire Water implemented the ban after the region experienced its driest and warmest spring on record, causing reservoir levels to fall to just over 50% capacity, a record low for this time of year. The ban prohibits using a hosepipe for activities like watering gardens or washing cars, with potential fines for non-compliance. The move highlights growing concerns about water scarcity as climate change and population growth put increasing pressure on the region's water supply.</p>

          <p>The government of El Salvador has informed United Nations investigators that the Trump administration maintains legal responsibility for Venezuelan migrants deported from the U.S. to a Salvadoran mega-prison. This contradicts public statements from both governments and is a key point in a legal challenge by the migrants' lawyers. The Trump administration had argued it was powerless to act as the men were outside U.S. jurisdiction. However, this new information suggests the U.S. retains control, strengthening the case that the deportations, part of a controversial deal to house migrants abroad, circumvented U.S. legal processes.</p>
