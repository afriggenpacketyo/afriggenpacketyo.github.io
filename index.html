Crusius already received 90 consecutive life sentences in federal court for hate crime and weapons charges; his state sentence will be served in Texas.

            <p>The beauty industry's embrace of snail slime has raised ethical questions regarding the treatment of snails. While some companies claim snails are treated humanely, concerns persist about the methods used to extract slime, which can involve stressful and harmful procedures. Despite ethical concerns, the snail slime beauty market is projected to reach $3.4 billion by 2034, driven by consumer demand for cruelty-free and anti-aging solutions. The article questions the ethics of industrializing snail labor for uncertain benefits and suggests that a shift in consumer preferences or the discovery of alternative secretions might be the only way to alleviate the burden on snails.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>The author reflects on the changing perception and reality of America, contrasting past experiences of openness and generosity with current anxieties about arbitrary detentions and a sense of closed borders. The essay explores America as a land of illusions, both magnificent and treacherous, and recalls moments of both prosperity and disparity. Personal anecdotes from travels across the country highlight the generosity of ordinary people and the pervasive sense of opportunity, while also acknowledging the undercurrent of resentment and the erosion of motivating ideals. The author concludes with a lament for the America they once knew, now seemingly closed off and replaced by careerism and a fear of lost status.</p>

            <p>Donald Trump's attempts to impose political authority over academic life by demanding viewpoint diversity at Harvard University have been criticized as political bullying. The demand for universities to audit political views and hire staff based on their politics is a form of social engineering. While viewpoint diversity is a vital aim, solutions that institutionalize political identities and make political beliefs criteria for admission and recruitment can worsen the problem. The article argues that fostering freedom of expression and encouraging the capacity to move between different points of view are better approaches.</p>

            <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has accused opponents of the government's net zero agenda of spreading "nonsense and lies." Miliband argued that transitioning to green energy is essential for social justice and national security, citing the energy crisis following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He warned that deviating from the net zero goal would risk climate breakdown and forfeit future clean energy jobs. The UK is legally committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050.</p>
