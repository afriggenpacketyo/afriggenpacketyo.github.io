          <p>China claims that Philippine construction and fishing activities near Thitu Island are contributing to coral reef degradation around Sandy Cay in the South China Sea. A Chinese research team concluded that coral ecosystems near Sandy Cay are seriously degraded, while nearby Whitsun Reef remains generally healthy. The report cites 'frequent human activities' by the Philippines as a significant factor, along with natural events like tropical cyclones and outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish. The Philippines has not yet responded to these accusations, but tensions remain high in the disputed region.</p>

          <p>UK retail sales saw their largest increase in nearly four years during the first quarter, with warmer weather in March boosting sales of garden supplies, clothing, and DIY goods. According to the Office for National Statistics, sales volumes rose by 1.6% between January and March. While non-food sales increased, food sales, particularly at supermarkets, declined.

          <p>A Japanese court has ordered Amazon Japan to pay 35 million yen in damages for failing to prevent the listing of counterfeit products on its platform. The court found Amazon Japan obligated to take effective measures against fake listings, particularly after being notified of their presence. The lawsuit was filed by a medical equipment manufacturer and its distributor, who claimed sales declined due to the availability of cheaper, counterfeit pulse oximeters. The ruling sets a precedent for platform accountability in policing counterfeit goods.</p>

          <p>Konstantin Borisov, a computer engineer, argues that the biblical Garden of Eden was located near the Great Pyramid of Giza. Borisov references biblical and medieval texts, claiming that the Nile River is the Gihon River mentioned in the Bible and that the Great Pyramid was built near the Tree of Eternal Life. He cites a simulation showing an electric field within the King's chamber resembling a tree-like pattern and suggests the pyramid's enduring structure aligns with the notion of immortality ascribed to Adam. Most biblical scholars still favor the Tigris and Euphrates river region in Iraq as the more likely location.</p>

          <p>Myanmar authorities arrested an astrologer for posting a viral TikTok video predicting a new earthquake, which caused public panic. John Moe The had warned that an earthquake would "hit every city in Myanmar" on April 21, just weeks after a devastating earthquake killed thousands. The astrologer was charged with making "false statements with the intention of causing public panic". Experts say that earthquakes are impossible to predict due to the complexity of the factors involved.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Peru have discovered the 5,000-year-old remains of a noblewoman from the Caral civilization. The remains were carefully preserved in layers of fabric and included a mantle of macaw feathers, with skin, nails, and hair still intact. The discovery suggests that women held important roles in the ancient Caral society, challenging the notion that rulers were exclusively men. The Caral civilization, contemporary to those in Mesopotamia and Egypt, thrived from around 3000 BC to 1800 BC.</p>
