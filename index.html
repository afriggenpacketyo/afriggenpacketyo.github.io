            <p>Analysts speculate on the potential cost of manufacturing an iPhone entirely within the United States, with estimates ranging from $1,500 to $3,500. Factors contributing to the increased price include higher labor costs, the need to import components subject to tariffs, and the lack of a skilled domestic workforce in tooling engineering. While Apple has committed to spending $500 billion within the U.S., including AI server production in Houston, moving the entire iPhone supply chain would be a significant undertaking. Despite challenges, TSMC has successfully begun manufacturing chips in Arizona for Apple. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>President Trump's renewed interest in acquiring Greenland has been met with resistance from the island's residents, who assert they are not for sale but open to business partnerships. While the U.S. has historically maintained a military presence and strategic interest in Greenland, Trump's aggressive stance has fueled a spirit of independence and prompted locals to reassess their relationship with Denmark. Concerns are growing that forceful acquisition by the U.S. could destabilize international relations, despite the potential economic benefits from Greenland's untapped mineral resources.</p>

            <p>A disabled parent reflects on how her experiences with disability have prepared her for the challenges of parenthood, particularly in adapting to the unpredictable nature of raising children. The author argues that disabled individuals are accustomed to problem-solving and innovating in an inaccessible world, skills that are valuable in parenting. She suggests that disabled parents may be less surprised when plans go awry and less likely to blame themselves, fostering flexibility and compassion in their approach to caregiving. Ultimately, embracing imperfection and accepting help are key lessons that any parent can learn.</p>

            <p>In an environment with persistent inflation, saving money can be challenging, but certificates of deposit (CDs) can offer a solution by providing higher returns than the inflation rate. Locking in high rates for the CD's term and the safety of FDIC or NCUA insurance make CDs attractive. Online banks often provide the most competitive rates due to lower overhead costs, and short-term CDs may offer better yields than longer terms due to the inverted yield curve.

            <p>Navigating the housing market can be difficult with high mortgage rates and limited inventory, but it's still possible to find affordable options. As of April 14, 2025, average mortgage rates are 5.96% for a 15-year and 6.70% for a 30-year loan. Homebuyers and homeowners looking to refinance can improve their chances of securing a good rate by strengthening their credit profile, comparing different lenders, and carefully considering loan terms. It's also important to lock in your rate after making a decision to avoid potential increases before closing. (not investment advice)</p>
