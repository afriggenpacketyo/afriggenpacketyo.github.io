          <p>The Trump administration has formally asked the Supreme Court to review a federal appeals court decision that declared many of its tariffs illegal, arguing the ruling threatens to economically disarm the United States. The Justice Department emphasized that these tariffs are vital for promoting national security, economic prosperity, and facilitating international negotiations, warning of potential trade retaliation and economic catastrophe without them. While the lower court found Trump exceeded his authority under the IEEPA, the administration maintains the act grants broad discretion for such measures. Small businesses challenging the tariffs remain confident in their case, highlighting the harm inflicted by the duties.</p>

          <p>Nidec Corp shares experienced their largest one-day drop, plunging over 22%, after the company announced an independent third-party committee would investigate alleged improper accounting at its Chinese subsidiary, Nidec Techno Motor. An earlier internal probe had already uncovered evidence suggesting the financial malpractice was linked to Nidec's management. The Japanese electronics components manufacturer stated that it recognized limitations in its prior investigation system, which engaged external experts but was led by internal audit members, necessitating a more objective review. This development highlights ongoing corporate governance challenges.</p>

          <p>Portugal is in profound shock following a tragic derailment of Lisbon's historic Gloria funicular, which resulted in 15 deaths and 18 injuries, five of them serious. Foreign nationals were among the victims of the accident, which occurred around 6:05 PM. Eyewitnesses reported a critical failure of the braking system, sending the cable-hauled carriage uncontrollably down the steep street before it crashed violently into a building. Lisbon's mayor declared a day of national mourning, and while maintenance checks were reportedly up-to-date, authorities are actively investigating the precise cause of this devastating event.</p>

          <p>The Restoration of America Foundation (ROAF) is calling on the Senate Finance Committee to question Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. regarding the safety of the abortion pill mifepristone. The pro-life group argues that the Biden administration's decision to remove key Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) requirements, which previously mandated in-person dispensing, jeopardizes women's health. By allowing telehealth prescriptions and mail delivery, ROAF contends essential safeguards like screening for ectopic pregnancies have been eliminated, putting women at serious risk and potentially burdening taxpayers with associated costs.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Caravello, a Cal State Channel Island professor, has been indicted by a federal grand jury on a felony charge of assaulting U.S. Border Patrol agents with a tear gas canister. The incident took place during a protest on July 10 against an immigration raid at a Ventura County marijuana farm, where agents had deployed tear gas for crowd control. Prosecutors allege Caravello picked up a canister and threw it back at the officers, later resisting arrest. Caravello, who previously denied intentionally harming anyone, now faces up to 20 years in federal prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump dismissed the Jeffrey Epstein controversy as an "irrelevant" and "Democrat hoax," despite a growing bipartisan effort in Congress to compel the release of all related files. Trump claimed thousands of pages had been released and that further demands were a distraction from his administration's successes. However, Epstein survivors, like Haley Robson, emotionally refuted his characterization, emphasizing the real trauma involved. A discharge petition, needing 218 signatures to force a House vote on releasing the documents, is gaining traction, creating a political showdown.</p>

          <p>Senator Mark Warner, the Democratic vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, reported that a scheduled intelligence agency meeting was canceled due to online attacks by far-right activist Laura Loomer. Warner described the cancellation as "unprecedented and dangerous," alleging the administration is caving to Loomer's influence, who has previously served as a national security adviser to President Trump. Loomer had publicly criticized Warner's visit, calling him a threat to national security. This incident highlights concerns about political interference in intelligence oversight and Loomer's enduring sway within the administration.</p>

          <p>Chinese smart electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers, including Nio, Xpeng, and Zeekr, must significantly increase deliveries in the coming quarters to reach their 2025 break-even goals.

Analysts warn that sustained heavy losses could threaten the survival of some companies amid overcapacity concerns. For instance, Nio's CEO aims for 50,000 monthly deliveries by Q4, double its Q2 figures, to stay on track for profitability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's recent military parade, showcasing advanced weaponry, served as a potent message of its growing global power and an alternative to the U.S.-backed world order. President Trump observed the display, reflecting on his "America first" trade policies, which he views as crucial for American industry but which have also strained relations with allies and adversaries alike. This article highlights how Trump's tariff strategy has inadvertently pushed nations like China, Russia, and India closer, scrambling geopolitical alignments.

          <p>President Trump has expanded the military's role into crime fighting, a departure from traditional U.S. policy dating back to the Revolution, by authorizing lethal strikes against drug traffickers in international waters. This move, exemplified by a recent strike in the Caribbean against alleged "narco-terrorists," extends counterterrorism missions to new threats and regions. Critics argue this blurs the lines between military and law enforcement, potentially setting problematic precedents and raising concerns about specious legal grounds for lethal action.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport Venezuelan migrants, determining there was "no invasion or predatory incursion." The ruling blocks the use of this obscure wartime law, which the administration had employed to remove hundreds of alleged Tren de Aragua gang members. The court rejected the argument that "mass illegal migration" constituted an invasion. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration strategy, with the ACLU calling it an "incredibly important win" for oversight.</p>
