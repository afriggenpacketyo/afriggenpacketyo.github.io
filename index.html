            <p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to 6%, the lowest since September 2022, in an effort to stimulate India's slowing economic growth. This decision aligns with analyst expectations and coincides with the implementation of reciprocal tariffs by the U.S. on Indian goods. The RBI cited a "decisive improvement" in the inflation outlook as the reason for the rate cut, expressing confidence in achieving its 4% inflation target within the next year. However, the bank acknowledged challenges in the global environment and projected a slower economic recovery, estimating a 6.5% growth for the financial year ending March 2025, a decrease from the previous year's 9.2%.</p>

            <p>President Trump's new tariffs have come into effect, imposing a 104% levy on Chinese goods and increasing rates on imports from other countries like the EU and Japan. China has vowed to retaliate with its own tariffs, escalating the trade war, while the EU seeks to de-escalate tensions. Trump claims the tariffs will revive American manufacturing, but experts warn of potential inflation and economic consequences. Canada has also implemented tariffs on certain U.S. auto imports, further complicating the global trade landscape.</p>

            <p>A recent survey commissioned by BBC News indicates that over a third of secondary school teachers have witnessed misogynistic behavior from students in the past week, with approximately 40% feeling inadequately equipped to address such conduct. This comes amidst growing concerns from teachers and parents about children's exposure to misogynistic and violent content online. Beacon Hill Academy has implemented a "zero tolerance" policy towards derogatory language and utilizes data to identify safeguarding issues early. The survey also revealed that nearly half of the teachers want more guidance from the government on tackling misogyny, highlighting the need for increased support and resources in schools.</p>

            <p>Ecuador has become a major transit point for cocaine destined for Europe, with 70% of the world's cocaine now flowing through its ports. The surge in trafficking is fueled by rising European cocaine consumption and facilitated by corrupt officials and criminal gangs, including the Albanian mafia. This has led to increased violence and instability in Ecuador, with a record number of murders linked to the drug trade. The article highlights the human cost of the drug trade, from exploited workers to the "collateral victims" of gang violence, and emphasizes the need for consumer countries to address demand to curb the crisis.</p>

            <p>President Trump has announced and implemented a sweeping set of tariffs on foreign imports, sparking concern in global markets. A baseline tariff of 10% has been imposed on most foreign imports to the U.S., with some countries exempt. However, specific reciprocal tariffs have been levied on approximately 60 "worst offenders," including the European Union, Vietnam, and Japan. China faces the steepest increase, with a cumulative tariff of 104% on goods imported into the U.S. Canada and Mexico are exempt from the baseline rate, but will be dealt with under previous executive orders.</p>

Analysts warn of potential economic fallout and geopolitical risks, including increased tensions over Taiwan. Despite the escalating tensions, some experts believe a deal may be possible if domestic economies are significantly impacted, while others emphasize the need for China to bolster its own economy in the face of U.S. pressure.

            <p>Cambodia is facing an existential crisis for its factories and workers due to the Trump administration's 49% tariff on Cambodian goods. While the goal of the tariffs is to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., experts say this is unlikely, as manufacturers are seeking alternative locations like Egypt and India. The Cambodian government is exploring measures to mitigate the pressure, but the high tariffs are causing significant disruption and uncertainty for businesses. The situation highlights the complex consequences of trade policies on global supply chains.</p>

            <p>Sick sea lions, suffering from domoic acid toxicosis caused by a harmful algal bloom, have been attacking beachgoers in Southern California. The toxic algae bloom has spread across 370 miles of coastline, sickening dozens of animals and causing neurological issues like seizures and disorientation. Experts emphasize that these animals are not naturally aggressive and are acting out of fear due to their illness. The attacks have caused anxiety among locals and highlight the increasing number of animals affected by the toxic algae bloom.</p>

            <p>Several investment firms, including Citi and Natixis, have lowered their China growth forecasts due to escalating trade tensions with the U.S. The firms cite the doubling of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods and Beijing's retaliatory measures as factors contributing to the revised outlook. Citi analysts reduced their GDP forecast for China to 4.2% this year, while Natixis also lowered its forecast to 4.2%. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have not yet cut their forecasts, but warned of increasing downside risks to their expectations. (not investment advice)</p>
