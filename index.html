          <p>A BBC Midlands investigation successfully exposed drug dealers leveraging Snapchat to sell spice-laced vape liquids to unsuspecting teenagers. Undercover reporters, posing as a schoolgirl, easily procured these substances, which were falsely advertised as THC but later confirmed to contain highly addictive spice. This impactful exposé was driven by the harrowing accounts of mothers whose young daughters developed severe addictions, highlighting the dealers' continued operation despite earlier police notifications. The incident prompted Snapchat to reiterate its stringent policy against illegal drug sales, reporting millions of removed posts and disabled accounts, while Warwickshire Police confirmed an ongoing evidence-gathering operation to address the illicit trade. The affected teenagers have since ceased using illegal vapes, underscoring the serious public health implications.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Kiko, a powerful Category 4 storm, is currently swirling in the Pacific Ocean and tracking westward towards Hawaii, with forecasters predicting life-threatening surf and rip currents could reach the islands by the weekend. Located about 1,400 miles east-southeast of Honolulu, the storm boasts maximum sustained winds of 130 mph and is expected to strengthen further before a slow weakening begins on Saturday. Acting Hawaii Governor Sylvia Luke has declared a state of emergency due to the possible inclement weather, urging residents and visitors to monitor updates, follow official guidance, and prepare accordingly. The National Weather Service in Honolulu anticipates heavy rainfall leading to potential flooding and high surf early next week, with main threats forecast for Tuesday.</p>

          <p>An Orange County woman, Laura Lee Yourex, faces five felony charges after being accused of registering her dog, Maya Jean Yourex, to vote and illegally casting ballots in two elections. Prosecutors allege she mailed in ballots under her dog's name for the 2021 gubernatorial recall and 2022 primary elections, with the 2021 ballot successfully accepted. Yourex reportedly shared her actions on social media, even posting about her deceased dog still receiving a ballot. This unusual case highlights a loophole in California's voter registration, where proof of residence is not required for state elections, contributing to the initial acceptance of the fraudulent vote. If convicted, Yourex could face up to six years in state prison.</p>

          <p>Austin city officials unveiled a new $1.1 million unified brand logo, a wavy blue and green "A," which immediately drew widespread criticism from residents and political figures. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Tex., blasted the rebrand as "woke" and a misallocation of funds, arguing the city should prioritize public safety issues like 911 response and police force levels over symbolic projects. City Manager T.C. Broadnax defended the initiative, stating it aims to unify over 300 existing city logos for the first time in Austin's history. The rollout is planned to begin in October 2025, with physical assets transitioning gradually to minimize budget impact, though public reaction online has been largely negative, comparing it to various unimpressive designs.</p>

The 140-year-old Glória funicular, a popular tourist attraction, crashed into a building near Avenida da Liberdade, prompting a large-scale rescue operation involving over 60 personnel. Portuguese Prime Minister Luís Montenegro declared a national day of mourning, calling the incident "one of the biggest human tragedies of our recent history." The cause of the crash remains unknown, with the public transport operator, Carris, launching an independent investigation and initiating inspections of all funiculars, while asserting that all maintenance protocols had been scrupulously followed, with the last general maintenance conducted in 2022.</p>

          <p>A large-scale immigration enforcement raid at a Hyundai facility in Georgia resulted in the detention of 475 individuals suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally. Federal authorities, including Homeland Security Investigations, confirmed most detainees were Korean nationals working for various subcontractors at the site, with some allegedly entering illegally and others overstaying visas. The sweep, part of a monthslong investigation into unlawful employment practices, was described as the largest single-site enforcement operation in HSI history. While no criminal charges were immediately announced, the operation underscores the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration, drawing criticism from labor groups who called it politically motivated and a campaign of harassment against immigrant Georgians.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has proposed a monumental compensation package for CEO Elon Musk, which could potentially elevate his wealth beyond $1 trillion if the company achieves a set of rigorous benchmarks over the next decade. The agreement, requiring shareholder approval, explicitly links Musk's compensation to Tesla's market value reaching an ambitious $8.5 trillion and to specific production goals, including the commercial operation of one million Robotaxis and the delivery of one million humanoid robots. This plan aims to retain and strongly incentivize Musk's energies and focus on Tesla's long-term success, particularly given the absence of a current long-term performance award. The proposal arrives after a Delaware judge twice struck down a previous $50 billion pay package, citing issues with board independence and Musk's problematic influence over those negotiations.</p>

          <p>US Health Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.'s controversial actions, including the sudden firing of CDC Director Susan Monarez and the dismissal of the entire vaccine advisory panel, have ignited furious backlash and global concern. Kennedy, who has previously labeled the CDC "most corrupt" and questioned vaccine safety, appointed a noted vaccine critic and handpicked a new advisory committee, leading to senior staff resignations. Critics, including former CDC scientists, fear these moves dangerously compromise America's public health systems and scientific integrity, potentially weakening its historical role in global health crises like Ebola and Covid. The ongoing conflict highlights a deep ideological divide within the administration regarding evidence-based public health policy and the agency's future direction.</p>

          <p>Russia's media regulator, Roskomnadzor, has imposed new restrictions on WhatsApp and Telegram calls, coinciding with the aggressive rollout of a state-approved "national messenger" app called Max. Max, controlled by Kremlin-linked entities, is set to become a "super-app" integrating government digital services and banking, mirroring China's WeChat, which raises significant privacy and surveillance concerns given its policy of passing information to government bodies. These moves are part of Russia's broader effort to tighten internet control, which includes blocking social media and independent media, fining users for "deliberately searching" extremist materials, and implementing widespread mobile internet blackouts, justified by drone attack defense, impacting daily life and business.</p>

          <p>Anthropic AI has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a landmark copyright infringement lawsuit brought by a group of authors, setting a significant precedent for how AI companies compensate creators. The settlement, awaiting judicial approval, will compensate authors approximately $3,000 per work for an estimated 500,000 books and includes destroying datasets containing pirated material. While a judge ruled Anthropic's use of books for AI model training constituted "fair use," he found the company improperly downloaded millions of books from online libraries like Library Genesis. This resolution signals a necessary evolution toward market-based licensing for AI training data, impacting ongoing legal battles against other tech giants.</p>

Trump praised Doral's location and beauty, reiterating a controversial plan from his first term to host a G7 summit at the same property, which was later abandoned due to criticism over potential personal profit. He dismissed such concerns, stating "There's no money in it," emphasizing the quality of the venue. Trump also expressed openness to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping attending as "observers," despite Putin's international arrest warrant, and confirmed he would skip this year's G20 summit in Johannesburg, sending Vice President JD Vance instead.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' pitching plans were unexpectedly altered when scheduled starter Tyler Glasnow was scratched from his start against the Baltimore Orioles due to back tightness. In a surprising and proactive move, Shohei Ohtani, who had his own scheduled pitching start scratched two days prior due to an illness, volunteered to step in and pitch on short notice. Manager Dave Roberts expressed hope that Glasnow's issue is not serious and aims for him to pitch early next week, noting the team did not want to put him in harm's way. Ohtani's willingness to take the mound earlier than planned, in his first start since August 27, is expected to provide a much-needed boost and rallying point for the team.</p>

The Scots held firm defensively against a strong opponent, earning a valuable point in the first of six matches towards the finals in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Clarke adopted an unusual but effective tactical shape, including a back four and two strikers, specifically to combat Denmark's physicality, recalling a chastening previous defeat. While some fans desired more exciting attacking play, the consensus praised the team's defensive performance and resilience, setting a positive foundation for upcoming matches against Belarus and Greece.

          <p>China's growing influence, particularly through the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), signals its ambition to establish a multipolar world order that challenges the traditional Western-led system. The SCO, now encompassing 40% of the global population and approximately 23% of global nominal GDP, is evolving beyond a mere security forum into a robust platform offering economic and political alternatives. With new members like Iran joining in 2023 and strong growth momentum in key economies like India and China, the organization's increasing output is making the US take notice and respond. This significant shift indicates a rebalancing of global power dynamics, prompting the US to re-evaluate its foreign policy strategies and potentially fire back against these emerging challenges to its hegemony.</p>

Armani, who founded his label in 1975, revolutionized both menswear and women's clothing with his signature loose, drapey, androgynous suits, embodying "effortless elegance" (sprezzatura). His pivotal role in dressing Richard Gere in the 1980 film "American Gigolo" launched his Hollywood relationship, leading him to become the unofficial couturier for the stars and famously turning the Academy Awards into the "Armani Awards." He strategically leveraged celebrity power to build a global fashion empire, forever changing how stars approached fashion and inspiring other designers to follow suit, despite some critics lamenting the loss of individual expression.</p>

He predicted an early general election, potentially in 2027, and announced plans to ramp up campaigning, including recruiting 5,000 vetted candidates by next year and forming a new department for government readiness.

          <p>Australia, the world's skin cancer capital, is embroiled in a sunscreen scandal after independent tests revealed several popular and expensive products failed to provide their claimed SPF protection. A consumer advocacy group, Choice Australia, found 16 out of 20 tested sunscreens did not meet their listed SPF rating, with Ultra Violette's Lean Screen SPF 50+ notably returning an SPF 4. This revelation sparked public outrage, product recalls, and a probe by the Therapeutic Goods Association. The issue highlights complexities in SPF testing and raises questions about global sunscreen regulation, prompting calls for greater scrutiny and consumer vigilance, though experts note that even lower SPF still offers significant protection.</p>
