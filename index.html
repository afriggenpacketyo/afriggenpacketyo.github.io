          <p>Investment in Chinese 'new consumer' stocks, such as Pop Mart and Mixue, is surging, driven by the spending habits of Gen Z consumers.  These companies are outperforming traditional consumer brands amidst a weak jobs market and deflationary trends. The strong performance of these stocks reflects investors' shifting focus towards companies catering to younger generations' preferences.
