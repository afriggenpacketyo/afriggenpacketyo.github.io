            <p>Many international adoptees in the U.S. are discovering they are not citizens, facing potential deportation due to adoptive parents failing to complete the naturalization process.

Advocates are pushing for Congress to remove the age cutoff, especially with increased deportation concerns under the current administration.

            <p>Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has launched a strong attack on Nigel Farage and the Tories for their criticism of the UK's net zero target, accusing them of spreading misinformation.

            <p>A recent survey reveals that people are increasingly frustrated with inefficient customer service systems, spending significant time on hold. The survey found that middle-aged people are the most frustrated, with booking NHS appointments being a particularly annoying experience. The thinktank that commissioned the survey believes that this frustration has a political dimension, potentially influencing voters to support parties that want to tear down the system. The "on hold" problem is also an excrescence of the private sector.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration's efforts to expand coal mining while simultaneously cutting funding for miner health and safety agencies has drawn criticism. Agencies responsible for protecting miners from hazards like black lung have been affected by government cuts. Advocates express concern that the administration's policies prioritize coal production over the well-being of miners. The administration also wants to pause a new rule on silica dust – a kind of pneumoconiosis or “black lung” disease that is increasingly striking younger miners in Appalachia, as workers dig for harder-to-reach veins of coal.</p>

            <p>Scientists claim to have discovered a new color, dubbed 'olo', a saturated shade of blue-green, through laser stimulation of specific retinal cells. The research, published in Science Advances, suggests that olo is more saturated than any color visible in the real world. The experiment involved firing laser pulses into the eyes of participants to stimulate M cones in the retina. While some experts are skeptical, the research team believes the findings could potentially aid research into color blindness.</p>

A survey indicates that a significant percentage of grandmothers provide childcare for their grandchildren, often on a weekly basis. As grandparents assume more responsibilities, they may experience strain and shifts in their personal plans. The dynamic between grandparents, parents, and grandchildren can become transactional, impacting the overall family structure.</p>
