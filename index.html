          <p>The article explores the often-overlooked role of personal finance, such as pensions and investments, in fueling the climate crisis by supporting fossil fuel projects. It highlights that shifting to a sustainable pension provider can significantly reduce an individual's carbon footprint. Major banks continue to invest heavily in the fossil fuel industry, often without the knowledge of their customers. The article also discusses green finance alternatives and the challenges of transparency and regulation in sustainable investing. Ultimately, the article suggests that individual actions, combined with citizen advocacy, can influence financial institutions to adopt more climate-friendly practices.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's recent criticism, Russia and Ukraine continued cross-border drone attacks, marking over three years of ongoing conflict. Ukrainian officials reported engaging targets across the country, including Kyiv, with Russia launching 364 "air attack vehicles," most of which were reportedly neutralized. President Zelenskyy condemned the attacks and urged international pressure through sanctions, while Trump criticized both Putin and Zelenskyy's actions. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov expressed gratitude for Trump's assistance in organizing negotiations, highlighting the complexities of achieving a ceasefire. The ongoing strikes underscore the deep-seated tensions and the challenges in reaching a peaceful resolution to the conflict.</p>

          <p>LEVA, a delivery robot developed by ETH Zurich, combines wheeled and legged locomotion to navigate diverse terrains autonomously. Equipped with GPS, lidar, and cameras, LEVA can identify, lift, and carry cargo boxes weighing up to 187 pounds without human intervention. Its design allows it to roll on smooth surfaces and climb stairs or traverse rough ground, making it suitable for urban deliveries, agricultural tasks, construction sites, and emergency response scenarios. This innovation could lead to faster, more reliable deliveries and reduced labor costs for businesses, potentially revolutionizing material handling and logistics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, "The Age of Diagnosis," argues that modern medicine's eagerness to diagnose and screen patients is creating problems, with doctors sometimes too quick to label conditions and prescribe treatments. The author, Dr. Suzanne O'Sullivan, advocates for "slow medicine," where doctors take time to develop relationships with patients and carefully monitor symptoms before making a diagnosis. Overdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary treatments and anxiety, and O'Sullivan suggests that a more measured approach is needed to balance technological advancements with clinical judgment. She emphasizes that diagnosis is a clinical skill requiring understanding the patient's story in the context of tests.</p>

          <p>Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa is facing criticism for accepting contributions from the oil industry and defending the state's struggling oil industry, despite his previous environmental advocacy. Villaraigosa warns of potential gas price increases due to refinery closures and advocates for an "all-of-the-above" energy approach, including oil and gas. This shift has upset some environmental groups who view it as a betrayal of his earlier commitments. Villaraigosa argues that his focus is on the rising cost of living for working-class Americans, reflecting a moderate stance in the governor's race.</p>

          <p>An Austrian court has overturned former Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conviction for giving false testimony to a parliamentary inquiry. The three-member panel of judges acquitted Kurz, who had previously received an eight-month suspended jail sentence. Kurz, who resigned as chancellor in 2021 amid allegations of financial impropriety, argued that he was interrupted during his testimony and did not intend to make false statements. He remains under investigation for corruption in a separate case.</p>

          <p>Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukrainian cities following signs that President Trump is stepping back from diplomatic efforts and reducing military assistance. Recent bombardments have resulted in numerous casualties, and analysts suggest that Russia is exploiting the situation as the U.S. pulls back. While Trump has condemned the attacks, he has not indicated a willingness to increase military aid to Ukraine. The lack of interceptor missiles and continued advancements in Russia's arsenal are exacerbating the situation for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Marcel Ophuls, known for his documentary "The Sorrow and the Pity," which challenged the myth of widespread French resistance during the Nazi occupation, has died at 97.

Ophuls directed other documentaries, including the Oscar-winning "Hôtel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," but "The Sorrow and the Pity" remains his most significant work.</p>
