          <p>A 12-year-old girl in France has died from severe food poisoning after consuming meat from butcher shops in Saint-Quentin. Eight children have become sick since June 12, with five contracting hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), often caused by E. coli. Authorities have closed two butcher shops as a precaution and are testing samples to determine the source of the contamination, with results expected early next week. E. coli outbreaks have also occurred recently in the U.S., involving ground beef and carrots, highlighting the ongoing risk of foodborne illnesses.
