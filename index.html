          <p>Japan's farm minister, Taku Eto, resigned after facing public criticism for stating he never buys rice due to receiving it as gifts, which angered citizens struggling with rising rice prices. The resignation comes amidst low approval ratings for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government and ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S. Japan has been dealing with soaring rice prices due to inclement weather and policies protecting local farmers, leading to consumer anger over food costs and overall inflation. The ministry has attempted to curb prices by releasing government stockpiles, but with little effect as demand has skyrocketed due to increased tourism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new satellite analysis reveals that tropical forests were destroyed at the fastest recorded rate in 2024, with fires overtaking land clearances for agriculture as the primary cause. The Amazon rainforest has been particularly affected due to record drought conditions, raising concerns about its resilience and potential irreversible decline into savanna. The loss of these forests, which store vast amounts of carbon, has released 3.1 billion tonnes of planet-warming gases, equivalent to the emissions of the European Union. However, countries in South East Asia have shown progress in reducing forest loss through concerted government and community efforts.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans for a comprehensive missile defense system, dubbed the ‚ÄúGolden Dome,‚Äù aimed at protecting the United States from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missile threats. The project, a priority since Trump took office, seeks to create a system similar to Israel‚Äôs Iron Dome but faces significant logistical and financial challenges. While Trump estimates the cost at $175 billion, the Congressional Budget Office suggests it could range from $161 billion to $542 billion. General Michael Guetlein of the Space Force will oversee the project, which aims to be fully operational before the end of Trump's term.</p>

          <p>Malaysia, a key player in the global semiconductor industry, is caught in the crosshairs of President Trump's trade policies, creating uncertainty for its ambitious plans to produce high-tech chips for artificial intelligence. Trump's administration has imposed tariffs on Malaysian exports, leading companies like Intel and Oracle to discuss coping strategies with the Malaysian government. Despite Malaysia's efforts to attract investment and develop a local chip-design sector, the potential for increased tariffs could disrupt the global supply chain and raise costs for American consumers. The country exported $16.2 billion worth of chips to the U.S. last year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is investigating whether the Trump administration violated an order by deporting migrants to South Sudan, a country the State Department advises against visiting due to crime and conflict. Judge Brian Murphy ordered the government to maintain custody and control of any deportees covered under a lawsuit challenging deportations to third countries, ensuring their return if the removals were unlawful. The order follows an emergency motion from attorneys who believe migrants were deported to South Sudan, despite having orders of removal to their home countries. The Justice Department lawyer claimed one migrant was deported to Myanmar, but declined to disclose the destination of another, citing classified information.</p>

          <p>A federal court ordered the Trump administration to maintain custody of migrants on a deportation flight reportedly headed to South Sudan, raising concerns about violating a previous injunction. The judge, Brian E. Murphy, expressed concern that the administration defied his order not to deport immigrants to countries where they are not from and may face danger. Immigration lawyers said at least two migrants were told they were going to be deported to South Sudan, a violence-plagued country. A Justice Department lawyer said one migrant was returned to Myanmar, but declined to say where the second migrant was deported, saying it was classified information.</p>

          <p>The Justice Department has opened an investigation into former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo concerning his testimony to Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to officials familiar with the matter. This investigation follows the DOJ's earlier decision to drop charges against current New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Congressional Republicans have accused Cuomo of lying to Congress during an investigation into coronavirus deaths in nursing homes. The House panel on the COVID-19 pandemic alleged Cuomo was involved in drafting and editing a 2020 state report on nursing home deaths, but he testified that he was not involved.</p>
