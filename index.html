A legal expert interviewed in the article strongly cautions against this approach, labeling self-representation as "almost always a mistake" in serious federal cases. The analysis explains the significant disadvantages, including the inability to later claim ineffective assistance of counsel and the challenging courtroom dynamics that arise for the judge and prosecution.</p>

          <p>This commentary delves into the recent public controversy sparked by a Holocaust Museum LA social media post that used the phrase "Never Again. For anyone." The author examines the historical origins and evolving interpretations of the slogan, from its anti-fascist roots to its adoption by various movements. The piece argues that the intense backlash against the museum's inclusive message signals a troubling shift away from a universalist understanding of Holocaust memory toward a more exclusive and ethnonationalist perspective.</p>
