          <p>British actor John Alford, known for his role in "London's Burning," has been found guilty of sexually assaulting two teenage girls. A jury at St Albans Crown Court convicted the 53-year-old, whose real name is John Shannon, of assaulting a 14-year-old and a 15-year-old girl in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, in April 2022. Alford had denied the charges throughout the trial. The verdict concludes the legal proceedings against the actor, who was a prominent figure in British television during the 1990s.</p>

          <p>Ohio Senator Bernie Moreno has introduced the "Halting International Relocation of Employment Act" (HIRE Act), which aims to penalize U.S. companies for outsourcing jobs. The proposed legislation would impose a 25% tax on payments made to foreign workers who serve U.S. consumers, with the revenue generated being used to fund American apprenticeship and workforce development programs. Moreno stated the bill is designed to protect American jobs and encourage domestic employment by making it financially disadvantageous for companies to move operations overseas. The bill also includes provisions to prevent tax avoidance and increase transparency.</p>

          <p>A decade after the notable arrest of the "Feminist Five," China's feminist movement is navigating a paradoxical environment of heightened public awareness and severe government crackdown. While issues like sexual harassment and gender discrimination have gained more public traction, authorities have systematically silenced feminist voices by banning online accounts and media outlets, framing the movement as a threat fueled by foreign influence. Despite the shrinking space for public discourse and the risks faced by activists, the movement continues in a decentralized form, challenging patriarchal norms and political restrictions through informal networks.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market showed significant signs of cooling as nonfarm payrolls increased by only 22,000 in August, falling far short of the 75,000 expected by economists. The Bureau of Labor Statistics report also indicated that the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, while previous months' figures were revised downward, showing a net loss of 13,000 jobs in June. This slowdown in hiring is raising concerns about economic turbulence and is expected to solidify the Federal Reserve's decision to implement an interest rate cut later this month to stimulate the economy.

          <p>Four Democratic senators have sent a letter to the Smithsonian Institution's secretary, urging the organization to withstand political pressure from the White House. The letter follows President Trump's recent criticism of the Smithsonian's exhibits as "WOKE" and a White House memo targeting specific displays for allegedly presenting a negative view of American history. The senators emphasized that the Smithsonian is an independent federal trust under congressional oversight, not an executive agency subject to presidential control. They affirmed their commitment to protecting the institution's autonomy and ensuring it can continue to tell the full, uncensored story of America.</p>

          <p>Despite a large-scale military parade in Beijing intended to project national strength, isolated but significant acts of dissent are surfacing in China. One notable protest involved an activist named Qi Hong projecting anti-communist slogans onto a high-rise building in Chongqing, criticizing what he called the government's "hate propaganda" and lack of reflection on its own past atrocities. While state media heavily promoted public enthusiasm for the parade, commentators note a divided public sentiment, with skepticism and criticism often silenced through censorship and arrests. These rare acts of defiance highlight an undercurrent of opposition to the ruling party's narrative.</p>

          <p>This opinion article by Margaret Sullivan scrutinizes the mainstream media's cautious approach to covering President Donald Trump's health, contrasting it with the intense focus previously placed on Joe Biden's age. Sullivan notes that Trump's recent brief disappearance from public view, combined with visible health issues like swollen ankles and verbal confusion, sparked widespread social media speculation but received minimal coverage from major news organizations. The article argues for responsible, evidence-based reporting on a president's health, suggesting that a lack of factual information creates a vacuum filled by rumors and that journalists should persistently seek and report the facts.</p>

The group successfully lobbied to have the $200 tax on suppressors and short-barreled firearms removed in a recent budget bill. Immediately after the bill was signed, the GOA filed a lawsuit to overturn the remaining NFA registration requirements for these items entirely.

          <p>China's government has issued a new action plan aimed at strengthening its domestic electronics manufacturing industry and achieving greater self-sufficiency in its supply chains. The plan, released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, emphasizes the strategic importance of the sector for national economic and political security. It sets goals for developing advanced core technologies and promoting the use of domestically produced equipment to fill supply chain gaps. This initiative is a direct response to increasing U.S. export restrictions on advanced semiconductor technology, as China seeks to reduce its reliance on foreign components and expertise.</p>

          <p>An internal memo reveals that the Department of Homeland Security has requested the use of Naval Station Great Lakes in Illinois as a staging area for an upcoming immigration enforcement campaign in the Chicago area. The base will accommodate approximately 250 federal agents and serve as a command post for "removal operations" expected to last for about 30 days. This use of a military installation for domestic immigration enforcement reflects an expansion of the military's supporting role in the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts. The move comes as Chicago officials and community groups prepare for the controversial federal crackdown.</p>

          <p>A tragic accident involving the historic Elevador da Gloria funicular in Lisbon has resulted in the deaths of 16 people, with more than 20 others injured. The streetcar reportedly hurtled out of control down a steep hill, derailed, and crashed into a building. Authorities are working to identify the victims, who include citizens from Portugal, South Korea, Switzerland, France, and the United States, with several other nationalities also likely among the deceased. Investigators are examining the possibility that a snapped steel cable caused the brake failure, leading to Portugal's worst-ever streetcar disaster. The city has declared three days of mourning.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has commented on the New York City mayoral election, stating he would like to see two candidates drop out to create a one-on-one contest against the frontrunner, Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani. Polls suggest Mamdani's strongest challenger in a head-to-head race would be former Governor Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent. The other major candidates are incumbent Mayor Eric Adams and Republican Curtis Sliwa. The president's remarks come amid reports that the White House was exploring ways to entice Adams and Sliwa to exit the race, a claim both candidates have publicly rejected.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board of directors is asking shareholders to approve a new, massive compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth up to $1 trillion over the next decade. The plan would award Musk approximately 423 million shares if the company achieves ambitious milestones, including reaching a market capitalization of $8.5 trillion and hitting significant production targets for vehicles, robotaxis, and humanoid robots. The board argues the award is necessary to retain and incentivize Musk's leadership through a pivotal growth period. This proposal follows a Delaware judge's decision to revoke his previous $56 billion pay package from 2018.</p>

          <p>Angela Rayner has resigned as the UK's deputy prime minister and housing secretary after admitting she did not pay sufficient tax on a home sale. The resignation follows a determination by the prime minister's ethics adviser that she had breached the ministerial code. Rayner, a prominent figure in the Labour Party with a compelling "working-class warrior" background, also stepped down as the party's deputy leader. In her resignation letter, she expressed deep regret for her actions. Her departure is a significant blow to Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government and marks a sudden end to her rapid political ascent.</p>

Only 33% of active funds delivered higher returns than their index equivalents between July 2024 and June 2025, a period marked by the exact market volatility that active managers often claim allows them to excel. The long-term data is even starker, with just 21% of active strategies surviving and outperforming over the past decade. The primary driver of this underperformance is the higher fees associated with active management. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, Germany, with a series of exhibitions and events. However, the centennial is taking place under a cloud of political controversy, as Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has criticized the celebration and denounced the movement for promoting "globalist uniformity," echoing the Nazi party's "degenerate art" attacks from the 1930s. Despite these challenges, the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation is proceeding with its program, which focuses on the evolution of materials and sustainable design, while also forming alliances to counter the far-right's culture war attacks.</p>
