          <p>Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso has indicated a readiness to unilaterally change Senate rules to confirm President Trump's nominees, bypassing Democratic opposition. Negotiations to approve dozens of non-controversial picks collapsed after President Trump rejected funding demands from Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. With 145 nominations pending, Republicans are considering the "nuclear option" to alter debate time rules for sub-Cabinet and ambassadorial positions. This move is being weighed against the need for bipartisan cooperation on upcoming legislative priorities, including government funding.</p>

          <p>The stock market's recent gains, heavily reliant on the artificial intelligence sector, are facing new scrutiny. Despite reporting strong profits, AI chipmaker Nvidia saw its stock dip, reflecting investor uncertainty about the tangible returns on massive AI investments. A recent MIT survey indicating that 95% of companies experimenting with AI have yet to see revenue from it has amplified these concerns. This situation unfolds amidst broader economic pressures, including President Trump's tariffs and his administration's increased involvement in private tech companies.</p>

          <p>Several local councils in the UK are continuing their legal efforts to prevent hotels from being used to house asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal decision. The court overturned an injunction against The Bell Hotel in Epping, a ruling seen as a setback for similar challenges. However, councils like West Northamptonshire and Broxbourne argue the hotels are unsuitable and strain local services, vowing to press on with their cases. The government maintains it will proceed with its plan to house asylum seekers in an orderly fashion while aiming to stop using hotels by 2029.</p>

          <p>Russia launched a significant overnight attack on Ukraine, deploying 45 missiles and over 500 drones, according to the Ukrainian Air Force. While most projectiles were intercepted, strikes on seven locations resulted in at least one death and 24 injuries, with the Zaporizhzhia region being hit particularly hard. The attack caused extensive damage to residential buildings and infrastructure, leaving thousands without power. In response, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called for stronger international sanctions against Moscow, while Ukrainian forces reportedly struck two Russian oil refineries.</p>

          <p>A couple has recounted the distressing discovery of their stillborn daughter's body being kept on a sofa at the home of funeral director Amie Upton. Cody and Liam Townend had entrusted Ms. Upton with their daughter's funeral arrangements, believing the body was at a proper facility. The case is part of a wider investigation into Ms. Upton's service, Florrie's Army, which has prompted calls for stricter regulation of the funeral industry. West Yorkshire Police investigated but found no evidence of criminal activity, while the government is considering options to improve standards.</p>

The court affirmed a lower panel's decision that the president does not have the authority to unilaterally alter America's tariff schedules. This judgment deals a blow to one of the central pillars of Trump's economic strategy and refashioning of trade policy. The ruling sets the stage for a potential showdown at the Supreme Court, which will ultimately determine the extent of presidential power in this domain.</p>

          <p>A worldwide movement to protect children online, spearheaded by regulations like the UK's Online Safety Act, is fueling a surge in AI-driven safety technologies. These new rules compel tech companies to prevent children from accessing harmful and age-inappropriate content, leading to the adoption of advanced age verification systems. Companies like Yoti are using AI to estimate a user's age from facial features, while phone manufacturers are developing devices with built-in AI to block explicit content. This regulatory pressure is creating a new market for child safety tech, though it also raises privacy concerns.</p>

          <p>A tactical analysis explores why Manchester United has struggled under manager Ruben Amorim, highlighted by a recent loss to a lower-league team. The article examines Amorim's rigid 5-2-3 positional system, which relies on creating numerical overloads in wide areas through specific passing routines. This approach has proven vulnerable to teams that employ man-to-man marking and defend with a back five, neutralizing United's primary strategy. The system's lack of encouragement for individual dribbling and player rotation makes it predictable and less effective against disciplined Premier League opponents.</p>

The move addresses fears that the previous restrictions were causing an entire generation to leave permanently before their 18th birthdays.

          <p>Human microbiome scientist Wang Leyao has left a US government-affiliated position to join the Shenzhen Medical Academy of Research and Translation (Smart) in China. Wang, formerly an assistant professor at UMass Amherst and part of an NIH cohort, is now a senior research fellow at Smart's Institute of Human Immunology. Her departure comes during a period of controversy and policy shifts at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) under President Trump's second term.

          <p>South Korean prosecutors have indicted former first lady Kim Keon Hee on charges of bribery and stock market manipulation. She is accused of generating over $720,000 in criminal proceeds through various illegal activities, including a stock manipulation scheme between 2010 and 2012. Kim is the wife of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was recently impeached and arrested over his attempt to declare martial law. The indictment is part of a broader investigation into Yoon's administration, which he had previously vetoed while in office, that is now proceeding under the new government.</p>
