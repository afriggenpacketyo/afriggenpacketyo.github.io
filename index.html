          <p>A devastating 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar has claimed over 1,600 lives and injured thousands more, with the Chinese embassy fearing a further rise in casualties among its citizens.  Rescue operations are hampered by widespread damage, highlighting the challenges in a country already grappling with civil war. The potential bias lies in the focus on Chinese casualties, potentially downplaying the suffering of the broader Myanmar population.</p>
