          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily reinstated operations at the "Alligator Alcatraz" immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, overturning a lower court's order to halt its activities. The facility, built to support migrant detention and deportation efforts, faced a lawsuit from environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe, who argued it lacked proper environmental review and threatened sensitive wetlands. Governor Ron DeSantis and the Department of Homeland Security lauded the decision, asserting the facility's mission would continue. However, the plaintiffs remain determined to pursue their appeal, believing the controversial site will ultimately be shut down due to its environmental impact.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are projected to open higher, with investors closely watching the upcoming U.S. August jobs report to gauge the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. Recent payroll data has already boosted market confidence in a September cut, alleviating fears of a sharp economic decline. Meanwhile, Danish wind farm developer Orsted announced a cut to its full-year earnings guidance, attributing the revision to unusually low offshore wind speeds. The company is also engaged in legal action against the Trump administration to resume construction on a stalled New England offshore wind farm, underscoring regulatory hurdles impacting renewable energy projects.</p>

          <p>Europe's difficult geopolitical landscape, often termed a "summer from hell," is now extending into autumn, exacerbated by mounting pressures from the administrations of U.S. President Trump and China's President Xi Jinping. Commentators are increasingly using stark language, such as "Europe’s century of humiliation" and "summer of geopolitical subservience," to describe the continent's perceived diminished standing. This period reflects a struggle for European nations to maintain their strategic independence and economic stability amid intense global power dynamics. The ongoing challenges suggest a significant reevaluation of Europe's role and influence in the evolving international order.</p>

          <p>Thaksin Shinawatra, Thailand's former prime minister, unexpectedly left the country just hours before a parliamentary vote to select a new prime minister. His departure precedes a Supreme Court ruling that could potentially lead to his imprisonment. Thaksin, who was ousted in a 2006 coup and lived in exile for years, had returned in 2023 to serve a reduced sentence, but his early release from a hospital suite sparked controversy. This political turmoil follows the recent removal of his daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, from the prime minister's office over an ethics violation, further destabilizing the Shinawatra family's political power.</p>

New research from the University of Bath confirms the growing threat, finding spice in over a quarter of confiscated vapes in some areas.

During a White House dinner with prominent tech executives, he signaled that companies like Apple, which has committed an additional $100 billion to domestic manufacturing, would be spared from these levies. This initiative aligns with a broader U.S. effort to onshore its semiconductor supply chain, a strategy that has already seen major companies like TSMC and Samsung invest hundreds of billions in American plants since 2020.

          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden recently underwent surgery for skin cancer, with video showing a fresh scar on his head. This procedure follows his May revelation of a stage-four prostate cancer diagnosis, which had spread to his bones and was described as an "aggressive form" with a high Gleason score. Biden's spokesperson confirmed he is recovering well from the basal cell carcinoma removal, a common skin cancer type. His wife, Jill Biden, also had similar skin cancers removed earlier. The article highlights the ongoing health concerns for the former president, providing updates on his medical treatments.</p>

Prosecutors argued Adelson orchestrated the murder-for-hire plot due to Markel's refusal to allow her daughter, Wendi Adelson, to move their children away from Tallahassee after a bitter divorce. Adelson's conviction marks the fifth in this decade-long case, which has captivated Florida with its sordid details.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.7 billion, making it the third-largest in U.S. lottery history, with a cash value of $770.3 million. This marks a record 42nd consecutive drawing without a top prize winner. An analysis of Powerball data reveals significant variations in after-tax payouts across states, due to differing state income tax laws on lottery winnings. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery prizes, allowing winners to retain a larger portion of their winnings after federal taxes. Conversely, states such as New York and Minnesota have higher state taxes, resulting in lower net payouts for winners.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order renaming the Department of Defense as the "Department of War," a move that would revert the agency to its pre-1947 designation. The White House confirmed that "Department of War" will serve as a "secondary title," allowing officials, including the Secretary, to use the new nomenclature. Trump has previously expressed a preference for the older name, believing it conveys a stronger image. While it's unclear if congressional action is ultimately required for a permanent change, this initiative reflects Trump's desire to project a more assertive military posture.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article from The Atlantic sharply criticizes President Trump's plan to rename the Department of Defense as the "Department of War," labeling it "inanity" and "cringe." The author argues the move, which Secretary Pete Hegseth also supports, reflects a simplistic "tough guy" image rather than a nuanced understanding of national security. Historically, the department was renamed in 1947 to reflect a broader, ongoing commitment to defense in a complex world, a decision made by leaders who understood the realities of modern warfare. The critique suggests the change is a superficial rebranding that ignores historical context and the actual nature of global security.</p>

Trump's administration argues that the President acted lawfully in removing Slaughter, citing recent Supreme Court decisions affirming presidential authority over executive agency heads. Slaughter and another Democratic commissioner were removed in March as part of Trump's efforts to influence federal agencies. However, appeals courts have maintained that FTC commissioners can only be removed for cause, such as neglect or malfeasance, which Trump did not provide, leading to an ongoing legal battle over presidential power.</p>
