          <p>Edan Alexander, a U.S.-Israeli citizen, was released by Hamas after being held hostage in Gaza for over 19 months, coinciding with President Trump's departure for a Middle East trip. Alexander, who served in the Israeli military, was abducted during the October 7, 2023, attack. Hamas stated the release was aimed at fostering a ceasefire and humanitarian aid to Gaza, while Israel maintained it made no commitments beyond ensuring Alexander's safe passage. Trump hailed the release as a potential step toward ending the conflict, amid ongoing concerns about food security and Israeli military actions in Gaza.

He clarified that the gift would be to the U.S. Department of Defense and not for personal use, eventually being decommissioned and given to his presidential library. This comes after Trump previously criticized Qatar as a sponsor of terrorism.

Tariffs, which can be imposed and waived unilaterally by the president, are described as regressive taxes that disproportionately affect low-income individuals. The author contends that the administration's focus on trade deficits distracts from the real goal of shifting the cost of government from the wealthiest to the poorest, while also increasing the president's power.</p>

          <p>The UK government faces challenges in reducing immigration despite numerous promises, with migration levels hitting unprecedented highs. The government's new plan aims to reduce net migration through tighter rules, including higher qualification requirements for work visas and stricter student rules. However, these measures may impact economic growth, social care, and universities. Economists disagree on the exact impact of immigration on economic growth, with concerns about pressure on public services and housing. The government's plan seeks to balance reducing immigration with maintaining economic prosperity.</p>

          <p>President Trump defended the administration's plans to receive a luxury jumbo jet donated by the Qatari government, arguing it would be "stupid" to reject a free plane. He stated it was a "very nice gesture" and that the plane would be a gift to the Department of Defense, not to him personally. Sources indicate the plane would be available for Trump's use as Air Force One until shortly before he leaves office, at which time ownership would transfer to the Trump presidential library foundation.

Alexander's release, unlike most others, was not accompanied by a formal cease-fire, highlighting the failure of broader truce efforts.

          <p>Labour's new immigration plan aims to reduce net migration into the UK through a series of measures. The plan includes tightening work visa requirements, increasing the residency wait time for indefinite leave to remain, and scrapping the dedicated care visa. At the same time, eligibility for elite university graduates is being expanded. The government says it wants to significantly reduce net migration without setting an overall cap, opting for a more flexible approach.</p>

          <p>Some gas stations are charging customers $1 more per gallon for using credit cards, exploiting a legal loophole that allows businesses to impose surcharges as long as customers are informed beforehand. This practice has been observed in Florida, where gas stations are reportedly attempting to conceal the extra charge. Consumer attorney Thomas Patti confirmed that it is legal to offer a discount for cash-based services while charging a standard price for credit card payments.</p>
