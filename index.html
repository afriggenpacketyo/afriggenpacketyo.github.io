          <p>Five days of torrential rainfall in South Korea have resulted in at least 14 deaths and left 12 people missing. The severe weather caused landslides, house collapses, and flash floods, particularly in southern regions like Sancheong. Authorities reported that over 3,800 people were evacuated from their homes as a precautionary measure. While the rain has since subsided and heavy rain alerts have been lifted, the country is now dealing with the devastating aftermath of the extreme downpours.</p>

          <p>Boxing legend Manny Pacquiao made his return to the ring after a four-year retirement, fighting WBC welterweight champion Mario Barrios to a majority draw. The 46-year-old showed flashes of his former speed and agility, but the 30-year-old champion's stamina proved challenging in the later rounds. One judge scored the fight for Barrios, while two others scored it a draw, allowing Barrios to retain his title. Pacquiao expressed his belief that he won and has called for a rematch.</p>

          <p>Actor Freddie Prinze Jr. recently discussed the longevity of his 23-year marriage to actress Sarah Michelle Gellar, attributing their success to a foundation of friendship and mutual respect. He emphasized that marriage requires continuous effort from both partners and that they navigate disagreements while maintaining their bond. The couple, who met while filming "I Know What You Did Last Summer" in 1997, have two children together. Gellar has also commented on the topic, suggesting that a willingness to work on the relationship is key in a society that often treats things as disposable.</p>

          <p>A California woman, Linda Duffey Gwozdz, was convicted of murdering her husband despite her unusual defense claim that the shooting was a tragic accident inspired by a cartoon. She told police she believed the gun was unloaded after her husband said "no more buwwets" in an Elmer Fudd voice, a game they allegedly played. After an initial mistrial, prosecutors in a second trial focused on forensic evidence, including the fact that the victim was shot twice. The jury ultimately found her guilty of second-degree murder, and she was sentenced to 40 years to life in prison.</p>

          <p>In an analytical article, Simon Tisdall explores why achieving peace in major global conflicts has become so difficult, pointing to a crisis in the global moral order. The piece argues that the rise of moral relativism, where universal principles are abandoned for subjective viewpoints, undermines efforts to mediate disputes in places like Gaza and Ukraine. Without a shared understanding of right and wrong, conflicts persist indefinitely, fueled by disinformation and political polarization. This breakdown of a collective moral conscience allows atrocities to continue and makes the work of peacemakers seem futile.</p>
