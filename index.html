          <h2>Powerful Russian Earthquake Triggers Tsunami Waves and Warnings Across the Pacific</h2>

          <p>A massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered widespread tsunami warnings across the Pacific, including for Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast. The first waves reaching Hawaii were relatively small, measuring around four to five feet, but officials urged continued caution as the event could last for hours. Authorities opened shelters and advised residents to move inland, while experts explained that a tsunami is a series of powerful waves, not a single event. The quake also prompted advisories for California, Oregon, and other Pacific nations, causing some disruptions to air travel.</p>

          <p>HSBC announced a $3 billion share buyback despite reporting second-quarter profits that fell short of analyst expectations, with pre-tax profits declining 29% year-over-year to $6.3 billion. The bank attributed the miss to impairment charges and income loss from divested businesses. CEO Georges Elhedery highlighted global economic uncertainty and trade disruptions as significant challenges, warning that lending demand would likely remain subdued for the rest of the year. The bank is continuing its restructuring efforts to cut costs and pivot its focus toward its wealth division and Asian markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake near Russia, tsunami warnings prompted evacuations and significant travel disruptions in Hawaii and Japan. In Hawaii, authorities ordered commercial vessels to leave harbors, and several flights to the islands were canceled or diverted back to the U.S. mainland. While initial waves observed near Hawaii were not of major consequence, Governor Josh Green cautioned that the state would not be 'all clear' for several hours. Japan also issued tsunami warnings for its eastern coastline, urging residents in vulnerable areas to move to higher ground as a precaution against potential waves.</p>

          <p>An off-duty NYPD officer, Didarul Islam, was one of four people killed in a shooting rampage inside a Manhattan office building. The 36-year-old officer, a father of two with a third child on the way, was working a paid security detail when he was shot by the gunman. The article highlights the profound grief within the law enforcement community and the supportive response, described as a "sea of blue," for the fallen officer's family. NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch was praised for her leadership in the aftermath of the tragedy, vowing that the department would support the family indefinitely.</p>

          <p>This essay examines the online mockery directed at NBA player Karl-Anthony Towns, whose expressive and joyful demeanor has been labeled "zesty" by critics, a term used to code him as queer. The author connects this public policing of Towns's behavior to broader cultural anxieties about Black masculinity and homophobia, drawing parallels to his own childhood experiences of having his joy suppressed. The article argues that despite Towns having the best season of his career, his refusal to conform to a rigid, humorless standard of masculinity has made him a target. It suggests this phenomenon reflects a world where expressive joy in male bodies is still treated as a form of defiance.</p>

While the RBA has already cut rates twice this year, it held them steady in its last meeting to ensure inflation was firmly under control. Analysts now widely anticipate a 25-basis-point cut at the RBA's upcoming August meeting, citing the favorable inflation data, a weaker global growth outlook, and rising domestic unemployment.

The article cites evidence that the US and UK governments knew Israel was obstructing aid but took no meaningful action, effectively enabling the crisis. It concludes that despite overwhelming evidence, Western powers have indulged Israel's denials and that their gestures, like airdrops, are mere cover for a policy of mass starvation.</p>

          <p>Chinese paleontologists have discovered that an ancient, clam-like marine invertebrate may have practiced a form of "social distancing" to ensure its survival. The findings are based on 436-million-year-old fossils of a brachiopod species found in Guizhou province, which were arranged in a highly regular, checkerboard-like pattern on the former sea floor. Researchers believe the creatures used hundreds of flexible, bristle-like structures, thinner than a human hair, to sense their neighbors and maintain optimal spacing. This arrangement likely improved their ability to filter feed from the water without competing with each other, demonstrating an ancient example of complex behavioral adaptation.</p>

          <p>The gunman who killed four people in a Midtown Manhattan office building was reportedly targeting the NFL's headquarters, according to New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Investigators found a note in which the shooter, Shane Tamura, indicated he believed he had the brain disease CTE and blamed the NFL. Tamura, who had a history of mental health incidents but a valid concealed carry permit, took the wrong elevator and began his rampage at a different company. The victims included NYPD Officer Didarul Islam and Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner. The incident has raised questions about gun laws and mental health systems.</p>

          <h2>California Coastal Areas Brace for Tsunami Waves with Specific Timings and Height Predictions</h2>

          <p>Following a massive earthquake off the coast of Russia, California authorities issued detailed forecasts for the expected tsunami waves, with the most significant impact predicted for the state's North Coast. A tsunami warning was issued for Del Norte and Humboldt counties, with waves up to five feet expected in Crescent City, an area historically vulnerable to tsunamis. The rest of the coast was under an advisory, with smaller waves of one foot or less predicted for Southern California. Officials urged residents to stay away from beaches and harbors, warning that even small waves can create dangerous currents and damage infrastructure.</p>

          <h2>NTSB to Hold Hearing on Deadly Midair Collision Near Washington, D.C.</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is holding a three-day investigative hearing into the January midair collision between an American Airlines regional jet and a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter. The crash, which occurred near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport (DCA), killed all 67 people aboard both aircraft, making it the deadliest U.S. aviation accident in over two decades. The hearing will examine the crowded and complex airspace around DCA, which the NTSB chair has called an 'intolerable risk.' Investigators are also looking into whether the helicopter's altitude instruments were functioning correctly and if its crew was hampered by night-vision goggles.</p>
