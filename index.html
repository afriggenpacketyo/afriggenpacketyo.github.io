          <p>Customs officials at Germany's Cologne Bonn airport discovered approximately 1,500 young tarantulas concealed within plastic containers inside sponge cake boxes. The shipment, originating from Vietnam, was flagged due to a suspicious odor that did not match the declared contents. A customs spokesperson described the seizure as extraordinary and expressed sadness over the exploitation of animals for profit. Most of the spiders did not survive the journey, and criminal proceedings are now underway against the intended recipient for alleged violations of animal welfare and customs laws.</p>

          <p>Following a preliminary report on the Air India crash that killed 260 people, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has stated that the fuel control switches on Boeing aircraft are safe. The investigation highlighted that the switches on the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner were moved to the "cut-off" position shortly after takeoff, referencing a 2018 FAA advisory that recommended inspections. However, the FAA clarified it does not consider the issue an unsafe condition warranting a mandatory directive. Air India's CEO has cautioned against drawing premature conclusions while the full investigation continues.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of catastrophic flooding in Texas Hill Country, search and rescue operations for missing individuals are ongoing, though they were significantly hampered by heavy rains. Kerr County officials are grappling with the disaster's scale, with one commissioner highlighting the need for improved infrastructure like sirens and diversion dams. The area remains under a flood watch as more rainfall is expected, compounding the challenges for first responders and the community. An extended period of dry weather is not anticipated until later in the week, delaying potential relief.</p>

          <p>The secluded New Hampshire mansion where Jeffrey Epstein's accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, was arrested has been put on the market for $2.5 million. The 156-acre property was reportedly purchased in 2019 by an LLC with ties to Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking. Her arrest at the remote hideout occurred nearly five years ago, following Epstein's death in jail. This real estate listing emerges as Maxwell continues to appeal her conviction, seeking a review from the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A court in the Netherlands has ordered the confiscation of approximately $112 million in criminal assets from Jos Leijdekkers, a prominent drug lord known as "Chubby Jos." The assets were determined to be proceeds from extensive cocaine trafficking and gold purchases. Leijdekkers, who was sentenced in absentia to 24 years in prison, remains a fugitive and is on Europol's most-wanted list. Dutch authorities believe he is hiding in Sierra Leone, where he has allegedly formed connections with the country's political elite, complicating efforts to secure his arrest.</p>

Despite the science being debunked, a generalized distrust of vaccination took hold, leading to lower immunization rates.

According to the energy policy thinktank Energy Innovation, this could cause household energy costs to rise by as much as 18% by 2035.

          <p>TV presenter Gregg Wallace has issued an apology after an independent inquiry into the BBC show MasterChef substantiated 45 allegations against him. The claims, spanning a 19-year period, include inappropriate sexual language, culturally insensitive comments, and one instance of unwelcome physical contact. Wallace stated he never intended to cause harm and accepted a "difference in perception" regarding the unwanted touching. The BBC has confirmed it has no plans to work with Wallace in the future, and a decision on the already-filmed new series of MasterChef is pending.</p>

          <p>After weeks of being denied entry, Florida lawmakers from both parties toured the controversial new migrant detention facility in the Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." Democratic lawmakers, who had sued for access, described the conditions as "appalling," citing high temperatures, inadequate water access, and small food portions. In contrast, Republican lawmakers who also toured the site expressed satisfaction, with one calling the beds comfortable. The visit follows claims from detainees of inhumane conditions, which state officials have consistently denied, creating a starkly divided view of the facility's operations.</p>

          <p>An internal BBC review has concluded that the documentary "Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone" breached editorial guidelines on accuracy. The failure occurred because the film did not disclose that its child narrator was the son of a Hamas official. While the review found no evidence that the family influenced the content, it criticized both the independent production company and the BBC's oversight team for the lapse. The BBC has apologized, stating the program should not have been approved, and is implementing new leadership and editorial processes to prevent similar errors.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Jordan have unearthed the long-lost Byzantine settlement of Tharais, providing new insights into the history of Christianity in the Middle East. The discovery, led by a professor from Mutah University, was guided by the ancient Madaba Map mosaic. Excavations at the site near the village of El-Irāq revealed the remains of a basilica-style church, an olive oil press, and various artifacts. The findings are expected to enhance the understanding of the region's transition from Byzantine to Islamic control and its broader archaeological context.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old man who escaped from a prison near Lyon, France, by hiding in a large bag carried by a departing inmate has been recaptured. The inmate was arrested early Monday morning on the outskirts of Lyon following an extensive investigation. His accomplice, the inmate who was being released, has not yet been found.

A decade later, his company is on track to generate over $50 million in revenue this year and is sold in more than 8,000 retail locations across the US. Kirby identified a culinary gap at the local farmers market and built his business from the ground up, focusing on slow, deep growth rather than rapid expansion. He has maintained control by avoiding venture capital, allowing him to focus on profitability and his long-term goal of becoming the top brand in the category.</p>

          <p>In response to declining cognitive skills in children post-pandemic, some experts are advocating for the use of 'brain training' programs in schools to improve working memory and focus. A recent German study suggested a 12-hour program improved children's IQ and long-term academic outcomes. However, the broader research on such interventions is inconclusive, with many studies showing limited or no effect when tested in real-world classroom settings. Critics caution against replacing core curriculum time with these programs, arguing that foundational knowledge is more critical for developing skills like critical thinking.</p>

In a New York Times interview, Biden defended the use of an autopen to sign a large number of pardons and commutations, noting it is a legal and previously used presidential tool. The comments come as a Republican-led House committee investigates his mental acuity and whether he personally authorized the documents. Biden asserts that the autopen issue is a diversion tactic by his political opponents.</p>
