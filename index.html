          <h2>China's Rising Bond Yields and Persistent Deflationary Pressures</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-03-21 01:24:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent increase in China's government bond yields, economists predict that deflationary pressures will likely keep borrowing costs low.  The rise is attributed to factors like currency stabilization and capital shifts, but underlying economic weakness persists, with low consumer sentiment and weak credit demand.  This suggests that cheaper loans are unlikely to stimulate significant economic growth in the near term. (not investment advice)<br><i></i></p>
