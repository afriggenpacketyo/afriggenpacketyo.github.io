          <p>Japanese markets experienced a significant rally following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's announcement that he will resign. The Nikkei 225 index rose 1.5%, and the Topix index reached a record high, as investors reacted to the political shift. Concurrently, the Japanese yen weakened against the dollar, and government bond yields continued to climb amid persistent inflation and fiscal uncertainty. Analysts predict a period of extended political ambiguity for Japan heading into the final quarter of 2025 as the ruling party prepares to select a new leader. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz secured his second U.S. Open title by defeating Jannik Sinner in a four-set match. The final was delayed due to enhanced security measures for President Donald Trump, who attended the event and sat in Rolex's luxury box, drawing a mixed reaction from the crowd. Many ticket holders were still in long lines outside the stadium when the match began. The U.S. Tennis Association reportedly asked broadcasters to avoid showing off-court disruptions, though videos of the crowd's reaction to the president circulated on social media.</p>

          <p>The trial for Ryan Wesley Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate President Donald Trump at a Florida golf course in September 2024, is set to begin this week. Routh, who has pleaded not guilty, will be representing himself in court, a decision Judge Aileen Cannon strongly advised against. Prosecutors allege Routh fired an SKS semiautomatic rifle at a Secret Service agent from bushes at the perimeter of the property. The incident highlighted growing concerns about political violence in the United States, occurring just weeks after a separate attempt on Trump's life.</p>

          <p>In his debut with the Green Bay Packers, star edge rusher Micah Parsons recorded his first sack, contributing to a 27-13 victory over the Detroit Lions. The play at Lambeau Field prompted a reaction of disbelief from his former Dallas Cowboys teammate, Trevon Diggs, who posted on social media, "This can’t be real." Parsons was traded from the Cowboys in a bombshell move and subsequently signed a four-year, $188 million contract extension with Green Bay. The Packers' defense was dominant, sacking Lions quarterback Jared Goff four times during the game.</p>

          <p>A New Zealand man, Tom Phillips, who had been on the run with his three children for nearly four years, was shot and killed by police during a confrontation. The incident occurred after Phillips allegedly robbed an agricultural supplies store. During the encounter, a police officer was also shot and critically injured. One of the children was taken into custody, but the whereabouts of the other two remain unknown, causing serious concern for authorities.

          <p>Senior UK trade union leaders are increasing pressure on the Labour government to demonstrate its commitment to working-class communities. TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak is set to call on ministers to prove "whose side it is on" and take decisive action, such as lifting the two-child benefit cap. Concurrently, Unite union leader Sharon Graham warned that her union, a major Labour donor, might vote to sever its financial ties with the party if it fails to improve living standards. These warnings come amid concerns that the government may dilute its promised Employment Rights Bill.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump issued what he described as a "last warning" to Hamas, urging the militant group to accept a ceasefire proposal that he said Israel has already agreed to. In a social media post, Trump stated, "It is time for Hamas to accept as well," and warned of consequences for non-compliance. Reports suggest the new proposal involves Hamas freeing all remaining hostages in exchange for thousands of Palestinian prisoners and negotiations to end the war. Hamas later confirmed it was discussing new ideas with mediators but reiterated its demand for a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.</p>

          <p>France's parliament is expected to remove Prime Minister François Bayrou in a vote of confidence, deepening the country's year-long political stalemate. Bayrou initiated the vote himself in a high-stakes gamble to pressure politicians into backing his austerity budget, which aims to slash government spending to address France's spiraling national debt. However, the move is widely seen as destined to fail, leading to his ousting without resolving the underlying deadlock. The political crisis stems from President Emmanuel Macron's 2024 snap election, which resulted in a deeply fragmented and polarized parliament.</p>

The surprise arrival happened after a match attended by 600 people, where she felt a sudden urge to push while in a cubicle.

One woman, Margaret, has lived in London for 15 years while her husband resides in Australia, a decision she made to pursue a new career after her children left home. While unconventional, this arrangement allows partners to pursue individual goals and maintain independence, which some, including high-profile couples, believe keeps the relationship fresh.

While U.S. stocks attracted $1.2 trillion from 2020 to 2024, inflows have slowed this year, with investors now seeing better valuations and opportunities in Asian markets.

The color is caused by sunlight scattering through the Earth's atmosphere, which filters out blue light and allows red light to pass through and reflect off the moon.

          <p>The South Korean government has announced a deal with the United States to secure the release of over 300 of its citizens detained during a major immigration raid. The raid occurred at a Hyundai and LG Energy Solution battery factory under construction in Georgia, where 475 people were arrested for allegedly working illegally. South Korean officials stated a chartered flight could bring the workers home this week and that they will pursue improvements to U.S. work permit processes for their citizens, highlighting the logistical challenges companies face with current visa systems.</p>

          <p>Superchief Gallery, an independent art space in downtown Los Angeles known for championing counterculture artists, is facing a potential closure this month due to financial hardship. The gallery's struggles reflect a broader trend of business closures in the area, which has yet to fully recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Co-founder Bill Dunleavy cited a decline in both corporate sponsorships and art sales as primary reasons for the gallery's difficulties. Despite launching a crowdfunding campaign, Superchief is struggling to cover its monthly expenses and has incurred significant debt to remain open.</p>

          <p>Florida's controversial plan to eliminate certain school vaccine mandates will not take effect for approximately 90 days, according to the state's health department. The initial rule change, proposed by Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, would make vaccinations voluntary for illnesses such as chickenpox and hepatitis B. However, mandates for other diseases, including measles and polio, will remain in place unless state lawmakers decide to expand the policy. The move has drawn sharp criticism from health experts, who warn it could lead to outbreaks of preventable diseases and endanger vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned that the U.S. government could be forced to issue massive refunds if the Supreme Court rules against President Trump's tariff plan. Bessent stated that if the tariffs are struck down, the Treasury would have to refund about half the duties collected, which he described as a "terrible" outcome. The administration has asked the Supreme Court for an expedited ruling to overturn an appeals court decision that found most of the "reciprocal tariffs" to be illegal. A negative ruling could result in refunding between $750 billion and $1 trillion to businesses that paid the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

This single issue has energized the state's often-fractured Republican party, which sees the November 4 vote as a critical battle for political survival in a deep-blue state.</p>

          <p>Ian Goldin, a professor of globalisation and development at the University of Oxford, asserts that globalisation is not dead but is instead becoming more regional and centered in Asia. He argues that the region's rapid economic growth and poverty reduction are direct results of its integration into the global economy. In an interview, Goldin noted that while the U.S. appears to be withdrawing from certain aspects of global integration, Asia continues to thrive. He also emphasized that the benefits of globalisation are accompanied by growing risks, such as pandemics, which are also global in nature.</p>

          <p>The latest U.S. employment report, which showed weaker-than-expected job growth in August, is raising questions about the economic impact of President Trump's policies. While some job losses can be attributed to the administration's efforts to shrink the federal government, there is little evidence of significant job creation from policies like tariffs. The article suggests that cultural wars are hurting growth in sectors favored by the previous administration, such as green energy, without a corresponding increase in manufacturing jobs. Ultimately, the analysis posits that the president's actions may be more relevant to media headlines than to the actual economy. (not investment advice)</p>

To capitalize on this momentum, the author suggests Beijing should encourage more foreign dignitaries to visit and support the city as a base for international institutions.
