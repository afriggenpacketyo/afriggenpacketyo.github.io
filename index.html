          <p>Intel reported second-quarter revenue that exceeded Wall Street estimates, leading to a positive stock reaction in extended trading. Despite a net loss, the company provided a third-quarter revenue forecast that was also above analyst expectations. New CEO Lip-Bu Tan announced significant spending reductions, including canceling new factory projects in Europe and slowing construction in Ohio, stating the company had "invested too much, too soon." The company has also completed the majority of its planned layoffs as it aims to regain a competitive footing and make every investment economically sensible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ride-sharing company Lyft is rolling out a new "favorite driver" feature, allowing passengers to preferentially book drivers they've had positive experiences with for future scheduled rides. This initiative aims to enhance the rider experience by offering more control and fostering better relationships between users and drivers. For drivers, the feature provides priority access to ride requests from repeat customers, potentially increasing their earning opportunities. The service will be available across the U.S. and Canada by the end of August, following a similar move by competitor Uber.</p>

          <p>An American woman, Christina Chapman, has been sentenced to more than eight years in prison for her part in a sophisticated scheme that stole the identities of U.S. citizens. Chapman helped North Korean IT workers use these stolen identities to secure remote jobs at over 300 American companies, including several Fortune 500 firms. The conspiracy generated an estimated $17 million, which U.S. officials say was funneled back to North Korea's weapons programs. Chapman ran "laptop farms" from her home to make it appear the foreign workers were based in the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a rescissions package into law, clawing back $9 billion in funding that Congress had previously approved. This marks the first successful presidential rescission request in decades. The legislation targets approximately $8 billion in foreign aid programs and about $1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports entities like NPR and PBS. The bill faced contention, particularly over initial cuts to global AIDS relief and funding for rural broadcast stations, but was ultimately passed by both the House and Senate after some modifications were made.</p>

          <p>A report from The Atlantic details how the Trump administration's approach to unaccompanied minors has shifted from visible family separations to more bureaucratic methods of dismantling protections. The administration is targeting the system that diverts minors to the Department of Health and Human Services, making it harder for sponsors to claim children and cutting funding for legal aid. These changes are reportedly leading to children being held in detention longer. While the administration cites child welfare as its rationale, critics argue the policies create a "Family Separation 2.0" that uses the system itself as a deterrent.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that France will officially recognize the State of Palestine, with a formal declaration planned for the United Nations General Assembly in September. Macron framed the decision as part of France's "historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East," while also emphasizing the urgent need to end the war in Gaza. This move makes France one of the most powerful European nations to take this step, adding to the growing international pressure on Israel amid the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the breakdown of ceasefire talks.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) will conduct a thorough review of Boeing's entire supply chain before it considers lifting the current production cap on the 737 MAX jet. The cap of 38 planes per month was imposed following a mid-air emergency on an Alaska Airlines flight in January. FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford praised Boeing's recent efforts to improve its safety culture but emphasized that the agency needs to see "long-term trends" and "real factory improvements" before approving any production increase.

          <p>A retrospective analysis shows that Tesla's decision to sell 75% of its Bitcoin holdings in mid-2022 cost the company billions in potential profits. The electric vehicle maker sold the assets when the cryptocurrency's price was near its low point. Had Tesla held onto its entire stake, it would be worth an estimated $5 billion today, compared to its current digital asset value of $1.24 billion. While the sale bolstered Tesla's cash reserves during a market downturn, the subsequent surge in Bitcoin's value highlights a significant missed financial opportunity. (not investment advice)</p>

One man was detained after his car was mistakenly flagged as stolen, and in another case, a family was held at gunpoint due to a plate from a different state being incorrectly matched.
