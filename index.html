          <p>The U.S. House is preparing for a final vote on a significant legislative package central to President Trump's second-term agenda. This 887-page bill, which narrowly passed the Senate, aims to make the 2017 tax cuts permanent while increasing funds for border security and defense. The legislation is funded through substantial cuts to social programs like Medicaid and SNAP, which the Congressional Budget Office projects could increase the federal deficit by $3.4 trillion and cause millions to lose health coverage. Key provisions include imposing work requirements for Medicaid, raising the SALT deduction cap to $40,000, and repealing many green energy tax credits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Cessna 208B aircraft carrying 15 people crashed near Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, resulting in injuries to all on board but no fatalities. The pilot reported engine trouble shortly after takeoff and was attempting to return to the airport when the crash occurred in a wooded area. Emergency responders, who recently conducted a training exercise at the same airport, noted it was remarkable there were no deaths, though some injuries were critical. The aircraft involved in the incident had previously been in a 2023 crash in Virginia where its nose landing gear collapsed. The FAA and NTSB are investigating the New Jersey crash.</p>

          <p>Following a strong June jobs report, market commentator Jim Cramer suggested the data validates Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's cautious approach to interest rates, despite pressure from President Trump for immediate cuts. The better-than-expected payroll growth and a lower unemployment rate have pushed the S&P 500 towards another record high. Cramer noted that the market is currently overbought, prompting discussions about potentially trimming profits from high-performing stocks. The analysis suggests that despite political demands for a rate cut, the current economic indicators do not support such a move, reinforcing the Fed's wait-and-see strategy.

          <p>A reflective article from The Atlantic examines the long-standing societal trend of older generations expressing concern and criticism towards the youth. Drawing parallels from a 1925 article that scrutinized young people for their dancing, dress, and perceived lack of intellectual curiosity, the author contemplates the fine line between genuine empathy and condescending judgment. The piece acknowledges that while social mores do transform with each generation, commentary should be offered with humility and nuance. It concludes that readers have always been able to distinguish between authentic curiosity about the challenges facing young people and hollow, stereotypical critiques, as seen in reader responses to past articles on the topic.</p>

          <p>A drive-by mass shooting outside the Artis Lounge nightclub in Chicago's River North neighborhood has left four people dead and 14 others wounded. The incident occurred as a crowd was leaving an album release party, when occupants of a dark SUV opened fire. The victims, ranging in age from 21 to 32, were transported to several hospitals with injuries from good to critical condition. The rapper whose party it was, Mello Buckzz, stated that many of the victims were her friends, including the four who were killed.

          <p>The U.S. retail industry is expressing mixed feelings about a new trade deal with Vietnam that sets tariffs on imports at 20%, a significant reduction from the initially proposed 46%. While executives are relieved to have avoided the worst-case scenario, many still believe the new rate will negatively impact businesses and consumers by increasing prices. For years, major retailers like Nike and Gap have shifted production from China to Vietnam to avoid high tariffs, a strategy now complicated by the new duties. Some business leaders worry that any tariff hike will ultimately be passed on to shoppers, potentially dampening consumer spending and the broader economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following Bryan Kohberger's guilty plea in the 2022 University of Idaho quadruple murder case, prosecutors revealed key evidence that led to his capture. The details, shared in court, included tracking Kohberger's cell phone and vehicle near the crime scene months before the stabbings. A crucial piece of evidence was a knife sheath left at the scene containing his DNA, which was later matched using a Q-tip retrieved from his family's trash. Kohberger, who had studied crime scene processing, meticulously cleaned his car and apartment, but the DNA evidence proved decisive. The plea deal spares him the death penalty, a resolution that has divided the victims' families.</p>

While Combs was acquitted of more severe charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering, the judge ordered his detention, citing flight risk. A sentencing date has been proposed for October 3, 2025, with each conviction carrying a maximum of 10 years in prison. Legal analysts suggest a sentence of around four to five years is more likely, though federal judges have significant discretion.

His journey from relative obscurity to the top levels of European football with clubs like Porto, Wolverhampton, and Liverpool made him an inspiration. Colleagues and former coaches recall his immense mental strength, discipline, and humility, noting that he overcame early doubts about his size to become a national hero.

He argued that the bill's provisions would be devastating for millions of Americans, particularly children, seniors, and people with disabilities, while primarily benefiting the wealthy.

          <p>The U.S. economy faces significant uncertainty as a 90-day freeze on sweeping tariffs announced by President Trump is set to expire on July 9. If new bilateral trade deals are not finalized, sharply higher duties on imports from dozens of countries could take effect, potentially triggering inflation and harming businesses. While the administration has announced agreements with the U.K., China, and Vietnam, the status of negotiations with many other nations remains unclear. Experts believe the deadline may be extended for countries negotiating in good faith, but others could face the new tariffs.

          <p>Infectious disease experts are pushing back against doubts cast on the hepatitis B vaccine by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his newly appointed CDC advisory panel. Kennedy recently claimed, without evidence, that the CDC hid a study linking the vaccine to autism, while the panel's chair questioned the practice of vaccinating all newborns. Health professionals reaffirm that there is no evidence the vaccine is unsafe or linked to autism, highlighting its success in virtually eliminating hepatitis B among U.S. children since universal infant vaccination was recommended in 1991. They warn that re-litigating the safety of well-studied vaccines could undermine public trust and vital immunization programs.</p>

          <p>Following high-level talks, the United States and China are moving to ease trade barriers on critical goods and technologies. The U.S. government has revoked a licensing requirement for major producers of ethane, clearing the way for shipments to China to resume. In a reciprocal move, Beijing has reportedly instructed state-owned enterprises to lift a ban on purchasing microchips from U.S. firm Micron Technology, and German company Siemens confirmed its software is again fully available to Chinese clients. These steps signal a de-escalation in trade tensions, though analysts note that President Trump's recent deal with Vietnam, which imposes new tariffs, could introduce new complications and risk blowback.

In a recent interview, Casey discussed his decision to openly criticize Donald Trump at concerts and his core belief in speaking for working-class people, even if it means losing some fans. He recounted making a bet with a fan in a MAGA shirt about whether the shirt was made in America, a moment that taught him about the potential for civil discourse. Casey believes it would be a betrayal of his band's 30-year history to back down from his political convictions now.</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market demonstrated continued resilience in June, adding 147,000 jobs and surpassing economists' forecasts.

Job growth was primarily driven by the government sector, particularly in state and local education, while the healthcare sector also saw a notable increase. These figures, along with upward revisions for April and May, suggest the job market remains on solid footing despite broader economic uncertainty and potential impacts from trade tariffs, possibly influencing Federal Reserve interest rate decisions.

          <p>As homeowners insurance costs continue to rise, experts suggest that certain strategic home renovations can lead to significant premium reductions. Insurers often provide discounts for upgrades that lower the risk of claims, such as a full roof replacement, especially with impact-resistant materials. Modernizing old electrical and plumbing systems can also yield savings, as water damage and electrical fires are major sources of claims. Additionally, installing monitored security and alarm systems to deter theft and enable faster emergency response is a reliable way to lower costs.

          <h2>Australian Man Dies from Rare Bat-Transmitted Infection</h2>

          <p>An Australian man in his 50s has died after contracting Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), a rare infection transmitted through a bat bite he sustained several months ago. Health officials in New South Wales confirmed this is the fourth human case of the rabies-like virus recorded in Australia since 1996, and all have been fatal. There is no effective treatment for ABLV once symptoms, which are initially flu-like before progressing to paralysis and convulsions, appear. Authorities are investigating the case and have reiterated warnings for the public to avoid handling any bats, as the virus can be carried by various species.</p>

          <h2>US Supreme Court to Review State Bans on Transgender Student Athletes</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court will take up a major civil rights challenge by agreeing to review laws from West Virginia and Idaho that ban transgender athletes from competing on female sports teams. The decision to hear the cases places the contentious issue of transgender rights squarely before the nation's highest court. Lower courts had previously sided with the student athletes, ruling that the bans likely violate constitutional equal protection guarantees and Title IX. The cases will be argued during the court's next term, which begins in October, and will be a significant test for LGBTQ+ rights in the current political and cultural landscape.</p>
