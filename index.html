          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has publicly criticized Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker, alleging his administration failed to provide police assistance during a disruptive anti-ICE protest. Federal officials described the protesters as "rioters" who obstructed law enforcement and assaulted officers while they were processing undocumented immigrants with criminal records. Governor Pritzker's office refuted these claims, calling them false and accusing the Trump administration of lying and failing to coordinate with local authorities. The incident highlights the intense political friction between federal immigration agencies and states with sanctuary policies.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced that it is recommending pregnant women limit their use of Tylenol, claiming a link between the pain reliever and an increased risk of autism. President Trump personally advised against its use, a statement that directly contradicts existing medical guidance. In response, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists labeled the announcement irresponsible and not supported by the full body of scientific evidence. Medical experts reiterated that acetaminophen remains the safest and most recommended option for managing pain and fever during pregnancy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order officially labeling the decentralized anti-fascist movement known as antifa a "domestic terrorist organization." The order directs federal agencies to investigate and disrupt activities associated with the movement. However, legal experts note that the practical and legal impact of this designation is uncertain, as the United States does not have a specific federal statute for designating domestic groups as terrorist organizations. The move is seen as a largely symbolic and political gesture targeting left-wing activists.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $28 million in federal grants for animal testing as part of a broader phase-out of research on live animals. This policy shift is supported by a bipartisan coalition and animal rights activists who criticize the practice as costly and inhumane. The decision has sparked a fierce debate, with patient advocates and some scientists expressing concern that eliminating animal trials could impede the development of critical, life-saving medical treatments that have historically relied on such research for safety and efficacy testing.</p>

          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the airwaves, ending a suspension that lasted nearly a week.

Disney stated the initial suspension was intended to de-escalate a tense situation but decided to reinstate the program after holding discussions with Kimmel, marking a resolution to the high-profile freedom of speech controversy.</p>

          <p>Mario Guevara, a journalist from El Salvador, is facing imminent deportation after a Board of Immigration Appeals decision reopened his decade-old immigration case. Guevara was detained by ICE agents in June while he was reporting on a protest. His legal team, which includes ACLU attorneys, has filed for an emergency hearing to halt the deportation, arguing that his detention is retaliatory and violates press freedom. The case underscores the growing concerns about the treatment of immigrant journalists under the current administration.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Launches 'Gold Card' Immigration Program for Wealthy Foreigners</h2>

          <p>The Trump administration has created a new immigration pathway called the "Trump Gold Card," which offers a fast track to permanent U.S. residency for affluent foreigners. Under this program, individuals can secure an employment-based visa by providing a $1 million "unrestricted gift" to the Department of Commerce. This policy marks a significant shift in immigration priorities, moving away from criteria based on skills, family ties, or asylum needs, and toward a system where personal wealth is the primary qualifier for residency.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service in England is rolling out a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," which encourages general practitioners to re-evaluate a patient's case if their symptoms persist or worsen after three separate appointments. The guideline is named in memory of Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who passed away from cancer after her symptoms were repeatedly misdiagnosed. This new approach is designed to improve patient safety by prompting doctors to consider alternative diagnoses, order further tests, or seek second opinions to prevent avoidable tragedies.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials have started the process of drafting the country's 15th five-year plan, a crucial policy document that will shape its economic and social trajectory from 2026 to 2030. This blueprint is vital for achieving President Xi Jinping's ambitious long-term vision of transforming China into a "moderately developed country" by 2035. Facing both domestic economic challenges and increasing global uncertainty, analysts suggest that the new plan may need to emphasize flexibility and qualitative goals rather than strict quantitative economic targets.</p>

          <p>A possible school shooting was averted in Northern California thanks to a tip submitted through the "Say Something" anonymous reporting system. The program, established by the Sandy Hook Promise organization, enabled someone to alert authorities about concerning online content posted by a former student. Police were able to locate the individual and recover weapons before any violence occurred. This incident marks the 19th credible planned school attack that the nationwide system has successfully helped to prevent since its inception in 2018.</p>
