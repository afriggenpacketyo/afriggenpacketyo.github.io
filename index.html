          <p>The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) reports that nearly 13 million people in West and Central Africa have been displaced due to conflict, climate shocks, and rising protection risks, especially for women and children. Nigeria, Burkina Faso, and Cameroon host the majority of internally displaced persons (IDPs) who have been forced to seek shelter within their countries due to drought, flooding, violence, and insecurity. While the UNHCR is sponsoring voluntary returns to countries like Nigeria and Mali, repatriation efforts are hampered by a reduced budget, impacting the provision of essential services like food, shelter, and healthcare. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) notes that economic needs are a key driver of migration, and migration routes have become increasingly dangerous due to efforts to stem migration to Europe, requiring new strategies that foster regular migration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pop Mart International Group's shares experienced a significant drop after the People's Daily newspaper criticized its blind box business model, warning against the addictive nature of these collectibles. The commentary highlighted that blind boxes, which conceal their contents, encourage frequent purchases to obtain rare items, with some having less than a 2% chance of discovery. The People's Daily described these products as "business traps" that exploit unpredictable rewards and cautioned that minors are particularly vulnerable, advocating for stricter regulations to protect them. In 2023, Chinese authorities banned the sale of blind boxes to children under eight to address addiction concerns, reflecting the government's stance on curbing exploitative consumer practices.</p>

          <p>UK retail sales experienced a sharp decline in May, primarily driven by a "dismal" performance in supermarkets, according to official figures. Sales volumes dropped by 2.7%, marking the largest monthly fall since December 2023, as reported by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Food retailers saw reduced sales in alcohol and tobacco, while clothing and household goods stores reported "slow trading," indicating a broad pullback in consumer spending. Separate economic data revealed an increase in government borrowing last month, reaching the second-highest level for May since monthly records began in 1993.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) avatars have demonstrated their potential as effective influencers in China, as exemplified by a recent collaboration between Chinese tech company Baidu and livestreamer Luo Yonghao. Luo Yonghao and his co-host Xiao Mu used digital versions of themselves to interact with viewers in real-time for over six hours on Baidu's e-commerce livestreaming platform "Youxuan", generating 55 million yuan ($7.65 million) in sales. This significantly outperformed Luo's previous livestream on Youxuan, showcasing the effectiveness of AI-generated avatars in engaging audiences and driving sales; Luo's avatars were built using Baidu's generative AI model, which learned from five years of videos to mimic their jokes and style.</p>

          <p>The UK is experiencing an early summer heatwave, with temperatures expected to reach 32C for a second consecutive day and potentially 34C on Saturday. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued an amber heat-health alert for all regions in England, warning of significant impacts on health and social care services, including a rise in deaths among vulnerable populations. Many regions are expected to meet the criteria for a heatwave, and firefighters are responding to a surge in wildfires across England and Wales. Scientists attribute the increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves to climate change, with the chance of reaching 32C in June having increased significantly since the pre-industrial era.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom expressed disappointment with the Ninth Circuit Court's decision to allow President Trump to retain control of the California National Guard but highlighted a portion of the ruling as a victory. Newsom stated that the court rejected Trump's claim that he can act without judicial oversight, emphasizing that the president is "not a king and not above the law." The ruling stemmed from Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles to manage demonstrations against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a move Newsom contested as an overreach of presidential authority.</p>

China asserts that the Philippines' actions violate its sovereignty and international law, while Manila has not yet commented on the incident.

          <p>A seven-year-old Ukrainian girl, Nastya Buryk, who had moved to Israel for cancer treatment, was killed in an Iranian air strike along with her mother, grandmother, and two brothers. The family had sought medical care in Israel after Nastya was diagnosed with lymphoblastic leukemia in 2022 and underwent chemotherapy in Ukraine. Her father, Artem, is currently fighting against Russian forces in Kyiv, and the family believed they would be safer in Israel than in Odesa. The attack on Bat Yam also killed four other people and injured more than 100, leading Ukraine's embassy in Israel to coordinate the return of the bodies.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have developed an edible, washable protein-based coating that can extend the shelf life of fruits by 2Â½ times by reducing moisture loss and microbial growth. The low-cost coating was tested across 17 varieties of whole and cut fruits, including strawberry, tomato, kiwi, and mango, effectively delaying rot by almost a week or more. The new strategy is as effective as existing preservation methods but reduces carbon dioxide emissions and the potential for toxicity, offering a promising solution to global food waste. The coating, costing just 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit, demonstrates universal applicability for post-harvest and fresh-cut fruits.</p>

          <p>Friday's newspaper front pages are dominated by the looming vote on the assisted dying bill in the UK, with the Daily Express leading with a plea from a supporter and the Daily Telegraph reporting on backbenchers switching sides.
