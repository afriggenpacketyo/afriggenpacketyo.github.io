          <p>Da Wei, a security and strategy expert from Tsinghua University, expresses cautious optimism about a potential U.S.-China trade deal. However, he characterizes current American foreign policy regarding China as being marked by "ignorance and neglect," suggesting a flawed approach to the growing competition between the two global powers. The interview delves into the complexities of the bilateral relationship, examining China's evolving role on the world stage amidst Washington's strategic shifts. He believes a deal is possible but depends on the criteria for success.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has threatened to send the National Guard to Baltimore to address crime, escalating a public dispute with Maryland's Democratic Governor, Wes Moore. This follows Trump's similar deployment of troops in Washington D.C., a move he has framed as a necessary crime crackdown in Democratic-led cities. The threat has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats, who label it an unconstitutional abuse of power and a political tactic, particularly as crime rates in some of these cities have been decreasing.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-24 17:54:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Liverpool John Moores University reveals a strong connection between hydration and stress management. Researchers found that individuals who drink less than the recommended 1.5 liters of water daily exhibit a 50% higher cortisol response to stressful situations. Cortisol is the body's primary stress hormone, and elevated levels are associated with increased risks of heart disease, diabetes, and depression. The findings suggest that maintaining proper hydration could be a simple yet effective strategy for mitigating the physiological impact of stress.</p>

The 34-year-old demonstrated remarkable composure, leading throughout the final day to finish three shots ahead of his competitors with a score of 18 under par. This significant win not only earns him a $10 million prize but also sheds the "nearly man" label he had acquired on the American circuit. The victory is seen as a major confidence boost ahead of the upcoming Ryder Cup.</p>

Despite the significant summer investment in attackers like Benjamin Sesko, Matheus Cunha, and Bryan Mbeumo, the unit appears to lack cohesion.

          <p>Millions of people across the western United States are under extreme heat warnings as a dangerous heatwave continues to grip the region. States like California, Oregon, Washington, and Arizona are experiencing temperatures well over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, with little relief expected at night. The National Weather Service warns that this prolonged heat increases the risk of heat-related illnesses. These conditions are also dangerously dry, elevating the risk of new wildfires and making it more difficult for firefighters to contain existing blazes.</p>

          <p>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has accused Western European leaders of not wanting a peaceful resolution in Ukraine, contrasting their stance with what he described as President Trump's desire for peace. In an interview, Lavrov praised Trump's efforts to end the conflict, while U.S. Vice President JD Vance stated that the administration will continue to pursue diplomacy despite a lack of a formal deal. The comments highlight the deep divisions in the international approach to the war, with Russia framing the U.S. as a more constructive negotiator than its European allies.</p>

          <p>A tiny homes enthusiast in southern Ohio has built what may be one of the world's smallest livable houses, measuring just 19.4 square feet. The builder, Levi Kelly, constructed the micro-home on a utility trailer for about $5,000, using mostly pre-owned materials. Despite its closet-sized footprint, the off-grid home is equipped with solar panels, a battery system, heating and air conditioning, a compact kitchen, and a portable toilet. The project demonstrates the potential for creative and efficient design in minimalist living, pushing the boundaries of functional small-space construction.</p>

          <p>The British government is planning a major overhaul of the asylum appeals system to reduce delays and cut the costs associated with housing migrants in hotels. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced that a new independent body of adjudicators will be established to handle appeals more swiftly than the current court-based process. The move comes amid increasing pressure on the government to end its reliance on hotels, where 32,000 asylum seekers are currently housed while awaiting decisions on their cases, which can take over a year on average.</p>

          <p>Maryland Governor Wes Moore has dismissed former President Trump's rhetoric on crime as "purely performative" and his threats to send troops to Baltimore as ignorant scare tactics. Moore stated that while his administration is actively working to reduce crime, Trump's approach is unhelpful and unconstitutional. The governor's comments came after he invited Trump to a public safety walk in Maryland, an invitation the former president rejected while reiterating his offer to deploy the National Guard. Moore affirmed he would not authorize the use of Maryland's Guard for such a purpose.</p>

          <p>Executives from major renewable energy firms are warning that the Trump administration's opposition to solar and wind projects could destabilize the U.S. electric grid and increase energy costs. The administration's move to block federal permits for new projects, combined with tariffs on materials, is creating uncertainty and driving up costs by as much as 30%. Industry leaders argue that stifling renewable energy growth will worsen a looming power supply shortage, especially as demand surges from new data centers for artificial intelligence, potentially leading to grid strain and higher utility bills.

          <p>A recent survey from Schroders indicates a grim reality for a significant portion of American retirees, with 19% describing their retirement as a "nightmare." This contrasts sharply with the mere 5% who feel they are "living the dream." The primary sources of stress for struggling retirees are inflation, which erodes their purchasing power, and high healthcare costs. The findings highlight a substantial gap between retirement expectations and the financial reality for many, as savings often fall short of what is needed to maintain a comfortable standard of living.</p>
