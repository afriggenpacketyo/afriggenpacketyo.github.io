          <p>A privately-built Japanese lander, Resilience, experienced a mission-ending "hard landing" on the moon after a failed touchdown attempt. Telemetry indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity, and communications were lost just before the projected landing time. The lander's laser rangefinder experienced delays, preventing sufficient deceleration for a successful landing. This marks the second consecutive failure for ispace, the company behind the lander, following a similar incident in 2023, highlighting the difficulties of achieving low-cost lunar landings. The mission aimed to deploy a small micro rover carrying an art project to the lunar surface. </p>

Plant-based brand THIS has also launched a "Super Superfoods" range with natural ingredients in response to consumer avoidance of processed meat replacements. However, some nutritionists argue that focusing solely on fewer ingredients can overlook the importance of fortified nutrients for public health. </p>

Mayor Daniel Lurie emphasizes that the city leads with services and values, focusing on getting people into shelters and treatment programs. The city's efforts have resulted in nearly half of San Francisco's homeless population being sheltered, a 35% increase since 2019, but some unhoused individuals express that shelters do not meet their needs. </p>

          <p>An NPR investigation reveals that young offenders in many states are denied credit for "dead time" spent in juvenile detention before adjudication. Unlike the adult system, this time often doesn't count toward their ultimate incarceration, adding months to their confinement. Experts argue this practice undermines the rehabilitative goals of the juvenile justice system and violates fundamental rights. The lack of credit for time served can lead to longer periods of incarceration and negatively impact young people's development and future prospects. </p>

          <p>This article reviews three new film releases: Ballerina, Dangerous Animals, and The Ritual. Ballerina, a spin-off from the John Wick saga starring Ana de Armas, offers spectacular fight scenes but lacks a compelling story. Dangerous Animals, a horror/suspense film, features a captivating performance by Jai Courtney as a psychopathic tour guide. The Ritual stars Al Pacino as a priest involved in a publicized exorcism, but the film suffers from a weak plot and overuse of jump scares. </p>
