          <p>Kim Keon Hee, the wife of South Korea's former president Yoon Suk Yeol, has been indicted on corruption and bribery charges, according to reports. The charges include allegations of providing funds for a stock manipulation scheme and receiving free opinion polls before the 2022 presidential election. Kim is also suspected of accepting luxury gifts from the Unification Church in exchange for business favors back in 2022. Her husband, Yoon Suk Yeol, was previously removed from office and arrested earlier this year for his declaration of martial law in December 2024, and he also faces charges of insurrection. </p>

          <p>Coco Gauff battled through tears and serving difficulties to secure a spot in the US Open third round with a victory over Donna Vekić. Gauff's serving struggles, including seven double faults in the first set, caused visible frustration, however, she managed to reset after a medical timeout taken by Vekić. She attributed her ability to recover to the support of her biomechanics coach and the presence of Simone Biles in the crowd, ultimately winning in straight sets. Gauff faces Magdalena Frech in the next round as she continues to work on her serve. </p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on Friday, diverging from Wall Street's performance as investors analyzed regional economic data. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices declined after Tokyo's core consumer prices rose at a slower pace in August, while South Korea's Kospi and Kosdaq also experienced losses following the indictment of the ex-first lady. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 saw gains, and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to meet China's President Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit in Tianjin. These factors contributed to a varied trading day across the region. </p>

          <p>The United States has ended its tariff exemption for low-value items shipped from abroad, meaning all goods entering the US are now subject to tariffs. For the next six months, postal service shippers can opt to pay a flat duty of $80 to $200 per package depending on the country of origin, according to Trump administration officials. Several foreign postal companies have suspended deliveries to the US, citing insufficient time to prepare for the changes. After the transition period, foreign postal services must collect duties on the full value of the product by February 2026. </p>

          <p>Bill Pulte, Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, has filed a second criminal referral with the Department of Justice against Federal Reserve Board Governor Lisa Cook. Pulte alleges that Cook made misrepresentations about her mortgage for a condominium in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and two homes she owns in government ethics filings. This referral comes as President Trump is attempting to remove Cook from the Fed, and Cook has sued Trump to block her removal. The DOJ is already investigating Cook based on Pulte's earlier referral, which alleged false claims on mortgage applications. </p>

          <p>Investigators state that Robin Westman, the attacker who opened fire at a church in Minneapolis, was "obsessed with the idea of killing children". The attack resulted in the deaths of two children, Fletcher Merkel, eight, and Harper Moyski, 10, and injuries to 18 others. Westman, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, left a note expressing hate towards various groups, including the Jewish community and former President Trump. Officials say that the guns used in the attack were legally purchased, and the attacker did not appear on any government watchlist. </p>

The city needs $4 million to rebuild its pier but has only been offered $555,000 by FEMA, and FEMA still owes Biloxi $34 million for upgrades to the city's sewage and stormwater system. FEMA has denied the city's request for additional funds, claiming a lack of documentation substantiating the costs. Biloxi is among 254 FEMA Katrina relief projects in Louisiana and Mississippi that remain unfinished. </p>

          <p>California fire investigators are examining whether Hundred Acre, a Napa Valley winery, played a role in starting the Pickett fire, which has burned nearly 7,000 acres. Investigators are reportedly looking into the possibility that discarded ashes from the vineyard sparked the fire, which ignited near the winery's property. A spokesperson for the winery confirmed that company representatives had spoken with fire investigators. While the cause remains under investigation, no structures have been reported destroyed or damaged, though Hundred Acre's properties sustained some road and infrastructure damage. </p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is changing its extra-seat policy for plus-size travelers, removing the guaranteed refund for those who purchase an additional seat. The change, effective January 27, is part of a broader update in preparation for assigned seating. Advocates for the plus-size community express concern that the change will create financial burdens and barriers for this segment of the traveling public. Some fear that the policy changes will disproportionately affect plus-size travelers who may not be able to afford two seats. </p>

          <p>An analysis by BBC Verify found that Israel struck Nasser Hospital in Gaza at least four times during a deadly attack on Monday, not twice as initially reported. The attack, which has drawn international condemnation, reportedly killed at least 20 people, including five journalists. Two staircases were hit almost simultaneously in the first wave, and what was thought to be a single later attack was in fact two separate strikes hitting the same place within a fraction of a second. The IDF said it had no additional comment on the newly identified blasts. </p>

Microsoft said the terminations were due to serious violations of company policies and code of conduct, including creating safety concerns for employees.

Experts from The Woodland Trust and the Arboricultural Association are involved in the project, studying about 50 of the UK's most well-known ancient oaks.

The spammers, based in countries like Pakistan, India, and Vietnam, are gaming Meta's system by creating low-quality AI-generated content that attracts high engagement. Meta does not intentionally encourage false stories, but its system rewards posts with high engagement, enabling these networks to profit. </p>
