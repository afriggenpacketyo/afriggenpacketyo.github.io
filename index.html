          <p>Taiwanese civil defense groups conducted a joint training exercise focused on disaster preparedness, observed by representatives from Japan, Canada, the Netherlands, and Ukraine. The exercise simulated a mass-casualty attack scenario, testing emergency responses, coordination, and communication, and also included simulated grey-zone threats like disinformation campaigns. Participants engaged in search-and-rescue operations and managing panic at shelters, emphasizing unscripted scenarios. This event underscores Taiwan's focus on enhancing its resilience amidst regional tensions and potential non-military threats, with international observers present to witness the island's preparedness efforts.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a three-day ceasefire in Ukraine starting May 8, coinciding with Russia's Victory Day celebrations marking the end of World War Two. The Kremlin stated the ceasefire is based on humanitarian considerations and expects Ukraine to reciprocate, warning of an "adequate and effective response" if Ukraine violates the truce. This announcement comes amidst ongoing efforts to broker peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, although previous ceasefire attempts have been marred by accusations of violations from both sides. The conflict has resulted in significant casualties and territorial changes since Russia's invasion in February 2022.</p>

The report, commissioned after the Huw Edwards scandal, found that while the BBC does not have a widespread "toxic" culture, a minority of individuals abuse their power, creating a difficult environment for colleagues. The BBC has pledged to introduce reforms, including a more robust disciplinary policy and improved mechanisms for staff to report concerns without fear of reprisal.

          <p>Dividend stocks are becoming more attractive to investors due to increased volatility in both stock and bond markets, offering a blend of equity growth and income. The market now features over 100 exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on dividend stocks, including actively managed options that seek higher-quality dividend payers. These ETFs can provide exposure to tech companies with substantial dividend payouts while potentially limiting overall tech sector weighting. While high-yield dividend ETFs exist, investors are cautioned against prioritizing yield alone, as these may carry higher risk of dividend cuts. (not investment advice)</p>
