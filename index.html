          <p>A widespread blackout left millions without electricity across Spain and Portugal, disrupting daily life and transportation. The cause of the outage, which affected nearly all of Spain and Portugal, is still under investigation, but officials have ruled out foul play, such as a cyberattack. While power has been restored to most areas, questions remain about the vulnerability of European grids to climate change and other disruptions. Many residents experienced significant inconvenience, such as being trapped in apartments without elevators and struggling to communicate with the outside world, but life is gradually returning to normal as schools and businesses reopen.

          <p>In a surprising turn of events, Pierre Poilievre, the leader of Canada's Conservative Party, lost his seat as the parliamentary representative for his Ottawa district. This defeat raises questions about his leadership of the party, as the long-held Conservative seat was flipped to the Liberal Party.

          <p>A new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll reveals that more Americans give President Trump a failing grade for his first 100 days than any other grade. The poll indicates declining approval ratings for Trump, driven by views on the economy and tariffs. A majority of respondents disapprove of Trump's handling of the economy, foreign policy, and immigration. There is a lack of confidence in the economy, with most believing grocery prices will increase and tariffs will hurt the economy. Optimism score: 35</p>
