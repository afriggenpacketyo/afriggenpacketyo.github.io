          <p>The Department of Justice has formally requested a judge unseal grand jury materials from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, citing significant public interest. This move was directed by President Trump and follows growing political pressure from his supporters for more transparency.

          <p>A new fantasy stage show in Liverpool, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," reimagines the life of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a medieval fantasy epic. Written by "Motherland" co-creator Helen Serafinowicz, the comedy-musical is loosely based on a 2004 tabloid story about Coleen allegedly throwing away her engagement ring. The writer and cast insist the show is an affectionate homage to the couple, celebrating them as heroic figures who have weathered many public battles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has identified a specific interaction between a gut bacteria molecule and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. Researchers found that in individuals with a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene, a molecule produced by certain bacteria can overactivate an immune protein called STING, leading to chronic inflammation. This discovery helps explain the unpredictable nature of the disease and opens the door for more precise, personalized therapies targeting this specific pathway.</p>

          <p>Tom Michael, the general manager of Boise State Public Radio, discussed the significant negative impact that recent federal funding cuts to public media will have, particularly on rural stations like his. He explained that this funding is crucial for providing essential news, emergency information, and cultural programming to communities that often have few other reliable media sources. The loss of these federal dollars threatens the operational viability of many small stations and their ability to serve their local audiences across the country.</p>

          <p>El Salvador is repatriating around 250 Venezuelan nationals, who were detained in its controversial CECOT prison after being deported from the U.S., in exchange for 10 American citizens held by Venezuela. The deal, facilitated by El Salvadoran leader Nayib Bukele, marks a significant diplomatic maneuver and effectively releases all known U.S. nationals held by the Maduro government. The complex three-way negotiation highlights the warming relationship between the Trump administration and Bukele, who has aided U.S. immigration policy by incarcerating deportees.</p>

          <p>Golfer Shane Lowry expressed disappointment after accepting a two-stroke penalty during the second round of The Open, a decision he is "still not sure" about. Officials determined that his ball moved during a practice swing in the rough, an infraction he insists he did not see with his naked eye. Lowry's score on the 12th hole was changed from a 5 to a 7, dropping him further down the leaderboard, with the R&A explaining the penalty was based on video evidence and rules regarding player-caused ball movement.</p>
