          <p>The Trump administration is deploying 2,000 National Guard members to Los Angeles in response to protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that the deployment aims to address "lawlessness" as demonstrations continue. California Governor Gavin Newsom criticized the federal government's move as "purposefully inflammatory" and warned that it would escalate tensions. The protests began Friday evening following federal immigration enforcement operations in the area, leading to clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that the Trump administration's deportation program receives positive net approval from Americans, particularly among Republicans, but is heavily influenced by differing views on the program's targets. Support is high among those who believe the program prioritizes dangerous criminals, but drops significantly if people think it targets others. The poll also reveals that half of Americans feel Trump is deporting more people than expected, with most disapproving of the program. The economic impact of the program is viewed negatively, with more Americans believing it will weaken the economy.</p>

          <p>This article critiques America's infatuation with narratives of "boy geniuses" and "Great Men," arguing that this obsession has contributed to societal problems such as wealth inequality and authoritarianism. The author uses examples like Adam Neumann of WeWork, Mark Zuckerberg as portrayed in "The Social Network," and Elon Musk to illustrate how the myth of the temperamental genius is often romanticized. The article also examines Lin-Manuel Miranda's "Hamilton" as a problematic retelling of American history that perpetuates founder myths. The piece concludes that this ideology of dominance is endangering human lives and the future of civilization, urging a rejection of these simplistic narratives.</p>

These principles include resolving disputes through consultation, managing differences through co-management, achieving mutually beneficial cooperation, and opposing external interference. The report blames regional tensions on external actors who fuel rival claimants' actions and undermine maritime cooperation. China's expansive claims in the South China Sea are contested by several ASEAN member states, leading to frequent face-offs between Chinese and Philippine vessels.</p>

          <p>Motivational speaker Tony Robbins cautions that relying on Social Security as the primary foundation for retirement planning is a risky strategy. He argues that the average monthly Social Security benefit is insufficient for most Americans and that the program's sustainability is uncertain. Robbins encourages working-age Americans to create their own nest egg by saving approximately 20 times their annual expenses and adhering to the 4% withdrawal rule. He emphasizes the importance of investing early and diversifying portfolios to build a robust retirement fund. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that sleeping positions, particularly side and stomach sleeping, can contribute to wrinkles and premature skin sagging due to compression and friction against the pillow. These positions weaken collagen and elastin, leading to sleep lines and asymmetry, especially in delicate areas like the cheeks and dÃ©colletÃ©. Back sleeping is recommended as the most skin-friendly position, preventing direct contact between the face and pillow and reducing fluid buildup. Interventions like silicone chest pads, retinoids, and in-office treatments such as Botox and RF microneedling can help prevent and treat sleep-positional aging.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has denounced as "deranged" the potential deployment of US marines in the state, following a threat by the Secretary of Defense amid protests over immigration raids. The protests erupted after clashes between law enforcement and demonstrators during immigration raids in Los Angeles, leading to the use of teargas. Trump promised to send in the National Guard, which Newsom confirmed, accusing the federal government of "moving to take over" the state's guard. The US attorney for the central district of California warned that protesters engaging in violence would face federal prosecution.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece contends that President Trump's policies have diminished the perceived threat of "peaceful evolution" in China, a concept that once fueled concerns about American conspiracies to subvert the Communist Party. The author, reflecting on their upbringing in China, notes that Mao Zedong warned about the threat of American imperialists using Western values to incite dissent. However, the US has shifted away from nation-building efforts and vowed to stop lecturing others on governance, leading to a decline in the perceived threat of peaceful evolution.</p>

          <p>This advice column addresses a reader's dilemma about her husband's interest in ethical non-monogamy while she prefers monogamy. The columnist draws on Erich Fromm's philosophy of love as freedom and the importance of self-awareness and communication in relationships. The advice emphasizes the need for emotional security and open dialogue about needs and boundaries before considering non-monogamy. The article recommends that the couple work on strengthening their existing relationship before opening it up and explores options for easing into non-monogamy if both partners are willing.</p>

          <p>Passengers on an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, were forced to take a bus for the final 140 miles after their Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner was diverted to Rome. American Airlines cited "operational limitations" as the reason for the diversion, as the aircraft was too large to land at Naples Airport. The airline typically uses a smaller Boeing 787-8 for the route. Passengers were bused from Rome to Naples, a journey of approximately three hours, and American Airlines apologized for the disruption.</p>

The book reflects Gingrich's desire to stay on the right side of the powers that be, but it also reveals some tensions between Gingrich's views and Trump's policies.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's goal to bring back manufacturing jobs, the aviation industry is struggling to hire skilled workers fast enough. The average age of a certified aircraft mechanic in the U.S. is 54, and 40% are over 60, leading to a projected shortage of 25,000 technicians by 2028. Airlines and manufacturers are trying to attract younger people to the field, with median pay for aircraft technicians around $79,140 a year. The industry is facing challenges from an aging workforce, the impact of COVID-19 layoffs, and competition from other sectors.</p>

          <p>This article explores how a Chinese movie called "Clash," about a Chinese American-football team, reflects the changing dynamics between the U.S. and China. The author, who originally wrote an article about the real team that inspired the film, discusses how the project was initially courted by Hollywood but ultimately produced by a Chinese studio. The shift highlights China's growing self-reliance in entertainment and the increasing distance between the two countries' cultural understanding. The author concludes that while a collaborative version would have been ideal, the Chinese version offers an authentic perspective.</p>

          <p>This article examines Barack Obama's post-presidency activities, noting his preference for private engagements and occasional statements over active political involvement. While acknowledging his right to enjoy a less stressful life, the author argues that Obama's detachment is incongruous with the desperation of his admirers, particularly given Trump's attacks on Obama's achievements. The piece suggests that Obama's reluctance to engage more actively stems from a desire not to overshadow the next generation of Democratic leaders, but argues that his continued popularity and influence could be valuable in challenging Trump's policies.</p>
