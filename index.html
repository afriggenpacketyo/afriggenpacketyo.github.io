          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter, appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, died at 85. Souter, a Republican appointee, often sided with liberal justices, frustrating conservatives, especially in cases like Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which upheld abortion rights. His retirement allowed President Barack Obama to appoint Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a liberal, to the Supreme Court. Souter's death marks the end of a career defined by judicial independence and a willingness to defy partisan expectations.</p>

          <p>Anti-abortion activists have launched a coordinated campaign, called “Rolling Thunder,” to pressure the FDA to reinstate restrictions on mifepristone, a drug used in most abortions in America. They plan new lawsuits against doctors who prescribe abortion medication and will continue lobbying to remove the drug from the market entirely. Their efforts rely on a controversial report claiming mifepristone causes high rates of health complications, contradicting decades of safety testing. While the Trump administration has sent mixed signals, experts see this as an effort to protect the administration's ability to restrict mifepristone.</p>

          <p>Real estate analysts have noted a significant trend of apartment renters renewing their leases instead of moving, with turnover rates dropping from the typical 50% to around 30%. This is attributed to factors like an unaffordable housing market, limited rental supply, economic uncertainty, and the costs associated with moving. As a result, landlords are benefiting from better pricing on renewals and reduced turnover expenses. Analysts recommend REITs like Essex Property Trust and Equity Residential, which have a strong presence on the West Coast.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and the U.K. have reached a trade deal, but it includes tariffs, signaling that President Trump's policy of imposing baseline tariffs is here to stay.

Analysts interpret this as the best deal other countries can expect, with Goldman Sachs noting more flexibility than expected on sectoral tariffs.

          <p>Republicans are grappling with Medicaid spending cuts to advance President Trump’s agenda, but proposed changes could disproportionately impact Southern states. While major cuts to the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion are off the table, limiting how states use a tax loophole could save $668 billion, largely by reducing Medicaid spending in poorer, Southern states. An analysis suggests that some states could lose 30% of their federal Medicaid funding, potentially leading to reduced health coverage or cuts in other government priorities. The final package probably needs one of the two big cuts to achieve Republicans’ budget goals.</p>
