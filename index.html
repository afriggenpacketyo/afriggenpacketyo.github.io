          <p>China's retail sales in May experienced a significant 6.4% year-on-year increase, exceeding analyst predictions and marking the fastest growth since late 2023.  This surge was partly attributed to holidays and government initiatives stimulating consumer spending. However, industrial output growth slowed to 5.8%, slightly below expectations, and fixed-asset investment also underperformed forecasts.  The urban unemployment rate decreased to 5.0%, its lowest point since November 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have significantly improved the stability and lifespan of perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs).  Using a new preparation method, they achieved a theoretical lifespan of over 21 years at a brightness meeting commercial standards. This breakthrough could revolutionize electronic devices, offering more energy-efficient and luminous displays at a potentially lower cost. The development is a significant step forward in PeLED technology.</p>

          <p>A study by York University found traces of the 'forever chemical' trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in almost all UK rivers tested.  The only exception was the River Ness in Scotland.  The German Federal Environment Agency is seeking to have TFA classified as toxic for reproduction, raising concerns about potential long-term health effects.  The UK is currently conducting its own research into the levels and risks of TFA in drinking water.</p>
