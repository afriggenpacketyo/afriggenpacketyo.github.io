          <p>After a 16-year hiatus, the band Oasis launched their highly anticipated reunion tour with a performance in Cardiff, Wales. The Gallagher brothers, Noel and Liam, put aside their long-standing feud to play a set of their classic 1990s hits to a crowd of 70,000 enthusiastic fans. The concert was widely praised for the band's rejuvenated energy and Liam Gallagher's powerful vocal performance, with many considering it their best form since their mid-90s peak. The show's success has set a positive tone for the remainder of their sold-out tour dates across the UK.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu has been eliminated from Wimbledon after a hard-fought third-round loss to world number one Aryna Sabalenka. Despite a strong performance that pushed the top seed, Raducanu ultimately fell in straight sets, 7-6, 6-4, on Centre Court. The 22-year-old showed significant improvement and resilience, even leading in the second set before Sabalenka mounted a comeback. While a difficult loss, Raducanu's competitive play against a three-time Grand Slam champion signals a positive trajectory for her career.</p>

          <p>Severe flash flooding has devastated Texas's Hill Country, leading to at least 13 confirmed fatalities in Kerr County. An intense storm dropped up to 12 inches of rain in a short period, causing the Guadalupe River to rise by an unprecedented 26 feet in under an hour. Search and rescue operations are ongoing for numerous missing people, including about 20 children from a summer camp that was hit by the floodwaters. Officials have described the situation as a "catastrophic level" flood, with the death toll expected to rise as emergency crews continue their work.</p>

          <p>On the Fourth of July, hundreds of demonstrators gathered in downtown Los Angeles to protest the Trump administration's recent immigration raids and a newly passed spending bill. The legislation allocates significant new funding for immigration enforcement, which protesters argue will escalate fear and harm within communities. The rally, which included a march to the federal building, highlighted the ongoing tensions between local officials and the federal government over immigration policies. Many participants expressed that they were forgoing holiday celebrations to stand in solidarity with affected families.</p>

The bill extends tax cuts that largely benefit the wealthy, while implementing new restrictions and cuts to federal safety-net programs like Medicaid and food stamps.

Gwinn has a history of two previous ACL injuries, casting significant doubt on her ability to continue in the tournament.

          <p>China's ambition to lead Global South-based organizations like the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and Brics is facing challenges from India. Both alliances operate on a consensus model, which gives India significant leverage to block or influence outcomes. This dynamic was evident at a recent SCO defense ministers' meeting where a joint statement was not adopted due to a lack of consensus on language related to terrorism, a key issue for India. This highlights how India's strategic positioning within these groups can act as a check on China's efforts to dominate the agenda.</p>

While this will lower the overall tax burden for many eligible seniors, it is not a direct repeal of the tax on Social Security benefits themselves.

          <p>According to a joint finding by Dutch and German intelligence services, Russia is systematically increasing its use of prohibited chemical weapons against Ukrainian forces. The report states that the use of agents like the World War I-era poison gas chloropicrin has become "standardized and commonplace." Russian forces allegedly use drones to drop these chemicals on trenches, forcing Ukrainian soldiers out into the open where they are then targeted by conventional fire. This escalation represents a significant violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, to which Russia is a signatory.</p>

          <p>A wildfire in California's Los Padres National Forest, dubbed the Madre Fire, has rapidly grown to over 70,800 acres, making it the largest fire in the state so far this year. The blaze, which is currently only 10% contained, has prompted evacuation orders and warnings in San Luis Obispo and Kern counties. Officials describe the fire's growth as "exponential" due to weather and fuel conditions. State and federal agencies are operating in a unified command to combat the fire and protect communities and property threatened by its spread.</p>

          <p>During a speech in Iowa, President Trump used the word "shylocks" to describe some lenders, a term the Anti-Defamation League identified as a "centuries-old antisemitic trope." The word references a greedy Jewish moneylender character from Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice." When questioned by reporters, Trump stated he was unaware of the term's antisemitic connotations and believed it simply meant a moneylender who charges high rates. The remark drew immediate criticism from the ADL and Democratic politicians, who condemned the language as offensive.</p>

Burns emphasized that the greatness of America comes from telling its full, complicated stories, including the flaws of its founders and the struggles of marginalized groups.</p>

When police located the brothers to make an arrest, they allegedly resisted violently, resulting in injuries to the officers, including a broken nose for one.

          <p>A provision within the newly passed "big, beautiful bill" creates a new federal tax deduction for tipped workers, a move President Trump has framed as "no tax on tips." The legislation allows workers like waiters and bartenders to deduct a portion of their tip income, thereby lowering their federal tax liability, though other taxes still apply. However, critics note the tax break is temporary, expiring in 2028, and will not benefit the lowest-earning tipped workers who already have no federal income tax liability to begin with.
