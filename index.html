        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump appointed Todd Blanche, his former defense lawyer, as acting Librarian of Congress, leading to immediate staff resistance. Library staff refused access to Justice Department officials selected by Blanche for key roles, citing the need for Congressional input. This action has ignited a power struggle between the executive and legislative branches, with Democrats criticizing the move as a trampling of Congress's authority. The Library of Congress houses important research services and the Copyright Office, making the appointment politically sensitive. The situation remains unresolved as Congress engages with the White House.</p>

          <p>Rapper Tory Lanez, incarcerated for the sexual assault of Megan Thee Stallion, was hospitalized following an attack by a fellow inmate at the California Correctional Institution. The extent of Lanez's injuries remains unclear, and an investigation has been launched by the prison's Investigative Services Unit and the Kern County District Attorney's Office. Lanez is serving a 10-year sentence after being found guilty in December 2022 of shooting and injuring Megan Thee Stallion in July 2020.

          <p>A recent Zillow analysis reveals that renters need to earn at least $100,000 annually to live comfortably in eight major U.S. metropolitan areas, including New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. This reflects a significant increase from pre-pandemic levels, driven by surging rents and a lack of adequate housing supply. New York City tops the list, requiring an annual income of $135,000 to afford the average rent. Experts advocate for increased affordable housing initiatives to alleviate the financial strain on renters across the country.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are pushing for significant changes to Medicaid, aiming to cut $880 billion over the next decade, but lack a full analysis from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) before their markup. While the CBO confirmed the savings target would be met, the full impact of the proposals remains unclear, raising concerns among Democrats about potential coverage losses. President Trump has urged Republicans to unify around the bill, incorporating savings from prescription drug cuts and tariff revenue. The effort faces potential challenges in the House, with some hardliners signaling opposition to the proposed debt increases.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has suspended all imports of live cattle, horse, and bison from Mexico due to the spread of New World Screwworm (NWS), a parasitic fly whose larvae eat living tissue.

The USDA is working to eradicate the disease by releasing sterile flies in affected areas of Mexico and Central America.

          <p>President Trump's aggressive tariff strategy against China has largely failed to achieve its intended goals, leading to a temporary trade truce and a rollback of tariffs. While the tariffs aimed to rebalance the global trading order and reduce dependence on China, they instead caused economic pain and market chaos. The US and China have agreed to reduce tariffs for 90 days, returning to levels in place before the trade war escalated. This shift suggests a scaling back of grand ambitions and a search for a deal that can be presented as a win, though it is unlikely to restore manufacturing in the US.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has resumed collection efforts on defaulted federal student loans, including wage garnishments. The Education Department will notify affected borrowers about the timeline for garnishments, which can take up to 15% of disposable pay. Borrowers can challenge the wage garnishment if it results in financial hardship or if they've recently been unemployed or filed for bankruptcy. Experts recommend contacting the government's Default Resolution Group to explore options for getting current on loans, such as enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan or signing up for loan rehabilitation.</p>

          <p>An article in the New York Times T Magazine explores the concept of 'the closet' in queer culture, noting its evolution from a place of hiding and shame to a subject of renewed interest. The documentary 'Pee-wee as Himself' reveals Paul Reubens' decision to remain closeted for much of his career, driven by self-preservation and professional constraints. The article examines the complexities of being in the closet, its portrayal in film and television, and the shifting dynamics of LGBTQ+ identity in contemporary society. It suggests that the renewed interest in the closet reflects a desire to claim the struggles of the past and a recognition of the ongoing need for visibility and self-declaration.</p>
