          <p>The U.S. government's vast data collection, historically compartmentalized, is increasingly at risk of centralization, raising concerns about potential abuse and weaponization. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, is gaining access to sensitive data across federal agencies, aiming to eliminate data silos. This consolidation, combined with advancements in AI, could lead to a surveillance society where data is used to target individuals and groups based on political or personal attributes, potentially eroding privacy and freedom.</p>
