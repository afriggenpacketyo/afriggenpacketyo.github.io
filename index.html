          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu delivered a defiant speech at the UN General Assembly, criticizing Western nations for recognizing a Palestinian state, which he termed a "mark of shame." His address prompted a walkout by dozens of diplomats, leaving the hall partially empty. In a move criticized by his political opponents in Israel, Netanyahu also arranged for his speech to be broadcast via loudspeakers into Gaza, stating it was a message for the remaining Israeli hostages. The speech underscored Israel's growing diplomatic isolation amid the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is conducting a safety review of the abortion pill mifepristone, according to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This review responds to pressure from Republican state attorneys general and anti-abortion groups who have raised concerns about the drug's safety, particularly after regulations were eased to allow for telehealth prescription and mail delivery. While advocates for abortion access cite numerous studies confirming the drug's safety, the review could potentially lead to new restrictions on its availability.</p>

          <p>The federal indictment of former FBI Director James Comey has ignited a political firestorm, with prominent Democrats labeling it a "constitutional crisis" and a politically motivated attack by the Trump administration. Critics like Senator Chris Murphy and Representative Jamie Raskin argue the charges are baseless and a direct result of President Trump's pressure on the Justice Department. In contrast, Republican reactions have been more measured, with some praising the move as a necessary step for accountability, highlighting the deep partisan divide over the issue.</p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has removed over a dozen webpages containing information on sexual health, gender identity, and health equity for marginalized groups. An internal email revealed the directive came from the Department of Health and Human Services, aligning with the Trump administration's broader policy of limiting references to gender identity in federal documents. Health equity advocates have condemned the move, warning that removing these critical resources from a trusted government source endangers public health and undermines inclusive care.</p>

While officials pointed to some observational studies showing an association, no high-quality research has established a causal link, and a major study of 2.4 million births found no connection. Health practitioners and scientists have expressed concern over the administration's messaging, emphasizing that acetaminophen remains the only approved painkiller for pregnant women and urging them to consult trusted medical professionals for advice.</p>

With the property sector in a slump and few other attractive investment options, more ordinary Chinese citizens are turning to stocks, despite the market's historical volatility.

          <p>The founders of Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, have been accused by the SEC of defrauding investors in a $112 million Ponzi scheme. The pair acquired the brands of bankrupt retailers like RadioShack, Pier 1 Imports, and Modell's Sporting Goods with the promise of turning them into profitable online businesses. However, the lawsuit alleges they misrepresented the companies' financial health and used money from new investors to pay returns to earlier ones, while also diverting $16 million for their personal use.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury in Virginia has indicted former FBI Director James Comey on charges of making a false statement and obstruction of justice. The indictment stems from his 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, where he allegedly lied about authorizing an FBI subordinate to be an anonymous source for news reports concerning the Hillary Clinton email investigation. The charges were brought just days after President Donald Trump publicly urged for his prosecution, raising concerns about political influence within the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a 100% tariff on imported branded pharmaceuticals has created uncertainty for global drug manufacturers. The policy includes an exemption for companies that are currently building or operating manufacturing plants in the United States, a move that could spare several large European firms already investing in U.S. production. However, the details remain unclear, and the move has been criticized for potentially disrupting supply chains, increasing costs for patients, and creating confusion for trade partners like the European Union.

The study found that the skull exhibits a mix of features from the early human forerunner Homo erectus and later species like Homo sapiens, implying that our ancestors may have diverged into distinct groups much earlier than previously believed. If confirmed, these provocative findings could shift the focus of early human evolution from Africa to Asia, challenging long-standing scientific assumptions.</p>
