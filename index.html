          <p>Jing Qian, a managing director at the Asia Society’s Centre for China Analysis, provides an assessment of recent U.S.-China trade negotiations. He notes that de-escalation was a shared interest in recent talks, driven by market instability and the need for economic breathing room for both nations. Qian characterizes the dynamic as a “manageable rivalry,” suggesting that while negotiators on both sides are tough, there is a structured framework for continued dialogue aimed at preventing further economic disruption.</p>

          <p>The D.C. National Guard has announced a policy shift, stating that its members patrolling Washington D.C. may now be armed. This change is part of the Trump administration's broader plan to increase law enforcement presence in the capital, a move that has drawn criticism from local officials like Mayor Muriel Bowser. While the Guard's role is described as supporting civil authorities and deterring crime, the potential for armed troops on city streets has alarmed civil liberties advocates.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of protesters gathered across Israel, with the largest demonstration in Tel Aviv, demanding the government secure a deal for the release of hostages held by Hamas and bring an end to the war in Gaza. The protests, which included a one-day national strike, reflect growing public pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's administration. Organizers and families of hostages argue that the government's plan to occupy Gaza City endangers the remaining captives and has turned a just war into a pointless one.</p>

Experts suggest that persistent inflation and a gloomy economic outlook are causing American tourists to drastically reduce their spending on travel, leading to a "ghost town" atmosphere in certain popular destinations.

          <p>Chelsea's Premier League season began with a frustrating 0-0 draw at home against Crystal Palace, raising early concerns about their offensive capabilities. Despite fielding an attacking lineup constructed with a combined £250 million in transfer fees, the team struggled to create clear chances and managed only three shots on target. The result highlights the challenge manager Enzo Maresca faces in integrating new talent and building a cohesive unit capable of challenging for top honors.</p>

The shot was allegedly made using a Ukrainian-made 14.5mm Snipex Alligator anti-materiel rifle, surpassing the previous record of 3,800 meters also held by a Ukrainian sniper.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, now a Category 3 storm, has shifted its forecast path, leading the government of the Bahamas to issue a tropical storm warning for the Turks and Caicos Islands and a watch for the southeastern Bahamas. While the hurricane weakened slightly after reaching Category 5 intensity, the National Hurricane Center expects it to restrengthen and remain a powerful storm for several days. The expanding storm is forecast to generate dangerous surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast early next week.</p>

          <p>A coalition of eleven civil liberty and anti-racism groups has formally requested that London's Metropolitan Police cancel plans to deploy live facial recognition (LFR) technology at this year's Notting Hill Carnival. In a letter to the commissioner, the organizations described LFR as a "mass surveillance tool" that has a documented history of being less accurate for women and people of color. The Met Police defends its use, insisting the technology is accurate and will help keep the large event safe.</p>
