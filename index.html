          <p>A man in Washington, D.C., has been federally charged with assaulting a Customs and Border Protection agent. The man allegedly shouted profanities at the officer before throwing a sub-style sandwich, striking him in the chest. The incident, which was reportedly captured on video, occurs amid heightened tensions over the increased presence of federal law enforcement in the nation's capital. The suspect was apprehended after attempting to flee and later admitted to the act.</p>

          <p>Google is under significant pressure as it awaits a judge's remedy decision following a major antitrust ruling that found it holds a monopoly in search. The situation intensified with a public $34.5 billion bid for its Chrome browser from AI startup Perplexity, highlighting the potential for a forced divestiture. The Department of Justice has explicitly called for Google to sell Chrome to foster competition, a move the company strongly opposes. This comes as analysts debate the valuation of Google's various assets, such as YouTube and Google Cloud, in the event of a forced breakup. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stargazers across the U.S. East Coast were treated to a surprising and unusual light show, witnessing mysterious spirals of light appearing in the night sky. The phenomenon was visible in numerous states and was likely caused by the upper stage of a recently launched Ariane 6 rocket. An astrophysicist from Harvard explained that the perfect spiral shape is formed when sunlight reflects off the frozen plume of fuel from a tumbling rocket stage in space, where there is no air to distort it. The spectacle occurred on a night when many were already looking up to watch the Perseid meteor shower.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Constitution grants Congress exclusive legislative power over the District of Columbia, a unique status dating back to the nation's founding. This arrangement was designed to protect the federal government from local pressures, a lesson learned from a 1783 army mutiny in Philadelphia. While the 1973 Home Rule Act granted D.C. a local government, Congress retains ultimate authority, periodically intervening in city affairs. This constitutional framework is the basis for President Trump's recent deployment of federal forces to oversee the city's policing.</p>

The article revisits the 1867 sale of the Alaskan territory from Russia to the United States for $7.2 million. This historical context is particularly relevant as some in Russia still question the legitimacy of the sale and view Alaska as historically Russian land. The summit provides a modern backdrop to this long-standing, and sometimes contested, chapter of U.S.-Russian relations.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 18:02:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alaska's capital, Juneau, was spared from widespread damage after a glacial ice dam released a record surge of water from the nearby Mendenhall Glacier. Newly installed temporary barriers, consisting of over 10,000 reinforced sandbags, successfully held back the Mendenhall River as it crested at a record high. These annual outburst floods, which have worsened in recent years, are attributed to climate change causing glaciers to melt and retreat. While some minor seepage occurred, officials credited the new defenses with preventing a repeat of past years when hundreds of homes were inundated.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration can proceed with its decision to withhold billions of dollars in congressionally approved foreign aid. The 2-1 decision by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals focused on procedural grounds, stating that only the Government Accountability Office, not the humanitarian nonprofits who filed the suit, had the standing to challenge the action. The ruling is a significant blow to global aid organizations, as the withheld funds include money for HIV/AIDS prevention and other critical health programs. Critics argue the cuts will have a severe human cost and undermine the separation of powers.</p>

          <p>Researchers are predicting a substantial decline in global reindeer populations over the next several decades, with North American caribou being the most vulnerable. A new study warns that these populations could plummet by up to 80% by the year 2100 unless major cuts to greenhouse gas emissions are made. Using fossil records and computer models, scientists found that while reindeer have survived past warming periods, the current rate of climate change poses an unprecedented threat. The loss of these animals could also have cascading ecological effects, including reduced plant diversity and the release of carbon stored in Arctic soils.</p>

          <p>A Kentucky man who had just collected a $167.3 million Powerball jackpot was arrested in Florida the very next day, as shown in newly released police bodycam footage. James Farthing, 50, was charged with battery on a law enforcement officer after allegedly kicking a deputy in the face during a fight at a resort. Police accuse Farthing of punching another guest and resisting arrest, while his girlfriend was also arrested for disorderly conduct. The incident presents a stark and ironic contrast to the celebratory mood just 24 hours earlier when he claimed the largest lottery prize in Kentucky's history.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Early Warning Services (EWS), the bank-owned parent company of the payment app Zelle. The suit alleges that EWS knowingly launched the service with design flaws that made it highly susceptible to fraud, leading to over $1 billion in consumer losses between 2017 and 2023. The complaint claims that the app's quick registration and lack of verification made it easy for scammers to exploit users. The lawsuit seeks restitution for affected New Yorkers and a court order requiring EWS to implement and enforce stronger anti-fraud measures.</p>

          <p>Shares of CoreWeave, a key provider of data center infrastructure for artificial intelligence, dropped by 20% after the company reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss. The results came just before the expiration of its post-IPO lock-up period, which could introduce more stock volatility as insiders become eligible to sell shares. Despite the loss, CoreWeave's revenue more than tripled year-over-year, and the company raised its full-year revenue forecast, citing strong demand that continues to outweigh supply.

          <p>Missouri health officials have confirmed a rare and dangerous infection from the Naegleria fowleri amoeba, commonly known as the brain-eating amoeba. The unidentified patient is currently in intensive care after reportedly water skiing in the Lake of the Ozarks days before falling ill. While the amoeba is common in warm freshwater, infection is extremely rare and occurs when contaminated water is forced up the nose, allowing the organism to reach the brain. This case follows another recent fatal infection in South Carolina, raising awareness about the risks of certain freshwater recreational activities.</p>

This rotation is largely driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates in September. Lower rates are particularly beneficial for smaller companies, as they reduce borrowing costs and can stimulate consumer spending, potentially boosting the broader economy.

          <p>Despite President Trump's public criticism of Goldman Sachs, a broad consensus is forming among Wall Street economists that U.S. consumers will face higher inflation due to tariffs. While a recent CPI report was mild, experts predict that as pre-tariff inventories are used up, the impact of increased duties will become more apparent in retail prices. Economists from firms like JPMorgan and UBS expect a gradual rise in inflation, which could slow consumer spending and GDP growth. However, most do not believe this will deter the Federal Reserve from cutting interest rates, as the inflation is seen as temporary. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A European Commission plan to impose penalties on Israel over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza remains deadlocked due to a lack of consensus among EU member states. The proposal, which would bar Israeli startups from a key EU research fund, was introduced after a review found Israel's actions in Gaza likely breach its cooperation agreement. However, countries like Germany are requesting more time for review, preventing the "qualified majority" needed for the measure to pass. This internal division highlights the bloc's ongoing struggle to form a unified policy response to the conflict, despite widespread condemnation of the suffering in Gaza.</p>

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic addresses White House advisor Stephen Miller's concerns about rampant crime in Washington, D.C., by ironically agreeing with him. The piece points out that he is indeed surrounded by "criminals," referencing various Trump administration officials and allies involved in controversial or legally dubious activities. The author uses sarcasm to critique the administration's own actions, from defying court orders to the events of January 6th. It concludes by highlighting the hypocrisy of calling for the National Guard to address lawlessness while ignoring alleged misconduct within their own circles.</p>
