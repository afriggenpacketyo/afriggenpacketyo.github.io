          <p>Following Sean "Diddy" Combs' four-year prison sentence for prostitution-related offenses, his legal team announced plans to appeal, arguing the judge unfairly considered conduct for which Combs was acquitted. Lawyers Teny Geragos and Alexandra Shapiro contended the judge "acted as a 13th juror" by focusing on domestic violence, a charge not leading to conviction. They maintain the sentence was disproportionate and inconsistent with the jury's verdict, emphasizing Combs' prior year served and his commitment to rehabilitation. The defense believes further incarceration is senseless given the damage already done to his life and reputation.</p>

          <p>During an antisemitic attack on a Manchester synagogue on Yom Kippur, authorities revealed that police gunfire likely killed one congregant and injured another. The perpetrator, a 35-year-old Syrian-born British citizen, drove into pedestrians and used a knife before being fatally shot by officers. Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Steve Watson described the incident as a "tragic and unforeseen consequence" of necessary police action to end the "vicious" attack. The incident has been declared an act of terrorism, with the attacker potentially influenced by Islamist ideology and having a prior criminal history including sexual assault.</p>

          <p>North Carolina Governor Josh Stein signed "Iryna's Law," a new measure designed to increase scrutiny on criminals released on bail and prohibit cashless bail for certain violent and repeat offenses. The law was enacted following the brutal murder of Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska by Decarlos Dejuan Brown Jr., who had a history of arrests and prior prison time. While acknowledging criticisms, including a controversial amendment aiming to restart executions by firing squad, Governor Stein emphasized the law's primary benefit in identifying high-risk individuals before bail decisions. The legislation seeks to enhance public safety by limiting judicial discretion in pretrial release and mandating mental health evaluations for more defendants.</p>

The IDF separately reported killing 20 Hamas operatives attempting to use children as human shields in a humanitarian zone. Further reports indicate Hamas is holding six clan members, potentially for execution, highlighting the brutal internal conflict within Gaza.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom publicly urged the University of Southern California (USC) to reject a higher education compact proposed by former President Trump, threatening to cut billions in state funding to any institution that accepts it. The compact demands conservative policy shifts on admissions, diversity, and free speech, and restricts recognition of transgender identities and foreign student enrollment, in exchange for priority federal funding. Newsom emphasized the importance of academic freedom and called the decision a "false choice" for USC, a private institution. The governor's stance escalates the ongoing debate over political influence in higher education, as other universities like UCLA also navigate federal negotiations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is reportedly considering minting a new one-dollar coin for the nation's 250th anniversary, potentially featuring an image of President Donald Trump. A draft design, shared by U.S. Treasurer Brandon Beach, includes Trump's face on one side and a depiction of him pumping his fist after a 2014 near-assassination attempt on the reverse. This initiative is enabled by the Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020, signed by Trump. Legal experts note historical provisions often prohibit living persons or presidents from appearing on currency, though Congress could grant an exception, as it did in 1926 for President Calvin Coolidge.</p>

Researchers in Switzerland are developing organoids—mini-brains grown from stem cells—that can be attached to electrodes and respond to commands, mimicking AI learning with a fraction of current energy consumption. While these organoids are far less complex than a human brain, they possess the same building blocks. Significant challenges remain, particularly in sustaining these cellular computers, as they lack blood vessels for nutrient supply. Despite the early stage, the research holds promise for disease modeling and complementing silicon AI, pushing the boundaries of technology.</p>

In exchange, the companies anticipate significant savings from reduced insurance requirements for accidents involving uninsured drivers.

Victims, who sold homes and made life-altering plans, discovered VCL does not own or lease the advertised vessel. Consumer advocates accuse VCL of selling a "dream" that became a "nightmare," with the company claiming it needs more customers to charter a ship and denying any wrongdoing. Legal cases and consumer complaints have been filed, while VCL has threatened legal action against those who speak out, revealing a web of shell businesses and unpaid taxes.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle (EV) sales in the UK reached a record high in September, with pure battery electric vehicles growing by almost a third to 72,779 units. Plug-in hybrid sales also surged, resulting in electrified vehicles comprising over half of all new car registrations last month. This growth is attributed to carmaker discounts, a wider range of models, and the government's £3,750 grant scheme aimed at encouraging the transition from petrol and diesel. While businesses and fleets accounted for the majority of these sales, private buyer interest has increased, with zero-emission vehicles now making up over one in five new cars registered in 2025.</p>

          <p>A white Kansas sheriff's deputy, Richard Fatherly, has been charged with second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter in the death of Charles Adair, a cuffed Black man. Newly released court records indicate Fatherly pressed his knee into Adair's back for 86 seconds while Adair, suffering from a severely injured and infected leg, was on his stomach in a cell. Adair, arrested for misdemeanor traffic warrants, was described as incoherent by deputies, with an autopsy listing his death as a homicide due to "mechanical asphyxia." Adair's family's attorney, Ben Crump, condemned the actions, highlighting that a traffic violation should not result in a death sentence and demanding public release of body camera video.</p>

However, a spokesperson for PPE Medpro stated that £83 million of that sum was passed to other consortium firms, Loudwater Trade and Finance and Eric Beare Associates, suggesting administrators should pursue them for the money. Doug Barrowman previously admitted receiving around £60 million himself, with a share going into a trust for Baroness Mone and her children.

          <p>The Trump administration plans to offer unaccompanied immigrant children aged 14 and older in government custody a $2,500 stipend to voluntarily self-deport, according to a memo from the Department of Health and Human Services. This initiative, which excludes Mexican minors, marks a significant departure from established immigration policy and has drawn alarm from legal experts and advocates. Critics argue the offer exploits children's vulnerabilities, pressures them to abandon legal claims, and risks returning them to dangerous situations without fair hearings. Concerns also exist that the program could fuel family separations and is part of a broader "sustained assault" on children's access to legal counsel and due process.</p>

It remains unclear if the crash was intentional, and the driver was assessed for injuries by paramedics. Mayor Karen Bass was briefed on the incident, which prompted an abundance of caution.

          <p>Gisèle Pelicot, a 72-year-old grandmother who became a feminist icon after being the victim in France's largest sexual assault trial, returns to court for the appeal of one of her husband's accomplices. Her husband, Dominique, drugged and facilitated her sexual assault by dozens of men over a decade, documenting the crimes. While Gisèle's decision to waive anonymity and pursue justice garnered global recognition and accolades, the ordeal has fractured her family. Her daughter and older son, who believe they were also sexually assaulted by Dominique, are estranged from Gisèle, who remained silent on their accusations during the initial trial. The appeal highlights the profound, lasting trauma of such crimes, extending beyond the victim to tear families apart.</p>

          <p>Recent anti-China protests in South Korea's Myeongdong and Daelim-dong districts, frequented by Chinese travelers, have reportedly failed to deter tourists. Despite the Chinese embassy expressing regret over the rallies, scheduled flights between the two countries are operating as expected, and South Korea remains a top destination for Chinese visitors. Analysts suggest that as long as both governments oppose the protests and public safety is maintained, tourism will likely continue unaffected. This situation highlights the resilience of travel patterns and the economic imperative to maintain diplomatic stability, even amidst public demonstrations.

Critics argue that capitulating to such demands erodes First Amendment protections and sets a dangerous precedent, especially given Apple's own mapping apps crowdsource police locations. The move reignites debates about corporate responsibility in upholding free expression versus complying with government requests, particularly when economic interests are at play.</p>

          <p>A CBS News/YouGov poll reveals a stark paradox in American sentiment: an overwhelming majority across all political affiliations condemn political violence as unacceptable, yet simultaneously anticipate its increase in the coming years. This apprehension is rooted in a pervasive pessimism about the ability of different political groups to unite, despite a general belief that people get along outside of politics. The poll also highlights a decline in political civility, with fewer than half feeling comfortable expressing political views publicly, fearing negative repercussions like insults, threats, or employment problems. This widespread discomfort and expectation of escalating conflict underscore deep divisions within the nation.</p>
