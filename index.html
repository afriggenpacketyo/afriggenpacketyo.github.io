        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coroner has concluded that neglect from a Manchester mental health unit, run by the Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust, contributed to the death of 22-year-old Cerys Lupton-Jones. The investigation found that staff had falsified observation records, stating she was safe just minutes before she fatally harmed herself. The coroner noted that a staff member admitted to falsifying the records and that if proper basic medical attention had been provided after an earlier suicide attempt, her death may have been prevented. This case has intensified calls from campaigners for a broader inquiry into the number of deaths under the trust's care.</p>

          <p>Christopher Moynihan, a New York man who was pardoned by former President Donald Trump for his involvement in the January 6th Capitol riot, has been arrested and charged with making a terroristic threat. State police allege that Moynihan threatened to kill House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Moynihan had previously been convicted on multiple counts related to his actions inside the Senate chamber during the riot. This new charge brings renewed scrutiny to individuals who received pardons for their roles in the events of January 6, 2021.</p>

          <p>SpaceX CEO Elon Musk publicly criticized acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy after Duffy stated that SpaceX was behind schedule on its lunar lander for the Artemis III mission. In a series of posts on X, Musk insulted Duffy's intelligence and suggested he was trying to "kill NASA." The exchange highlights the pressure and friction within the U.S. space program as it races to return humans to the moon amid technical setbacks and delays. NASA has indicated it may consider other contractors, such as Blue Origin, to accelerate the project's timeline.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has officially launched ChatGPT Atlas, a new web browser built around its generative AI technology, positioning it as a direct competitor to Google Chrome. The browser integrates ChatGPT into a companion sidebar on every webpage, allowing users to summarize content, ask questions, and perform tasks without switching tabs. CEO Sam Altman stated the goal is to rethink the browser experience, with features like an "agent mode" that can complete actions like booking flights for the user. Following the announcement, shares of Google's parent company, Alphabet, dropped by approximately 3%.</p>

          <p>According to CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook, using weighted vests during exercise can increase calorie burn and heart workload but also carries risks. He advises that individuals with underlying health conditions should consult a doctor before using them, as it acts as a mini stress test on the heart. To avoid injury, it is recommended to start with a weight that is only 5% of one's body weight and to ensure the vest fits properly to prevent stress on joints. While some users hope for bone health benefits, studies on this remain inconclusive.</p>

          <p>The Paris prosecutor has estimated that the crown jewels stolen from the Louvre museum in a weekend heist are worth approximately $102 million, not including their immense historical value. About 100 investigators are now searching for the suspects and the priceless gems, which include Napoleonic-era diadems and necklaces. In response to questions about security failures, France's culture minister asserted that the museum's security systems worked properly, though she did not explain how the thieves succeeded.

A White House official stated there are "no plans" for a summit in the "immediate future," citing a lack of progress in preliminary discussions between their top diplomats. Key differences remain over the terms for ending the war in Ukraine, particularly Russia's refusal to accept a ceasefire along the current front lines, which has stalled any potential for a high-level diplomatic breakthrough.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Israel, Vice President JD Vance stated that the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is progressing "frankly better than I expected," despite recent violent flare-ups. Vance acknowledged the challenges, including difficulties in recovering all hostage remains, but insisted the peace plan is on track. The visit aims to reinforce the fragile agreement, which has seen some progress with hostage and body exchanges. However, some analysts remain skeptical about the long-term viability of the deal, questioning both sides' commitment to a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>Israel is implementing new rules that threaten to halt the work of major international aid organizations in Gaza and the West Bank, according to humanitarian officials. The new registration process reportedly includes ideological criteria, such as whether an organization's statements could be seen as delegitimizing Israel, which could be used to de-register them. This move is severely hampering the ability of established NGOs to send staff and aid into Gaza, where famine has been declared, and comes as Israel continues to ban the main UN agency from operating there.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, top financial advisors are suggesting portfolio adjustments to navigate the changing economic landscape. Planners recommend considering intermediate-term U.S. Treasury bonds with three- to seven-year maturities to lock in currently attractive yields before rates fall further. For stocks, the consensus advice is to maintain a well-diversified portfolio across various asset classes rather than trying to time the market or chase performance in sectors that are historically sensitive to interest rates, such as small-cap stocks.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis indicates that tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are contributing to rising consumer prices. The research shows that importers are passing on a substantial portion of the tariff costs to consumers, leading to measurable inflation in product categories with high import rates like furniture, car parts, and electronics. While some businesses are still absorbing costs, the study concludes that the tariffs are already exerting clear upward pressure on what Americans pay for goods. (not investment advice)</p>
