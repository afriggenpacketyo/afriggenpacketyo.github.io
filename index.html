          <p>Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff stated that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding and dismissed concerns that Iran could quickly resume its nuclear enrichment program. He also criticized the leak of an initial intelligence assessment of Iran's nuclear capabilities after U.S. strikes, calling it "treasonous." The assessment had concluded that the strikes did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program but likely set it back by a few months. Witkoff assured that it's "not even conceivable" that Iran could resume its program within months. </p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars nearing the end of their lives slow their spin, revealing insights into star formation. By studying thousands of stars, researchers found that stars born today spin up to 10 times faster than older stars. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, hindering the formation of massive stars. The study provides direct evidence that the Milky Way's star-forming clouds have become more turbulent over time, offering a new method to study the galaxy's evolution.</p>

          <p>An initial classified assessment indicates that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities have only set back Tehran's nuclear program by a few months, despite claims of complete obliteration. The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, found that entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities were sealed off, but the underground infrastructure remains largely intact. Some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was reportedly moved before the strikes. The White House has disputed these findings, while officials caution that the assessment is preliminary and subject to change as more information becomes available. </p>

Immigration law experts note that the Trump administration's strict enforcement policies have reduced the discretion previously afforded to military families, leading to increased deportations.

          <p>Data from ICE raids in Los Angeles indicate that a majority of those arrested had no criminal convictions, contradicting claims that the focus is on targeting criminals. The analysis revealed that 69% of those arrested had no criminal conviction and 58% had never been charged with a crime. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass criticized the raids, noting the fear they instill in the community, with immigrant advocates alleging racial profiling. Nationally, the number of people arrested without criminal convictions has increased significantly. </p>

          <p>McDowell County in West Virginia, already facing economic decline, is struggling to recover from a devastating flood that occurred in February. The flood exacerbated existing challenges in the impoverished county, including population loss and the closure of essential services like the local Walmart. Despite approximately $12 million in federal relief, the funds are insufficient to cover the extensive cleanup and rebuilding efforts. The community's frustration with government is growing, as many feel forgotten and underserved. </p>

The report also faulted the FAA for ineffective oversight. Both Boeing and the FAA have responded, with Boeing stating it will review the report and the FAA affirming it has fundamentally changed its oversight of Boeing. </p>
