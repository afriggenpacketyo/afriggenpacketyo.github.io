            <p>The owner of Toby Carvery, Mitchells & Butlers (M&B), has issued an apology after the company felled a 500-year-old oak tree in Enfield, admitting the need to tighten protocols. Despite a planning document recognizing the tree as a "fine specimen," it was cut down on April 3, prompting outrage from the local council and residents. M&B initially stated the tree was removed due to health and safety concerns based on contractor advice, but later removed the statement while maintaining legal requirements were met. The company is conducting a thorough review to prevent similar incidents in the future.</p>

            <p>In an environment of persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn returns that outpace inflation, helping to preserve buying power. CDs allow investors to lock in high rates for a specific term, with FDIC or NCUA insurance providing safety on balances up to $250,000. While national average CD yields are around 2.01% for a 1-year CD, top online banks offer rates as high as 4.50% for shorter terms. Experts recommend considering short-term CDs and laddering CDs to take advantage of the inverted yield curve. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>The UK government has temporarily banned the personal import of pork, beef, lamb, mutton, goat, venison, and dairy products from the EU to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease. This ban applies to travelers arriving in Great Britain from the EU, regardless of transport mode, but excludes Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man. The measure does not affect commercial imports, which are subject to higher standards, including heat treatment and veterinary health certificates.

            <p>Current mortgage rates are elevated, with the average 30-year mortgage at 6.76% and the 15-year at 6.01%, while refinance rates are similar. Experts suggest that potential pauses in Federal Reserve rate hikes could stabilize or slightly reduce mortgage rates in the near future. Borrowers can improve their chances of securing favorable rates by strengthening their credit profiles, shopping around for lenders, and considering shorter loan terms. Locking in a rate after approval is crucial to avoid increases before closing. (not investment advice)</p>

The Monetary Policy Committee aims to strengthen the disinflation process through tight monetary policy and a stronger Turkish lira. The committee also acknowledged the potential impact of rising protectionism on global trade and emphasized its commitment to maintaining a tight monetary stance until price stability is achieved.</p>

While some smartphone manufacturing has expanded beyond China, the ecosystem needed to produce electronics remains largely concentrated there.

            <p>A federal judge in North Dakota has permanently blocked federal regulations protecting workers who seek abortions and fertility treatments, ruling in favor of Catholic employers. The Catholic Benefits Association and the Bismarck Diocese argued that the regulations violated their religious freedom. Judge Daniel Traynor found that the Pregnant Worker Fairness Act violated federal law protecting religious freedom, siding with the plaintiffs' claim that the EEOC's pronouncements forced them to accommodate abortions and immoral fertility treatments against their Catholic faith.</p>

            <p>Organ meats, once unpopular in the U.S., are experiencing a resurgence driven by online wellness communities promoting "ancestral" diets. Nutrition influencers tout the nutrient density of offal, leading to its inclusion in smoothies and other convenient forms. This trend has boosted sales of organ-meat blends and supplements, with supermarkets like Whole Foods and Erewhon offering specialized products. While organ meats are nutrient-rich, experts caution against overconsumption due to potential health risks and advise treating them as food rather than supplements.</p>

            <p>Netflix's co-founders, Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings, once declined an acquisition offer from Jeff Bezos and Amazon during the company's early days. In 1998, Amazon offered "low eight figures" to acquire Netflix and jump-start its entry into the video market, but the founders turned it down, believing they were on the brink of something significant. Later, Netflix attempted to sell to Blockbuster for $50 million, but the offer was dismissed. Today, Netflix is a video streaming giant with a market cap of over $400 billion.</p>

Western companies face tough negotiations, paperwork, and reputational risks, with the government prioritizing domestic production. While some companies secured buyback agreements, implementing them will not be simple, as the government seeks to maintain control over strategic sectors.

            <p>Archer, an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft company, has announced plans to offer air taxi services between Manhattan and major New York City airports. The proposed service would use Archer's Midnight aircraft to shuttle passengers to JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark airports in a matter of minutes. While Archer has partnered with several established aviation companies, the service still requires FAA approval and type certification for its aircraft. The air taxi industry is risky for startups, and Archer faces regulatory and operational challenges.</p>
