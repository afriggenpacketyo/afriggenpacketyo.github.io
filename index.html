          <p>A car-ramming attack at the annual Lapu Lapu festival in Vancouver, celebrating Filipino culture, has tragically resulted in 11 deaths and numerous injuries, plunging the city's Filipino community into mourning. The suspect, a 30-year-old with a history of mental health issues, is in custody, though authorities do not believe the attack was an act of terrorism. The incident occurred at East 43rd Avenue and Fraser, prompting a large-scale emergency response and leaving the community grappling with shock and grief. The victims' ages ranged from five to 65 years old, marking a profound loss for the tight-knit Filipino community in Vancouver.</p>

          <p>Canada is gearing up for a snap federal election called by new Prime Minister Mark Carney following Justin Trudeau's resignation and escalating trade tensions with the US under President Donald Trump.

Key issues include the response to Trump's tariffs, the cost of living, and housing affordability.

          <p>Canada is preparing for a pivotal federal election, with the ruling Liberals and opposition Conservatives in a tight race.

          <p>Despite agreeing to a ceasefire following a 7.7-magnitude earthquake that killed thousands, Myanmar's ruling junta has repeatedly violated the agreement, according to a BBC report from inside rebel-held territory. The violations include rocket and mortar attacks that have killed and injured civilians and resistance fighters. The UN reports that the earthquake has pushed a further two million people into need, adding to the existing 2.5 million displaced before the quake, amidst an ongoing civil war between the junta and ethnic groups, since the military seized power in a coup in 2021.</p>
