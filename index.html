          <p>A recent BBC interview featuring Prince Harry's emotional appeal to reconcile with his father, King Charles III, has reignited bitter tensions within the British royal family. The article suggests that this ongoing rift could overshadow King Charles' reign, which is already marked by his cancer treatment and efforts to modernize the monarchy. Some royal watchers warn that unless Charles finds a way to heal the divide with Harry, it could negatively impact his legacy and undermine the messages of unity and forgiveness that he has long championed. The palace has pushed back on Harry's claims regarding security arrangements, further fueling the family drama.</p>

          <p>Democrats are seeking to capitalize on parents' anxieties regarding rising baby gear prices and the spread of vaccine misinformation, linking these issues to President Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The article explores how the Trump administration's policies are impacting families, with rising costs of strollers and car seats due to tariffs, cuts to safe infant sleep campaigns, and measles outbreaks fueled by vaccine skepticism. While Republicans have successfully tapped into parental concerns in the past, Democrats see an opportunity to connect with voters by addressing their fears and offering solutions grounded in science and public health. The effectiveness of this strategy remains to be seen, as some voters express skepticism towards vaccines regardless of political affiliation.</p>

          <p>President Trump's proposed Special Education Simplified Funding Program, part of his 2026 budget, raises concerns among parents of students with disabilities about potential cuts to funding and reduced federal oversight. The article highlights the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and its role in ensuring fair education for students with disabilities. With the proposed budget aiming to limit federal involvement and give states greater flexibility, parents fear that states may not be held accountable for meeting IDEA's requirements, potentially leading to an erosion of educational opportunities for disabled students. The article uses the example of a student in Oklahoma who was initially placed in segregated classrooms and denied the opportunity to earn a high school diploma to illustrate the potential consequences of reduced oversight.</p>

His comments come after major outages and delays at Newark Liberty International Airport. Kirby emphasized that safety remains the aviation industry's top priority and outlined backup procedures in place during outages. He acknowledged that the system is deliberately slowed down during such events, causing disruptions for customers, and said United has proactively reduced flights to create more space at the airport.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed his readiness to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Istanbul on Thursday to discuss ending the war, following a call from Donald Trump for direct talks. Zelensky insisted on a full ceasefire before the talks, stating that there is no point in prolonging the killings. Trump's demand came after a proposed ceasefire was ignored, and Zelensky reiterated his country's openness to talks only after a ceasefire is in place. Western powers had called for a 30-day pause in fighting, but Putin's offer of direct talks has been met with skepticism.</p>

          <p>Wealthy Gulf states have promised President Trump significant investments in the US; however, falling oil prices pose a challenge to their ability to fulfill these pledges. Lower oil prices impact the national income of these oil-dependent nations, potentially affecting their financial commitments, including regional projects and domestic reform agendas. While UAE and Qatar are in a better position due to current account surpluses, Saudi Arabia may face pressure on spending, requiring careful decisions about priorities. Experts suggest that these new pledges should be viewed in the context of past unfulfilled promises from Gulf states.</p>

Despite the positive rhetoric, the US has maintained that tariffs will not be lowered unilaterally, and China will need to make its own concessions. The meeting, the first since the imposition of steep tariffs, was described as a 'total reset' by Trump, though challenges and complexities persist.</p>
