          <p>Ether, a prominent cryptocurrency, achieved a new record high for the first time since 2021, spurred by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's remarks at Jackson Hole. Powell suggested that current economic conditions might warrant adjusting the policy stance, implying potential interest rate cuts. This dovish sentiment reportedly caught traders off-guard, leading to significant short liquidations in the crypto market and pushing Ether's price higher. The article highlights a shift in market momentum and growing institutional interest in stablecoins, which are heavily reliant on the Ethereum blockchain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has released over 300 pages of transcripts and audio from Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's two-day interview with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell, a key associate of Jeffrey Epstein, discussed her relationship with Epstein and others in his orbit, including her interactions with prominent figures. The interview, conducted with limited immunity, came amidst scrutiny of the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein case and the subsequent release of related files to Congress. Maxwell denied knowledge of an "Epstein list" and speculated about Epstein's death not being suicide.</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has undergone a significant transformation over the past decade, rapidly closing the military capability gap with the United States. President Xi Jinping set ambitious goals for the PLA, aiming for "significant progress" by 2027, "basically complete" modernization by 2035, and a "world-class" military by 2049. Analysts now view China as a comparable military power due to its advanced weaponry and robust industrial support.

          <p>This article highlights three often-overlooked factors that can reduce Social Security benefits for retirees, potentially impacting their financial stability. These include the earnings test for those working before full retirement age, automatic deductions for Medicare Part B premiums (which can increase for high-income earners), and federal income taxes on benefits based on combined income thresholds. Many retirees are surprised by these reductions, underscoring the importance of comprehensive retirement planning. The article also suggests strategies like reverse mortgages, part-time work, or annuities to supplement income if benefits fall short. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article critiques Donald Trump's reported comments questioning the Smithsonian Institution's focus on "how bad slavery was," viewing them as part of a broader effort to control historical narratives. The author argues that attempts to replace historical truth with "unifying and constructive descriptions" are an insult to Black and Indigenous Americans and a disservice to all. The article suggests that such actions aim to whitewash America's past, preventing a clear understanding of present-day inequities. It warns against the danger of erasing history and the potential for repeating past brutalities if the truth is suppressed.</p>

          <p>The FBI has raided the Maryland home and office of former National Security Adviser John Bolton as part of an investigation into the mishandling or sharing of classified material. This development follows intelligence collected overseas by the CIA, according to reports. The article highlights Bolton's widespread unpopularity, noting President Trump's strong dislike and past criticisms from Democrats. Despite his meticulous nature, Bolton's memory is reportedly "brimming with so many secrets" that even a cautious person could err. The raid underscores the ongoing scrutiny of classified document handling among former officials.</p>

          <p>California and Texas, the two most populous U.S. states, are at the forefront of a fierce political battle over congressional redistricting, poised to significantly impact the balance of power in Washington D.C. Texas Republicans redrew maps to create five new seats favoring their party, prompting California Democrats to retaliate by voting to redraw their own districts to boost Democratic representation by five seats. This "political arms race" highlights the contentious practice of gerrymandering, where electoral boundaries are manipulated for partisan advantage. The article explains how this mid-decade redistricting could shape the 2026 midterm elections and is spreading to other states.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is signaling a readiness to cut interest rates, yet Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned that the "neutral" rate may settle higher than in the 2010s, suggesting a less stable long-term economic outlook. While Wall Street cheered the prospect of rate cuts, the article notes that higher rates will continue to make borrowing expensive, impacting housing affordability. Trump's tariffs have begun pushing up prices, complicating the Fed's efforts to balance inflation and employment. The article suggests Powell's cautious remarks indicate that the Fed can only do so much to mitigate economic instability caused by executive policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The North Carolina Supreme Court issued favorable rulings, allowing lawsuits filed by bars seeking monetary compensation for COVID-19 restrictions to continue.

The court's majority rejected arguments to halt the litigation, affirming that plaintiffs could present evidence regarding claims that their constitutional right to earn a living was violated. This decision opens the door for bars to seek damages and highlights ongoing legal challenges stemming from pandemic-era government mandates.</p>
