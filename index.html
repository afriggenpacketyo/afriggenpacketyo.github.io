          <p>Speaker Mike Johnson is working to sway Republican holdouts on the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' which encompasses President Trump's legislative agenda. The bill includes key components related to Medicaid and tax reform, including state and local tax (SALT) deductions. Johnson aims to reach a consensus on SALT caps, which have become a major sticking point. He expressed optimism about passing the bill next week, emphasizing the goal of deficit neutrality. The Republican majority can only afford to lose three votes, making Johnson's task of unifying the conference a crucial test of his speakership.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding President Trump's executive order aiming to limit birthright citizenship to children born on U.S. soil to lawful permanent residents. The justices debated the legality of nationwide injunctions blocking the order, with Solicitor General D. John Sauer arguing against their use, claiming they create an unfair legal playing field. Justice Sotomayor challenged the order's constitutionality, citing Supreme Court precedents. The court also considered whether limiting nationwide injunctions would create chaos by requiring individual lawsuits across the country, with a decision expected by early summer. This case revisits the interpretation of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause and its application to children of undocumented immigrants.</p>

Nuclear energy currently accounts for around 40% of Belgium's power generation, and this move aligns with other European countries considering a shift in nuclear policy.</p>

          <p>President Trump's acceptance of a $400 million jet from Qatar has sparked controversy, highlighting concerns about foreign influence. The article argues that this is an extreme example of a broader issue, as Qatar has also funded American universities, think tanks, and politicians across the political spectrum. While not all exchanges are as blatant, they represent a subtle form of influence peddling. The article contrasts Qatar's influence operations with those of pro-Israel activists, emphasizing that the latter are primarily driven by American citizens rather than a foreign state.</p>

          <p>Glen Rogers, a suspected serial killer once scrutinized in the OJ Simpson case, was executed in Florida for the 1995 murder of Tina Marie Cribbs. The U.S. Supreme Court denied Rogers' final appeals. Rogers had also received a separate death sentence in California for another murder. The documentary "My Brother the Serial Killer" raised questions about Rogers' possible involvement in the Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman murders, though police dismissed the theory.</p>
