          <p>Senior Pentagon officials have disclosed details of Operation Midnight Hammer, a U.S. mission to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran. According to Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, the operation involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers that flew from Missouri to Iran, requiring multiple in-flight refuelings and coordination with U.S. fighter jets and support aircraft. The strikes targeted nuclear sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan, utilizing Tomahawk cruise missiles and GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs). Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth lauded the attack as an "incredible and overwhelming success," emphasizing that it did not target Iranian troops or the Iranian people, but rather Iran's nuclear program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The shooting of an Indiana kidney doctor has drawn parallels to the UnitedHealthcare murder case, raising concerns about vigilante violence and systemic issues within the healthcare system. Prosecutor Terry Modesitt condemned the shooting as abhorrent, emphasizing that violence is never justified as a response to grievances. Tom Mueller, author of "How to Make a Killing," noted the incident highlights long-standing dismay about shortcomings in America's healthcare system, including the rise of for-profit dialysis clinics and their impact on patient care. Mueller had corresponded with the alleged shooter prior to the incident, but said there was no indication that he was spiraling towards violence.</p>

          <p>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated that Tehran reserves all options to defend itself after the U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities, describing the attacks as "outrageous." Iran also launched its 20th wave of missile and drone strikes against Israeli military targets. The Israel Defense Forces reported sirens blaring due to further Iranian offensives and said it had begun its own missile offensives in western Iran. Araghchi accused the U.S. and Israel of destroying recent diplomatic efforts. President Trump claimed the strikes had "completely obliterated" Iran's key enrichment facilities, a claim that could not be independently confirmed.</p>

          <p>The article argues that Donald Trump's actions against Black cultural institutions stem from a fear of Black culture's power to challenge white supremacy, rather than simply an opposition to diversity initiatives. It draws parallels between Trump's efforts to control cultural institutions and historical attempts to suppress Black cultural expression, highlighting the Black Arts Movement's role in challenging white cultural hegemony. The author contends that Trump's attacks on institutions like the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture are aimed at dismantling the infrastructure that supports Black cultural and intellectual production, which poses a threat to his vision of white dominance.</p>

This move places South Korea alongside countries like China and the United States, which are also developing next-generation fighter aircraft. KAI's display at the air show included the KF-21 Boramae fighter jet, FA-50 light combat aircraft, and next-generation unmanned combat aircraft, suggesting a focus on crewed-uncrewed teaming.</p>

          <p>The United States has entered the conflict between Israel and Iran, launching strikes on three nuclear sites in Iran. President Trump described the operation as "very successful," with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claiming the Iranian nuclear program was "devastated." The strikes involved B-2 bombers dropping "bunker-buster" bombs and a submarine launching Tomahawk missiles. Trump warned Iran to "make peace" or face further attacks.
