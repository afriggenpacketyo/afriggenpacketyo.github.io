          <p>The Senate has moved forward with the GENIUS Act, a bill designed to regulate stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The bill mandates that stablecoin issuers maintain reserves and prioritize repayment to coin holders in case of bankruptcy, while also adhering to anti-money laundering rules. Supporters claim the act will protect consumers and foster innovation, but critics, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, argue that it's a weak regulatory framework that fails to address conflicts of interest, particularly those exemplified by Trump's cryptocurrency ventures. The bill includes a provision prohibiting members of Congress from issuing stablecoins during their public service. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New Jersey Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver has been charged with felony assault for allegedly assaulting a federal law enforcement officer during a protest outside a Newark ICE detention center. The charges stem from an incident where McIver and others attempted to block the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. McIver denies the allegations, calling them "purely political" and a mischaracterization of the events, while her attorney claims ICE agents escalated the situation. The Justice Department's announcement of the charges prior to them being unsealed has also raised eyebrows.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has launched an investigation into Chicago's hiring practices after Mayor Brandon Johnson touted the diversity of his administration, emphasizing the number of Black officials appointed. The DOJ's probe is based on suggestions that hiring decisions were made solely on the basis of race, potentially violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Johnson's comments, made at a church, highlighted that his administration is the most diverse in Chicago's history, with a significant percentage of Black employees. The investigation comes amid a broader crackdown by the Trump administration on DEI practices.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has confirmed that Tesla will launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, by the end of June, with plans to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The service will initially start with about 10 Model Y vehicles equipped with FSD Unsupervised, and will be geofenced to limit their driving areas. Tesla employees will remotely monitor the fleet, with Musk promising no human safety drivers will be present in the vehicles. This move puts Tesla in direct competition with Alphabet's Waymo, which already operates commercial, driverless ride-hailing services in several U.S. markets.</p>

          <p>The European Union has approved a new set of sanctions on Russia, targeting covert oil exports and individuals. The EU has already imposed extensive sanctions on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The latest measures target 189 ships in Russia's shadow fleet, bringing the total to 342. These measures add to a wide-ranging set of measures that the European Union has patched together since 2022, hoping to squeeze the Russian economy harder with each package. Discussions are underway for an 18th package, potentially targeting gas pipelines and banks. The move comes as questions mount about the U.S. approach to future sanctions.</p>

          <p>Joel Le Scouarnec, a former surgeon on trial in France for sexually abusing hundreds of patients, mostly children, said he considers himself "responsible" for the deaths of two of his victims. He admitted to sexually abusing all 299 victims, many while they were under anaesthesia or waking up after operations, between 1989 and 2014. Le Scouarnec, 74, was being questioned in court in Vannes, Brittany, during the penultimate week of a long and gruelling trial which began in late February. Victims' lawyers and child protection advocacy groups have said "institutional failings" allowed the surgeon to continue working with children even after an FBI alert.</p>

          <p>Despite gold's recent price surge, safe investment strategies remain crucial. Investors should limit gold holdings to a maximum of 10% of their portfolio, avoid riskier investment types like gold mining stocks, and monitor the economic climate for selling opportunities. Traditional advice of limiting gold investment is still applicable, even with all of the changes in the gold market. Monitoring the economic climate is critical to ensure that gold maintains its ability as a hedge against inflation and a reliable diversification tool. (not investment advice)</p>
