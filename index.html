          <p>A mass shooting incident in Philadelphia's Grays Ferry neighborhood resulted in three fatalities and nine injuries early Monday morning. Police reported that victims, including two juveniles expected to survive, were transported to various hospitals. The incident occurred on a block where officers had responded to prior disturbances over the weekend, with police hearing gunfire while attending a nearby call. Authorities believe approximately 40 individuals were present, and dozens of shell casings were recovered, indicating a potential exchange of gunfire during a violent Fourth of July weekend in the city.</p>

          <p>Engineering students at Johns Hopkins University have innovated a specialized printer capable of adding Braille to beer labels for a Maryland brewery. This invention, requested by Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), addresses the challenge of accommodating plastic beer labels, which commercial Braille printers cannot typically handle. The students designed the machine with open hardware and integrated software, making it user-friendly for employees with low or no vision. This initiative supports BISM, the largest employer of blind and low-vision workers in Maryland, and benefits Checkerspot Brewing Company's annual fundraiser for vision loss.</p>

          <p>Former US President Donald Trump has declared that countries supporting "Anti-American policies" of the BRICS alliance will face an additional 10% tariff, with no exceptions. This threat follows his long-standing criticism of the bloc, which includes China, Russia, and India. The new tariffs are expected to take effect on August 1, despite an earlier July 9 deadline, causing confusion and prompting intensive trade negotiations with partners like the European Union. Trump's administration asserts these tariffs aim to boost American manufacturing and protect jobs, while BRICS nations have criticized such unilateral measures as threats to the global economy.</p>

          <p>Doris Garcia, a 96-year-old from Boulder, Colorado, fulfilled a lifelong dream of meeting penguins, 70 years after being denied a research trip to Antarctica solely because she was a woman. While working for the U.S. government in Argentina in the 1950s, Garcia was fully prepared for the expedition but was turned away at the last moment due to her gender. The Denver Zoo Conservation Alliance, in collaboration with Compassionate Hospice, arranged a special behind-the-scenes encounter with African penguins, bringing immense joy to Garcia and her family. This heartwarming event highlighted a past injustice while celebrating a dream realized in her later years.</p>

          <p>Communication experts emphasize that an apology offers a critical opportunity for leaders to foster positive change and build trust, particularly after missteps. Effective apologies require taking full responsibility, demonstrating understanding of what went wrong, and outlining a clear path forward to prevent recurrence. Timing is paramount, as waiting too long can signal indifference, while speaking too quickly without a plan can erode credibility. Genuine empathy and a human touch are crucial, as disingenuous or emotionless statements can undermine trust and harm company morale.

          <p>Apple is appealing a €500 million fine imposed by EU regulators, who accused the tech giant of anti-competitive behavior on its App Store by restricting developers from informing customers about alternative purchasing options. Apple described the fine as "unprecedented" and argued that the EU's demands for further concessions are confusing for developers and detrimental to users. The company contends it is being "unfairly targeted" and forced to give away its technology for free. This appeal escalates the ongoing scrutiny of large US tech firms by the EU under its Digital Markets Act.</p>

          <p>The jury has retired to consider verdicts in the retrial of Constance Marten and Mark Gordon, who face charges of manslaughter by gross negligence and causing or allowing the death of their newborn daughter, Victoria. The couple became subjects of a police manhunt after evidence of a recent birth was found in a burnt-out car. Victoria's body was later discovered in a shopping bag in a shed, having died in a tent during cold conditions. The defense claimed the prosecution fabricated details, while Marten asserted her love for her baby and efforts to protect her, with the previous trial resulting in convictions for concealing birth and perverting justice.</p>

          <p>An autopsy report revealed that 26-year-old Brazilian tourist Juliana Marins died within 20 minutes from internal bleeding and bone fractures after falling into Mount Rinjani, an active Indonesian volcano.

          <p>Critics are condemning Donald Trump's new migrant detention facility in the Florida Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," as a symbol of ongoing cruelty towards undocumented immigrants. The facility's harsh conditions, including extreme heat and hurricane vulnerability, are highlighted, alongside the controversial sale of related merchandise by the Florida Republican party. Opponents, including human rights and environmental groups, view the project as a "sick game" that prioritizes political spectacle over human welfare and threatens the delicate wetlands.

          <p>A new critique argues that the proposed nationwide Medicaid work requirement, part of President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," will not strengthen the program but rather impose significant burdens and cause millions to lose health coverage. While proponents claim it prevents abuse, data suggests most Medicaid recipients are already working or have valid reasons for not doing so. The requirement is described as a costly "work-reporting" burden, creating complex bureaucratic systems that disproportionately affect vulnerable individuals. This policy is predicted to lead to unnecessary disenrollments and potentially preventable deaths due to lack of access to care.</p>
