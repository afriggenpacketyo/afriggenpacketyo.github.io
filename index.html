          <p>A mobile prison is visiting schools in the U.K. to educate students about the realities of life behind bars and the consequences of crime. The interactive experience, which includes scanned, photographed, and fingerprinted students dressed in inmate attire, aims to deter them from engaging in criminal behavior. Students are taken into replica cells complete with stainless-steel toilets to make the experience as realistic as possible, sparking tough conversations about drugs, alcohol, and violence. Organizers emphasize that this project is not a scare tactic, but rather an informational initiative to help young people make informed choices and understand their responsibilities, especially since children as young as 10 can be arrested in the U.K.</p>

          <p>Charles Rangel, a former New York representative and a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, has died at the age of 94.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spain has called for a European arms embargo on Israel amidst escalating violence in Gaza, but the impact hinges on actions from major weapons exporters. While Israel is a significant arms exporter itself, it relies heavily on imports from the United States, Germany, and Italy. The United States is by far the largest supplier, providing about two-thirds of Israel's arms imports, including aircraft, armored vehicles, and guided bombs. Germany accounts for approximately a third of Israel's arms, primarily naval capabilities, while Italy contributes a smaller percentage. Some EU nations have already reduced or suspended arms exports to Israel, but a significant shift would require the involvement of the U.S. and Germany.</p>

Despite an ethics investigation that led to his censure in 2010, Rangel remained a respected figure, known for his gregarious political agility and his impishness, and was instrumental in persuading Hillary Clinton to run for the Senate from New York in 2000.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has resumed its sporadic eruption, sending lava hundreds of feet into the air and releasing plumes of ash and volcanic material. The activity, which lasted for several hours, featured lava fountains reaching heights of over 1,000 feet from the mountain's north vent. An eruptive plume containing ash, volcanic rock, and Pele's hair was also released, posing a potential hazard to residents and visitors in the area. Kilauea, one of Hawaii's most active volcanoes, has been emitting lava fountains frequently since December 2024, drawing tourists to witness the spectacle, and the USGS also offers multiple YouTube livestreams of the volcanic activity.</p>

Lauren Bell's game-changing wicket of Matthews, who scored 71 from 54 balls, contributed to England's victory, while Heather Knight's unbeaten 66 from 47 balls helped England post a competitive total, and Knight suffered a hamstring problem during her knock.</p>

          <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla have arrived in Canada for a two-day visit, interpreted as a show of support for the country amidst ongoing tensions with the U.S. and President Donald Trump. Prime Minister Mark Carney, who campaigned on an anti-Trump platform, welcomed the royal couple in Ottawa. The King's visit will culminate in a "Speech from the Throne" to Canada's Parliament, the first by a monarch in nearly 50 years, expected to affirm Canada's sovereignty and reject Trump's suggestions of a U.S. takeover. This visit is viewed as a diplomatic balancing act, as King Charles also maintains relations with the U.S. as head of state of the UK.</p>

The museum's collection will include items amassed by Lucas over the years, including Hollywood memorabilia, book and magazine illustrations, comic books, and Norman Rockwell paintings, but the museum needs to better define its mission, given the wide scope of narrative art.</p>

While data suggests it is more transmissible, it does not appear to cause more severe illness, according to experts. However, the Trump administration plans to limit booster vaccine access, requiring major clinical trials before approving them for wider use, which could delay access for lower-risk groups. Experts recommend prevention strategies such as good hygiene and mask-wearing, while authorities in Hong Kong urge residents to mask in public transportation due to rising cases, and the new COVID-19 vaccination framework was laid out by the FDA's new leadership under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</p>

Trump's comment came after Russia's largest aerial assault on Ukraine since the start of the conflict, and Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, linked the remark to the emotional strain of the situation. Meanwhile, Germany's chancellor, Friedrich Merz, stated that Ukraine's allies had removed range limits on supplied arms, amid reports that Berlin might provide Kyiv with Taurus missiles, while the Ukrainian air force said it was the largest attack yet conducted with drones alone.</p>

The delay follows a conversation between Trump and Ursula von der Leyen, who agreed to expedite trade negotiations. While Emmanuel Macron expressed hope for minimal tariffs, Giorgia Meloni is reportedly seeking a meeting between Trump and European leaders. The EU's offer to eliminate tariffs on cars and industrial goods remains on the table, but Trump's on-again, off-again tariff threats have created uncertainty for businesses.

          <p>The remains of four U.S. airmen killed in the 1944 crash of the B-24 bomber "Heaven Can Wait" off New Guinea are being returned to their hometowns for burial. This follows a 12-year investigation by family members and a recovery mission by Navy divers, and the remains of Staff Sgt. Eugene Darrigan and 2nd Lt. Thomas Kelly have been identified and interred with military honors. The plane was shot down during a bombing mission, and the recovery efforts involved analyzing historical documents and underwater searches to locate the wreckage, with seven men who were on the plane still unaccounted for.</p>

He also criticized "unchecked" migration and earlier wished a "happy Memorial Day" to those he deemed "scum," drawing criticism for the tone and focus of his address during a solemn occasion.</p>

          <p>Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukrainian cities as the United States reduces its involvement in the conflict, and at least 355 Russian drones swarmed the skies across Ukraine before dawn on Monday. The campaign comes a week after President Trump spoke to President Putin by telephone and appeared ready to abandon his efforts to secure a cease-fire. The United States is slowly starving Ukraine of vital aid, which is very much understood and acted on by the Russians, according to analysts. Mr. Trump's comments on Russia's prosecution of the war constituted a sharp rebuke of Mr. Putin, but he has not approved a single new military assistance package for Ukraine.</p>

Experts say Trump's signals of pulling back from the conflict, followed by shock at Putin's demands and attacks, create a strategic void, and while Trump has said he is "absolutely" considering sanctions, he has pulled back when forced to make a decision.</p>
