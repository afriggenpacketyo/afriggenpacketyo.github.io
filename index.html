          <p>A private survey indicates that China's manufacturing activity experienced its most significant contraction since September 2022 in May, primarily due to the impact of U.S. tariffs and a decline in new export orders. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index fell below 50, signaling contraction, for the first time since September of the previous year, with the job market also showing signs of strain as employment shrank for the second consecutive month. Economists suggest that increasing uncertainty in the external trade environment is exacerbating domestic economic challenges, contributing to a weakening of major macroeconomic indicators at the start of the second quarter.

          <p>The Justice Department is escalating its efforts to prevent transgender athletes from participating in school sports in California, issuing warnings to school districts that non-compliance with barring transgender athletes could result in legal repercussions. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon argues that allowing transgender athletes to compete violates the U.S. Constitution by depriving girls of athletic opportunities based solely on their biological sex. California officials have expressed concerns over the Trump Administration's actions and remain committed to defending laws ensuring students' rights to be free from discrimination, while LGBTQ+ advocates decry the move as targeting transgender youth for political gain. The Justice Department's actions follow a controversial win by a transgender athlete in the state's track and field championships.</p>

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson suggested the comment was a joke, while others felt it reflected poorly on the agency's leadership amid ongoing internal challenges.

          <p>President Trump is actively pressuring Senate Republicans to finalize a major tax bill, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which encompasses a significant portion of their legislative agenda. The White House plans an "all-out advocacy effort" involving high-ranking officials lobbying senators, with potential travel to states if necessary. Key sticking points include concerns about the bill's cost and potential cuts to Medicaid, while Trump insists that only waste, fraud, and abuse will be reduced. The Senate must navigate the Byrd rule, which requires legislation to be directly related to deficit reduction, potentially necessitating changes that the House may need to accept.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is promoting his "Big, Beautiful Bill" as a means to reverse what he describes as "four disastrous years" under former President Joe Biden. The bill, already passed by the House, aims to balance the budget through spending cuts and tax cuts, while also expediting energy permitting, refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and upgrading the air traffic control system. Trump asserts the bill will secure the border, deport criminal immigrants, and repeal Biden's EV mandate, but the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget estimates it would add roughly $3 trillion to the national debt.
