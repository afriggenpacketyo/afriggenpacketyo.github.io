          <p>According to a source familiar with a House Oversight Committee interview, Hunter Biden was involved in discussions regarding pardons near the end of his father's presidential term. The information emerged from a closed-door testimony by former White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients as part of a broader Republican-led investigation into former President Joe Biden's administration. The extent of Hunter Biden's influence in these meetings, which included discussions about his own controversial pardon, remains unclear.</p>

          <p>Legendary late-night host David Letterman has sharply criticized ABC's decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel's show, calling the move "ridiculous" and a form of "managed media." Speaking at The Atlantic Festival, Letterman argued that media corporations should not capitulate to pressure from what he described as an "authoritarian criminal administration." He expressed concern that such actions are part of a dangerous trend aimed at silencing dissent and represent an inexcusable manipulation of the media landscape.</p>

          <p>A major earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 has struck in the Pacific Ocean near the coast of Russia's remote Kamchatka region. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake occurred at a relatively shallow depth, prompting a brief tsunami threat for the area which was later lifted. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or casualties from the powerful tremor, which was followed by a series of smaller aftershocks.</p>

          <p>The House Foreign Affairs Committee has unanimously passed a bipartisan amendment requiring greater congressional oversight of the Trump administration's efforts to combat human trafficking. The measure directs the State Department to report on the impact of recent staff reductions and reorganization within its anti-trafficking office. This action follows reports that the administration had significantly scaled back its initiatives and delayed a legally mandated annual report on global human trafficking.</p>

          <p>During a state visit to the United Kingdom, President Donald Trump advised Prime Minister Keir Starmer to "call out the military" to control the country's borders and stop illegal migration. At a joint press conference, Trump drew parallels between the UK's situation with small boat crossings and the US southern border, advocating for tough measures. The comments were part of a visit that also included a £150bn US investment promise and discussions on topics like Palestinian statehood and the war in Ukraine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>First Amendment experts are raising concerns that the suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" may represent an illegal form of government pressure known as "jawboning." The controversy stems from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr's public statements urging action against the show, which were quickly followed by ABC pulling the program. Legal scholars suggest the direct line between the regulator's threat and the network's action creates a strong case for unconstitutional censorship by proxy, setting a potentially dangerous precedent for media independence.</p>

          <p>A new Los Angeles County policy is facing backlash from oversight officials and civil rights advocates who claim it is an attempt to muzzle criticism. The rule requires county commissions, including those that monitor the Sheriff's Department and jails, to get prior approval from a central office before releasing press statements or contacting other officials. Critics argue this improperly limits the independence of these watchdog bodies and could chill their ability to report on issues like jail conditions and deputy misconduct.</p>

          <p>President Trump's economic strategy in his second term represents a significant departure from traditional Republican free-market principles, embracing a more interventionist "state capitalism" approach. Policies now include not just tax cuts and deregulation but also protectionist tariffs and direct government equity stakes in major corporations like Intel. This transactional, "America First" doctrine prioritizes ad hoc deals over predictable rules, creating market uncertainty and fundamentally reshaping the GOP's economic playbook.</p>
