          <p>A suspect has been arrested in the murders of “American Idol” music supervisor Robin Kaye and her husband, Thomas Deluca, who were found shot to death in their Los Angeles home. Police believe the couple was killed on July 10 after returning home to find the suspect, who had scaled a fence, inside their property. The arrest followed a welfare check requested by a friend, where officers discovered the victims. The motive for the violent attack remains unclear, and an investigation into the initial police response to a burglary call is underway.</p>

          <p>Basketball Hall of Famer Charles Barkley has labeled most current NBA coaches as "cowards," arguing they are afraid to properly coach and discipline highly-paid players. Speaking on "The Dan Patrick Show," Barkley claimed that players now run the teams, and coaches, fearing for their jobs, have lost control, which he believes ultimately ruins player development. He contrasted this with his own experience under coaches like Pat Riley and Billy Cunningham, who he says held players accountable. Barkley asserted that bad coaching has ruined more players than any other factor in the league.</p>

          <p>The Senate is proceeding with a White House request to cancel $9 billion in previously approved funding, primarily targeting foreign aid programs and federal support for NPR and PBS. The rescissions package, which must pass by a Friday deadline to take effect, is facing internal Republican division and unified Democratic opposition. Some GOP senators have raised concerns about cuts to global health initiatives like PEPFAR, forcing the administration to offer amendments. The move has been criticized by Democrats as an affront to the bipartisan appropriations process. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Leaders from UC Berkeley, Georgetown, and CUNY faced a contentious House committee hearing, where they defended their commitment to free speech while detailing actions taken to combat antisemitism on campus. The university chancellors pushed back against Republican suggestions that pro-Palestinian speech is inherently antisemitic and highlighted their efforts to protect students from harassment. Democrats on the committee criticized the hearing as "political theater" and a partisan attack on higher education, while Republicans questioned the universities' faculty hiring practices and response to protests.</p>

          <p>It has been revealed that the UK government secretly operated a £400 million scheme to relocate 4,500 Afghans after their personal details were inadvertently leaked by a Ministry of Defence official. The data breach, which occurred in 2022, compromised the information of nearly 19,000 people who had applied for UK resettlement, placing them at risk from the Taliban. The existence of both the leak and the subsequent relocation program was concealed from the public by a super-injunction, which a High Court judge has now lifted, prompting a formal apology from the Defence Secretary.</p>

The first, a bold all-gold "Charger Power" look, has drawn mixed reactions, with online comparisons ranging from mustard bottles to the Minions. The second is a navy blue "Super Chargers" uniform, designed as a modern throwback to the team's look from the 1990s and early 2000s, an era that included their only Super Bowl appearance.

          <p>The world-famous Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set to undergo a massive £50 million renovation, necessitating a five-year closure starting in 2027. The ambitious project will involve replacing 16,000 panes of glass, repairing the 175-year-old iron framework, and carefully relocating over 1,300 tropical plants. A primary goal of the extensive makeover is to upgrade the building's systems to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, ensuring the landmark's sustainability for the future.</p>

          <p>The UK's advertising watchdog has banned an advertisement for Trip drinks after finding it made unauthorized health claims. The company marketed its beverage by suggesting it could "help you feel calm" and reduce stress and anxiety, claims the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) found were not permitted on the official register for food and supplement marketing. The ASA ruled that the ad, which also made inaccurate claims about its sugar content, breached advertising codes and must not appear again in its current form.</p>

          <p>Julian Smith, a former Conservative chief whip and Northern Ireland Secretary, has sharply criticized former Prime Minister David Cameron's handling of the 2016 Brexit referendum. Smith accused Cameron of being "extremely cavalier" and treating the vote like "some sort of Eton game." He argued that it was "unforgivable" to present such a fundamental question to the public without a clear, detailed plan for how either outcome, particularly concerning the Irish border, would be managed.</p>

The case revisits a pivotal and polarizing moment in the nation's history, examining whether Kim was a power-hungry killer or a patriot who acted to prevent greater bloodshed. The retrial was granted after Kim's family argued his original conviction in a military court was unjust, citing evidence that his confession was obtained through torture.</p>

          <p>President Trump has accused Senator Adam Schiff, a prominent political adversary, of committing mortgage fraud by misrepresenting his primary residence to lenders. Schiff immediately dismissed the accusation as a "baseless attempt at political retribution" and an effort to distract from other issues. A spokesperson for the senator clarified that Schiff's lenders were always aware he maintained homes in both California and the D.C. area, a common practice for members of Congress from far-flung states.</p>
