          <p>Members of the Texas National Guard have arrived at an Army Reserve Training Center near Chicago, a deployment authorized by Governor Greg Abbott at the request of the Trump administration. The move has drawn sharp criticism from Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who have labeled it an authoritarian overreach and an intentional act to foment chaos. Governor Abbott defended the decision as necessary to ensure the safety of federal officials, escalating the political tensions between state and federal authorities over the use of military personnel in American cities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal prosecutors investigating former FBI Director James Comey have concluded that their case is significantly undermined by a central witness, according to sources familiar with the matter. The witness, law professor Daniel Richman, reportedly told investigators that Comey never authorized him to leak information to the press anonymously, directly contradicting the core of the indictment. This development, detailed in an internal memo, suggests prosecutors face "insurmountable problems" in proving Comey knowingly made false statements to Congress, casting serious doubt on the viability of the politically charged prosecution.</p>

As the tenth named storm of the season, Jerry is currently located far from the U.S. mainland but is moving west-northwest towards the northern Leeward Islands. A tropical storm watch has been issued for several Caribbean islands, which are expected to experience heavy rainfall, potential flash flooding, and life-threatening surf conditions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing government shutdown is creating far-reaching negative consequences for the commercial real estate market, extending beyond the immediate impact on residential sales. The halt in the release of key economic data, such as employment and construction reports, injects uncertainty into financial markets, making it harder for investors to secure financing and complete deals. Sectors like retail and hospitality face immediate downturns due to reduced consumer spending from furloughed federal workers, while construction projects and federal property leases are also experiencing significant delays and disruptions.

          <p>Shares of major European car manufacturers, including BMW and Volkswagen, fell sharply after the European Commission announced plans to increase tariffs and reduce import quotas on steel. The proposed measures, intended to protect the EU's domestic steel industry, have sparked panic within the automotive sector, which fears inflationary pressures and higher production costs. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association argued that the proposal is excessive and will negatively impact an industry already facing numerous challenges, calling for a more balanced approach to trade protection.

          <p>James Comey, the former director of the FBI, is scheduled for a court arraignment in Virginia on felony charges of making false statements and obstructing a congressional investigation. The proceedings will see him formally enter a plea, with his defense team expected to argue that the prosecution is politically motivated by former President Trump. The case is being overseen by U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, a Trump appointee, in a district that has historically favored Democrats, setting the stage for a contentious legal and political battle.</p>

          <p>The UK's Director of Public Prosecutions has stated that a high-profile espionage case against two men accused of spying for China collapsed because the government failed to provide evidence officially designating China as a national security threat. This legal requirement, established by a precedent in another spying case, was necessary to proceed under the Official Secrets Act. The prosecutor's rare public explanation revealed that despite months of requests, witness statements from the government did not meet the new, higher evidentiary threshold, leading to the controversial dismissal of the charges.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that deploying the National Guard to cities like Chicago is not a sustainable solution but rather a clear signal of a broken public safety system. The author contends that years of political cuts, bureaucratic hiring processes, and a failure to modernize police recruitment have created critical staffing shortages that soldiers are ill-equipped to fill. Instead of relying on temporary military surges, the piece calls for fundamental reforms in how police departments hire and retain officers, warning that without them, cities will continue to see troops replacing community police officers.</p>

          <p>Overall mortgage application volume fell last week despite a slight dip in interest rates, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Within this sluggish market, a growing number of homebuyers and refinancers are opting for adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) to secure lower initial interest rates. The share of ARM applications increased as borrowers seek savings, even though these loans carry the risk of future rate hikes. This trend indicates that while high prices and economic uncertainty are deterring many potential buyers, those still in the market are increasingly willing to accept riskier loan structures.

          <p>An article from NPR's Planet Money team details why preordering a book is a crucial form of support for authors, using their own upcoming book as an example. Preorder numbers are a key metric for booksellers, influencing decisions on stocking levels, in-store placement, and online visibility. Furthermore, all preorders are counted as first-day sales, which significantly increases the chance of a book landing on a bestseller list and creating a snowball effect of further sales. This inside look reveals the powerful economic forces at play in the publishing industry before a book even hits the shelves.</p>

          <p>China has enacted a decree allowing it to impose retaliatory fees or restrictions on vessels from countries that limit its own ships, but the impact on U.S. operators is projected to be minimal. According to research firm Linerlytica, the U.S.-operated fleet in China is significantly smaller than the Chinese fleet exposed to potential U.S. fees, creating a major imbalance in leverage. While Chinese operators could face over $1 billion in U.S. fees, American companies would likely pay only a fraction of that if China were to impose similar measures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An attack by Myanmar's military has killed at least 24 people and wounded dozens more at a Buddhist festival in the central Sagaing region. According to reports, a motorized paraglider dropped two bombs on a crowd of approximately 100 people who had gathered for a peaceful protest against the ruling junta. This incident is part of what Amnesty International calls a "disturbing trend" of the military using paramotors for airstrikes as it continues its bloody campaign against armed resistance groups in the country's ongoing civil war.</p>

          <p>Germany's Finance Minister, Lars Klingbeil, has called for a "marathon of reforms" to address a significant budget shortfall of over €30 billion. He stated that the government must make cuts, including to welfare benefits, but insisted that any reforms must be fair and not disproportionately burden one segment of society. Klingbeil also indicated a push for higher taxes on top earners as part of a comprehensive package, arguing that a single "autumn of reforms" is not ambitious enough to tackle the country's long-term bureaucratic and financial challenges.

This legislative effort aims to alleviate one of the major financial strains on federal workers, who are being used as "bargaining chips" in the political stalemate, according to labor leaders who are demanding an end to the shutdown.</p>

Authored by Assemblymember Tina McKinnor, the bill reclassifies these appliances from "amenities" to necessities required for a unit to be considered habitable, similar to heating and running water. The law, which applies to new leases starting January 1, 2026, aims to ease the financial burden on renters, who will no longer have to purchase these costly appliances when moving into a new home.</p>

While the conservancy argues the removal is essential for ecological restoration, the plan is again facing opposition from some community members and L.A.
