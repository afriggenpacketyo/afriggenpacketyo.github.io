          <p>In an interview, Paula Kerger, the CEO of PBS, addresses the increasing threats to the public broadcaster's funding, including congressional pushback and executive orders. Kerger emphasizes PBS's mission, audience, and spending priorities, highlighting the importance of federal grants for local stations, particularly in rural areas. She also defends PBS against claims of bias, noting that a significant portion of their programming is for children and that they strive to present multiple viewpoints. Kerger expresses hope that the current challenges might lead to a broader conversation about the structure of federal funding for public broadcasters and the critical role PBS plays in education and emergency services.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are struggling to pass President Trump's domestic policy bill due to disagreements among conservative members and blue-state Republicans. The bill aims to extend tax cuts from Trump's first term while increasing spending on military and border security, offset by cuts to Medicaid and clean energy. Conservatives argue the bill doesn't cut enough spending, while blue-state Republicans demand a higher cap on state and local tax deductions. House leaders are working to negotiate a compromise to secure enough votes for the bill's passage before Memorial Day.</p>

          <p>Ofwat, the UK's water industry regulator, is considering blocking bonuses for Thames Water executives due to the company's poor environmental and financial management. New rules would prevent the company from using customer money, shareholder funds, or lender funds for bonuses. Thames Water, facing significant debt and struggling with leaks and sewage spills, argues that the payments are retention payments, not performance-related bonuses. The government aims to ban unfair bonuses for polluting water bosses, demanding improved performance from water companies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized former FBI director James Comey over an Instagram post that some interpreted as a threat. Comey's post, featuring seashells arranged as "8647," sparked allegations of calling for violence against Trump, leading to an investigation by the Secret Service. Comey stated that he did not intend any violence and was unaware of the violent interpretation. Trump dismissed Comey's explanation, claiming Comey knew exactly what the message meant, while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asserted the post called for Trump's assassination.</p>

          <p>India's decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, following a militant attack, raises concerns about water security in South Asia. The treaty, which has survived previous conflicts, is now "in abeyance," leading to fears that India may divert water from the Indus River system. Experts warn that this unilateral action could erode trust between neighboring countries and destabilize the region, especially given China's influence and investments in water infrastructure. The move could also impact India's relations with Bangladesh, with whom it shares the Ganges river basin.</p>

Trump's focus on deals with Saudi Arabia and potential direct talks with Iran contrasts with Netanyahu's hardline stance. While some believe Trump is laying the groundwork for regional changes, others suggest that Trump wants Israel to end the war in Gaza, which Netanyahu has not done.</p>

Despite low expectations, the meeting was viewed as a tactical win for Putin, who initiated the talks without agreeing to a cease-fire. While Trump initially supported the talks, he later undermined them by stating that meaningful progress would require a personal meeting between him and Putin.

The group also argues that the official unemployment rate understates economic distress, with a "functionally unemployed" rate topping 24% when factoring in poverty-wage workers and those unable to find full-time employment.</p>

The deduction would phase out for single filers with incomes over $75,000 and married couples with incomes over $150,000.

          <p>Three massive wildfires continue to burn in northeastern Minnesota, north of Duluth, with crews also battling fires in Canada's Manitoba and Ontario provinces. The fires have spread to cover about 32,000 acres. The Eastern Area Complex Incident Team is managing the Jenkins Creek and Camp House fires as the "Brimson Complex." The Camp House Road Fire has destroyed dozens of structures, while the Munger Shaw Fire has spread to at least 1,600 acres. Donations are being collected to support relief efforts for affected communities.</p>

This is the latest development in the ongoing legal battle between Epic Games and Apple.</p>

This action is aimed at fulfilling President Trump's directive to remove transgender service members.

The policy offers financial incentives to those who voluntarily leave by early June for active-duty and early July for national guard and reserve.</p>

The agency and Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) have been at odds over pay raises. The union, which represents about 460 engineers, says the competition pays more and the cost of living has gone up.</p>

          <p>The article explores the complexities and costs associated with producing a 100% "Made in the USA" vehicle, highlighting the reliance on global supply chains. While President Trump is pressuring automakers to build in the U.S., sourcing all parts domestically is not feasible due to cost and availability. Experts estimate that a 100% U.S.-made vehicle would be significantly more expensive, potentially pricing consumers out of the market. Sourcing certain materials and components, such as semiconductors and raw materials, would require substantial investment and time.</p>
