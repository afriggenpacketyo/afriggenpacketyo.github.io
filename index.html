        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a notable break from their party, two House Republicans, Thomas Massie and Brian Fitzpatrick, voted against President Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill. Massie cited the legislation's projected negative impact on the national debt and inflation as his primary reason for opposition. Fitzpatrick, who had supported an earlier version, changed his vote due to Senate amendments that he believed would harm Medicaid protections for his constituents in Pennsylvania. Their dissent highlights the internal fractures within the GOP despite the bill's eventual narrow passage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has strategically utilized the Supreme Court's emergency application process, or "shadow docket," to advance its policy agenda, achieving surprising success. By filing an unprecedented number of emergency requests, the administration has bypassed lower court injunctions on controversial policies, including the ban on transgender service members and the termination of certain federal grants. This approach allows for the rapid implementation of executive actions without waiting for lengthy appeals, securing temporary but significant victories for the administration's agenda.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has cleared the path for the Trump administration to deport a group of migrants with criminal records currently held at a U.S. naval base in Djibouti to South Sudan. This ruling overrides a lower court's order that had required additional processing and fear-based interviews before removal. The decision marks a significant win for the administration's mass deportation efforts, while dissenting justices expressed grave concerns about the safety and human rights of the individuals being sent to the violence-plagued nation.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative David Valadao of California's Central Valley is facing intense criticism after voting for President Trump's major policy bill, which includes substantial cuts to Medicaid. This program provides healthcare to approximately two-thirds of his constituents, making his vote politically perilous in a highly competitive district. Valadao defended his decision by pointing to negotiated concessions for his district, but Democrats have seized on the vote, accusing him of betraying his constituents and breaking his promises to protect their healthcare access.</p>

          <p>British tennis star Jack Draper attributed his surprising second-round Wimbledon loss to veteran Marin Cilic to his own performance rather than external pressure. As the highest-seeded British player, Draper insisted he simply wasn't good enough on the day and expressed disappointment with his game on grass this season. He candidly assessed his performance, noting that weaknesses in his forehand were exposed and that he needs to continue working on multiple areas of his game to compete at the highest level he aspires to.</p>

          <p>This opinion article challenges the common view of the Declaration of Independence as a purely individualistic document. The author argues that the American founding was, in many ways, a conservative effort to restore inherited traditions and rights. Furthermore, it posits that the declaration's central claim that "all men are created equal" is not a self-evident truth in a vacuum, but rather a concept deeply rooted in the West's biblical inheritance, specifically the idea that humanity is created in the image of God.</p>

          <p>The recently passed House domestic policy bill contains a new, temporary tax break specifically for senior citizens. The provision adds a $6,000 standard deduction for individuals aged 65 and older ($12,000 for couples), which will be in effect from 2025 through 2028. This benefit is designed to phase out for higher-income earners and will primarily assist upper-middle-class seniors. It is important to note this is a temporary income tax deduction and does not eliminate federal taxes on Social Security benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Britain's domestic intelligence agency, MI5, has been sharply criticized by a High Court in London for repeatedly misleading courts about an informant accused of violence against women.

The case involves a woman who alleged her former partner, an MI5 agent, abused her while claiming immunity, raising serious questions about the agency's accountability, oversight, and long-standing policy of secrecy.</p>

While a future Congress could choose to extend them, the temporary nature of these tax benefits adds a layer of uncertainty for taxpayers and the long-term budget outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a satirical column, the author humorously imagines the dismay of America's Founding Fathers as they witness the chaotic passage of a recent, massive spending bill. The piece uses a fictional dialogue between James Madison and Alexander Hamilton to contrast the founders' vision of a deliberate, thoughtful government with the modern reality of last-minute deals, record-long votes, and coercive presidential tactics. The article serves as a sharp critique of the current state of U.S. governance, suggesting the legislative branch has abdicated its coequal role.</p>
