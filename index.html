        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is advancing a plan to lower U.S. drug costs by linking them to prices in other developed countries, signing an executive order to that effect. Experts, however, doubt the plan's feasibility, citing potential legal challenges from drugmakers and the need for congressional approval. The order directs federal agencies to combat "unreasonable and discriminatory policies" in foreign countries, and seeks to allow U.S. patients to buy drugs directly from manufacturers at the "most favored nation" prices. Experts question whether other countries will voluntarily increase their prices or if drug companies will voluntarily lower theirs. </p>

          <p>The Trump administration has resumed collection efforts on defaulted federal student loans, prompting concerns among borrowers about wage garnishments and seizure of federal benefits. The Education Department plans to send notices to millions of defaulted borrowers this summer, with wage garnishments potentially starting as soon as June. Borrowers can challenge the wage garnishment if it results in financial hardship or if they've recently been unemployed or filed for bankruptcy. Experts advise borrowers to contact the government's Default Resolution Group to explore options for getting current on their loans, such as enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan or signing up for loan rehabilitation.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article explores the evolving meaning of "the closet" in queer culture, sparked by Paul Reubens' posthumous revelation about concealing his homosexuality for career reasons. The article traces the historical context of the closet from a place of shame and secrecy to a more complex space of negotiation and strategic concealment. It reflects on the pressures faced by gay artists and entertainers to remain closeted and the social impact of coming out in different eras. The article ultimately considers the resurgence of interest in closeted narratives, as well as the risks of silence in a world where LGBTQ+ rights are increasingly under threat.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Todd Blanche, his former defense lawyer, as the acting Librarian of Congress, raising concerns due to Blanche's lack of experience in libraries or archives. The appointment follows the firing of Carla Hayden, who was targeted by conservative groups for promoting "wokeness." The Library of Congress is a legislative branch agency, and it remains unclear how Congress will respond to the appointment. The acting assistant librarian is Brian Nieves, and the acting Register of Copyrights and Director of the Copyright Office is Paul Perkins.</p>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive tariff strategy with China has faced limitations, as demonstrated by the recent reduction in tariffs following trade talks in Geneva. The tariffs, which had risen to a minimum of 145 percent, disrupted global trade and caused pain for American businesses. The agreement to reduce tariffs to 30 percent on Chinese imports and 10 percent on American goods signals a U.S. retreat and raises questions about the effectiveness of Trump's approach. While the administration claims the agreement as a win, critics argue that it did not yield significant concessions from China beyond a commitment to continue negotiations.</p>

          <p>Hamas released Edan Alexander, a dual Israeli American national, following pressure from President Trump, in a deal that largely circumvented the Israeli government. Alexander's release is seen as an attempt by Hamas to secure U.S. support for a wider deal to end the war. Unlike most other hostages, Alexander was released without a formally announced cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. The release highlights the failure of efforts to secure a broader truce between the two sides, as Hamas still holds hostages and wants negotiations to end the war, while Israel wants to continue fighting.</p>

One refugee group, Episcopal Migration Ministries, declined to assist with the resettlement, citing its commitment to racial justice, while other groups indicated they are willing to work with the South Africans.

In cities like Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose, renters need to earn $100,000 or more to live comfortably.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent anticipates meeting with Chinese officials in the coming weeks to continue trade negotiations after the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day pause on most tariffs. The exact details of the meeting, such as location, have not been set, but there is now a "mechanism" for further talks. Bessent said there was a "very long and in-depth sidebar" regarding fentanyl between two officials at the meeting, indicating that the Chinese are now serious about assisting the U.S. in stopping the flow of precursor drugs.</p>

          <p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom is planning to make a significant push to address homeless encampments by releasing a model ordinance that cities can use as a basis for their own local bans. Newsom cited the Supreme Court ruling in favor of anti-camping ordinances and a 2024 executive order from his office as part of his call on cities to act. The effort is also being backed by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding. Newsom stated that "there's nothing compassionate about letting people die on the streets" and that "the time for inaction is over."</p>

The toy industry is heavily reliant on supply chains in China, leaving toy makers at the mercy of trade policy.

          <p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom is escalating the state's push to eradicate homeless encampments, urging cities, towns, and counties to ban tent camps on public property. The governor has created a template for a local ordinance that municipalities can adopt to outlaw encampments and clear existing ones. The move coincides with the release of over $3 billion in state-controlled housing funds that local officials can use to implement the ban. While the model ordinance does not specify criminal penalties, it outlaws homeless encampments on public property, making them a crime by definition.</p>
