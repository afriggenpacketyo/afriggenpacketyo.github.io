          <h2>Supreme Court Hears Arguments on Trump's Birthright Citizenship Order and Nationwide Injunctions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding President Trump's executive order aiming to limit birthright citizenship, focusing primarily on the legality of nationwide injunctions issued by lower courts. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that these injunctions unfairly hinder the government, while justices like Sonia Sotomayor questioned the order's constitutionality, citing previous Supreme Court precedents. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson raised concerns about the potential for a "Catch Me If You Can" system of justice if nationwide injunctions are limited. The court's decision could significantly impact the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches. </p>

While some question his qualifications, Smith's foray into politics reflects the blurring lines between news and entertainment, with Democrats seeking to connect with sports-minded voters through his platform.

The report's Minimal Quality of Life index reveals that the bottom 60% of U.S. households cannot achieve a minimal quality of life, with a significant gap between earnings and necessary expenses. The analysis also suggests that the official unemployment rate understates economic distress, with a functionally unemployed rate topping 24%.

          <p>Investing in gold should not be based on a specific cadence, but rather viewed as a small yet critical component of an overall portfolio. Gold should ideally make up no more than 10% of a portfolio and investors should get invested fairly quickly and frequently until they have the recommended threshold. Waiting to invest in gold is generally not advisable, as over time, the price only increases, accounting for minor drops. The timeline for investing in gold depends on specific needs and goals, both immediately and long-term. (not investment advice) </p>

The court ruled that assessing whether an officer acted reasonably requires considering all relevant circumstances, not just the "moment of threat." While the ruling favors broader scrutiny of police actions, a concurring opinion suggested that the officer in this specific case might still prevail under the revised standard. </p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is considering Donald Trump’s attempt to limit birthright citizenship, with the justices debating the power of lower court judges to block presidential orders nationwide. While the executive order aims to deny U.S. citizenship to babies born on American soil to parents who aren’t citizens or permanent residents, the court is primarily focused on the scope of judicial power. Justice Sotomayor stated Trump’s executive order violates four supreme court precedents, while D John Sauer, US solicitor general, said that Trump’s order was “protecting the meaning and value of American citizenship”. Critics warn that limiting judges’ power could force individuals to file thousands of lawsuits to protect their rights. </p>
