          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index surged to a new all-time high, largely driven by significant gains in the technology sector. Tech investment firm SoftBank Group saw its shares jump over 10% following reports of a major cloud-computing deal between OpenAI and Oracle, which also caused Oracle's stock to soar. The rally reflects broader positive sentiment in Asian markets, mirroring gains on Wall Street fueled by hopes for U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts and favorable inflation data. This performance highlights the interconnectedness of global tech investments and market movements. (not investment advice)</p>

The incident, which Utah's governor has termed a "political assassination," occurred when a single shot was fired from a distance, striking Kirk in the neck in front of a crowd of thousands. A manhunt for the suspected shooter is currently underway, with the FBI assisting state and local authorities in the investigation. The shooting has drawn widespread condemnation from political figures across the spectrum, including President Trump and former President Biden.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae-myung stated that companies will be very hesitant to invest in the United States following a major immigration raid at a Hyundai-affiliated battery plant in Georgia. The raid resulted in the detention of over 300 South Korean nationals who were working to set up the new facility, a common practice for such projects. This event has created significant bewilderment and concern in Seoul, threatening to chill business activities and strain the economic alliance between the two countries. The White House has defended the operation, emphasizing the need for foreign companies to hire American workers and respect immigration laws.</p>

          <p>Charlie Kirk, an influential 31-year-old conservative activist, was assassinated by a single gunshot to the neck while speaking to a crowd of approximately 3,000 people at Utah Valley University. Eyewitnesses report the shot was fired from a distance, possibly a nearby rooftop, as Kirk was addressing a question about gun violence. A massive manhunt for the shooter is ongoing, though two individuals initially detained were later released with no connection to the crime. The event has elicited shock and grief from across the political spectrum, with President Trump ordering flags to be flown at half-staff in Kirk's honor.</p>

          <p>Equity markets around the world are experiencing a significant rally, with major indices like the MSCI All Country World Index and the S&P 500 reaching new record highs. This surge in investor confidence is attributed to easing inflation pressures, resilient corporate earnings, and widespread expectations of interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Recent U.S. economic data, including a softer-than-expected Producer Price Index, has bolstered the case for policy easing.

          <p>The killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk has prompted a wave of bipartisan condemnation from prominent political figures. President Trump, who announced Kirk's death, mourned him as a legendary figure and blamed "radical left" rhetoric for the violence. Former presidents Joe Biden, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton all released statements decrying political violence and offering condolences. The incident sparked a brief, contentious scene on the House floor over a moment of silence, highlighting the nation's raw political tensions even amid shared grief over the tragic event.</p>

          <p>An opinion article in The Guardian posits that the relationship between the United States and Europe is undergoing a fundamental and likely permanent deterioration, rather than a temporary rupture caused by any single administration. The author contends that deep-seated security, demographic, and economic forces are driving the two continents apart, eroding the shared values that once defined their alliance. Even with a change in U.S. leadership, the transatlantic partnership is unlikely to return to its previous state of close kinship. Europe must therefore prepare for a more transactional and potentially less amicable future relationship with America.</p>

This intensified effort aims to secure critical mineral supply chains and reduce China's dependence on imports amid growing geopolitical tensions and high demand from its technology sector.

The gunman is believed to have fired a single shot from a campus building approximately 200 yards away from where Kirk was speaking.

          <p>The assassination of Charlie Kirk has sent shockwaves through Donald Trump's inner circle, where he was considered a close friend and a vital political ally. Kirk, through his organization Turning Point USA, was instrumental in mobilizing young voters for the MAGA movement and was a frequent, welcome presence at the White House and Mar-a-Lago. This article details his rise from a teenage activist to one of the most influential unelected figures in America, credited with remaking conservatism for a new generation.

This reunion is being viewed by royal correspondents as a small but potentially significant step toward healing the deep rift within the family. The meeting follows a recent shift in Prince Harry's public tone, where he expressed a desire for reconciliation. While details of their 50-minute conversation remain private, the fact that the meeting occurred without leaks suggests a new level of coordination and may signal a fragile opening for future dialogue.</p>

One witness standing near the front of the crowd at Utah Valley University said Kirk had just begun to address the topic when the shot rang out, causing blood to pour from his neck. The event, part of Kirk's "Prove Me Wrong" tour, had minimal security, with no metal detectors for the estimated 3,000 attendees.

          <p>A new analysis by real estate company Redfin suggests that San Francisco's housing costs, when adjusted for local income growth, have returned to a pre-pandemic "normal" baseline set in July 2018. The report indicates that while the city remains one of the nation's most expensive, the rapid price growth has cooled considerably, while wages in the tech-driven metro have grown faster than the national average. This has brought the mortgage payment-to-income ratio back to 2018 levels. However, economists caution this does not mean the city is affordable, and the trend does not reflect the reality for renters facing rising costs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's administration is appealing a federal judge's order that temporarily blocks him from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. The judge had ruled that Cook made a strong case that her removal would violate the Federal Reserve Act, which requires legal "cause" for such an action, and that maintaining the Fed's independence was in the public interest. Trump moved to fire Cook, the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor, based on allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. Her lawyers argue the firing is a pretext in a broader campaign to pressure the central bank on interest rates.</p>

          <h2>Experts Warn Kirk Assassination Could Ignite a 'Vicious Spiral' of Political Violence</h2>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk, experts on domestic terrorism are warning that the event could act as a flashpoint, inspiring further unrest in an already fractured nation. Researchers note that politically motivated attacks in the U.S. have nearly doubled in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year. They cite a convergence of factors, including economic insecurity, demographic anxiety, and inflammatory political discourse, for the surge. Experts fear the killing could trigger a "vicious spiral" of retaliatory violence, as people are often more willing to engage in violence as retribution than to initiate it.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating an incident at the Port of Long Beach where approximately 75 cargo containers fell from a vessel during offloading. The containers, filled with consumer goods, tumbled into the water and onto a smaller clean-air barge, causing damage and a light oil sheen from the barge's renewable diesel fuel. One worker on the barge suffered a sprained ankle while fleeing the falling containers, but no major injuries were reported. While port operations continue, a 500-yard safety zone has been established as recovery and cleanup efforts get underway.</p>

          <p>An estimated 250,000 residents in rural West Virginia lack access to reliable, treated drinking water, forcing many to depend on untreated sources like natural springs or abandoned coal mines. For decades, coal companies operated local water systems, but as the industry declined, the infrastructure crumbled, leaving communities to fend for themselves. In towns like Kimball and Rhodell, water treatment plants are now dilapidated and non-functional. The nonprofit DigDeep is working with local authorities to replace these failing systems, bringing the basic human right of clean tap water to communities that have been without it for years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior cancer specialists in England are warning that bureaucratic hurdles and funding application processes are creating a "postcode lottery" for patients seeking access to the latest treatments. The Royal College of Radiologists states that red tape is stifling innovation, making it difficult for some cancer centers to offer cutting-edge therapies like Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR). This results in an inequitable system where access depends on a patient's location and the resources of their local unit. The warning comes as the government prepares a new cancer strategy aimed at improving care and diagnosis times.</p>

          <p>In excerpts from her upcoming book, former Vice President Kamala Harris writes that Joe Biden's decision to seek re-election was a choice that should not have been left to an "individual's ego." She describes the decision-making process as reckless given the high stakes for the country. Harris also claims that she was in the worst position to advise him against running, as it would have appeared self-serving. The book is also critical of Biden's inner circle, alleging they often failed to defend her against unfair attacks and sometimes added "fuel to negative narratives" about her and her office.</p>

          <p>For a generation of students with no memory of September 11, 2001, educators across the country are finding new ways to convey the historical significance and emotional impact of the attacks. Teachers are participating in programs at the 9/11 Memorial & Museum in New York City to learn directly from first responders and survivors, bringing those firsthand accounts back to their classrooms. The goal is to help students understand the trauma their parents' generation experienced, the global war on terror that followed, and the powerful sense of national unity that emerged in the tragedy's aftermath.</p>

Nineteen of the injured are reported to be in serious condition with severe burns. Officials believe the explosion occurred after the truck, which was carrying nearly 50,000 liters of gas, tipped over.

          <p>China is adopting a distinct and pragmatic approach to artificial intelligence, focusing on practical, economy-wide integration rather than the massive, speculative investments seen in the U.S. While American firms chase human-level artificial general intelligence, Beijing has launched a national AI fund and is rolling out its "AI+" initiative to embed the technology in key sectors like industry and energy. This state-driven strategy leverages China's significant talent pool and financial resources to overcome hardware limitations, aiming to build a robust AI ecosystem even without access to the most advanced chips.

          <p>A new legislative proposal in California would require electric customers to contribute an additional $9 billion to the state's wildfire fund, which compensates victims of utility-caused fires. The deal, introduced as a last-minute amendment, would extend a monthly surcharge on customer bills for an additional ten years beyond 2035. The state's three large investor-owned utilities would also contribute another $9 billion from shareholders, for a total infusion of $18 billion. The move comes as officials warn the current fund could be depleted by damages from recent catastrophic fires.</p>

          <p>A surprise Israeli missile strike in Doha targeting senior Hamas officials has almost certainly ended the current U.S.-brokered peace negotiations, according to diplomatic sources. The attack, which occurred as Hamas leaders were considering a new proposal, has been fiercely condemned by Qatar, the key mediator. U.S. officials were reportedly furious, viewing the strike as a move that undermines regional stability and the chances of freeing remaining hostages. The timing of the operation has raised questions in Israel about Prime Minister Netanyahu's strategic goals, with some critics suggesting it was a political move that sabotaged a potential breakthrough.</p>
