          <p>Exit polls indicate that Portugal's center-right Democratic Alliance (AD) is poised to win the most votes in Sunday's election, but is unlikely to secure a full majority. The AD is projected to receive between 29% and 34% of the vote, falling short of the 42% needed for an outright majority, which would potentially extend Portugal's period of political instability. The election, triggered by a failed confidence vote in March, addresses pressing issues such as housing and immigration amidst a decade of fragile governments. The far-right Chega party is expected to perform well, while the AD leader has ruled out forming a coalition with them.</p>

          <p>Authorities have identified 25-year-old Guy Edward Bartkus as the primary suspect in the deadly car bombing outside a fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California. The FBI believes Bartkus, who is presumed dead at the scene, intentionally targeted the in vitro fertilization (IVF) facility and had nihilistic views, characterizing the event as an act of terrorism. Investigators are examining Bartkus's writings and social media posts, suspecting he attempted to livestream the bombing. The explosion caused extensive damage, injured four people, and prompted a large-scale investigation, though officials assure the public there is no ongoing threat.</p>

          <p>A series of severe storms, including tornadoes, swept through the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions, resulting in at least 27 fatalities, with Kentucky and Missouri being the hardest-hit areas.

In Kentucky, at least 18 people died, including a firefighter responding to the disaster, while Missouri reported seven deaths, with St. Louis experiencing significant damage to approximately 5,000 buildings.
