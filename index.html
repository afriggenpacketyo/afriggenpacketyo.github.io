          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has restored the voting privileges of Maine state Rep. Laurel Libby, a Republican, who was censured and barred from voting in the state House after she outed and deadnamed a transgender student athlete. The court granted her request for a preliminary injunction, restoring her vote while the lawsuit proceeds. Libby had posted a photo of a trans female athlete on Facebook and frequently denounced the presence of trans girls and women in female sports. The court's decision was split 7-2, with liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissenting. </p>
