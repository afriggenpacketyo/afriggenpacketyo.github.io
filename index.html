        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Block CEO and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has introduced Bitchat, a new peer-to-peer messaging application that functions without an internet connection. The app uses Bluetooth mesh networks to create local communication clusters, allowing for encrypted, ephemeral messages to be passed between nearby devices. This design ensures functionality even during internet outages or censorship, echoing Dorsey's focus on privacy and resilient communication. The beta version is currently available, with future plans to integrate WiFi Direct to enhance its range and speed, furthering the vision for off-grid, user-owned communication tools.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will levy a 25% blanket tariff on all goods imported from Japan and South Korea, effective August 1. The decision was revealed through letters sent to the leaders of both nations, which assert the tariffs are necessary to address persistent trade deficits. The move caused US financial markets to decline, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping over 400 points. The letters also warned against retaliatory tariffs, stating that any new duties imposed by Japan or South Korea on US goods would be added to the 25% rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Roman Starovoy, Russia's recently dismissed Minister of Transport, has died from a suspected suicide just hours after being fired by President Vladimir Putin. According to state media, Starovoy fatally shot himself in his car, with the primary hypothesis being suicide. His dismissal followed a weekend of major air traffic disruptions in Russia caused by Ukrainian drone attacks. Shortly after, another senior transport official also died suddenly of a reported cardiac arrest, adding to a series of unexplained deaths among high-profile Russian figures since the start of the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Widespread flooding from the remnants of Storm Chantal has prompted numerous water rescues across central North Carolina, particularly in Chapel Hill and Durham. The Chapel Hill Fire Department conducted over 50 rescues as floodwaters inundated apartments and businesses, displacing more than 60 people. Record-breaking crests were recorded on the Haw and Eno Rivers, leading to evacuations and significant property damage. While the storm has moved northeast, authorities are still assessing the damage and warning residents of continued danger from elevated and fast-moving rivers and creeks in the coming days.</p>

          <p>A new 50-foot-long mural in Brooklyn, titled the "Wall of Shame," documents the stories of over 1,500 individuals involved in the January 6 Capitol attack who were subsequently pardoned by President Donald Trump. Created by artist Phil Buehler, the public installation color-codes the pardoned individuals based on their actions, such as violence or property damage, aiming to create a visual reminder of the event. The project seeks to counter what the artist sees as an attempt to erase or rewrite the history of the insurrection. It serves as a form of artistic pushback against political narratives that downplay the severity of the attack.</p>

In contrast, the study found that carrying handguns on school property decreased by 60% during the same period, a trend researchers suggest may be linked to enhanced school safety measures. The authors emphasize the need for tailored prevention strategies, as firearms are now the leading cause of death for children and teens in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed microscopic robots capable of treating sinus infections by directly targeting and eliminating bacteria within the nasal cavity. These dust-sized robots, made of magnetic particles, are guided to the infection site where light activation triggers a chemical reaction that breaks through mucus and destroys pathogens. This targeted, drug-free approach could reduce side effects and combat the growing problem of antibiotic resistance. While animal trials have been successful, further research is needed to ensure safety and public acceptance before the technology can be widely adopted for human use.</p>

This follows a fourth-round match where the system was accidentally turned off for a crucial point, leading to a disputed call by the umpire. While the umpire was found to have followed existing protocols, the All England Club stated the error cannot be repeated and will consider implementing a video review system in the future.</p>

          <p>Health professionals are navigating a complex landscape as federal vaccine recommendations undergo significant changes, creating confusion for the public. The CDC, under a new administration, has shifted its stance on universal COVID vaccines for children to a "shared decision-making" model, which some doctors say sows doubt. Pediatricians report battling misinformation and find that building trust requires empathetic, one-on-one conversations to clarify facts and address patient concerns. Experts believe these frontline healthcare providers are key to overcoming the current turbulence and rebuilding public confidence in vaccinations.</p>

          <p>White House trade advisor Peter Navarro has criticized Apple CEO Tim Cook, arguing the company is not moving its manufacturing operations out of China quickly enough. Navarro described the situation as the "longest-running soap opera in Silicon Valley," referencing ongoing pressure from the Trump administration for Apple to shift production. President Trump has recently intensified these demands, warning of a 25% tariff on iPhones made outside the U.S. and discouraging production in India. Despite this, supply chain experts maintain that completely moving iPhone production to the U.S. is not feasible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South African cricket captain Wiaan Mulder chose not to pursue the Test record for the highest individual score, declaring his innings at 367 not out against Zimbabwe. Mulder was just 33 runs shy of Brian Lara's iconic record of 400 not out. He explained the decision was made in the team's best interest but also out of respect for the West Indies legend, stating that someone of Lara's stature should retain such a special record. Mulder's score is now the fifth-highest individual total in Test cricket history and the highest ever by a South African.</p>

          <p>A vital nonprofit clinic in Libby, Montana, that provides free screenings for asbestos-related diseases is facing closure. The Center for Asbestos Related Disease (CARD) was forced to shut down after BNSF Railway won a lawsuit against it and seized its assets to collect a $2.9 million judgment. The town's health crisis stems from a now-closed vermiculite mine that contaminated the area with asbestos. The clinic's future is further threatened by potential federal funding cuts from the Trump administration, which could permanently end its services for the community where 1 in 10 residents suffer from asbestos-related illness.</p>

          <p>An extensive review by the Department of Justice and the FBI has concluded that there is no incriminating "client list" associated with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and confirmed his 2019 death was a suicide. The findings, detailed in a two-page memo, contradict long-standing conspiracy theories suggesting Epstein was murdered to protect high-profile associates. Investigators found no credible evidence to predicate new investigations against uncharged third parties. The review aims to provide transparency and counter misinformation surrounding the case, reaffirming the official narrative of Epstein's death while in federal custody.</p>

The inquiry was prompted after OpenAI publicly stated it had no partnership with Robinhood and did not endorse the "OpenAI tokens" being offered, which supposedly provide indirect exposure to the private company's equity. The regulator is seeking clarification on the structure of the tokens and whether consumer communication has been clear and non-misleading. Robinhood launched the product to give EU users a way to invest in private company shares. (not investment advice)</p>
