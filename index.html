          <p>Official statistics indicate a continued slowdown in the United Kingdom's jobs market, presenting a challenging economic picture. The annual rate of pay growth decreased to 5% in the three months leading up to May, while the number of job vacancies has consistently fallen for three years, now at 727,000. The Office for National Statistics noted that survey data suggests some companies are halting new hires or not replacing departing employees, reflecting broader economic caution.

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a nearly 61% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter profit, significantly surpassing market expectations. This record-breaking performance is largely attributed to the sustained high demand for its advanced artificial intelligence chips, which are essential components for major tech firms like Nvidia and Apple. Despite the strong growth, the company acknowledges potential future headwinds from U.S. trade policies and a possible slowdown in smartphone and PC markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for increased regulatory oversight to manage the intense price competition within the nation's electric vehicle industry. The government is concerned that these aggressive "price wars" are contributing to deflationary pressures and eroding business profitability, as evidenced by a significant fall in industrial profits. This move highlights Beijing's challenge in balancing the need to curb destructive competition while simultaneously sustaining economic growth and protecting jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan and the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey. Sources report she was dismissed under Article 2 of the U.S. Constitution, which outlines presidential powers. Comey was a notable prosecutor who helped lead the cases against Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Sean "Diddy" Combs. Her father, James Comey, was famously fired as FBI director by President Trump in 2017 amid the Russia investigation.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports fell by 0.5% in June compared to the previous year, marking the second straight month of contraction and raising concerns about a potential recession. The decline was driven by a significant drop in shipments to key trading partners, including an 11.4% decrease to the United States, as a trade deal remains elusive. The data reflects the impact of a 25% U.S. tariff on Japanese imports, which has particularly affected the nation's crucial automobile sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Deportation data obtained by CBS News indicates that despite the Trump administration's focus on removing the "worst of the worst," a small percentage of those deported had convictions for violent crimes. Of the approximately 70,583 convicted criminals deported in the first half of the year, only 0.58% had homicide convictions, while most infractions were for traffic or immigration offenses. This data suggests the administration's deportation push has broadly targeted undocumented immigrants, not just those with serious criminal records, a point of contention for some lawmakers.</p>
