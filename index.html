          <p>The Times highlights a report dismissing concerns that leaving the European Convention on Human Rights would threaten peace in Northern Ireland, citing former Labour Home Secretary Jack Straw's support. The Daily Mail covers the "sleaze crisis" surrounding Angela Rayner, alleging a Labour civil war fuels criticism. The Guardian reports claims that Kemi Badenoch's assertion of being offered a place at Stanford at 16 is "impossible". The Daily Telegraph says Reform-controlled councils will cut council tax by overhauling pension funds, while the Daily Express urges action against shoplifting, with the policing minister promising to reverse decline under the Conservatives. The article provides a summary of the major headlines shaping the UK's news landscape. Optimism might be slightly tempered by the political infighting and concerns over factual accuracy. The current state of affairs shows the dynamic nature of news and the challenges faced by politicians and policymakers alike.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping addressed the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, advocating for increased cooperation in artificial intelligence and rejecting a "Cold War mentality." The summit, the largest to date, included leaders like Vladimir Putin and Narendra Modi, amid China's efforts to position itself as a global peacemaker. Xi highlighted China's $84 billion investment in SCO countries and support for vocational education. Analysts suggest that improved relations between China and India could bolster Beijing's influence, while China could mediate in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The summit is expected to result in a joint statement, potentially leading to improved relations between China and various countries.</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has rescinded its subpoena for Robert Mueller to testify, citing his health issues, according to a committee spokesperson. Chairman James Comer had requested Mueller's appearance as part of an investigation into the Jeffrey Epstein files, referencing Mueller's tenure as FBI director during the Epstein investigation. However, Mueller's family informed The New York Times that he is battling Parkinson's disease, precluding his ability to appear before Congress. This decision marks the end of the committee's attempt to question Mueller regarding the Epstein case.</p>

          <p>Following Seattle's 3-0 Leagues Cup final win against Inter Miami, Luis Suárez confronted Seattle's midfielder Obed Vargas and spat on the Sounders director of security, Gene Ramirez. The incident adds to Suárez's controversial history, which includes biting opponents and simulation. MLS has previously issued suspensions for spitting incidents, raising the possibility of disciplinary action against Suárez. The game saw Seattle secure a decisive victory, with key plays from Vargas stifling Miami's attack, and the win qualifies Seattle directly to the Concacaf Champions Cup.</p>

          <p>The European Union is drafting "precise plans" to send multinational troops to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees, according to EU chief Ursula von der Leyen. The force would be supported by the United States, providing intelligence and surveillance assets. President Trump has reportedly assured European leaders of an American presence as part of the support. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed skepticism about the war ending in 2025, indicating preparations for a prolonged conflict, suggesting a complex and uncertain future for the region.</p>

          <p>During World War II, American mercenaries known as the Flying Tigers played a crucial role in defending China against Japanese forces. The group, officially named the American Volunteer Group, was formed by Claire Chennault and consisted of American pilots, mechanics, and support personnel. Despite current US-China tensions, the Flying Tigers are still highly regarded in China, with their contributions and sacrifices remembered. The daughter and granddaughter of the Flying Tigers' founder were invited to Beijing's military parade commemorating the end of World War II, highlighting the enduring bond between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's administration has significantly altered the decor of the Oval Office, adding numerous gold accents and increasing the number of displayed paintings. The redesign, described by some as a "golden office for the golden age," has drawn mixed reactions, with comparisons to a wrestler's dressing room. The additions include gold trimming, trophies, vases, and coasters bearing Trump's name, reportedly paid for personally by the president. The office also features a large number of paintings of presidential predecessors and pictures of the Trump family, marking a departure from previous administrations.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing prolonged drought conditions, leading to reduced yields of staple vegetables like broccoli. Farmers are struggling with hot temperatures and poor growing conditions, resulting in yield cuts of over 50%.
