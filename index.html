          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang praised Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) during a visit to Taiwan, hailing it as one of humanity's greatest companies and suggesting that investing in its stock would be "very smart," particularly given the U.S. administration's interest in acquiring stakes in tech firms receiving CHIPS Act funding. Huang also announced that TSMC is producing six new products for Nvidia, including advanced AI chip components. Simultaneously, Nvidia has reportedly asked suppliers to halt production of its H20 graphics processing units designed for China, following Beijing's security concerns and a reported freeze on local company purchases. Huang acknowledged these queries and expressed optimism that the issue would be resolved, underscoring the delicate balance Nvidia must strike amid escalating U.S.-China trade tensions in the critical semiconductor sector.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Thailand's former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra was acquitted of a royal defamation charge by a Bangkok court, avoiding a potential 15-year prison sentence under the country's strict lese majeste law. The court found insufficient evidence and noted potential political bias among witnesses, stating the prosecution's account was incomplete and lacked context regarding the specific royal figure. This verdict marks a significant moment for Thaksin, who has faced numerous politically motivated charges and has consistently maintained his innocence since being ousted in a 2006 military coup. Despite this acquittal, his daughter, current Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, faces a separate ethics ruling that could lead to her removal from office next week.</p>

This marks the first official famine confirmation in the territory, highlighting a severe humanitarian crisis exacerbated by Israeli restrictions on aid. Concurrently, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that Gaza City would be "completely destroyed" if Hamas does not agree to Israel's conditions for ending the war, including hostage release and disarmament, further intensifying fears for the civilian population and remaining hostages.

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is set to deliver a significant speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, as the central bank considers its first interest rate cut of 2025. This comes amidst persistent pressure from President Donald Trump, who has urged the Fed to lower rates and called for the resignation of a Fed Governor. Policymakers face a complex dilemma: whether to cut rates to stimulate a slowing job market or hold steady against rising underlying inflation and the uncertain effects of tariffs. Futures markets are anticipating a rate cut in September, adding to the high stakes of Powell's upcoming remarks regarding the economic outlook and the Fed's independence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's economy contracted by 0.3% in the second quarter of 2025, a steeper decline than initially estimated, primarily due to weaker industrial production, construction, and private consumption. This marks a potential third consecutive year of contraction for Europe's largest economy, a first in its postwar history, exacerbated by rising trade tensions and U.S. tariffs. Separately, former Munich Security Conference chairman Christoph Heusgen urged Germany to recognize a Palestinian state, citing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the upcoming UN General Assembly. The German government, however, maintains that recognition should be a final step in a two-state solution, despite growing public support for the move. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration proposes eliminating funding for TRIO, a group of federal programs that have helped millions of low-income and first-generation students access and succeed in college for 60 years. Advocates, including former participants, highlight the programs' proven track record, with Upward Bound students being twice as likely to earn a bachelor's degree by age 24 compared to their peers from similar backgrounds. Despite bipartisan support in Congress, the White House argues that "access to college is not the obstacle it was," placing the onus on colleges. Critics warn that cutting the $1.2 billion annual funding would stifle opportunities, particularly in regions like Appalachia, and undermine decades of successful educational support.</p>

          <p>Many patients, like Mara Varona, are discovering that paying the cash price for medical services, such as prenatal genetic tests, can be significantly cheaper than using health insurance. Varona was billed $750 by Natera after her insurer paid only 45 cents on a $4,480 charge, despite being offered a cash price of $349. Research indicates that cash prices are often lower than insurer-negotiated rates for various services, a counterintuitive trend attributed to administrative efficiencies and consumer price shopping.

A key positive indicator is the increase in housing inventory, now at its highest since 2020, offering buyers more options and leverage. While nationwide median prices are still up minimally, some markets are experiencing price softening, and mortgage rates have slightly decreased, spurring refinance activity. Experts anticipate rates to remain near 6.6% through year-end, with potential dips in 2026, which could further encourage buyers and ease the "lock-in effect" that has kept many homeowners from moving.

          <p>Millions of travelers across the UK are warned to expect significant disruption over the upcoming bank holiday weekend, due to a combination of busy roads, a rail strike by the RMT union, and planned engineering works. CrossCountry routes will be particularly affected by the strike, with no services on Saturday and limited operations on Monday, impacting connections from Aberdeen to Cornwall. The RAC anticipates heavy road traffic, especially on the M5, with peak travel times identified for Friday, Saturday, and Monday. Despite the travel woes, the weather forecast is mostly dry, encouraging large crowds at numerous festivals and events scheduled nationwide.</p>

          <p>An explosion at an illegal fireworks warehouse in Pakistan's southern port city of Karachi on Thursday resulted in the deaths of at least four people and injuries to more than 30 others.

          <p>President Donald Trump has agreed to significantly reduce previously threatened high tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors imported from the European Union, settling on a 15% rate in line with most other sectors. This deal comes after Trump had earlier threatened tariffs as high as 250% on pharmaceuticals, aiming to boost domestic production. In exchange for the 15% tariff on most European goods, including semiconductors and lumber, the EU must pass legislation to eliminate tariffs on all U.S. industrial and agricultural goods. While the agreement offers some predictability for businesses, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association noted that the new 15% tariff on cars, down from 27.5%, is still considerably higher than the previous 2.5%, impacting consumer prices.

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate eased to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% in June, marking its lowest level since March, primarily due to a deceleration in rice prices. Despite the cooling, the figure was higher than economists' expectations of 3%. The "core-core" inflation rate, closely watched by the Bank of Japan, remained steady at 3.4%. This 40th consecutive month of inflation exceeding the BOJ's 2% target has led some experts to criticize the central bank for being "behind the curve" in raising interest rates. The article suggests that easing food inflation could support a potential rate hike by the BOJ in September or October, influencing purchasing power. (not investment advice)</p>

The launch, alongside Nio's cheaper Onvo and Firefly brands, is seen as a move to counter dipping deliveries while competitors grow.
