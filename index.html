European captain Luke Donald hopes his experienced team can capitalize on US rookies and silence the home crowd, especially given the financial incentives offered to US players.</p>

          <p>South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung expressed willingness to accept a Trump-Kim deal freezing North Korea's nuclear production as an "interim emergency measure," rather than immediate denuclearization. Lee views this as a feasible, realistic alternative to curb the North's estimated 15-20 new weapons annually, despite its 2022 declaration as a nuclear power. He believes such a freeze could benefit South Korea and global peace, advocating for renewed talks between Trump and Kim, who share a degree of mutual trust.</p>

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has cautioned Israel against annexing parts of the West Bank in response to the UK's recognition of Palestinian statehood. This significant policy shift, announced by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, aims to revive the two-state solution amidst condemnation from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the US, who view it as rewarding terrorism. Cooper emphasized the decision is for regional security and justice, while acknowledging ongoing devastation in Gaza.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has strengthened and is forecast to pass east of Bermuda on Monday. With maximum sustained winds of 75 mph, rapid strengthening is possible, and life-threatening surf and rip current conditions are expected along the East Coast from North Carolina to Atlantic Canada. Despite initial predictions for a busier season, hurricane activity has been quieter than anticipated so far this year.</p>

          <p>Officials are issuing warnings regarding "Reggie," a dolphin known for interacting with swimmers off England's south coast, due to alarming changes in his behavior spurred by human contact. While initially seen as playful, incidents of the dolphin becoming "boisterous" and pushing women underwater highlight a dangerous habituation. Experts caution that Reggie, a young, half-ton mammal, doesn't understand the harm he could inflict, emphasizing the need to avoid swimming with or approaching dolphins to ensure both human and wildlife safety.</p>

          <p>China's central bank kept its one-year and five-year loan prime rates (LPR) unchanged for the fourth consecutive month, defying expectations of a cut despite the US Federal Reserve's recent rate reduction.

Key indicators like retail sales, industrial output, and consumer prices have shown weakness, while the real estate slump worsened in August.</p>
