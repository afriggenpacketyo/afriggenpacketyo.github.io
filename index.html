          <p>Russian fighter jets violated Estonian airspace for 12 minutes, prompting Estonia to request urgent Article 4 consultations with its NATO allies. The "unprecedentedly brazen" incursion involved three MiG-31s with their transponders off, which were intercepted by NATO aircraft. This event follows other recent Russian provocations against NATO members, escalating regional tensions and reinforcing the alliance's focus on defending its eastern flank against Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz has strongly criticized FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's suggestions that ABC's broadcast license could be threatened over comments made by host Jimmy Kimmel. Cruz compared Carr's rhetoric to mafia-style threats, calling the government policing of speech "dangerous as hell" and a risk to conservative voices in the long term. This positions Cruz in opposition to former President Trump, who praised both Kimmel's suspension and Carr's stance on the issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A potential deal to prevent a U.S. ban on TikTok could involve its parent company, ByteDance, licensing its powerful recommendation algorithm to a new U.S. entity. This arrangement aims to resolve national security concerns while allowing ByteDance to retain some ownership of its core technology, which was a major point of contention in negotiations. Experts suggest this "rental" of the algorithm might not fully eliminate risks if it allows for external updates or data access from China.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a substantial $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications, targeting the program used by companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers. The executive order aims to ensure that companies are hiring "truly extraordinary people" and not replacing American workers, according to a White House aide. Critics and policy experts express concern that the high cost could incentivize U.S. companies to move jobs overseas and deter international students from studying in the country.</p>

          <p>A CDC advisory committee has voted on several key vaccine recommendations, including changes for the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine for young children. For COVID-19, the panel shifted its guidance for most adults to "individual-based decision-making" rather than a universal recommendation, a move that has drawn criticism from some medical groups. The committee also tabled a vote on changing the hepatitis B vaccine schedule, leaving current guidance for newborns in place for now.</p>

          <p>The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) narrowly voted against recommending a prescription for COVID-19 vaccines, instead advising that vaccinations be based on "individual-based decision making." The two-day meeting was marked by confusion and heated debate among the newly appointed members, some of whom have previously criticized vaccine safety. The panel's decisions and procedures have left many healthcare professionals concerned about the future clarity and reliability of U.S. vaccine policy guidance.</p>

          <p>Recent decisions by the CDC's advisory committee (ACIP) risk creating a vaccine system where access is unequal, particularly for low-income families. The panel's vote to remove the combined MMRV vaccine from the federal Vaccines for Children (VFC) program means that privately insured families may still access the convenient single shot while poorer children cannot. This shift, along with proposed delays for other childhood immunizations, echoes past public health crises and could lead to significant healthcare disparities and resurgences of preventable diseases.</p>

          <p>A journalist for the publication L.A. Taco has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department, claiming officers repeatedly violated his First Amendment rights. Lexis-Olivier Ray alleges that police and sanitation workers threatened him with arrest and once handcuffed him while he was documenting sweeps of homeless encampments. The lawsuit is the latest in a series of legal challenges scrutinizing the LAPD's treatment of the press during public events and protests.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors have revealed that Nicholas Roske, the man who pleaded guilty to the attempted assassination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, had planned to kill two other justices as well. According to a sentencing memorandum, Roske's goal was to "single-handedly alter the constitutional order" in response to the court's anticipated overturning of Roe v. Wade. Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of at least 30 years to life, describing his actions as an "abhorrent form of terrorism" that strikes at the core of the U.S. government.</p>

While Musk has denied the current fundraising round, the capital would likely be used to acquire vast amounts of computing power and talent needed to build next-generation AI systems.

          <p>The Trump administration has released a new welcome letter for newly naturalized U.S. citizens that shifts the focus from America's founding ideals to its culture, traditions, and history. Unlike letters from past presidents, which often described America as an "idea" or an "experiment" in democracy, Trump's version emphasizes assimilation and forging a "sacred bond with our Nation." This rhetorical change aligns with a broader right-wing redefinition of American identity as being based on a shared culture rather than a universal creed.</p>

          <p>Recent threats by former President Trump and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr to revoke broadcast licenses of networks like ABC have highlighted the federal government's regulatory power over media. Broadcast networks use public airwaves licensed by the FCC, which requires them to operate in the "public interest." While this is typically invoked for issues like obscenity or children's programming, the Trump administration is using the clause to challenge news coverage it deems politically biased, an unprecedented move that raises significant First Amendment concerns.</p>
