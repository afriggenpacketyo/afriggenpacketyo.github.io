          <p>President Trump has ordered the deployment of troops to Portland, Oregon, authorizing the use of "full force" to protect federal facilities, specifically an ICE center targeted by protesters. The move has drawn strong criticism from Oregon's governor and Portland's mayor, who state there is no need for federal intervention and that their communities are calm. This action is part of a broader administration crackdown on illegal immigration and follows the designation of Antifa as a domestic terrorist organization, a move legal experts say faces constitutional challenges. The specific type of troops and the definition of "full force" remain unclear.</p>

          <p>At the UN General Assembly, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated that Russia has no plans to attack NATO or EU countries but warned of a "decisive response" to any aggression. He also criticized Western powers for sabotaging diplomacy regarding Iran. In contrast, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul defended the decision by European powers to reimpose "snapback" sanctions on Iran, stating they had "no choice" due to Tehran's failure to comply with its nuclear commitments. The speeches highlight the deep diplomatic rifts over European security and the handling of Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>Former Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers is now working with the U.S. Israel Education Association to promote "friendshoring" pharmaceutical supply chains to nations in the Abraham Accords. The initiative aims to reduce American dependence on China, which currently dominates the market for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and generic drugs. Rodgers argues that while onshoring manufacturing to the U.S. is a priority, high costs make it difficult for generics. Therefore, relying on allied nations like Israel and the UAE presents a viable solution to enhance national security and build on diplomatic ties established under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has reached a confidential settlement with Rudy Giuliani, former attorney for Donald Trump, ending a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit. The suit, filed in January 2021, accused Giuliani of spreading damaging falsehoods about the company's voting machines following the 2020 presidential election. This resolution comes shortly after Dominion also settled a similar case against another former Trump lawyer, Sidney Powell. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed, and the court filing indicates that each party will cover their own legal fees and costs.</p>

          <h2>Wild Chimpanzees Regularly Consume Alcohol from Fermented Fruit, Study Finds</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that chimpanzees in the wild frequently consume fermented fruit, ingesting amounts of alcohol equivalent to about one small beer for a human each day. The study, conducted in national parks in Uganda and the Ivory Coast, suggests that alcohol consumption may have deep evolutionary roots rather than being a purely human cultural phenomenon. Researchers observed chimps of all ages and sexes sharing the alcoholic fruit, supporting the theory that our use of alcohol is not a recent development.

          <p>The FBI has arrested a Texas man, Joshua Cole, for allegedly making online threats to commit a mass shooting at a Pride parade in Abilene. According to court documents, Cole posted comments on Facebook calling for people to "lock and load" to avenge the recent murder of right-wing activist Charlie Kirk. In his posts, Cole also used derogatory language targeting LGBTQ+ people. Upon his arrest, Cole reportedly admitted to making the threats and owning a firearm, stating that he did not believe the Pride event should be allowed but denying he intended to act on his words.</p>

          <p>More than a dozen FBI agents were fired, including several who were photographed kneeling to de-escalate a confrontation with protesters in June 2020 following the killing of George Floyd. The agents' actions, which an initial FBI review found did not warrant discipline, drew sharp criticism from the right, and a new investigation was later opened by FBI Director Kash Patel. The FBI Agents Association condemned the firings as a violation of due process that damages trust within the Bureau. The association warned that such actions weaken the agency by eliminating valuable expertise and could put national security at greater risk.</p>

          <p>For the eighth consecutive year, Finland has been named the happiest country in the world, a distinction many Finns find puzzling. Experts suggest the ranking is based more on contentment and life satisfaction rather than daily expressions of joy. This contentment is rooted in a society with strong social support systems, such as extensive free public services like Helsinki's central library, which are funded by higher taxes that citizens willingly pay. Access to nature and cultural practices like saunas also contribute to a high quality of life, fostering a sense of well-being and societal trust.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, currently a major hurricane north of the Caribbean, could potentially interact with another nearby developing storm system in a rare meteorological event known as the Fujiwhara effect. This phenomenon occurs when two storms get close enough to orbit a common center, sometimes merging or altering each other's paths. While experts say a full merger is unlikely in this case due to the difference in storm strengths, any interaction could slightly change their forecast tracks. The second, weaker system is expected to approach the southeastern U.S. coast, prompting officials to advise residents to monitor its progress.</p>

The case involved the killing of four teenage girls who were bound, shot, and set on fire inside the shop.

          <p>The Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine is operating on emergency diesel generators for a fifth consecutive day, raising significant safety concerns after its last external power line was severed. The UN's nuclear watchdog has repeatedly warned of a potential catastrophe. Concurrently, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced a $90 billion arms agreement with the United States, which includes long-range weapons systems and the direct purchase of Ukrainian-made drones. Zelenskyy also revealed that an Israeli Patriot air defense system has been operational in Ukraine for the past month, with two more expected this fall.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has condemned Reform UK's proposal to abolish indefinite leave to remain (ILR) for legal migrants, calling the policy "toxic" and divisive. Speaking ahead of the Labour party conference, Starmer described the plan, which would force migrants already in the UK to reapply for visas every five years, as one of the "most shocking things" Nigel Farage's party has said. He argued that it targets people who have long contributed to British society and would "tear this country apart." The criticism comes as Labour faces pressure from polls showing it trailing Reform UK.</p>

          <p>Market strategist David Zervos has warned that the Federal Reserve may be underestimating the impact of the artificial intelligence boom on the U.S. labor market. He suggests a scenario where AI drives strong economic growth but also leads to significant job losses, creating a dilemma for the Fed's dual mandate of price stability and full employment. Zervos cites conversations with leading AI experts who predict the loss of three to five million jobs within the next few years due to AI-driven automation. This could lead to a situation where the economy is growing but the unemployment rate is simultaneously rising. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has abruptly summoned hundreds of generals and admirals from around the world to a meeting at Marine Corps University in Quantico, Virginia. The unusual and sparsely explained order has fueled anxiety and speculation among military officials that it could precede firings or demotions. A senior administration official described the meeting's purpose as a "rally the troops" message to get leaders excited about the new posture of the rebranded Department of War. However, some retired military figures have expressed concern, calling the gathering unprecedented and potentially a form of "performative theatre" by the new Pentagon chief.</p>

A BYD executive stated that selling is a "completely normal" part of investing and expressed gratitude for the 17 years of support from Buffett and Charlie Munger. Berkshire's initial investment saw massive returns, but the firm began gradually reducing its holdings in 2022. BYD's shares have fallen this week following the news, amid signs that its recent strong growth is slowing, with the company recently cutting sales targets and reporting a quarterly profit decline.

As the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot, he flew 21 combat missions over Europe during World War II and went on to serve in both the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first Black military pilots in the U.S. armed forces, celebrated for their skill and for breaking racial barriers. After retiring from the Air Force in 1971, Hardy became a dedicated champion of the group's legacy, which was honored with the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007.</p>

          <p>A resilient stock market is fueling consumer spending, particularly among wealthier households, and may be preventing the U.S. economy from entering a recession. Despite negative consumer sentiment surveys, strong spending and GDP growth are being powered by the "wealth effect" from rising stock portfolios. However, economists warn that this creates a significant vulnerability, as the top 10% of earners own the vast majority of the market. A potential downturn in stocks could sharply curtail spending and, in the absence of strong job growth, quickly trigger an economic recession. (not investment advice)</p>

Ryan states this amount allows him to live an upper-middle-class lifestyle, paying $850 in rent for a modern apartment and covering all his expenses with money to spare. He contrasts the low-stress environment and financial freedom in Vietnam with the constant monetary pressure he felt in the United States, saying it allows him to focus on personal happiness and growth.</p>
