          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have "both signed off" on the first phase of a peace plan, which he stated would lead to the release of all hostages and an Israeli troop withdrawal. The Families' Headquarters for the Return of the Abductees, representing those held since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, welcomed the news with "excitement, anticipation and apprehension." They urged the Israeli government to approve the agreement immediately, expressing deep gratitude to Trump for his leadership in achieving this "historic breakthrough" towards ending the war and returning all abductees.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed director Ridley Scott has voiced strong criticism of modern Hollywood, asserting that it is "drowning in mediocrity" and struggles to produce well-made films. The director of "Blade Runner" and "Gladiator" claimed he resorts to watching his own movies for entertainment, finding them to have aged well. Scott, whose career spans decades with multiple Academy Award nominations, expressed relief when he occasionally finds a good contemporary film. He also recounted a moment when Joaquin Phoenix nearly quit his villainous role in "Gladiator," highlighting the challenges of filmmaking.</p>

          <p>During a White House event, Secretary of State Marco Rubio passed an urgent handwritten note to President Trump, informing him that negotiators were "very close to a deal" on the Middle East peace plan. The note advised Trump to announce the deal first on Truth Social, highlighting the immediacy of the situation as top US and international officials were in deep negotiations in Egypt. Trump, who had previously expressed readiness to travel to the Middle East, including potentially Gaza, eventually acknowledged the breakthrough, emphasizing his administration's role in seeking peace. The incident underscored the rapid developments surrounding the critical peace talks.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a "first phase" ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, aiming to end the devastating Gaza war. The agreement reportedly includes the release of nearly 50 hostages in exchange for around 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, with Hamas disarming and Israel withdrawing troops to an agreed line. This breakthrough follows multiple failed efforts and two previous ceasefires, with strong international support hoping this truce will last. The plan also outlines a transitional governance committee for Gaza and a vague pathway to Palestinian self-determination, while Israel emerges in a stronger security position despite international isolation.</p>

          <p>Despite the arrest of Jonathan Rinderknecht for allegedly setting the initial Lachman fire that led to the devastating Pacific Palisades blaze, residents express a lack of "closure." The community is grappling with the revelation that fire crews initially thought the New Year's Day fire was extinguished, only for winds to rekindle it days later. While some are relieved it wasn't an accidental cause, others, still deep in recovery and reconstruction, question why the fire department didn't prevent the reignition.

          <p>Manchester United coach Marc Skinner championed Maya Le Tissier's qualities after her match-winning penalty in the club's Champions League debut, despite her limited international appearances for England. Le Tissier, a consistent Women's Super League defender with a record 71 consecutive appearances, has only eight caps, with England coach Sarina Wiegman preferring her at right-back despite her club role as a center-back. Injuries to key England players like Leah Williamson and Lucy Bronze may open an opportunity for the 23-year-old, whom Skinner hails as a future "incredible England stalwart" and a "rock" for her club.</p>

          <p>Britain's membership in the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR) has become a highly contentious political issue, with the Conservative Party pledging to withdraw if they win the next election. This stance, aimed at curbing illegal immigration, is challenged by Liberal Democrats and nuanced by Labour. The debate has been fueled by past cases, such as prisoner voting rights and deportation appeals, which brought the ECHR into public consciousness. Critics argue the ECHR compromises UK sovereignty and has expanded its reach, while human rights lawyers warn of potential losses in accountability for state abuses. The complex issue is seen as more political than legal.</p>

          <p>An article argues that American politicians are increasingly using profanity, attempting to appear "cool" but instead lacking sophistication. The author, who personally enjoys swearing for catharsis, contends that frequent public cursing diminishes its impact and fails to model appropriate behavior for the electorate. Examples include Kamala Harris's "motherfuckers are crazy" and President Trump's use of "bullshit," along with other officials. The piece suggests that while cultural tolerance for profanity has grown in entertainment, politics should maintain a higher standard, expressing a desire for leaders to set better examples rather than vulgarizing public discourse.</p>

Trump emphasized the urgency for negotiators to "move fast" and noted Hamas's prior acceptance of key elements of the plan, including hostage release.

While the absolute impact was smaller due to milder circulating variants and increased immunity, the vaccines provided meaningful additional protection.

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem compared antifa to designated terrorist organizations like MS-13, Hamas, Hezbollah, and ISIS during a White House roundtable, asserting the loosely affiliated antifascist network is "just as dangerous." Her comments came after President Trump signed an executive order designating antifa as a "domestic terrorist organization." Experts, however, generally describe antifa as a decentralized movement without formal leadership, engaging in protest activity that sometimes includes property destruction and street violence, contrasting sharply with the structured, military-wing operations of the groups Noem cited. The roundtable featured conservative influencers who supported these claims without presenting evidence.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the Real Food, Healthy Kids Act, a new state law that will ban some "of concern" ultraprocessed foods from California school meals starting in 2035. This legislation provides the first statutory definition of ultraprocessed foods in the U.S., aiming to address health issues like obesity and asthma in children. The state's Department of Public Health will identify prohibited foods by 2028, requiring schools to phase them out. The bill, championed by Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel, builds on previous food safety laws and is expected to lead to a major overhaul of school cafeteria meals, with vendors likely adapting recipes.</p>

          <p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has temporarily lifted a lower court's order that blocked the deployment of Oregon National Guard troops to Portland. However, a more sweeping order from U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, which prohibits any state's National Guard from deploying into Portland, remains in effect. The administrative stay by the Ninth Circuit preserves the status quo by not allowing the Oregon National Guard to be deployed, without ruling on the legal merits. Judge Immergut had previously expressed concerns about the Trump administration's attempts to circumvent her initial order, stating claims about the city were "untethered to the facts."</p>

          <p>The Internal Revenue Service announced it will furlough approximately 34,000 employees, nearly half its workforce, due to the ongoing government shutdown. This decision will significantly hinder taxpayer assistance, leading to increased wait times, backlogs, and delays in implementing tax law changes. The National Treasury Employees Union condemned the move, highlighting the loss of vital services for the American public. Despite a 2019 law intended to ensure back pay for furloughed workers, a recent White House memo suggested this might not occur, adding to the uncertainty for affected employees.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has agreed to settle a $128 million lawsuit brought by four former top Twitter executives, including former CEO Parag Agrawal, over unpaid severance following his 2022 acquisition of the company.

This settlement follows another agreement with approximately 6,000 former rank-and-file Twitter employees over $500 million in severance. The lawsuits highlighted a pattern of refusing to pay former staff, with executives contending Musk falsely accused them of misconduct after being compelled to complete the $44 billion purchase.</p>

Lecornu confirmed that dissolving parliament for fresh elections is unlikely, as most MPs prioritize passing a budget by year-end. The new prime minister will face significant challenges, including France's crippling national debt and revisiting contested pension reforms, with some factions remaining unyielding and Macron appearing increasingly isolated.</p>

          <p>Federal investigators determined the devastating Pacific Palisades wildfire was a "holdover" from a smaller fire set intentionally on New Year's Day, which smoldered underground before reigniting. This revelation prompts questions about whether the Los Angeles Fire Department could have done more to prevent the conflagration, especially given warnings of extreme weather. Critics, including a former head of the county's arson unit, suggest a commission should examine why the rekindled fire was allowed to reignite, pointing to common wildland firefighting practices of patrolling for days or weeks after initial suppression. LAFD officials had collected hoses and believed the initial fire was fully extinguished.</p>
