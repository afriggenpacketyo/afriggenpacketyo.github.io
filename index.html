        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill set to be introduced in Parliament in England and Wales aims to give judges the power to add up to two years in prison for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings, preventing them from avoiding the consequences of their actions. The families of victims, including those of Sabina Nessa, Zara Aleena, and Jan Mustafa, have advocated for this change, emphasizing that it provides recognition and reparation for families, while also serving as a moment of reckoning for offenders. While powers exist to compel attendance, they are often not used due to the risks of restraining disruptive individuals in court, although additional options like restricting family visits and parole eligibility are being considered. </p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk has revised its sales growth expectations for 2025 due to lower-than-anticipated sales of its popular Wegovy weight loss drug, facing increased competition from copycat medications. Despite this, the company reported a first-quarter net profit of 29.03 billion Danish kroner ($4.4 billion), surpassing analysts' forecasts. Wegovy sales reached 17.36 billion Danish kroner, slightly below expectations, and overall revenues amounted to 78.09 billion Danish kroner.

The Komeito party is advocating for tax cuts on essential goods, while LDP lawmakers are divided over including a consumption tax reduction in the new package, as the government plans to secure approximately 300 billion yen ($2 billion) from contingency reserve funds to subsidize energy bills during the summer. </p>

          <p>A New York Times article reports that escalating military support from the West to India and from China to Pakistan signals a change in global alignments, potentially leading to increased international tensions. After a deadly terrorist attack in Kashmir, India and Pakistan are again in military conflict, but this time, the region's alliances have been redrawn. The flow of arms illustrates these new alignments, where India is buying more from Western allies, and Pakistan is increasingly reliant on China for military purchases. This injection of superpower politics into South Asia's conflict raises concerns about potential escalation, particularly given the nuclear capabilities of the involved nations. </p>

          <p>President Trump criticized California Governor Gavin Newsom after Newsom requested collaboration on a significant film tax credit aimed at revitalizing the state's film industry. Newsom's proposal followed Trump's announcement of 100% tariffs on films produced outside the U.S., citing the industry's decline due to COVID-19 and Hollywood strikes. Trump accused Newsom of causing the film industry to "abandon" the U.S., while also claiming he gave water to California during the January wildfires and challenging Newsom to run for president. Despite the criticism, Trump acknowledged having a good relationship with Newsom and vowed to restore the American film industry.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Rogoff, a Harvard professor, argues that President Donald Trump’s plan to weaken the dollar, known as the “Mar-a-Lago Accord,” is based on a flawed diagnosis of the U.S. economy. While the dollar’s reserve-currency status contributes to trade deficits, it is only one factor among many, and tariffs are not a cure-all. Rogoff suggests that the current account deficit is influenced by the balance between national saving and investment, with the fiscal deficit and the strength of the American economy being key factors, and reducing the fiscal deficit would be a more straightforward fix than launching a trade war.</p>
