          <p>A superintendent in a low-income Pennsylvania school district is leveraging technology to make music education more accessible. By using over 30 3D printers, the California Area School District produces violins for just $50 each, a fraction of typical rental costs. This initiative provides the instruments to students for free, fostering confidence and a love for music in a community where over 70% of students are from low-income families. The program, inspired by a similar effort from the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra, has successfully produced over 200 violins in five years.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts advise that the amount of money to invest in a certificate of deposit (CD) depends heavily on an individual's financial situation, including the stability of their emergency fund. When considering a CD, savers should compare potential returns against other low-risk options like high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts. It is also crucial to consider current and future interest rate trends, as the Federal Reserve's potential rate cuts could make locking in current CD rates advantageous. A strategy like CD laddering can help maintain liquidity while benefiting from higher interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pakistan has deported 211 Afghan nationals back to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, despite them having been approved for resettlement in Germany. These individuals, including human rights defenders and journalists, had fled to Pakistan after the 2021 withdrawal of Western forces. The German Foreign Ministry is now in contact with Pakistani authorities to facilitate their return and has arranged temporary accommodation for them in Afghanistan. This event occurs as Pakistan continues a broader deportation of Afghan refugees and highlights the precarious situation for over 2,000 Afghans with German admission promises who remain in Pakistan.</p>

          <p>Investment firm Evercore ISI has issued a short-term negative call on cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, citing subdued channel checks and the stock's premium valuation ahead of its upcoming earnings report. The analysis suggests a potential post-earnings pullback, which would not be unusual given the stock's history of declining after its last three reports. Meanwhile, investors are also watching peer company Palo Alto Networks, which is set to release its own results. The key focus for Palo Alto will be confirming that its recent acquisition of CyberArk was strategic and not a move to mask a slowdown in its core business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated the group's agreement to the latest ceasefire proposal from Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The two-stage plan involves a 60-day temporary truce during which Hamas would release approximately half of the remaining 50 Israeli hostages. This period would also be used for negotiations on a permanent ceasefire and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. This development follows a period of stalled talks, with Israel previously demanding the release of all hostages at once, while Hamas insisted on a complete end to the war before freeing any captives.</p>

Ukrainian officials reported that a drone attack in a residential area of Kharkiv killed seven people, including a toddler and a teenager, while missile strikes in Zaporizhzhia resulted in three deaths and numerous injuries. President Zelenskyy described the attacks as a "demonstrative and cynical" act by Russia, intended to apply pressure and undermine diplomatic efforts to end the war.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred has proposed the idea of a significant league realignment based on geography, which would coincide with future expansion to 32 teams. The proposal aims to reduce player travel and create more appealing postseason television slots, particularly for West Coast audiences. However, the idea has been met with criticism from many baseball fans who value the historical tradition of the separate American and National Leagues, which have existed for over a century. Potential expansion cities mentioned include Nashville, Tennessee, and Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>

Their primary goal is to counter what they perceive as a shift in U.S. strategy that favors Russia, following a recent Trump-Putin summit. The European contingent is concerned that the U.S. might push Ukraine toward a peace deal that amounts to capitulation, such as ceding the Donbas region without robust, long-term security guarantees for both Ukraine and the wider European continent.

          <p>A jury has found Javon Riley, 33, guilty of causing grievous bodily harm for his involvement in a gang-related shooting in Dalston, London, that severely injured a nine-year-old girl. The child was struck in the head by a bullet while eating at a restaurant with her family and now lives with life-changing injuries, including a bullet still lodged in her brain. Riley was also convicted of the attempted murder of three men at the restaurant who were the intended targets in a feud between rival Turkish gangs. The gunman who fired the shots has not yet been identified.</p>

          <p>As part of its separation from parent company Comcast, the cable news channel MSNBC will be renamed MS NOW, which stands for My Source News Opinion World. The rebranding is part of the creation of a new standalone company called Versant, which will also include CNBC and entertainment networks like USA and SYFY. Along with the name change, all Versant brands, including CNBC, will drop the iconic NBC peacock logo to establish a distinct identity. MSNBC is currently hiring dozens of journalists to build its own newsgathering operation independent from NBC News.</p>

          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is warning parents to stop using Nutrition Ignition Kids Magnesium Glycinate Gummies. Testing revealed the products contain melatonin, a prescription-only sleep aid, which was not declared on the label. Melatonin can cause side effects like drowsiness and dizziness in children. The product, which has been removed from sale, was marketed to support calm and focus in children over four. The MHRA was alerted after two mothers had the gummies tested when they noticed their children becoming unusually sleepy after consumption.</p>

          <p>After hitting a new all-time high of nearly $125,000 last week, the price of Bitcoin fell by 2% to around $115,000. The broader cryptocurrency market also tumbled, with over $500 million in long positions being liquidated in 24 hours due to forced selling. The downturn was triggered by investor profit-taking and heightened macroeconomic concerns, particularly after higher-than-expected wholesale inflation data cast doubt on a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. Other cryptocurrencies like Ether and crypto-related stocks also experienced significant declines amid the market-wide sell-off. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A large-scale study in rural Kenya has found that giving no-strings-attached cash payments of $1,000 to low-income households can be as effective as medical interventions in saving infants' lives. Researchers found that infants born to families who received the cash were nearly half as likely to die compared to a control group. The payments were associated with a 48% drop in infant mortality, largely because the money enabled families to access better healthcare, such as hospital deliveries. The cash also led to better nutrition and allowed pregnant mothers to reduce physically taxing work.</p>

          <p>As former President Trump is put forward for a Nobel Peace Prize, a Chinese foreign policy analyst has offered a critical assessment of his mediation style. Zhang Luwei, a research associate at a state-affiliated think tank, argued that Trump's heavy-handed, power-politics approach to diplomacy is ill-advised for long-term stability. The analyst claims Trump's method reduces complex geopolitical issues to "schoolyard fights," using America's dominant position to force temporary agreements without addressing deep-rooted historical grievances. This approach, the article suggests, fails to provide the strategic patience necessary for genuine conflict resolution.</p>

          <p>The U.S. documentary film community is facing a severe funding crisis following the government's decision to eliminate the budget for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB). This move has led to a 21% budget reduction at PBS, a primary supporter of independent documentaries, and follows grant cancellations at the National Endowments for the Humanities and the Arts. Filmmakers and organizations like ITVS are now scrambling to find alternative funding through international sources, streaming platforms, and private donations. Many in the community worry that the loss of public media support will impoverish the media landscape and reduce the diversity of stories being told.</p>

          <p>This article posits that the only viable way to end the war in Ukraine is to create a battlefield reality that convinces Russia it cannot achieve further gains. While the Trump administration is exploring a peace deal involving territorial concessions and security guarantees, the author argues that Moscow's core demands still amount to Ukraine's subjugation. The only credible guarantee for Ukraine's sovereignty is not a diplomatic promise but a national one: a massive, Western-backed military buildup to deter future Russian aggression. Therefore, the U.S. and its allies must commit to arming Ukraine for a protracted conflict to create the necessary conditions for successful negotiations.</p>

          <p>As diplomatic talks continue, the focus has shifted to potential territorial concessions from Ukraine, specifically concerning the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. Russia, which annexed Crimea in 2014 and occupies parts of four other Ukrainian regions, reportedly demands full control of Donetsk and Luhansk. However, this area contains Ukraine's most critical defensive line, the "fortress belt," and ceding it would leave the country vulnerable. The constitutions of both nations present legal obstacles, as Russia has incorporated the annexed lands into its own, while Ukraine's constitution deems its territory indivisible and inviolable.</p>
