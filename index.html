          <p>Michelle Goldberg's article discusses the Democratic Party's initial reluctance to acknowledge Joe Biden's declining health and fitness for office, despite widespread concerns. Goldberg reflects on her own early doubts and the pressure from party officials who prioritized incumbency and feared internal divisions. She argues that this 'cover-up' stemmed from groupthink and risk aversion, ultimately harming the party's credibility. The article suggests that a reckoning is needed to learn from these missteps and regain public trust by being honest about the situation, rather than solely blaming Biden's inner circle.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Secret Service after posting a photo of seashells arranged to spell '8647' on Instagram, which some interpreted as a coded threat against President Trump. The post, which Comey later deleted, sparked outrage from Trump administration officials, who accused Comey of calling for Trump's assassination. Comey claims he was unaware of the violent interpretation and removed the post upon realizing the association. The Secret Service interviewed Comey about the post, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>Moody's has downgraded the United States' credit rating, citing concerns over rising debt levels, political gridlock, and the potential for further fiscal imbalance due to proposed tax cuts. This downgrade means that all three major credit rating agencies no longer give the U.S. their highest rating. The agency pointed to the failure of successive administrations to address the growing national debt and underfunded social programs. Moody's also acknowledged the policy uncertainty and political instability within the U.S. government, which could lead to higher borrowing costs and a potential debt crisis.</p>

          <p>The United States has lost its last perfect credit rating as Moody's downgraded the country's rating due to concerns about the government's ability to repay its debt. Moody's cited successive administrations' failure to reverse ballooning deficits and interest costs as reasons for the downgrade. The White House responded by blaming the previous administration for the situation. A lower credit rating typically leads to higher borrowing costs for the country. The downgrade occurred on the same day as a setback for Trump's spending bill in Congress.</p>

          <p>An internal review reveals that FEMA is "not ready" for the upcoming hurricane season due to staff cuts and a shift in policy towards greater state responsibility. The review cites "culture issues," staffing shortages, and challenges coordinating with other federal agencies as contributing factors. These findings raise concerns about the agency's ability to respond effectively to potential disasters, particularly given the Trump administration's plan to reduce FEMA's role and shift more responsibilities to the states. The agency's acting leader has also expressed support for shrinking FEMA and increasing cost-sharing with states.</p>

The bill aims to extend tax cuts from Trump's first term while increasing spending on military and border security, offset by cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, and clean energy subsidies.</p>

          <p>President Trump faced setbacks in both the courts and Congress on Friday, while concluding a tour of Middle Eastern nations. The Supreme Court rejected the administration's request to block deportations of Venezuelans. Meanwhile, right-wing lawmakers stalled Trump's signature tax legislation in the House of Representatives, raising questions about the Republican party's ability to unite behind the bill. The bill would extend tax cuts from Trump's first term.</p>

          <p>A four-minute audio clip of President Biden's 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur has been released, revealing Biden speaking softly and haltingly as he struggled to recall key dates. The clip captures moments where Biden stumbled over the years his son died and Donald Trump was first elected. Republicans have long sought the release of this audio, arguing it might offer evidence of a decline in Bidenâ€™s mental acuity. The emergence of the recording coincides with new revelations about Biden's health while in office and efforts to downplay concerns about his ability to run for re-election.</p>

The Hamas-run Ministry of Health in Gaza reported that the death toll since the war began had reached 53,010. Qatar and families of hostages are calling on Netanyahu to make a deal with Hamas.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation for posting and deleting an image on Instagram that federal officials allege was a call for violence against President Trump. The image showed seashells arranged to form the numbers '86 47'. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that the issue is under investigation, while President Trump called the post 'a terrible thing'. The Secret Service interviewed Comey. It's unclear what Comey meant with his Instagram post, but according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, to 'eighty-six' means to 'throw out' or 'get rid of' something.</p>

          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, erected near her hometown in Sevnica, Slovenia, has been stolen. The statue, which had previously been made of wood and set on fire, was a life-size sculpture commissioned by an American artist. Police are investigating the theft, but residents speculate it was either vandalism or stolen for scrap metal. The statue, never popular with locals, stood in a field overlooking the Sava River. Ms. Trump left Sevnica in 1985 and has not been spotted in town since.</p>

          <p>As the Democratic Party faces low approval ratings, some top Democrats are attempting to distance themselves from their previous endorsements of Joe Biden, acknowledging his cognitive decline while in office. These Democrats, who once staunchly supported Biden's re-election campaign, are now expressing regrets about the party's handling of the 2024 race. Some officials have complained that White House aides kept Mr. Biden cloistered as his condition worsened. This shift in perspective comes as Democrats jostle for influence and strategize for future elections, with some warning that the issue could become a dividing line in the 2028 presidential primary.</p>

          <p>Tesla has amended its corporate bylaws to require shareholders to hold at least 3% of the company's issued and outstanding shares to sue over a breach of fiduciary duties. Ann Lipton, a corporate law expert, stated that the company is taking advantage of a Texas state law that allows corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits. This change would make it difficult for shareholders to bring lawsuits against insiders for breach of fiduciary duty. This follows Tesla's move to incorporate in Texas after a court decision against Elon Musk's compensation package.</p>
