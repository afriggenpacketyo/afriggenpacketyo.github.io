          <p>Audio recordings of former President Joe Biden's interview with special counsel Robert Hur have fueled criticism regarding his mental state and the use of an autopen for official presidential actions, including pardons. Critics, including House Oversight Committee Chair Rep. James Comer, are raising concerns about Biden's capacity to authorize these actions and the validity of blanket pardons issued to figures like Hunter Biden, Gen. Mark Milley, and Dr. Anthony Fauci. Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch suggests Biden should face prosecution for his handling of classified documents, while President Trump has claimed the use of an autopen is a "bigger scandal."</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reflects on Desi Arnaz's pivotal role in challenging racial barriers in early television and his broader impact on Hollywood. In the 1950s, Arnaz, a Cuban immigrant, fought against network skepticism to star alongside his wife, Lucille Ball, in "I Love Lucy," breaking stereotypes and popularizing Latin music. His success led to innovations in television production and syndication, and he became a leading Latino executive, paving the way for greater diversity in the entertainment industry. The article argues that Arnaz's story offers valuable lessons for contemporary efforts to promote inclusion.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article analyzes President Trump's evolving Middle East diplomacy, noting a shift away from prioritizing Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. During a recent tour, Trump engaged with leaders in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, seeking deals on Iran and Yemen without directly involving Israel. This shift includes lifting sanctions on Syria and pursuing negotiations with Iran, diverging from Netanyahu's preferred strategies. The article suggests that Trump is prioritizing economic opportunities and broader regional stability over traditional alliances with Israel, causing concern among some Israeli officials.</p>

          <p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent claims Walmart will absorb some of President Trump's tariffs, following a direct demand from Trump for the company to avoid raising prices. This assertion follows Walmart's earlier announcement that it would need to increase prices for consumers due to the tariff costs. Bessent stated he received assurances from Walmart's CEO, Doug McMillon, but a Walmart spokesperson declined to comment. Trump's initial tariff plans have caused market turmoil, leading to a partial walk-back with reduced tariffs on China.</p>
