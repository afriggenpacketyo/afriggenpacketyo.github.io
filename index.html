          <p>Former Congressman George Santos is scheduled to be sentenced in New York on federal fraud charges after admitting to campaign finance violations, unemployment benefit theft, and lying on financial disclosure forms. Santos pleaded guilty to wire fraud and aggravated identity theft as part of an agreement with prosecutors, and he has agreed to restitution and forfeiture totaling nearly $580,000. The sentencing will determine the consequences for Santos's extensive fabrications and financial misdeeds during his time in office.</p>
