          <p>A tourist boat carrying 53 people capsized during a sudden storm in Vietnam's Ha Long Bay, resulting in at least 34 fatalities, including eight children. The vessel, named Wonder Seas, was primarily carrying Vietnamese families when it was hit by bad weather, including hailstones and torrential rain. Rescue efforts have been hampered by the conditions, though 11 people were pulled from the water alive, including a boy who survived for hours in an air pocket. The government has promised a full investigation into the tragic accident.</p>

          <p>A vehicle struck a crowd of people outside a nightclub in East Hollywood, injuring 30 individuals, with at least seven in critical condition. The incident occurred early Saturday morning as people were waiting to enter the Vermont Hollywood venue. Following the crash, bystanders reportedly assaulted the driver, who was also found to have sustained a gunshot wound from an unknown assailant who fled the scene. Authorities are investigating the complex event, which also involved the car hitting a taco truck and a valet stand.</p>

          <p>Dozens of protesters were arrested across the United Kingdom during demonstrations against the government's decision to proscribe the activist group Palestine Action under the Terrorism Act. The ban makes supporting the group a criminal offense, and police in London, Bristol, and Truro arrested at least 80 people for displaying placards with supportive messages. The protests were organized ahead of a High Court challenge to the ban by the group's co-founder. The proscription followed an incident where activists broke into an RAF base, causing millions in damages to military aircraft.</p>

          <p>An explosion at a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training facility in East LA resulted in the deaths of three veteran officers. The blast occurred in the parking lot of the special enforcement bureau, which houses the bomb squad. The deceased officers, identified as detectives Joshua Kelley-Eklund, Victor Lemus, and William Osborn, were all part of the arson explosives detail. While the exact cause is under investigation, reports suggest the officers were working to render a grenade safe when it detonated. This incident marks the department's largest single loss of life since its founding in 1857.</p>

          <p>A government report has concluded that the collapse of a five-story building in George, South Africa, which killed 34 construction workers, was preventable. Public Works Minister Dean Macpherson stated the tragedy resulted from multiple failures, including the use of substandard materials and ignoring structural defects that were known for a year. The report revealed that workers had felt vibrations and were told to cover up cracks, with a safety officer even resigning in protest before the collapse. The minister has called for criminal accountability as a police investigation continues, though no arrests have been made.</p>

However, they also caution that these corporate pledges are long-term and could be reversed, while the tariffs have begun to increase prices on some consumer goods, risking inflation. Despite initial fears, the economy has remained resilient, though new threats of tariffs up to 50% on various countries add fresh uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>FC Barcelona has reportedly initiated talks to sign Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford, a move the player is said to prefer. The proposed deal would be an initial loan with an option to buy, potentially resolving a standoff between Rashford and United's head coach, Ruben Amorim. Rashford, one of the club's highest-paid players, has been training separately from the first team. His departure would provide Manchester United with significant wage bill savings, aiding their efforts to fund new signings after a costly summer transfer window.</p>

          <p>A month after U.S. airstrikes targeted three of Iran's major nuclear facilities, the full extent of the damage and the risk of radioactive contamination remain unclear. The operation, which involved heavy "bunker buster" bombs, hit fortified enrichment sites at Fordo, Natanz, and Isfahan. While these sites are not believed to contain active reactors, there are concerns about the potential release of toxic uranium hexafluoride gas. The fate of Iran's existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium is also uncertain, heightening fears about nuclear proliferation and regional stability following the attack.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Wipha is forecast to intensify into a typhoon before making landfall on the coast of southern China. The storm has already passed south of Taiwan, causing flight cancellations and dropping heavy rain, and previously crossed the Philippines, where it caused damage from high winds. In anticipation of the storm's arrival, authorities in Hong Kong have warned of gale-force winds and potential flooding, prompting Cathay Pacific to cancel numerous flights. Ferry services in China's Fujian province and ports on Hainan island have also been suspended as a precaution.</p>

          <p>Congress has approved President Trump's request to rescind $9 billion in previously allocated federal spending, a move that signals a potential shift in how the government appropriates money. The rescission, which targets funds for programs like foreign aid and public broadcasting, passed the Senate with a simple majority, bypassing the usual 60-vote, bipartisan threshold for budget bills. Political analysts suggest this serves as a successful test case for the administration's goal of moving toward a more partisan budgeting process. This could dramatically alter how the federal government has been funded for many years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 61-year-old man has died after being pulled into an MRI machine at a facility in Westbury, New York. According to Nassau County police, the man was wearing a large metallic chain and entered the MRI room while a scan was in progress for his relative. The machine's powerful magnet reportedly pulled the chain, drawing the man into the device and causing severe, fatal injuries. Medical experts emphasize that such incidents are rare but highlight the critical importance of strict safety protocols that require the removal of all metal objects before entering an MRI scanning room.</p>

          <p>This opinion article expresses alarm over the rise of anti-vaccine sentiment in the U.S., linking it to the Trump administration and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It points to the highest measles rate in 33 years and a recent, unusual CDC decision to stop recommending Covid-19 boosters for healthy children and pregnant women. This has prompted a lawsuit from medical associations and reflects a growing distrust in vaccines, with recent surveys showing a majority of pregnant women do not intend to fully vaccinate their children. The author argues these trends represent a significant threat to public health.</p>

This change stems from a lawsuit by evangelical groups who argued the previous ban, known as the Johnson Amendment, violated their First Amendment rights. This article argues that while seen as a victory by some, the move risks turning churches into political organizations, susceptible to campaign pressures and further polarizing congregations. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has already stated its clergy will continue to refrain from making endorsements.</p>

This move highlights the significant economic challenges facing Germany's goal to become carbon-neutral by 2045, as the steel industry is a major source of emissions.

A DW fact-check debunks these assertions, explaining that rising skin cancer diagnoses are linked to factors like better detection, increased sun exposure, and climate change, not sunscreen use. While countries with high sunscreen use, like Australia, also have high skin cancer rates, this is due to high UV radiation levels and population genetics. Health authorities continue to strongly recommend sunscreen as a crucial tool for filtering harmful UV rays and preventing melanomas.</p>
