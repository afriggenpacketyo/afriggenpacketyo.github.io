          <p>The Trump administration has moved to restrict foreign student visas at Harvard University, citing national security concerns and alleging the university has concerning ties to foreign entities, particularly China. The proclamation suspends the entry of foreign nationals seeking to study or participate in exchange programs at Harvard for an initial six-month period. Harvard has responded by calling the move an illegal retaliatory step, asserting it violates the university's First Amendment rights and vowing to protect its international students. The action is part of a broader standoff between the Trump administration and Harvard, which has seen the freezing of billions in grants and other funding. Optimism about a resolution is tempered by the escalating tensions and the potential impact on international students.</p>

          <p>A plow driver testified in the Karen Read trial that he did not see a body on the lawn of the residence where Boston Police Officer John O'Keefe was found dead, potentially bolstering the defense's case. Brian "Lucky" Loughran stated he made multiple passes by the address during a blizzard in January 2022 and saw nothing. This contradicts the prosecution's timeline, which alleges O'Keefe's body remained unmoved from around 12:30 a.m. until first responders arrived around 6 a.m. Loughran's testimony, along with other evidence, aims to cast reasonable doubt on the prosecution's claim that Read left her boyfriend to die in the snow.</p>

          <p>Italians are set to vote in a referendum that includes a proposal to halve the legal residency requirement for non-EU adult foreigners to apply for citizenship, from 10 to five years. The referendum presents a rare opportunity to make the country's bureaucracy more benevolent amid tightening citizenship rules. Prime Minister Meloni and other high-profile ministers have encouraged people to skip the referendum, hoping it will not reach quorum. The outcome of the vote could significantly impact the lives of many immigrants and reflect on Italy's national identity.</p>

          <p>The Washington Department of Natural Resources used a firefighting helicopter to remove abandoned boats from an uninhabited island in Puget Sound. The agency airlifted 14 vessels to the mainland for deconstruction, marking its largest operation of this kind. The use of a helicopter was necessary to avoid disrupting the marine bed and surrounding environment. Since the boat removal program began in 2002, the department has removed over 1,200 derelict vessels, addressing a significant environmental challenge.</p>

The presence of Bifidobacterium longum appeared to have a protective effect, reducing the likelihood of hospitalization for lung infections.</p>
