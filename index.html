        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has ordered former President Jair Bolsonaro to be placed under house arrest, alleging he violated previous court-ordered restrictions by communicating with supporters through his sons. The decision, made by Justice Alexandre de Moraes, comes as Bolsonaro is on trial for allegedly plotting a coup to stay in power after his 2022 election loss. This legal battle is intensified by international tensions, as the Trump administration has linked new tariffs on Brazilian goods to the case and sanctioned the presiding justice, while U.S. officials condemned the house arrest order. The ruling bars Bolsonaro from travel and communication, escalating political turmoil in Brazil.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is dealing with the aftermath of Storm Floris, which caused widespread power cuts and travel chaos, particularly in Scotland. Utility company SSEN is working to restore electricity to tens of thousands of homes in what it called the "most damaging summer storm in recent memory." Network Rail reported numerous incidents on train lines, and disruptions are expected to continue as cleanup and safety checks proceed. The storm also led to flight cancellations and the suspension of major events, including the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo. A yellow weather warning remains in effect as authorities manage the recovery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers wasted a dominant performance from starting pitcher Tyler Glasnow, losing 3-2 to the St. Louis Cardinals. Glasnow pitched seven strong innings, allowing only one run, but the bullpen couldn't maintain the lead. After the Dodgers tied the game in the eighth, a ninth-inning single by Cardinals' pinch-hitter Yohel Pozo drove in the winning run. The game was largely a pitchers' duel between Glasnow and the Cardinals' Sonny Gray, who also pitched seven impressive innings, allowing only a solo home run to Freddie Freeman. The loss highlights ongoing concerns with the Dodgers' bullpen reliability.</p>

          <p>The United States is introducing a 12-month pilot program that will require some business and leisure travelers to post bonds of $5,000, $10,000, or $15,000 to enter the country. The policy, part of the Trump administration's stricter immigration measures, targets visitors from countries with high rates of visa overstays. The State Department expects about 2,000 people to be affected during the trial period. The program aims to test the feasibility of the bond system and to encourage foreign governments to reduce their nationals' overstay rates. This is a governmental financial regulation.

          <p>Thirty years after Croatia's "Operation Storm," the military offensive that effectively ended its war of independence, Croatia and Serbia maintain starkly different views of the event. In Croatia, the anniversary is celebrated as a heroic victory that reclaimed occupied territory and led to a turning point in the Bosnian War. Conversely, Serbia commemorates it as a tragic "pogrom" that resulted in the mass exodus and murder of Serbian civilians. The differing interpretations highlight the deep, unresolved tensions that persist in the region, with both nations holding military parades and their leaders delivering nationalist speeches that underscore the lasting historical divide.</p>

          <p>A manhunt is ongoing for Michael Paul Brown, a 45-year-old military veteran suspected of killing four people at a bar in Anaconda, Montana. The small, tight-knit community is in mourning as local, state, and federal authorities search for the suspect, who is considered armed and dangerous. The victims, all local residents, were known by the suspect, who was a regular at The Owl Bar. While the motive remains unclear, the suspect's niece stated he has struggled with mental illness for years.

          <p>Ranchers in Sonora, Mexico, are facing a severe economic crisis following the United States' suspension of live cattle imports due to concerns about the New World Screwworm. This flesh-eating parasite, found in southern Mexico, poses a significant threat to livestock. The import ban has devastated the Mexican cattle industry, which was already weakened by years of drought, forcing ranchers to sell their cattle domestically at a significant loss. To survive, many, like third-generation rancher Martín Ibarra Vargas, are diversifying into other ventures like beekeeping and selling milk, but the future of their traditional livelihood remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>Representatives from over 170 nations are meeting at a UN conference in Geneva to negotiate a legally binding global treaty aimed at addressing the plastic pollution crisis. With plastic production soaring and an estimated 200 trillion plastic pieces in the world's oceans, the need for action is urgent. However, after two years of talks, no agreement has been reached. Key sticking points include whether to cap plastic production, a measure supported by nearly 100 countries but opposed by oil-producing nations like Russia and Saudi Arabia. The treaty also aims to ban harmful chemicals and create universal standards for product design and recycling.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Poland's liberal democratic government, led by Prime Minister Donald Tusk, is losing momentum less than two years after ousting the populist Law and Justice party. The author suggests that Tusk's administration has failed to present a compelling future vision, instead getting bogged down in reversing its predecessor's policies and even adopting some of their rhetoric on issues like migration. With Tusk's popularity plummeting, the piece warns that this period may be a brief "intermezzo" before a more radical right-wing populist government returns to power, offering a cautionary tale for democrats globally.</p>

The ministry also pointed out that the EU and U.S. themselves continue to trade with Russia.

Officials noted that Chinese diets are often deficient in high-quality protein, suggesting significant room for growth in consumption.

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have reportedly been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's asylum ban.

The original ban, which declared illegal immigration an emergency, was challenged by the ACLU and other advocacy groups. The court's decision represents a significant legal setback for the administration's stringent immigration policies, forcing officials to process migrants under existing U.S. immigration law rather than the sweeping ban.</p>

          <h2>Experts Advise on Where to Spot Tarantulas During Mating Season in California</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 21:29:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>It is currently peak mating season for tarantulas in California, a period when the typically reclusive male spiders venture from their burrows in search of mates. This season, running from August to December, makes sightings more common in chaparral, desert, and mountain areas, including popular hiking spots like Joshua Tree National Park and Griffith Park. Experts note that while their appearance may be intimidating, native California tarantulas are shy and reluctant to bite unless provoked. Their primary defense is flicking irritant hairs, which can cause a rash, but their venom is not considered a serious threat to humans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Communities across the United States are facing a critical shortage of volunteer firefighters, who make up nearly 70% of the nation's fire crews. The number of volunteers has declined by over 20% since 1985, while emergency call volumes have tripled, leading to burnout and strained resources. This trend threatens the safety of many smaller communities and could have significant financial consequences, as volunteer departments save taxpayers an estimated $46.9 billion annually. Without more volunteers, many towns may be forced to switch to paid fire departments, a costly alternative. Proposed incentives, like student loan forgiveness, aim to boost recruitment.</p>

          <p>Saquon Barkley, star running back for the Philadelphia Eagles, has declined an invitation to serve on President Donald Trump's revitalized council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. Barkley stated that due to his busy schedule, he and his family decided it was best to not accept the position. The council, which includes other prominent sports figures like Mariano Rivera and Bryson DeChambeau, was re-established under a recent executive order. Barkley, who has previously golfed with both Trump and Barack Obama, said he was surprised to be considered but appreciated the offer, framing his decision as a practical one.</p>

          <p>In a significant archaeological find, researchers have discovered the remains of an auroch, an extinct species of large wild cattle, in a cave near Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales. The discovery was part of a project surveying caverns in the area, which also uncovered evidence of the cave system being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. The findings, made in partnership with local cave explorers, provide new insights into the prehistoric farming and ritual practices of people who lived in the region thousands of years ago. The project highlights the important role cavers play in uncovering subterranean history.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) warns that Taiwan's energy reserves would be quickly exhausted in the event of a military blockade by mainland China. According to the think tank's analysis of 26 wargaming scenarios, Taiwan's natural gas supplies would last only 11 days, coal for seven weeks, and oil for 20 weeks. The report concludes that a blockade would not be a low-risk option for Beijing, as it would likely incur high casualties and could easily escalate into a wider conflict involving the United States, with potential missile strikes on mainland China, Guam, and Japan.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump weighed in on a controversial American Eagle advertising campaign, praising actress Sydney Sweeney and causing the company's stock to surge. The ad, which plays on the words "genes" and "jeans," drew criticism from some on social media who claimed it echoed eugenicist rhetoric, while others defended it as simple wordplay. In a Truth Social post, Trump called it the "HOTTEST ad out there" and praised Sweeney, whom he described as a registered Republican. The incident highlights the intersection of celebrity culture, marketing, and partisan politics, turning a commercial into a widely discussed cultural flashpoint. (not investment advice)</p>
