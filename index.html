          <h2>Trump's China Policy: A Chaotic Mix of Rhetoric and Risky Escalation</h2>

          <p>One hundred days into Donald Trump's return to the White House, his China policy is characterized by a mix of aggressive rhetoric, reactive measures, and potentially dangerous escalations. Despite Trump's occasional friendly remarks towards Chinese President Xi Jinping, his administration has increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 245%, reigniting a trade war with significant economic consequences. The absence of a confirmed ambassador to Beijing and a lead negotiator for China further complicates diplomatic efforts, contributing to uncertainty among allies and observers regarding the broader strategic goals of the US. Vice-President J.D. Vance's controversial comments about the Chinese people have added to the diplomatic strain.</p>

          <h2>Is College Still Worth the Investment? An Analysis of ROI</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-28 17:26:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York questions the traditional view of college as a guaranteed path to economic advancement, highlighting that a college degree may not always be worth the cost. While a typical college graduate earns significantly more than someone with only a high school diploma, about 25% of graduates see little return on their investment, earning only marginally more than high school graduates. Factors such as high out-of-pocket expenses, living on campus, taking extra time to graduate, and choosing a major with lower earning potential can diminish the value of a college education. STEM majors generally offer the highest returns, while fields like fine arts and education have the lowest. (not investment advice)</p>

The investigation identifies 65 actual or potential actions against Musk across 11 agencies, including fines to Tesla over allegations of misleading statements about its autopilot and self-driving features.

          <p>Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani expressed his government’s willingness to build a “strategic partnership” with China, a key backer of ousted ruler Bashar al-Assad. Shaibani met with the Chinese ambassador to the United Nations, Fu Cong, at UN headquarters in New York, where he had been representing Syria at a session of the Security Council. The Syrian government was seeking to “strengthen relations with China” and that the two countries “will work together to build a long-term strategic partnership in the near future”.</p>

Jenner & Block argues that the order is retaliation for free speech, violating the First Amendment, and would violate their clients' right to counsel.

          <p>Salman Toor's largest exhibition to date, “Wish Maker,” is set to open in Manhattan, showcasing the artist's contemporary scenes of queer desire and the immigrant experience. The show aims to reintroduce the artist as one of the most fascinating painters of his generation, capable of remixing old European techniques into contemporary scenes of queer desire and the immigrant experience. This was Toor’s first chance at seeing everything in one room to decide which pictures he is comfortable exhibiting at a time when his work has become more politically conflicted and emotionally raw.</p>
