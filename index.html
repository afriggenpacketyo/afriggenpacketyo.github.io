            <p>Pop star Katy Perry, along with Bezos's fiancée Lauren Sánchez and CBS presenter Gayle King, were among the six women who experienced weightlessness during the 11-minute flight that crossed the internationally recognized boundary of space. Perry expressed feeling "super connected to life" and "so connected to love" after the landing. While some critics have dismissed such ventures as mere tourism, supporters argue that they accelerate innovation and make space more accessible, although concerns persist regarding environmental impact and the exclusivity of high-cost space tourism.</p>

            <p>Rhian Butlin underwent a hysterectomy and had her appendix and bowel lining removed after doctors mistakenly diagnosed her with ovarian cancer. Biopsy results later revealed no cancer was present in those organs, leading to an apology from doctors. However, further testing revealed Butlin had a rare form of cancer in her appendix that had spread, now considered stage 4 and incurable. Butlin has begun chemotherapy, and her family has expressed disappointment with the handling of her care.</p>
