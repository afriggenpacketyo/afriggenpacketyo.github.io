        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pop Mart, the company behind the popular Labubu monster toys, has stated it is pleased with the recent drop in the toys' high resale prices. The secondary market had seen markups of over 2,000%, but increased production and cooling demand have caused prices to fall, which the company sees as a positive development for making its products accessible to genuine fans. Pop Mart is focusing on a sustainable long-term model by expanding overseas and developing original content to build character backstories. Analysts view the move as a necessary step to transition from a hype-driven phenomenon to a stable consumer brand.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury has charged former FBI Director James Comey with making false statements and obstruction of justice related to his 2020 congressional testimony. The charges stem from an investigation into his statements about the FBI's handling of inquiries into Russian election interference and Hillary Clinton's emails. Comey has declared his innocence and stated his intent to fight the charges in court, a case seen as a high-profile prosecution during the Trump administration. The indictment has drawn criticism from Democrats, who view it as a politically motivated attack on the rule of law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British energy giant BP has seen its stock value increase by over 32% since April, reducing the intense takeover speculation that surrounded the company earlier this year. This improved performance is attributed to a strategic reset, leadership changes, cost-cutting measures, and recent oil discoveries. While activist investor Elliott's arrival has pressured the company to focus on its core oil and gas business, analysts remain concerned about BP's significant debt burden. The company's focus is now on growth and delivering on its divestment program to further strengthen its financial position.</p>

          <p>A deadly sniper-style shooting at a Dallas ICE facility, which killed one detainee and wounded two others, is part of a concerning trend of long-distance attacks, according to law enforcement experts. The suspect, who died by suicide, allegedly planned the ambush-style attack for months and left behind writings indicating a desire to terrorize ICE agents. This incident follows at least seven other sniper-type shootings since July 2024, including the assassination of activist Charlie Kirk, prompting fears of copycat violence. The trend presents a significant challenge for law enforcement, leading to calls for enhanced security protocols at federal facilities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Welsh word "poody," meaning to sulk or pout, has been officially included in the Oxford English Dictionary's latest update. The term gained wider recognition after being used by contestants on the BBC show "Race Across the World," who had to explain its meaning to baffled producers. It is one of ten Welsh words added, including "nobbling" (freezing cold) and "scram" (to scratch).

          <p>As autumn begins, health officials are warning of a potential seasonal increase in both flu and COVID-19 cases, creating confusion due to their similar symptoms. While the flu often presents suddenly with fever and body aches, COVID-19 symptoms have evolved and can now resemble a common cold, though a hoarse throat has become a hallmark of recent variants. Experts stress that both viruses can cause serious illness, particularly in vulnerable populations, and are urging eligible individuals to get vaccinated. Vaccination remains the most effective defense against severe outcomes and helps reduce strain on healthcare systems during the winter months.</p>

          <p>A senior German lawmaker has cautioned against a "false sense of security" at the nation's airports regarding the threat of drones. The warning comes after several Danish airports experienced drone incursions, which are suspected to be "hybrid attacks" potentially linked to Russia. German officials have also blamed Moscow for drone sightings over military and industrial sites, prompting calls for upgraded drone defenses and reforms to aviation security laws. Security experts are urging for a more unified national approach to counter these threats to critical infrastructure.</p>

          <p>A North Carolina Democratic state representative, Marcia Morey, is facing criticism for stating there is "no correlation" between the murder of a Ukrainian refugee and the accused killer's 14 prior releases from jail. The case has intensified the debate over the state's bail system, with critics arguing that lenient policies endanger public safety by allowing repeat offenders to remain free. Republicans are pushing for reforms, dubbed "Iryna's Law," to tighten bail requirements for violent criminals. Supporters of the current system contend it prevents the unfair punishment of low-income defendants who cannot afford to pay for their release.</p>

          <p>The European Union is reportedly preparing to launch approximately 20 new anti-dumping investigations against China in the coming weeks, according to a former trade commissioner. This move reflects growing frustration in Brussels over Beijing's trade policies, including industrial overcapacity and the perceived "weaponization" of its dominance in critical raw materials. The EU is also concerned that U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods will cause a diversion of discounted products into the European market, threatening local producers. The potential probes signal a more assertive trade stance from the EU towards China.</p>

One new study involves kidney transplants on monkeys sourced from Alpha Genesis, a South Carolina primate farm that has faced criticism over animal welfare.

The White House budget aims to cut Education Department funding by 15%, eliminating support for English language learners, while the House version includes an unprecedented cut to Title I funding for disadvantaged schools.

          <p>President Trump's recent suggestion that pregnant women should avoid Tylenol due to a purported link to autism has been strongly refuted by medical experts and the FDA. Scholars note this claim follows a historical pattern of wrongly blaming mothers for autism, citing the discredited "refrigerator mom" theory of the mid-20th century and the disproven link between vaccines and autism. Experts worry that such misinformation puts pregnant women in a difficult position, as untreated pain or fever can pose serious health risks. They emphasize that there is no established causal link between acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, and autism.</p>

This pattern includes the government taking stakes in companies like Intel and demanding a percentage of chip sales to China.

          <p>The mother of Barnaby Webber, one of the victims of the 2023 Nottingham attacks, has condemned the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) as "inhumane." Her criticism follows allegations that IOPC staff suggested their investigation into police conduct was "politically motivated" by the victims' families and that officers would face minimal repercussions. The IOPC had reopened its inquiry into Leicestershire Police's prior interactions with the killer, Valdo Calocane. The watchdog has since removed some staff from the case and commissioned an external review into the allegations.</p>

          <p>Shipping analysts report that carriers are already beginning to reduce the deployment of Chinese-built vessels on transpacific routes ahead of new U.S. port fees. Data from Sea Intelligence shows a downward trend in the share of Chinese-built ships on routes to both the U.S. West and East Coasts in recent weeks. This proactive shift suggests that shipping lines are attempting to mitigate the financial impact of the impending U.S. policy. Despite this, major carriers like Cosco Shipping Lines have publicly affirmed their commitment to maintaining stable service to the American market.</p>

          <p>A large-scale search is in progress for a 44-year-old diver, identified as Bryson Higashi, who went missing in the waters near Hanalei Bay, Kauai. Higashi was last seen on Tuesday afternoon, and an alert was raised after his truck was found unattended for a full day. The U.S. Coast Guard is leading the search, which involves a response boat, a helicopter, an airplane, and a cutter, in coordination with local police, fire departments, and natural resources officials. Search conditions are challenging, with strong winds, moderate seas, and occasional showers reducing visibility in the area.</p>

          <p>Following the landfall of Super Typhoon Ragasa in Guangdong province, workers are focused on restoring communication and power to islands that were severely impacted. The storm, the world's most powerful this year, brought torrential rain and winds up to 265km/h, damaging undersea cables and causing outages on the islands of Shangchuan and Xiachuan. Over one million people in Guangdong were evacuated ahead of the typhoon, which had previously caused fatalities in the Philippines and Taiwan. As of Friday morning, no typhoon-related casualties had been reported in the mainland Chinese province.</p>

          <p>At the UN General Assembly, Finnish Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen asserted that diplomacy has failed with Russia and that the country "understands only military power." She emphasized the need for credible deterrence and defense to compel Russia to negotiate, refuting claims that NATO and the EU declared war on Russia. Her comments come as EU states are set to hold talks on creating a "drone wall" to bolster defenses. Valtonen also highlighted Russia's hybrid warfare tactics, which she said extend globally, citing its destabilizing actions in Africa's Sahel region.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cities worldwide, including New York, London, and Toronto, are experiencing a significant increase in rat populations, a phenomenon some are calling "Ratmageddon." Experts point to several contributing factors, including increased waste from fast food and less frequent rubbish collection, but a key driver appears to be rising global temperatures. Warmer winters allow rats, which are prolific breeders, to reproduce more successfully throughout the year. A recent study found a strong correlation between temperature increases and rising rat activity in major cities, suggesting that climate change will continue to exacerbate the problem of urban rodent infestations.</p>

Key factors likely to decide the outcome include performance in the opening foursomes sessions, the ability to manage the notoriously boisterous New York crowd, and the influence of veteran players.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis highlights the fundamental difference between China's state-led, long-term economic planning and the United States' market-driven, often reactive approach. China's system, evolving from Soviet-style targets to the comprehensive Five-Year Plans formulated by the NDRC, allows for proactive, strategic goal-setting in areas like industrial policy and economic rebalancing. In contrast, the U.S. system, which relies on the "invisible hand" of the market and a politically polarized budgeting process, struggles to implement coherent, long-range strategies. This divergence in governance philosophy is a key factor in the economic competition between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the deadly January wildfires in Los Angeles County found that the emergency response was slowed by insufficient resources, staffing shortages, and outdated alert policies. The report, commissioned after the Eaton and Palisades fires killed over 30 people, identified "communications vulnerabilities" that led to delayed evacuation warnings for some neighborhoods. Critical issues included a high number of sheriff's deputy vacancies, an under-resourced emergency management office, and unreliable communication systems. The review praised the heroic actions of first responders but concluded that systemic weaknesses need to be addressed to improve public safety.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has signaled his irritation with Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, comparing his economic ideas to those of former Conservative PM Liz Truss. The internal friction comes as the Labour Party grapples with how to counter the rise of Reform UK and define its own political direction. Starmer is set to argue that the choice is between the "politics of predatory grievance" and "patriotic renewal." The public disagreement highlights a perceived lack of clear direction from the new government, a vacuum that critics like Burnham are attempting to fill, much to the frustration of Downing Street.</p>
