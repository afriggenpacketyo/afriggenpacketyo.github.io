          <p>Following the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, the next phase of the Gaza peace plan faces significant hurdles. Key unresolved issues include the post-war governance of Gaza, Israel's demand for Hamas to disarm, and Palestinian calls for statehood, all of which are points of contention. The plan also proposes an international security force and requires substantial funding for reconstruction, but the deep-seated mistrust between Israel and Hamas makes future negotiations fragile.</p>

          <p>This article revisits Orson Welles' 1938 radio broadcast of "The War of the Worlds," examining its historical context and the public reaction it provoked. It discusses how the realistic news-bulletin format led to some panic, which was later exaggerated by newspapers seeking to discredit the newer medium of radio. The broadcast serves as a timeless case study on the power of media, the importance of source credibility, and the need for critical consumption of information, especially in today's era of social media and AI-generated content.</p>

          <p>In a recent podcast interview, former President Barack Obama criticized businesses, universities, and law firms for compromising their principles by making deals with the Trump administration. He argued that these institutions have the capacity and resources to resist being bullied and should have stood firm on their core values, such as academic independence and diversity initiatives. Obama suggested that while taking a stand can be uncomfortable, it is essential for maintaining institutional integrity in the face of political pressure.</p>

          <p>This article explains the conditions under which a homeowner can remain in their house after taking out a reverse mortgage. Generally, borrowers can stay in their home for the rest of their lives, provided they use it as their primary residence and meet all loan obligations. These obligations include paying property taxes, maintaining homeowners insurance, and keeping the property in good condition. The loan becomes due and payable if the borrower moves out, passes away, or fails to meet these essential requirements.</p>
