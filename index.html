        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Scottish government has decided to postpone plans for a new misogyny law until after next year's Holyrood election. Ministers cited the need to carefully consider the recent Supreme Court judgement on the definition of a woman as the reason for the delay. Instead of introducing a standalone bill, the government intends to amend existing hate crime legislation to provide protections on the basis of sex. Legislation to end conversion therapy has also been delayed, with the government hoping for a UK-wide solution.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street's forecasts, although profits decreased compared to the previous year due to lower crude oil prices. The company's earnings were $1.76 per share, surpassing the expected $1.73, while revenue reached $83.13 billion, falling short of the anticipated $86.72 billion. Despite a 6% profit decline, Exxon's performance was bolstered by volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, coupled with cost-cutting measures. The company returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, with capital expenditures aligning with the projected $27 billion to $29 billion for 2025.

          <p>The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has announced that transgender women are now barred from competing in all levels of women's cricket, effective immediately. The updated transgender regulations state that only individuals whose biological sex is female will be eligible to participate in women's and girls' cricket. Transgender women and girls are still permitted to play in open and mixed cricket categories. The policy change follows a UK Supreme Court ruling on April 15, which defined a woman based on biological sex.</p>

Reform UK also secured numerous local council seats, capitalizing on voter dissatisfaction with both Labour and the Conservative Party.

The trial is expected to last at least eight weeks, with Cassandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, expected to testify. Cassie previously sued Combs, accusing him of sexual assault and physical abuse, but the case was settled shortly after filing.</p>

Additionally, tariffs imposed by Trump have raised the cost of materials like steel for these companies. Some companies are already scaling back operations in response to these economic pressures.

          <p>A federal judge in Texas has ruled that the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act (AEA) cannot be used by the Trump administration to deport Venezuelan immigrants alleged to be gang members. Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr stated that Trump's use of the act exceeds its scope, as the alleged gang members have not staged an "organized armed attack" and Venezuela has not attacked the US. The ruling is the first permanent injunction to directly address whether the government can use the AEA to deport migrants alleged to be members of Tren de Aragua.</p>

          <p>Russell Brand appeared in a London court on multiple sexual assault charges, including two counts of sexual assault. The 14-minute hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court was the first procedural step in what is likely to be a lengthy legal process. Brand, who has denied all charges, confirmed his name, date of birth, and address. The case has been referred to a higher court, with the first hearing scheduled for May 30, though any trial might only begin "a year from now" due to judicial backlogs.</p>

She asserts that the SAVE Act is a modern-day version of Jim Crow laws, placing unnecessary burdens on voters and undermining decades of hard-fought constitutional rights.
