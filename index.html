          <p>A new exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago, titled "Gustave Caillebotte: Painting His World," is bringing fresh attention to a lesser-known French Impressionist painter. While Caillebotte is recognized for his iconic "Paris Street; Rainy Day," the exhibition highlights his unconventional focus on male subjects, a theme that scandalized the 19th-century art establishment. The show explores how Caillebotte depicted men in intimate, interior settings, challenging traditional notions of masculinity for the era. This has sparked contemporary debate over the artist's personal life and the interpretation of his work.</p>

          <p>Utah Governor Spencer Cox has stated that the suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, identified as 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, is not cooperating with the investigation. While Robinson has not confessed, Cox noted that those around him, including his roommate, are providing information to authorities. Officials have not yet established a clear motive for the attack, though the governor mentioned that initial information from family and acquaintances suggested the suspect was influenced by leftist ideology. Formal charges are expected to be filed soon.</p>

          <p>In Altadena, California, residents who lost homes and businesses in the devastating Eaton fire have formed the Altadena Dining Club to support struggling local restaurants and foster community connection. Founded by a resident who lost her own apartment, the club organizes weekly gatherings at different eateries, providing a vital economic boost and a space for shared healing. For many members, the club offers a unique sense of belonging and understanding among people who have experienced similar trauma. Mental health experts note that such community-led initiatives are a powerful model for post-disaster recovery, helping to rebuild social bonds that were fractured by the tragedy.</p>

          <h2>Columnist Argues Against U.S. Tipping Culture, Criticizing New 'No Tax on Tips' Law</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 10:00:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A columnist argues that the American culture of tipping has become excessive and is being further entrenched by President Trump's "no tax on tips" law. While the law benefits some workers, the author contends it shifts the burden of paying a living wage from employers to consumers and creates more social pressure to tip for every service. The article critiques the temporary nature of the tax break and questions the eligibility list, which includes professions like digital content creators and plumbers but excludes others like postal workers and teachers.

          <h2>Social Media Influencers Promote 'Cortisol Cocktail' for Stress and Weight Loss, but Experts Urge Caution</h2>

          <p>A "cortisol cocktail" has become a popular trend on social media, with influencers claiming the non-alcoholic drink can reduce stress, boost energy, and aid weight loss by lowering levels of the stress hormone cortisol. The mocktail typically includes ingredients like coconut water, orange juice, and salt, which contain nutrients that can be depleted by stress. While medical experts acknowledge the potential hydration and electrolyte benefits, they caution that there is no direct scientific evidence proving the drink's efficacy in reducing cortisol levels. Health professionals instead recommend foundational wellness habits like a healthy diet, exercise, and proper sleep to manage stress.</p>

          <p>Romania has reported that a Russian drone breached its airspace during a Russian attack on Ukrainian infrastructure near the Danube border, making it the second NATO country to report such an incident. This follows a similar event where Poland shot down at least three Russian drones that had entered its airspace earlier in the week. The incursion has been condemned by EU officials as an unacceptable violation of sovereignty, prompting Poland to place its air defense systems on high alert. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated the act was an "obvious expansion of the war by Russia," while Moscow has not commented.</p>

          <p>In a public act of defiance, Jon Green, the Democratic chair of the Johnson County Board of Supervisors in Iowa, has refused to follow the Republican governor's order to fly flags at half-staff for slain activist Charlie Kirk. Green condemned the killing but stated he would not honor a man he described as denigrating marginalized communities and harming the country's political fabric. The decision has drawn criticism from the governor and some state Democrats, but has been supported by another supervisor who cited Kirk's divisive rhetoric as a reason not to bestow the honor.</p>

The blast, which occurred on Saturday night, was powerful enough to shake nearby homes and scatter debris across the street.

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Jon Meacham warns that the United States is in a dangerous place.

Meacham asserts that when citizens lose the ability to engage in peaceful debate and dissent, it breaks the American covenant of living in contention without resorting to violence.

          <p>Ukraine has conducted a successful drone strike on the Kirishi oil refinery, one of Russia's largest, located in the northwestern Leningrad region. The attack caused a fire and explosions at the facility, which is operated by oil major Surgutneftegas and is a top producer of crude oil in the country. This strike is part of a sustained Ukrainian campaign targeting Russian oil infrastructure, which Kyiv says is crucial to fueling Moscow's war effort. The attacks have contributed to domestic gasoline shortages in Russia, leading the government to temporarily ban gasoline exports to stabilize the market.</p>

          <p>A historical review of the U.S. Constitution emphasizes its original design as a dynamic and amendable framework, rather than a static relic. Historian Jill Lepore and National Constitution Center CEO Jeffrey Rosen explain that the founders expected the document to be constantly revised to reflect an evolving nation, a process exemplified by the initial inclusion of the Bill of Rights. The article highlights that the Constitution was born from compromises, including over slavery, and was later transformed by amendments that sought to fulfill the Declaration of Independence's promise of equality. It notes a modern departure from this vision, with constitutional change now often driven by Supreme Court reinterpretations rather than the amendment process.</p>

          <p>Amazon is expanding its use of artificial intelligence with "Hear the Highlights," a feature that provides AI-voiced audio summaries of product information and customer reviews. While intended to simplify the shopping experience, the feature raises concerns about whether an AI can effectively capture the nuance and context found in human reviews. Critics worry that by distilling thousands of comments, the AI may overlook critical niche feedback, particularly on safety issues, and could unintentionally blend promotional marketing language with genuine user experiences. The technology is seen as a step toward more interactive, conversational AI shopping agents, but its current implementation risks losing the unique, personal insights that make customer reviews valuable.</p>

Critics also point out that the administration has recently cut funding for the very FDA and CDC programs responsible for successful tobacco control and anti-vaping campaigns.

The meeting aims to address the escalating trade disagreements that have intensified since U.S. President Donald Trump renewed his tariff war earlier in the year. The discussions are being led by the respective representatives, He Lifeng for China and Kevin Bessent for the U.S. This series of negotiations in Europe represents a continued effort by both global economic powers to find a resolution to their mounting trade disputes.</p>

          <h2>Recent Media Moves Suggest Growing Influence of Right-Wing Perspectives in Mainstream News</h2>

          <p>A series of recent developments in the U.S. media landscape has sparked concerns about the increasing influence of right-wing figures and perspectives within mainstream news organizations. At CBS News, a Trump ally was installed as ombudsman shortly after a family friendly with the president sealed control of its parent company, Paramount. This comes as Paramount reportedly considers acquiring CNN's parent company and a settlement ensures Fox News will maintain its conservative direction. Media critics worry these moves represent a capitulation to right-wing political pressure and could threaten press freedoms by reshaping the editorial posture of storied journalistic institutions.</p>

          <p>The fatal shooting of Charlie Kirk at Utah Valley University has brought renewed attention to the state's permissive gun laws, particularly a recent bill allowing permitted individuals to openly carry firearms on college campuses. While it remains unclear if the suspect legally possessed the weapon on campus, the incident highlights the broader legislative environment in Utah, which lacks red-flag laws and allows permitless concealed carry. Advocates for these laws argue they deter crime, but critics suggest they are inadequate for preventing politically motivated violence and create complex safety challenges for securing public events.</p>

          <h2>'Make America Healthy Again' Campaign Adds to Stress and Financial Burden for Parents, Critics Say</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) campaign, led by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., may be inadvertently increasing the pressure and workload on parents, particularly mothers. The movement's strict dietary guidelines, which condemn ingredients like seed oils and processed foods, force parents into time-consuming and expensive shopping habits, often requiring visits to multiple stores to find approved products. Critics argue that while the campaign's goals may be well-intentioned, it creates additional stress without providing sufficient federal support. The administration's plans, such as food box deliveries, are tied to programs that have seen funding cuts, leaving parents to navigate the challenges alone.</p>

          <p>Texas Longhorns quarterback Arch Manning is facing mounting pressure after another underwhelming performance, during which he was booed by his own fans in a 27-10 victory over UTEP. Manning, who began the season as a Heisman Trophy favorite, has struggled with accuracy, completing only 55% of his passes through three games. After the game, Manning acknowledged his poor play, stating, "I’ve got to play better." Coach Steve Sarkisian expressed confidence that he can help the quarterback improve, while teammates voiced their continued support for the highly-touted player from the famous football family.</p>

          <p>This archival article from 2008 examines the murder investigation of British student Meredith Kercher in Perugia, Italy, and the subsequent case against her American roommate, Amanda Knox. The report details the intense police interrogation that led to Knox's confession, which she later recanted, and the prosecution's theory of a sex game gone wrong. It explores the evidence presented by Italian police, including contested DNA on a knife, alongside a private investigator's view that Knox was being "railroaded" and that the evidence pointed solely to another suspect, Rudy Guede. The case was characterized by a global media frenzy, which heavily focused on Knox's personal life.</p>

          <p>This archival report investigates the mysterious 2005 disappearance of George Smith from his honeymoon cruise, a case the FBI has since closed without resolution. Suspicion initially fell on his widow but later shifted to a group of young men last seen with him, whose accounts contained inconsistencies. The investigation uncovered questionable alibis, failed polygraphs, and a provocative video made by some of the men shortly after Smith vanished, in which they made callous remarks about his death. Despite evidence of a struggle and bloodstains in his cabin, the case remains officially unsolved, leaving Smith's family still searching for answers and justice.</p>

          <p>In a remarkable act of bravery, surgeons at the Kyiv Heart Institute performed a life-saving heart transplant on a 12-year-old girl during one of the most intense Russian missile and drone attacks on the city. Dr. Borys Todurov and his team drove through explosions to retrieve the donor heart from another hospital and completed the surgery as their own building shook from the nearby blasts. The recipient, Kira Skliarova, whose heart was severely weakened by childhood illness, is now recovering well. The donor was a 4-year-old girl who died in an accident, and her mother later visited Kira to listen to her daughter's heart beating.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The family of Virginia Giuffre has publicly stated that Lord Mandelson should never have been appointed as the UK's ambassador to the United States due to his close relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Giuffre's brother called the appointment a sign of "deep corruption" in government systems. Lord Mandelson was recently dismissed from the post after emails were published showing he sent supportive messages to Epstein as he faced jail time in 2008. A UK government official admitted that had the full extent of the relationship been known, it is "highly unlikely" Mandelson would have been appointed.</p>

          <p>A scrapbook compiled for Jeffrey Epstein's 50th birthday, recently released by House Democrats, has revived scrutiny over the extent to which his powerful associates were aware of his criminal activities. The book, assembled by Ghislaine Maxwell, contains numerous messages with sexual innuendo, including an alleged note attributed to Donald Trump stating, "We have certain things in common." The book also lists former President Bill Clinton and other prominent figures as "friends," raising further questions about the social circles that enabled Epstein's long history of child-sex trafficking. Trump has denied the authenticity of the note and is suing over its prior reporting.</p>
