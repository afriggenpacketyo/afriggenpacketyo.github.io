          <p>The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, and Poland made a joint visit to Kyiv, Ukraine, pledging to intensify pressure on Russia for a full, unconditional 30-day ceasefire. The leaders paid tribute to fallen Ukrainian soldiers and discussed strengthening the Ukrainian military to ensure a lasting peace. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that President Volodymyr Zelensky and the four other European leaders spoke with President Trump about the ceasefire and confidence-building measures that can pave the way to peace negotiations. The visit underscores Europeâ€™s commitment to Ukraine amidst the ongoing war with Russia and comes after Russia's celebration of the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.</p>

          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire, ending escalating tensions following an attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir, according to Pakistan's Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar. President Trump announced the ceasefire on Truth Social, highlighting US mediation efforts led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance. Earlier, Indian officials reported Pakistani attacks on multiple locations and troop movements into forward areas, but denied any damage to India's military infrastructure. Tensions have been rising since an April attack on Hindu tourists in Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistani-backed militants.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz criticized Democratic lawmakers, including Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, for advocating for the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an alleged MS-13 gang member, to the U.S. after his deportation to El Salvador. Cruz accused Democrats of prioritizing illegal immigrants and gang members over U.S. citizens, citing evidence that Abrego Garcia was identified as an MS-13 member by the Prince George's County Police Gang Unit. Van Hollen defended his advocacy, stating that Abrego Garcia's issues need to be litigated in the courts. The article notes that Abrego Garcia also faces allegations of domestic violence.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972 but stranded in Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction, re-entered the atmosphere after 53 years. The European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking confirmed the uncontrolled reentry, and the European Space Agency also indicated Kosmos 482 had reentered after it failed to appear over a German radar station. Experts predicted that some or all of the half-ton spacecraft, designed to withstand Venus's harsh conditions, might survive the descent. The chances of anyone being hit by debris were considered exceedingly low.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily halted the Trump administration's government overhaul, ruling that Congress did not authorize large-scale staffing cuts and agency restructuring. Judge Susan Illston sided with unions, non-profits, and local governments in blocking mass layoffs for 14 days, stating that the President may only broadly restructure federal agencies when authorized by Congress. The ruling is the broadest of its kind against the government overhaul led by Elon Musk's "department of government efficiency". The plaintiffs argued that the administration's reorganization efforts have disrupted critical services and exceeded its authority.</p>

          <p>The U.S. air traffic control system is under increasing strain due to staffing shortages, underinvestment, and outdated infrastructure, highlighted by a recent equipment failure in Philadelphia that caused significant flight delays.

Airlines and labor unions are calling for urgent upgrades and improved staffing to address the chronic problems, particularly around New York City's busy airspace.

Despite Trump's calls for rate cuts, Powell has expressed confidence in the economy and dismissed any idea of pre-emptive cuts. Economists suggest Powell is in a no-win situation, with tariffs and other factors creating uncertainty, making it difficult to determine the appropriate course of action.

          <p>Researchers have determined that a spear tip carved from bone, unearthed in Russia in 2003, dates back 80,000 years, indicating it was not created by modern humans. Since Homo sapiens didn't venture into Europe until about 45,000 years ago, the creators were most likely Neanderthals. This discovery suggests that Neanderthals had advanced beyond stone tools, using techniques previously attributed only to modern humans. The spear tip joins other recent finds demonstrating Neanderthals' proficiency in bone toolmaking, challenging previous assumptions about their technological capabilities.</p>

After struggling with frequent illnesses and hospitalizations, the family enrolled in a clinical trial testing an investigational gene therapy developed by Rocket Pharmaceuticals. The therapy, which involves using a patient's own stem cells, has been successful in producing healthy immune cells capable of fighting infections. Five years after participating in the study, the Langenhop children are doing well and have not had to return to the hospital for treatment. The therapy is now under review with the Food and Drug Administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump's crypto agenda is facing challenges due to concerns that his personal cryptocurrency ventures have created conflicts of interest. Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act, a bill meant to establish federal rules for stablecoins, citing concerns that individuals can enrich Trump by buying cryptocurrencies he owns or controls. Democrats have also introduced the "End Crypto Corruption Act" to prohibit elected officials and their families from issuing or endorsing digital assets. Some investors and entrepreneurs believe Trump's pursuit of personal profits is hindering advancements in the crypto industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses how the rise of part-time work and just-in-time scheduling has created a new form of exploitation, where workers are given too few hours rather than too many. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) set limits on how many hours an employer could demand, but employers have circumvented the FLSA by hiring multiple part-time staff instead of one full-time worker. This precarious employment results in unstable incomes and makes it difficult for workers to access social safety net programs. The article suggests Congress should consider reforms such as requiring employers to set schedules in advance and incentivizing full-time employment.</p>

The event serves as a reminder of the Cold War space race and the Soviet Union's ambitions in exploring the solar system.

China has also introduced new economic weapons, such as export controls and antimonopoly laws, to counter actions from other countries. While China still relies on the West for some advanced technologies, its willingness to weaponize the supply chain challenges the supremacy of the United States.</p>
