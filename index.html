          <p>Shares of Pop Mart, the company behind the popular Labubu figurines, experienced a significant drop after Morgan Stanley removed the stock from its focus list. This decline was further exacerbated by Chinese state media calling for stricter regulation of "blind box" toys, a concept central to Pop Mart's business model where consumers purchase unmarked boxes hoping for rare collectibles. The People's Daily criticized the blind box phenomenon, particularly its impact on children, advocating for tighter controls. Additionally, Chinese customs officials have been cracking down on counterfeit Labubu products, adding to the company's challenges. The stock is on track for its first negative week since May.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump did not publicly acknowledge Juneteenth this year, a stark contrast to his previous four years in office when he issued statements and even claimed to have made the holiday "very famous." This silence deviates from earlier White House guidance suggesting he would sign a Juneteenth proclamation. Instead, Trump shared statements on other topics, including Iran and TikTok. He later criticized non-working holidays as costly. Trump's earlier Juneteenth statements invoked the historical significance of the day and honored the contributions of African Americans, and in 2020, he postponed a Tulsa rally due to criticism over its Juneteenth timing and location.</p>

          <p>The recent exchanges between Israel and Iran have highlighted the effectiveness of Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system, reigniting discussions about the proposed Golden Dome multi-layered missile defense system in the United States. While the Iron Dome protects Israel from missile attacks, the U.S. seeks to defend its homeland from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles through the Golden Dome project. The project faces challenges including technological obstacles and a hefty price tag, but defense companies are vying for a piece of the pie. The Golden Dome Caucus has been formed to support Trump's plans, with significant funding allocated for missile defense and space programs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trade Minister Douglas Alexander suggests that public support for international aid spending has declined, even if financial constraints were not a factor. He argues that the case for investing in foreign aid needs to be re-evaluated, citing reversals in aid funding in countries like the United States, France, and Germany. This comes as Prime Minister Keir Starmer plans to cut the international aid budget to fund increased defense spending, a move criticized by charities. While some argue that public support remains strong, Alexander believes a cultural shift has occurred, requiring a renewed effort to demonstrate the value of international aid.</p>

          <p>Experts are raising concerns that children with lazy eyes are increasingly being missed for treatment due to the lack of early screenings in schools. Some local councils are unable to provide this service because of budget or capacity issues. The British and Irish Orthoptic Society (BIOS) advocates for universal screening in schools, similar to practices in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, as treatment is most effective before age seven. The LGA is calling for increased funding for public health to support school-based screenings, and while the government has announced a Â£200m boost, experts emphasize the importance of regular NHS-funded eye tests for children.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have created a low-cost, edible protein-based coating that more than doubles the shelf life of various fruits by reducing moisture loss and inhibiting microbial growth. Tested on 17 types of whole and cut fruits, the coating delayed rot by nearly a week or more, costing only 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit. The researchers at Shaanxi Normal University say this eco-friendly strategy is as effective as existing preservation methods, while reducing carbon dioxide emissions and the potential for toxicity. This innovation offers a promising solution to global food waste, as approximately one-third of all food produced is wasted, mostly perishable items like fruits and vegetables.</p>

This transit comes as a UK carrier strike group arrives in the Indo-Pacific for an eight-month deployment.

Economists are closely monitoring food prices, especially rice, as they heavily influence future inflation trends, and the government's efforts to reduce rice prices could stimulate household spending.

          <p>A federal appeals court has extended its block of a judge's order that would have directed President Trump to return control of California's National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom. The unanimous order allows the continued deployment of approximately 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles, where they are protecting federal property and U.S. immigration agents during enforcement operations. Newsom objects to the use of troops and sued the president. The court found that Trump likely lawfully exercised his statutory authority to federalize the National Guard under Title 10, citing instances of protesters interfering with immigration agents.</p>

          <p>The 18-month saga over Nippon Steel Corp.'s buyout of United States Steel Corp. reveals the increasing vulnerability of businesses in the U.S. market, according to analysts. Trump's administration's blocking of the deal, driven by political motives, suggests that executives can no longer base decisions solely on business criteria. This wrangling could deter global companies from making substantial investments in the U.S., leading them to reduce their exposure. Despite Trump's approval, Nippon Steel had to commit to investing $11 billion and accept a golden share for the U.S. government, highlighting the challenges foreign companies face in the U.S.</p>

          <h2>Shark Attacks and Conservation Efforts Highlighted on Jaws Anniversary</h2>

          <p>As Americans commemorate the 50th anniversary of "Jaws," recent shark attacks are grabbing headlines, even as activists emphasize the importance of shark conservation. Despite reported attacks, experts say the rise in sightings is due to more people in the water, improved technology, and successful conservation efforts, not an increase in shark populations. Shark Angels founder Julie Andersen notes that white shark populations are rebounding in areas like California and Cape Cod. In Florida, New Smyrna Beach is known as the "shark bite capital of the world," but most bites are minor. One athlete is swimming around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness of shark protection.</p>

          <p>China has been urged to leverage the resumption of visits to Tibet by Indian pilgrims to improve relations between the two countries, which have experienced years of tension. After a five-year suspension due to COVID-19 and border disputes, China is allowing pilgrims to return to the Tibet autonomous region this summer. The sites are sacred to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and followers of Bon. Approximately 750 of the 5,561 applicants will be permitted to travel along two routes between June and August. Some analysts suggest these pilgrimages could play a positive role in stabilizing China-India relations during times of crisis.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned as a government whip in protest over the government's planned cuts to disability benefits. Foxcroft expressed understanding of the need to address the welfare bill but opposed cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit. She felt unable to effect change from within the government. The government defends the reforms as necessary to fix a broken welfare system, ensuring support for those who cannot work and encouraging those who can to find employment. The bill, which tightens criteria for personal independence payments and cuts the sickness-related element of universal credit, faces potential rebellion from Labour MPs.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has decided to keep its benchmark lending rates steady, following a reduction last month and a trade agreement with the United States. The People's Bank of China held the one-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the five-year LPR at 3.5%. This decision comes after China and the U.S. agreed to honor a consensus reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade while suspending tariffs. This trade truce has provided Beijing with some room to support its currency and has raised hopes that any economic impact will be smaller than anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

The case garnered significant attention due to the conflicting evidence and allegations of a coverup, and the initial trial ended in a hung jury.</p>
