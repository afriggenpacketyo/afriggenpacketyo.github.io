          <p>Gold has risen to become the world's second-largest reserve asset, driven by central banks' increasing appetite for the precious metal as a hedge against inflation and a means of diversifying their holdings. According to a European Central Bank report, central banks' gold stockpiles are near levels last seen in the 1960s, making gold second only to the U.S. dollar in value terms. While China, India, and Turkey have been leading drivers of the gold rally, analysts suggest that central bank purchases may slow in the coming months. Despite a recent period of choppiness in the market, some experts advise investors to maintain exposure to gold due to expected turbulence in stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is experiencing escalating tensions between President Trump and California Governor Newsom due to ongoing protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and mass arrests. Mayor Karen Bass issued an overnight curfew for downtown LA following clashes between police and protesters.

          <p>The American Bar Association (ABA) has criticized the Department of Justice's decision to exclude the organization from the judicial nomination process. ABA President William Bay expressed "surprise and disappointment" in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, arguing that the decision restricts access to judicial nominees without justification. Bondi accused the ABA of bias towards Democratic nominees, a claim Bay refuted by highlighting the ABA's ratings of President Trump's Supreme Court nominees. The ABA has been involved in rating judicial nominees for seven decades, and this decision marks a significant departure from established practice.</p>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is seeking to revoke a key Biden administration rule that limits carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin argued that the Trump administration can both protect the environment and grow the economy, claiming the Biden-era rules would "suffocate our economy." The EPA also plans to repeal updated limits to the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards rule, despite data showing the rule has significantly reduced mercury air emissions. Critics argue that the rollbacks could be dangerous, with the Natural Resources Defense Council stating they are prepared to sue the EPA.</p>

House Republicans are considering tariff revenue to offset tax and spending bill losses, but the long-term impact and economic implications remain debated. The revenue from tariffs is a relatively small percentage of the money the government makes from taxes.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the UK government's Spending Review, outlining budgets for departments over the next three years, which includes increased funding for the NHS, defense, and housing. The review allocates a 3% annual real-terms increase for NHS spending and significant funds for social and affordable housing. However, other departments, including the Home Office, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), and the Foreign Office, will face budget cuts. The plans include ambitious long-term infrastructure investments, but many projects may not materialize until the 2030s.</p>

          <p>Harvey Weinstein was convicted on one count of engaging in a criminal sex act but acquitted on a second count in his New York sex crimes retrial, with the jury unable to reach a verdict on the third count of rape. The split verdict followed apparent discord among jurors, with the foreperson expressing an inability to continue deliberating with the other jurors. Weinstein complained that the jury's behavior was depriving him of a fair trial. The jurors will resume deliberations on the rape count involving Jessica Mann.</p>

Hodges, the Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage, the resolution, written by Denny Burk, a professor at Boyce College, argues for "restoring moral clarity through God's design for gender, marriage and family." The resolution was approved by Southern Baptist delegates, known as "messengers," following little debate on the resolution's language. The Southern Baptist Convention has a long history of opposing LGBTQ+ rights and previously focused on opposing abortion before the overturn of Roe v. Wade in 2022.</p>

          <p>An uneasy calm has settled over Los Angeles after the first night of a curfew, with nearly 400 people arrested amid ongoing protests over President Trump's immigration raids. The city's police department reported arrests for failure to disperse, curfew violations, firearm possession, and assault on a police officer, while two officers were injured. Trump's deployment of troops to LA has escalated tensions with state officials, who accuse him of an "assault" on democracy. The National Guard and Marine Corps forces deployed do not have the authority to make arrests, only to detain protesters.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's trade war is facing increasing criticism as the U.S. economy slows while China's thrives. Despite initial claims of being fast, easy, and cheap, the tariffs are proving to be costly and unproductive. Courts are ruling against Trump's tariffs, and public opinion mistrusts them. Trump is expected to blame fellow Americans for the failure of his trade war, framing the tariffs as a patriotic sacrifice. The article argues that Trump's global trade war has always been subordinate to his domestic culture war, leading to a doomed conflict without justification or consent.</p>

          <p>The U.S. budget deficit increased in May, reaching $316 billion and pushing the year-to-date total to $1.36 trillion.

Tax revenue has increased, but expenditures are also up, contributing to the growing shortfall.
