          <p>Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was arrested on charges of obstructing immigration enforcement, accused of intentionally misdirecting federal agents away from an undocumented immigrant being pursued in her courtroom. Judge Dugan, known for her progressive stance and work with marginalized groups, is alleged to have directed the individual through a side door while agents waited in the hallway. A statement issued on her behalf asserts she will vigorously defend herself and maintains her commitment to due process and the rule of law. Judge Dugan was elected in 2016, unseating a Republican appointee, and was unopposed for re-election in 2022, with her current term expiring in 2028.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has launched an investigation into the New York Department of Education (NYDOE) over its ban on Native American-inspired sports mascots, specifically targeting the Massapequa School District's continued use of the 'Chiefs' mascot. The NYDOE mandate requires public schools to retire such mascots or risk losing state funding, prompting a lawsuit from several Long Island school districts. The Trump administration, prompted by a complaint from the Native American Guardian's Association (NAGA), claims the ban violates federal civil rights law, arguing that it unfairly singles out Native American heritage while other mascots referencing indigenous or ethnic groups are allowed. NAGA asserts that preserving Native themes and imagery in schools is a fundamental civil right, and the Massapequa Board of Education has expressed gratitude for the Trump administration's involvement.</p>

          <p>An upcoming mini-heatwave in the UK is expected to provide a temporary boost to nature, benefiting migratory birds and butterflies. While a brief warm spell will not significantly alter the overall impact of climate change, it offers a welcomed opportunity for nature lovers to enjoy the spring season. Wildlife charities urge caution to prevent wildfires, as dry conditions create a high risk, especially in heathlands, which are vulnerable ecosystems. Climate change contributes to more frequent and intense wildfires, threatening wildlife and their habitats during critical breeding seasons.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that federal authorities can again seek reporters’ phone records and compel their testimony in leak investigations, reversing a Biden administration policy. The change aims to protect a broader range of government secrets, including classified and privileged information. First Amendment advocates had anticipated the reversal given President Trump’s critical stance toward the press and his complaints about leaks.

Critics argue that these audits threaten the ability of universities to engage in global partnerships, while proponents claim that transparency is necessary to protect American interests.

          <p>Donald Trump stated that Russia and Ukraine are 'very close to a deal' and called for high-level officials to meet to finalize it, suggesting that 'most of the major points are agreed to'. This announcement came shortly after Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Vladimir Putin in Moscow to discuss a US-brokered peace plan. However, Ukraine has repeatedly stated it would not accept a deal conceding land or sovereignty to Russia, marking a significant point of contention.</p>

This decision comes after nearly a hundred federal lawsuits were filed across the country, prompted by ICE suddenly terminating thousands of students' SEVIS records. The government lawyer stated that students' terminated SEVIS records would be restored, at least temporarily, while the government adopts a formal policy for revoking records in the database.</p>

          <p>CBS's '60 Minutes' is facing an unprecedented crisis with the departure of its executive producer, Bill Owens, who cited interference from Paramount Global. The show's integrity is threatened by President Trump's lawsuit against CBS over an interview with Kamala Harris, which is seen as a potential obstacle to Paramount's merger with Skydance Media. The staff of '60 Minutes' fears that the company may settle the lawsuit to appease Trump, potentially undermining the program's independence and hard-hitting journalism. The situation raises concerns about corporate influence and the ability of '60 Minutes' to aggressively cover the Trump White House.</p>

          <p>A system was set up in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's Pentagon office to allow him to access Signal messages, bypassing standard security protocols, according to sources. A computer monitor in Hegseth's office provided remote access to the Signal app and text messages from his personal cellphone, despite cellphones being prohibited in the sensitive compartmentalized information facility (SCIF). This arrangement raises security risks, as it gives Hegseth access to his personal iPhone text messages and Signal chat groups at his desk. The Defense Department denies the existence of a "dirty line" and the current use of Signal inside Hegseth's office.</p>
