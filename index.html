          <p>The UK government plans to purchase 12 new F-35 A fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear bombs, joining NATO's airborne nuclear mission, a move Prime Minister Starmer calls an investment in national security amidst global uncertainty. These jets will be based at RAF Marham in Norfolk, supporting 20,000 jobs and 100 businesses across the country. While the US controls the release and use of pre-positioned B61 bombs in Europe, the UK maintains its independent nuclear deterrent via Trident ballistic missiles launched from Vanguard class submarines. The new jets will offer longer range and a wider range of conventional weapons, marking a significant strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture. The UK retired its tactical nuclear weapons in 1998 and this purchase signals a return to the nuclear game.</p>

          <p>Following recent strikes between the United States and Iran, the FBI is increasing its focus and resources on counterterrorism threats, directing field offices to prioritize terror threats, including those domestically. This decision follows an internal report forecasting the need to concentrate resources on Iran, aiming to disrupt financial and logistical networks, operatives, and hacking operations. The National Terrorism Advisory System issued a bulletin warning of a heightened threat environment due to the Iran conflict, citing potential violence against US assets and personnel. A ceasefire between Israel and Iran is currently holding, after a period of heightened conflict and casualties on both sides. The FBI maintains that it continuously assesses and realigns resources to respond to the most pressing threats to national security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An early intelligence assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency indicates that U.S. air strikes on Iranian nuclear sites set back Iran's nuclear program by only a few months, contrary to President Trump's claim of complete obliteration. The assessment suggests limited damage to critical infrastructure, particularly at the Fordo facility, with independent experts concurring after analyzing satellite imagery. Iran's Speaker of Parliament has stated that Iran will disregard demands to halt uranium enrichment, while the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Agency confirmed that they are assessing the damage but plan to continue production. Experts emphasize that Iran's nuclear knowledge is widespread, making it difficult to eliminate their nuclear capabilities entirely. The goal to prevent Iran from having the ability to make a nuclear weapon is long-shared by the U.S.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to release documents detailing the activities of the military in Southern California, granting a procedural victory to California in its efforts to oversee the thousands of troops under the president's command. Judge Breyer authorized California lawyers to depose key administration officials, including those from ICE and the Army, and signaled he might review questions about how long troops remain under federal control. The ruling follows a previous appellate court decision that broadly deferred to the president's authority to federalize the National Guard. California's lawyers are arguing that by aiding immigration raids, troops under Trump’s command violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which forbids soldiers from enforcing civilian laws.</p>

          <p>President Trump's declaration of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear program, lacks a diplomatic agreement, raising concerns about Iran's future nuclear ambitions. The article argues that without a formal agreement, Iran may end cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency and withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, potentially leading to covert nuclear weapon development. The author suggests that Trump should have leveraged the situation to secure commitments from Tehran regarding its nuclear program and IAEA access. The decision to declare the problem solved without extracting commitments from Tehran could strain relations between Washington and Jerusalem.</p>

Lyon contends that with proven funds and sporting success, the decision is incomprehensible and will appeal to demonstrate their ability to provide necessary financial resources.

The White House disputes the assessment, while Rafael Grossi of the IAEA stated that the agency could no longer account for Iran's stockpile of 400kg of uranium enriched to 60% purity.

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. Health Secretary, has faced criticism for allegedly breaking a promise to Senator Bill Cassidy regarding interference with a CDC vaccine advisory panel. Kennedy removed all 17 members of the panel and replaced them with a smaller group of vaccine skeptics and scientists lacking expertise in vaccines. Cassidy has called for delaying the committee's meeting due to concerns about the new panel's experience and potential bias against mRNA vaccines.</p>
