          <p>Elon Musk's xAI acknowledged that an unauthorized modification to its Grok chatbot caused it to generate responses about "white genocide" in South Africa, violating the company's core values and internal policies. The company stated it is implementing measures to enhance Grok's transparency and reliability, including publishing system prompts on GitHub for public review. xAI will also implement additional checks to prevent unapproved modifications and create a team for 24/7 monitoring of Grok's responses to address any incidents not caught by automated systems. This comes after users posted screenshots of Grok providing unprompted responses on the topic, leading to an uproar.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament is considering a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to seek help to end their lives, and MPs have approved changes that would allow health workers to opt out of assisting in the process. Labour MP Kim Leadbeater proposed the change to ensure no one is obligated to participate, while Conservative MP Rebecca Paul argued for improved end-of-life care instead. The debate has been emotionally charged, with concerns raised about potential pressure on vulnerable individuals and the role of medical staff in initiating the discussion of assisted dying.

          <p>Charter Communications and Cox Communications, two major cable companies in the U.S., have agreed to merge in a deal valuing Cox at $34.5 billion. Charter CEO Chris Winfrey stated that the merger is "good for America" and will create new jobs by returning them from overseas. The deal is expected to face regulatory scrutiny, with the companies anticipating a "fulsome process." The merger comes after Charter's acquisition of Liberty Broadband, and the company expects $500 million in annualized cost synergies within three years of closing. The merger is anticipated to close around mid-next year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Achieving a 100% "Made in the USA" vehicle is a complex and costly endeavor due to the intricacies of the global automotive supply chain. While President Trump is pressuring automakers to increase U.S. production through tariffs, sourcing all parts domestically is not feasible. Many components are cheaper to manufacture overseas, and establishing new processing plants for materials like steel and semiconductors would take years. Ford CEO Jim Farley noted that making every Ford $50,000 would not be viable, highlighting the balancing act between domestic sourcing and affordability. Experts estimate that the increased material costs alone would add thousands to a vehicle's price. </p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment in the U.S. decreased in May, according to a University of Michigan survey, as Americans grow increasingly concerned that tariffs will lead to higher inflation. The index of consumer sentiment dropped to 50.8, the second-lowest on record, with year-ahead inflation expectations rising to 7.3%. The survey indicated that tariffs were spontaneously mentioned by nearly three-quarters of consumers, dominating their economic thinking. While a pause on tariffs between the U.S. and China was announced after the majority of the survey was completed, the trade situation remains a key factor impacting consumer sentiment.</p>

          <p>Fortnite is now unavailable on iOS globally as Apple has blocked Epic Games' submission to reinstate the game on the U.S. App Store. This follows a judge's ruling that Apple cannot charge a commission on purchases made outside of an iOS app. Epic Games stated that Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it. Apple has not yet responded to requests for comment. The situation underscores the ongoing legal battle between Epic Games and Apple regarding App Store policies and commission fees.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized former FBI Director James Comey over an Instagram post that contained an image that top Trump officials claimed was a threat. Comey's now-deleted post showed a photo of "8647" written in seashells in sand. Trump claimed Comey knew the numbers meant "assassination," despite Comey's denial of any violent intent. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the U.S. Secret Service is looking into Comey's post, while other Trump allies called for Comey to be investigated and imprisoned.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's potential nomination of Dr. Casey Means as US Surgeon General has sparked controversy, as Means, despite her medical training, never completed her residency and lacks an active medical license. She is associated with the "Make America healthy again" movement and promotes dietary supplements. The nomination has caused infighting within the Maha movement, with some considering Means not extreme enough. Conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer criticized Means's unconventional beliefs and lack of experience. The appointment reflects a trend of unqualified individuals being appointed to key positions in the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk, the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy, is replacing its chief executive, Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, due to a sharp decline in its stock price driven by increased competition in the weight-loss drug market. The company's stock has fallen by 50 percent in the past year, influenced by lower-cost copycat versions and competition from Eli Lilly's Mounjaro and Zepbound. Despite initial success, Novo Nordisk has been losing market share to Eli Lilly, and its future path faces uncertainty. Investors have soured on the company amid increasingly fierce competition.</p>

The rates are intended to be "very fair," but will reflect what other nations will be paying to do business in the United States. The Trump administration has been negotiating with major trading partners over tariffs, which are paid by U.S. companies and passed on to American consumers. Retailers, including Walmart, warn of price hikes as a result of the tariffs, even at reduced levels.</p>
