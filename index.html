          <p>The UK, EU, and other allies have issued a joint statement warning that a famine is unfolding in Gaza and urged Israel to take immediate steps to allow humanitarian aid into the territory. This comes as Israeli forces conduct intense air attacks on Gaza City in preparation for a ground occupation. The World Health Organization has also pleaded for access to stock medical supplies for the catastrophic health situation. Israel denies there is starvation, blaming UN agencies for failing to distribute aid that reaches the border.</p>

          <p>E.J. Antoni, President Trump's nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), has suggested the agency should suspend its monthly jobs report. Antoni, from the conservative Heritage Foundation, criticized the report as flawed due to frequent data revisions and argued for relying on more accurate, though less timely, quarterly data. The nomination follows Trump's firing of the previous commissioner, whom he blamed for a disappointing July jobs report, raising concerns about the politicization of economic data.</p>

The analysts raised their price target, arguing the company's planned acquisition of CyberArk is a high-quality move to fill a portfolio gap. This positive assessment follows a period where the stock was punished due to the acquisition news. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index for July showed that overall inflation remained stable, largely due to falling gasoline and grocery prices. However, economists are pointing to concerning signs in the "core" inflation data, which excludes food and energy and has been rising. Many analysts attribute this underlying price pressure to the effects of the Trump administration's tariff and immigration policies, which are beginning to impact consumer goods prices more visibly.

          <p>In a personal essay, author Anne Lamott reflects on navigating political despair and finding hope in unexpected places. She argues for embracing absurdity and humor, specifically the work of Monty Python, as a form of fearless resistance against authoritarianism and cruelty. Lamott suggests that small acts of joy and kindness, like getting a manicure, are vital forms of self-preservation and defiance that can help maintain one's spirit and humanity.</p>

          <p>The Nevada Supreme Court has ruled in favor of former coach Jon Gruden, determining that he cannot be forced into the NFL's internal arbitration process for his lawsuit against the league and Commissioner Roger Goodell. The court found that the arbitration requirement was "unconscionable" and did not apply to Gruden as a former employee. This decision clears a major hurdle for Gruden's lawsuit, which alleges the NFL orchestrated a campaign to destroy his career by leaking offensive emails he had sent years earlier.</p>
