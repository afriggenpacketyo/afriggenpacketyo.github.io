          <p>A Pennsylvania Air National Guardsman, Mohamad Hamad, faces federal charges for allegedly building explosives, promoting extremist violence, and vandalizing a synagogue. Hamad, along with Talya Lubit and Micaiah Collins, is accused of conspiring to manufacture destructive devices and defacing Jewish religious property with pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel graffiti. Hamad, who enlisted in the Air Force in 2023, allegedly made false statements about his loyalty to the U.S. while privately celebrating terrorist groups and expressing hostility toward America. The indictment details Hamad's actions, including sharing violent pro-Hamas videos and posting threats on social media. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, in collaboration with state law enforcement, arrested approximately 780 undocumented immigrants in Florida this week. The operation, which began on Monday, specifically targeted immigrants with final deportation orders, with over 275 migrants taken into custody. This action represents the latest effort by the Trump administration to accelerate deportations, although previous attempts have fallen short of the administration's goals. This is the first operation conducted under a formal arrangement with state law enforcement known as a 287(g) agreement.</p>

          <p>Animal rights groups are urging the French government to reconsider rehoming two killer whales, Wikie and Keijo, to a sanctuary in Nova Scotia, Canada. The orcas are currently held at Marineland Antibes, a shuttered marine zoo in France, and a previous application to move them to Loro Parque in Tenerife was blocked. Activists argue that a whale sanctuary would provide more space and prevent forced breeding or performances, while Marineland insists on the urgency of transferring the animals to an operational destination for their welfare. The Whale Sanctuary Project has identified a suitable site in Port Hilford Bay, Nova Scotia, for the orcas.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the liberation of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, survivors and their families are gathering to remember the horrors endured there. British and Canadian troops discovered approximately 13,000 unburied corpses and 60,000 emaciated survivors upon entering the camp in April 1945. Belsen became notorious due to the chilling accounts from journalists, soldiers, and photographers, as well as the intact evidence of Nazi atrocities. Overcrowding led to widespread dysentery, malnutrition, and typhus, resulting in the deaths of between 50,000 and 70,000 people, primarily Jews.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams, despite not making splashy selections in the 2025 NFL draft, are considered by some to have positioned themselves for future success. By trading a relatively insignificant pick, the Rams acquired a first-round pick in 2026, giving them two first-round picks in a draft that could include highly touted prospects. This move allows the Rams to have substantial draft capital to potentially replace veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford or acquire other key players. The Rams are expected to make another deep playoff run this season and are planning for long-term success.</p>

More than 29,200 hectares have been burned, exceeding the previous high of 28,100 hectares in 2019, due to a prolonged dry and sunny period in March and early April. Researchers note that while wildfires are common in early spring, the lack of rainfall created ideal conditions for widespread burning.

          <p>Australia's universal healthcare system is facing a growing crisis due to inadequate government funding, leading to shortages of healthcare workers, ballooning wait times, and rising costs for patients. The issue is particularly acute in regional areas, where access to affordable care is increasingly challenging. Voters are demanding solutions ahead of the upcoming election, with both major parties promising additional funding. However, experts argue that sweeping changes to the funding model are needed to save the system, which is struggling to meet the needs of a growing and aging population.</p>

This back-and-forth has created uncertainty and disarray in global markets, leaving investors and business leaders struggling to navigate the volatile trade landscape. The outcome of ongoing trade talks between the U.S. and China will likely shape perceptions of Trump's first 100 days and provide insights into his future trade policies.</p>
