          <p>UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has permitted Royal Mail to cease second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays to reduce operational costs amid declining letter volumes. First-class mail will continue to be delivered six days a week, but delivery targets for both services will be slightly relaxed. Royal Mail welcomed the decision, which will take 12-18 months to implement, stating it supports a sustainable universal service, though consumer groups criticized the move as a reduction in service standards.</p>

          <p>A large-scale overnight Russian aerial assault on Kyiv has resulted in at least two deaths and thirteen injuries, with drone wreckage causing fires and damaging buildings across multiple districts. Ukraine's air defense systems were activated during the prolonged attack, which authorities described as part of the largest aerial assault since the conflict began. The attack destroyed a primary healthcare center and caused significant damage to residential and non-residential structures, underscoring the escalating conflict as diplomatic prospects wane.</p>

          <h2>New 'Superman' Film Explores Themes of Universal Morality and Kindness Amidst Political Scrutiny</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming "Superman" film, directed by James Gunn, portrays the hero as a symbol of universal kindness rather than just American exceptionalism, a choice that has drawn criticism from some right-wing commentators. The article explores the historical context of Superman as a character created by Jewish immigrants to defend the weak, framing him as a "moral immigrant." This interpretation aligns with Gunn's outspoken political views and positions the film within the ongoing cultural debate over the political leanings of superhero franchises.</p>

Ten other individuals have already been charged in the incident, where an officer was shot and fireworks were launched at the facility.</p>

Company sources indicate that high US tariffs, which recently increased from 2.5% to 27.5% on European-built cars, played a significant role in the halt. Additionally, the model is facing a recall by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration because its third-row seats do not meet federal safety standards, requiring modifications by the automaker.</p>

          <p>To combat persistent labor market pressures, the Chinese government has announced a one-off subsidy for employers who hire unemployed individuals aged 16 to 24. Companies that sign formal contracts and make social insurance contributions for new young hires will receive up to 1,500 yuan per person. This measure, effective until the end of the year, is part of a broader effort to stabilize employment and support household incomes amid a sluggish economy and intense domestic competition.

          <p>The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against California, arguing the state's animal welfare laws for egg-laying hens create "unnecessary red tape" that has contributed to rising egg prices nationwide. The suit claims that California's requirements, which mandate more space for hens and apply to eggs sold in the state regardless of origin, unlawfully regulate out-of-state producers. This legal action is part of President Trump's broader vow to lower egg prices, which have soared due to a major bird flu outbreak.</p>
