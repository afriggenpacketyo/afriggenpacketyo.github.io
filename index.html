          <p>One year after being convicted of falsifying business records related to a hush money scheme, Donald Trump is still fighting the criminal case. A federal appeals court is set to hear arguments on June 11 regarding his attempt to move the case from state to federal court, a move opposed by the Manhattan District Attorney. Trump's lawyers argue the case belongs in federal court due to the unprecedented nature of prosecuting a former president. The former president continues to deny any wrongdoing, characterizing the prosecutions against him as politically motivated. (not investment advice)</p>

The bee celebrated its 100th anniversary this year, and Zaki may be remembered for a word he got wrong as much as the one he got right.

          <p>China's power grid has implemented a quantum-powered safeguard called a "diamond ring" to prevent catastrophic collapses by detecting grid instability in real-time with high precision. Designed by the University of Science and Technology of China in collaboration with the State Grid Corporation, this toroidal device embeds nitrogen-vacancy quantum sensors. The urgency for this system was highlighted after sweeping outages in Spain, Portugal, and France, as well as instability in China's Xinjiang region due to renewable energy fluctuations. As renewables increasingly dominate energy transitions, this system aims to address the challenge of weather-dependent unpredictability straining traditional monitoring systems.</p>

The bill, passed by the House of Representatives, includes sweeping changes to the tax treatment of foreign capital in the U.S. The legislation targets entities from "discriminatory foreign countries" that impose levies disproportionately affecting U.S. companies. This bill could transform a trade war into a capital war by using taxation on foreign holdings of U.S. assets as leverage to further U.S. economic goals. (not investment advice)</p>

The essay suggests that a redefined understanding of ‚Äúharm,‚Äù ‚Äúabuse,‚Äù and ‚Äútrauma‚Äù has led to a new standard for parenting. This cultural shift has contributed to a nearly impossible standard for parents, who are now expected to ensure their children's mental health and career success well into adulthood.

          <p>Valerie, a mini dachshund, has returned home after surviving 529 days alone in the Australian bush, after running away during a camping trip in November 2023. Despite being microchipped and having an AirTag, the remote location made it difficult to track her. After months of searching, a farmer's photo led to her rescue by Kangala Wildlife Rescue, who used traps to capture her. Valerie has since settled back into her home, and her owners hope her story provides hope to others facing challenges.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the federal government have raised concerns about the ability of the USDA to protect American agriculture. The exodus of thousands of employees from USDA, including those from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), has left American agriculture vulnerable. Experts fear that progress in eradicating pests and diseases could be lost due to staff depletion. The administration has also suspended imports of live cattle, horses, and bison across the southern border to combat the spread of screwworm.</p>

          <p>Gold prices edged lower on Friday, on track for a nearly 2% weekly decline, as traders positioned themselves ahead of a closely watched US inflation report. The move came as investors awaited the release of the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs preferred measure of inflation. Technical dynamics also contributed to the pullback, with the price action in gold failing to break above the key near-term resistance level of $3,328. The broader investment case for gold remains intact, boosted by renewed uncertainty over Donald Trump‚Äôs trade agenda. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to increase rice exports in response to an expected long-term decline in domestic consumption. The annual white paper on food and agriculture for fiscal 2024 recommends exploring new overseas markets and supporting more efficient production. China, Singapore, the United States, Hong Kong, and Taiwan have been identified as target markets. The government aims to boost rice exports nearly eightfold to 353,000 tons in 2030 from 2024, by increasing acreage managed by export-focused farmers and reducing production costs to better compete with foreign-grown rice.

          <p>An opinion piece challenges Mark Twain's assertion that travel is fatal to prejudice, arguing that despite record levels of global tourism, bigotry, prejudice, and narrow-mindedness persist. The author points to ruinous wars, rising nationalism, opposition to immigration, and protectionism as evidence that international travel has not fostered peace and cooperation. The tariff policies of U.S. President Donald Trump are cited as an example of how international trade and tourism have failed to inoculate against prejudice. The piece suggests that many tourists remain isolated from the realities of the places they visit, limiting the potential for broadening their perspectives.</p>
