          <p>Shares of Coinbase and Circle experienced significant gains after the Senate passed the GENIUS Act, which establishes a federal framework for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins. The GENIUS Act allows private companies to issue stablecoins under strict regulations, including full reserve backing and monthly audits. Coinbase, which co-founded USDC and shares revenue with Circle, saw its shares increase by over 16%, while Circle's stock rose by 33% since its recent IPO. The bill now proceeds to the House for further consideration, where reconciliation with the House's version, STABLE, will be necessary to finalize the legislation, potentially paving the way for significant growth in the stablecoin market.

          <p>The Federal Reserve announced it would hold its benchmark interest rate steady, continuing its approach of assessing the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies. While the central bank expects inflation to increase in the coming months, it still projects two interest rate cuts by the end of the year. Fed Chair Jerome Powell cited the solid labor market and economic growth but cautioned that new tariffs could drive up inflation and slow economic growth. The Fed anticipates inflation to reach 3% by year-end and unemployment to rise to 4.5%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Massachusetts jury found Karen Read not guilty of murdering her Boston police officer boyfriend, John O'Keefe, in 2022, after a retrial. Read was acquitted of second-degree murder, manslaughter, and leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death, but the jury found her guilty of operating under the influence of liquor, for which she received one-year probation. The prosecution alleged that Read struck O'Keefe with her car after a night of drinking, while the defense argued that O'Keefe was attacked and left to die in the snow. The verdict prompted emotional reactions from both Read's supporters and the O'Keefe family.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times criticizes a Biden administration regulation mandating two-person crews on freight trains, arguing it's based on "common sense" rather than data. The author, Veronique de Rugy, contends that agencies are sidestepping their legal responsibility to document market failures and conduct cost-benefit analyses. She argues that such emotion-based regulation sets a dangerous precedent, potentially leading to unnecessary and costly mandates across various sectors. The author suggests that federal rulemaking is abandoning core principles, shifting the burden to regulated parties to prove a rule is unnecessary.</p>

          <p>President Trump has endorsed David Ellison's takeover of Paramount Global, an $8-billion merger complicated by Trump's $20-billion lawsuit against CBS. Trump expressed hope the deal would proceed, connecting the review delay to his lawsuit over a "60 Minutes" interview with Kamala Harris. Paramount seeks to settle the lawsuit to facilitate the Skydance acquisition, which requires FCC approval. The merger awaits FCC Chairman Brendan Carr's consent to transfer CBS television station licenses.</p>

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kept its key borrowing rate in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, where it has been since December, while indicating that two rate cuts are still anticipated by the end of 2025. The committee's economic projections point to continued stagflationary pressures, with GDP expected to advance at a 1.4% pace and inflation hitting 3%.

          <p>There is no minimum debt threshold to qualify for bankruptcy, but it's typically considered when unsecured debt exceeds half of one's annual income. Warning signs include making only minimum payments, borrowing from one card to pay another, and facing calls or lawsuits from debt collectors. Bankruptcy can stop collection calls and wipe out certain debts, but it also has long-term consequences, affecting credit and borrowing ability. Alternatives include debt settlement, debt management plans, debt consolidation loans, and budgeting with additional income.</p>

          <p>Vance Boelter, the suspect in the shootings of a Minnesota lawmaker and her husband, was appointed to the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Board by Gov. Tim Walz. Boelter served two consecutive three-year terms on the board, providing expertise rooted in his work as a general manager at a Speedway gas station. The Governor's office stated that these boards have no authority to make decisions, change laws, or implement policies. The governor does not interview applicants for these roles and did not know Boelter.</p>
