          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is seeking a temporary restraining order to prevent President Trump from firing her. During a court hearing, her lawyers argued to maintain the "status quo" while the case proceeds, calling the allegations of mortgage fraud a "smear campaign." Trump's legal team contends that the president has the discretion to determine cause for removal, a power they argue is not subject to judicial review. The Federal Reserve has taken a neutral stance but requested a prompt ruling to resolve the uncertainty surrounding its board's composition.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's U.S.-listed stock climbed significantly after the company reported better-than-expected profits for its June quarter, largely driven by its cloud computing unit. Revenue for the cloud division grew 26% year-over-year, fueled by robust demand for artificial intelligence services, which saw triple-digit growth for the eighth consecutive quarter. While the company's overall revenue slightly missed forecasts, investors were encouraged by the strong performance in the high-growth cloud sector. The results demonstrate Alibaba's successful balancing act of investing in competitive areas like AI while maintaining growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alexis Wilkins, the girlfriend of FBI Director Kash Patel, has filed a $5 million defamation lawsuit against former FBI agent Kyle Seraphin. The lawsuit alleges that Seraphin, on his podcast, falsely claimed Wilkins is a former Israeli Mossad agent involved in a "honeypot" operation to compromise Patel. Wilkins' complaint states she is an American-born country singer, is not Jewish, has never been to Israel, and that the claims are malicious lies intended as "self-enriching clickbait."

          <p>An executive order by President Trump has ended the "de minimis" trade exemption, which previously allowed shipments valued under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free. The sudden elimination of this provision, which was heavily used by e-commerce retailers and smaller businesses, is causing significant supply chain disruptions and forcing companies to overhaul their business models. Experts warn the change will lead to higher costs for businesses and consumers, with one study estimating an impact of at least $10.9 billion for U.S. families.

          <p>A UK Court of Appeal ruling has permitted the government to continue using hotels to accommodate asylum seekers, a decision seen as a technical victory for ministers. The government had feared that a loss would trigger a wave of legal challenges from other local councils, potentially causing chaos in the asylum system. However, the ruling places the Labour government in a difficult political position, as it had to argue in favor of using hotels, a policy it has promised to end. Opponents are now criticizing the government for prioritizing migrants over local communities, creating further political pressure.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed new regulations that would prohibit the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) from performing or counseling on abortions, even in cases of sexual assault and incest. The only exception would be if a physician certifies that the mother's life is endangered. This move reverses a 2022 Biden administration policy that expanded abortion access for veterans following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Critics, including female veterans and abortion rights advocates, argue the rule is cruel and will endanger women's lives, particularly given the high rates of sexual assault in the military.</p>

          <p>President Trump is unilaterally blocking $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid by employing a rare budgetary tool known as a "pocket rescission." The maneuver involves requesting Congress to cancel funds so late in the fiscal year that the 45-day review period extends beyond the September 30 deadline, causing the funds to expire. This tactic, last used in 1977, effectively bypasses the legislative branch's constitutional power over spending.

This international setback comes shortly after a challenging start to his time at Real Madrid, where he was substituted in his debut and benched for the following match. Tuchel has publicly questioned Alexander-Arnold's defensive abilities, a concern that seems to have contributed to his omission. The 26-year-old now faces a significant battle to secure his place for both his new club and his country ahead of the next World Cup.</p>

          <p>President Trump has officially revoked the extended Secret Service protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris. While Harris was legally entitled to six months of security after leaving office, the Biden administration had quietly extended it for another year. A memo from the Trump administration has now directed the Secret Service to discontinue this non-mandated protection effective September 1. The decision has drawn criticism from Democratic politicians, who frame it as a politically motivated act of retaliation that could compromise Harris's safety, particularly as she begins a national book tour.</p>

          <p>Survivors of the shooting at Annunciation Catholic Church in Minneapolis are sharing accounts of terror and bravery during the attack. Parishioner Cathrine Spandel described hiding under a pew and praying with another worshipper, believing she was going to die as the shooter fired through the stained-glass windows. Witnesses reported that older students and adults instinctively shielded younger children from the gunfire that erupted during the first school Mass of the year. The community, deeply rooted in the school and parish, is now grappling with the violence that shattered its sense of peace.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a significant surge in overseas sales, Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD reported a nearly 30% drop in profits for the second quarter. The decline is attributed to an intense price war in its domestic market, where increased competition and aggressive marketing have squeezed profit margins across the industry. The Shenzhen-based company's second-quarter earnings fell to 6.4 billion yuan (US$894.6 million). While international deliveries grew significantly, the challenges in the highly competitive Chinese market overshadowed this strong overseas performance, impacting the company's overall financial results.

          <p>The median price for condominiums and co-ops in the U.S. fell by 2.1% in July compared to the previous year, a trend driven largely by an oversupply of units on the market. While the lower sticker price may seem attractive, real estate experts caution that condos are not automatically a bargain. Buyers must factor in rising costs such as Homeowners Association (HOA) dues, insurance premiums, and potential special assessments for building repairs. These additional expenses can often make the long-term cost of owning a condo comparable to that of a single-family home. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose to an annual rate of 2.9% in July.

Despite the uptick, the figure was in line with economists' forecasts. The report also showed a solid 0.5% increase in consumer spending for the month, indicating continued economic resilience. The data will be a key consideration for the Fed as it weighs a potential interest rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has strongly condemned a visit by U.S. Senators Roger Wicker and Deb Fischer to Taiwan, where they met with the island's leader, William Lai Ching-te. A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry stated the visit is a "serious violation of the one-China principle" and sends the wrong signal to what it calls "separatist forces." Beijing urged Washington to cease its support for Taiwanese independence to avoid escalating tensions in the region. The visit occurs at a sensitive time, with Beijing viewing self-governing Taiwan as a province to be reunified with the mainland.</p>

          <p>Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who recently resigned as a director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has claimed that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has never been briefed by any of the agency's scientists on major diseases like measles or COVID-19. Daskalakis, who was one of several top officials to depart the CDC amid leadership turmoil, suggested Kennedy is receiving information from "alternate experts" rather than the world-renowned scientists at the CDC.

          <p>President Trump's attempt to dismiss Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is escalating into a significant legal challenge over the central bank's independence. Cook has filed a lawsuit arguing her removal is illegal and based on pretextual allegations, while the president asserts broad authority to fire board members. The case, which is expected to reach the Supreme Court, tests the long-standing principle of the Fed's autonomy from political interference. Trump's actions are seen as an effort to install a majority on the board who will align with his calls for interest rate cuts.</p>
