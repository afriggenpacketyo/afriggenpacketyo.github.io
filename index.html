          <p>A U.S. District Court judge rejected a lawsuit from an investment fund, Azoria Capital, which sought to force the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings to be open to the public. The judge ruled the FOMC is not subject to the "Sunshine Act" and questioned if the lawsuit was a publicity stunt for the new fund, which is run by a Donald Trump ally critical of current interest rate policies. The decision upholds the long-standing practice of the FOMC meeting privately to deliberate on the nation's monetary policy, as the fund had argued the Fed was keeping rates high for political reasons.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to maintain current interest rates, the price of gold is projected to remain relatively stable in the short term. Historically, gold prices have reacted to interest rate changes, but recent surges have been driven more by inflation and geopolitical concerns, decoupling it from traditional monetary policy effects. While a rate cut is unlikely this week, future comments from the Fed, inflation data, and global tensions could still influence the precious metal's market value. Investors are watching these factors to gauge potential entry points into the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a new HBO documentary, musician Billy Joel has directly refuted longstanding rumors that he has a history of driving under the influence (DUI). The 76-year-old artist stated he has never had a DUI, attributing past car accidents to a "mental fog" and deep depression following the 9/11 attacks, not alcohol. Joel, who was recently diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), expressed frustration with the tabloid press for perpetuating the myth over the years. He has canceled tour dates to focus on his health and recovery from the brain disorder.</p>

          <p>Chinese leaders, including President Xi Jinping, have called for an all-out emergency response following severe downpours that have caused significant flooding and landslides. The heavy rains have resulted in "heavy casualties" and property damage in several regions, including suburban Beijing and the provinces of Hebei and Liaoning. While specific casualty numbers have not been released, authorities are focused on search and rescue operations for the missing, relocating thousands of affected residents, and deploying disaster relief supplies. The Miyun district in Beijing has been particularly hard-hit, with over 3,700 people evacuated from their homes.</p>

          <p>A legal challenge has been launched against President Trump's effort to keep his former lawyer, Alina Habba, as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey. A defendant in a criminal case argues that Habba's appointment is unlawful, citing a violation of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act and a conflicting court order that had appointed her deputy to the role. This follows a complex series of events where federal judges declined to extend Habba's initial term, the Justice Department fired her replacement, and the White House withdrew her formal nomination to reinstall her in an acting capacity. The motion escalates the controversy over who legally leads the powerful office.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a nationwide order requiring the Trump administration to continue Medicaid reimbursements for all Planned Parenthood clinics. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by the reproductive health organization challenging a provision in a recent tax bill that aimed to "defund" abortion providers by halting their Medicaid payments for one year. The judge's order stated that cutting off funds would likely cause adverse health consequences for patients by reducing access to services like contraception and STI testing.

The author, a Gazan, recounts personal experiences of humiliation by Israeli soldiers and connects this to recent rhetoric from Israeli officials and the current humanitarian crisis. The piece describes how the blockade and war have dismantled Gazan society, forcing people into "death traps" for aid and eroding their sense of self and humanity. It concludes by questioning the world's inaction in the face of live-streamed suffering and the denial of Palestinians' right to grieve.</p>

Other affected areas include beer and wine, imported cars, and housing construction materials like steel, copper, and lumber.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has successfully shut down four major dark web sites dedicated to sharing child sexual abuse material as part of "Operation Grayskull." The investigation, which began in 2020, has led to the conviction of at least 18 individuals who led or used the network, which had over 120,000 members and housed millions of illicit files. One of the key figures, labeled "one of the most significant" purveyors of such material, was sentenced to life in prison. Officials called the operation one of the most successful of its kind, dismantling a sophisticated and sadistic online community.</p>

          <p>Adam Coy, a former police officer in Columbus, Ohio, has received a mandatory sentence of 15 years to life in prison for the 2020 murder of Andre Hill. Coy fatally shot Hill, an unarmed Black man who was holding a cellphone, in a garage, claiming he believed Hill had a gun. Body-camera footage showed Hill was not a threat and that officers delayed rendering aid for nearly 10 minutes. At his sentencing, Coy maintained his actions were justified and planned to appeal, while Hill's family described him as a gentle man whose death was a profound loss.</p>

          <p>The European Union has finalized a trade deal with the United States, accepting a 15% tariff on most of its exports to avert a more severe trade war. While European leaders presented the agreement as a way to restore stability, it has faced sharp criticism from within the bloc for being a "lopsided" submission to U.S. pressure. The new rate is a significant increase from pre-Trump levels, and critics argue the EU failed to secure meaningful concessions. The deal is expected to have a relatively mild overall impact on the EU's GDP but will still impose billions in additional costs on European exporters.</p>

According to an internal memo, only 13% of the 1.89 billion API calls in June were for active customer transactions, with the rest used for purposes like product improvement or data harvesting. The bank, which is preparing to charge fees for this data access, also claims these transactions are linked to higher fraud rates.

Her lawyers assert that the government has an obligation to honor the terms of that deal, which they claim was not geographically limited and applied to any co-conspirators.
