          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro has accused the U.S. of "murder" following an American strike on a suspected drug-carrying submarine, which President Trump stated killed two people. Petro claims the vessel was adrift with engine failure and had a distress signal active, demanding an explanation from Washington. This incident is the latest in a series of U.S. strikes in the Caribbean targeting drug trafficking, which the UN has described as "extrajudicial executions." The U.S. maintains the vessel was specifically built for drug transport, and two survivors have been taken into custody.</p>

          <p>The United States has issued a warning based on "credible reports" that Hamas is planning an imminent attack against Palestinian civilians in Gaza, which would be a severe violation of the current ceasefire agreement. The State Department has informed other mediating nations, including Egypt and Qatar, stating that measures will be taken to protect Gaza's population if the attack proceeds. This warning comes amid the ongoing first phase of the ceasefire, which has seen the release of living hostages and the return of some deceased individuals, though tensions remain high.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian drone attack has caused a fire at a gas plant in Russia's Orenburg region, according to the local governor. The strike damaged a workshop at the facility, but no employees were reported to have been injured in the incident. This attack is part of Ukraine's escalating strategy since August to target Russian energy infrastructure, including oil refineries and gas plants. The goal of these strikes is to disrupt Moscow's fuel supplies and reduce its revenue from energy exports.</p>

Rallies in New York, Washington D.C., and other cities were largely peaceful, with participants holding signs with slogans like "Democracy not Monarchy." Critics of the administration, including Democratic senators, have warned that recent executive orders and actions are unconstitutional. The protests reflect a deep national division, occurring despite some states mobilizing the National Guard in anticipation of unrest.</p>

          <p>China's ministry of state security has accused the United States of conducting long-term, covert cyberattacks against its National Time Service Center. The center, based in Xian, is responsible for maintaining and distributing China's official standard time, a critical service for the nation's communications, finance, and defense sectors. Beijing claims the attacks utilized "state-level cyberespionage tools" to carry out the prolonged infiltration. The U.S. embassy has not yet responded to the allegations, which add to the ongoing technological and security tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Embassy in Trinidad and Tobago has issued an unusual security warning, advising American citizens to avoid U.S. government facilities over the weekend due to a "heightened state of alert." This caution comes amid escalating regional tensions between the United States and Venezuela following a series of deadly U.S. strikes on suspected drug trafficking vessels in the Caribbean. Trinidad's homeland security minister confirmed the alert is based on specific threats and that local authorities are implementing security measures. The nearby nation of Venezuela is just miles from Trinidad.</p>

          <p>Despite a massive summer spending spree, Liverpool's recent struggles may be linked to the departure of right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold to Real Madrid. An analysis of their gameplay reveals difficulties in bypassing high-pressure defenses and building up play from the back without his unique passing range and ability to use his weaker foot. The team's rate of switching play has dropped significantly, making them more predictable and less effective at breaking down compact defensive blocks. New signings like Florian Wirtz are being forced into deeper roles, which limits their attacking potential.</p>

          <p>While numerous companies like Accenture, Lufthansa, and Salesforce have recently announced job cuts and attributed them to the increasing efficiency of artificial intelligence, some experts are skeptical. Critics argue that AI has become a "good excuse" for layoffs that may actually be due to other business factors, such as overhiring during the pandemic. Research from institutions like Yale and the New York Fed suggests that AI has not yet caused widespread job disruption. Instead of admitting to miscalculations, companies may be using AI as a scapegoat to appear innovative while downsizing. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>It is common for sexual desire to decrease in long-term relationships after the initial passionate phase, according to psychologists. This shift is partly due to hormonal changes, as the bonding hormone oxytocin begins to suppress sex drive hormones over time. Experts emphasize that open communication about sexual needs and satisfaction is crucial for maintaining intimacy. Studies also show a significant "orgasm gap" in heterosexual relationships, where female pleasure is often not prioritized, which can lead to a decline in desire if unaddressed over time.</p>
