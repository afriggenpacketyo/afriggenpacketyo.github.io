          <p>A significant wildfire in Galloway, southwestern Scotland, prompted evacuations of people and properties as it spread across a large forest area. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service deployed crews and helicopters to combat the blaze, which expanded to nearby hills due to rising temperatures and dry conditions. Galloway Mountain Rescue assisted in safely relocating walkers from the affected areas and urged caution regarding open flames in the coming week. The fire service issued an "extreme" warning for wildfires across Scotland, emphasizing the high risk due to dry vegetation.</p>

          <p>Two Labour MPs, Abtisam Mohamed and Yuan Yang, were denied entry to Israel while attempting to visit the West Bank, sparking criticism from UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy. Israeli authorities accused the MPs of intending to spread hate speech and document security forces, while the MPs maintained their visit was organized with UK charities to witness the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory. The incident has raised concerns about the freedom of parliamentarians to speak truthfully without fear of being targeted and has strained diplomatic relations between the UK and Israel.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover Automotive is temporarily suspending shipments to the United States in response to the 25% tax on vehicle imports imposed by President Donald Trump. The company cited the need to address the new trading terms and develop mid- to longer-term plans as reasons for the pause. Analysts anticipate similar actions from other British carmakers facing increased pressure from declining demand and the transition to electric vehicles. The U.K. car industry has already been impacted by declining production, with exports to the U.S. experiencing a surge in anticipation of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>A study published in the Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis suggests that colorful fruits and vegetables, rich in anthocyanins, may help protect the body from the harmful effects of microplastics. Anthocyanins, natural pigments found in foods like blueberries and red cabbage, act as potent antioxidants, neutralizing oxidative stress and reducing inflammation caused by microplastic exposure. They may also interact with steroid receptors to regulate hormone functions disrupted by microplastics. Experts recommend consuming a variety of colorful plant foods as part of a defense strategy against microplastic damage.</p>

          <h2>Study Warns of Increased Earthquake Risk in China and Surrounding Regions</h2>

          <p>A study by Chinese seismologists warns of a heightened risk of major earthquakes in China and neighboring regions, linking seismic cycles to fluctuations in the Earth's rotation. The research, published shortly before a devastating earthquake in Myanmar, analyzes 150 years of seismic data to identify major earthquake "active periods." The timing of the study has sparked debate about whether the planet's tectonic stress fields are entering a dangerous new phase. The seismologists used changes in the length of a day to measure shifts in the Earth’s rotational speed.</p>

          <p>Alejandro Garnacho's recent dip in form and a frustrating performance against Nottingham Forest have ignited discussions about his future at Manchester United. After a promising start to the season, Garnacho's goal-scoring and creative output have declined, leading to questions about his performance levels and attitude. A previous disciplinary issue with head coach Ruben Amorim further fueled the speculation. As a result, his performance levels have dipped and fans are concerned about the future.</p>

Bennett critiques the support Tossici-Bolt has received from US figures like JD Vance and the Alliance Defending Freedom, accusing them of misrepresenting the situation as a free speech issue while ignoring the harassment faced by women seeking abortions. Bennett questions the US State Department's "monitoring" of the case and argues that it is an attempt to undermine UK women's reproductive rights.</p>

          <p>Kenan Malik reviews Joel Budd's book "Underdogs," which challenges common myths about the white working class. Budd argues that geography, rather than ethnicity, is a key factor in shaping their distinctiveness, with white workers often living outside metropolitan areas with limited opportunities. Malik highlights Budd's discussion of immigration and the dangers of "ventriloquised xenophobia," where elite prejudices are legitimized by attributing them to the working class. He also criticizes the left's neglect of class politics, which has allowed regressive parties to portray themselves as champions of working-class interests.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has pledged that his government will use industrial policy to protect UK companies from the impact of Donald Trump's new 10% tariff. The UK is among several countries affected by the import duty, prompting concerns about a potential global trade war. Starmer emphasized the need to "keep calm and fight for the best deal" while also boosting domestic competitiveness. The announcement comes as Jaguar Land Rover announced it would "pause" shipments to the US for a month, as firms grapple with the new taxes.</p>

He criticizes Trump's view of trade as a zero-sum game and suggests that Britain should work with other nations to sustain a rules-based global trading system. Hutton proposes that Britain should associate with Canada as a privileged trade partner with the EU and extend the terms of that association to a newly relevant commonwealth.</p>

          <h2>PLA Aircraft Carrier Explores Alternative Route to Taiwan Ahead of Drill</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The PLA's Shandong aircraft carrier is believed to have taken an alternative route to the east of Taiwan before a drill last week. The move analysts say was likely to be training to counter American warships nearby and to explore alternative routes in the event of a conflict over the island. Ahead of the two-day exercise around Taiwan, the Shandong appears to have bypassed the wider waterways between the self-ruled island and the Philippines. Analysts said the new route could give the People’s Liberation Army alternative southbound options to approach the western Pacific via the Bashi Channel, which is seen as a strategic chokepoint.</p>
