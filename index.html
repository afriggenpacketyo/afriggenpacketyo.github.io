          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves asserted that the UK is in a superior position regarding trade compared to any other nation due to recent agreements with the US, India, and the EU. These deals aim to boost the UK's economic growth by facilitating exports of goods like whisky and cars to India, reducing tariffs, and enhancing trade with the US. Reeves highlighted the UK's unique advantage in having favorable deals with major global economies, making it an attractive destination for investment and business. The chancellor also mentioned that a trade pact with Gulf nations is the next priority. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba has charged Congresswoman LaMonica McIver with assaulting, impeding, and interfering with law enforcement during a confrontation at the Delaney Hall ICE facility. The charges stem from an incident where McIver and other officials allegedly rushed through the gates of the facility with protesters, past security. Habba dismissed trespassing charges against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was also involved in the incident. McIver alleges that ICE instigated the chaos and mistreated the lawmakers, who were there to conduct oversight.

          <p>Michelle Goldberg's opinion piece in The New York Times discusses a fundraising pitch by the Heritage Foundation for Project Esther, which aims to combat the pro-Palestinian movement. The article alleges that the Heritage Foundation's illustration of a pyramid topped by progressive elites, including Jewish billionaires like George Soros, employs an antisemitic trope. Goldberg argues that conflating antisemitism with opposition to Israeli policies is perverse, particularly when ultra-Zionist gentiles lecture Jews about antisemitism while undermining liberal values. The piece highlights concerns about the crackdown on pro-Palestinian speech and the demonization of those critical of Israel.</p>

          <p>Moody's recent downgrade of the United States' credit rating, citing congressional gridlock and potential fiscal plans that could increase the federal deficit, has intensified the debate among Republicans over tax and spending cuts. Fiscally conservative Republicans are leveraging the downgrade to advocate for deeper cuts to federal programs, including Medicaid and food assistance, to reduce the deficit. Speaker Mike Johnson aims to bring the bill to a vote soon, but faces challenges from both anti-deficit conservatives and moderate Republicans concerned about the political impact of slashing social programs. Representative Thomas Massie argues the bill would make bond buyers realize the US isn't fiscally responsible.</p>

Biden's office stated the diagnosis followed urinary symptoms, leading to the discovery of a nodule, and that the cancer appears hormone-sensitive, allowing for effective management.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced that 64 undocumented immigrants participated in a new program called "Project Homecoming," voluntarily returning to their home countries via a government-funded flight.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that those who do not utilize the program will face fines, arrest, and deportation.

Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media, and Eric Swider, CEO of the SPAC that merged with Trump Media, recently raised $210 million for a new SPAC targeting the crypto space. The resurgence is driven by a rising stock market, demand for crypto, and small investors seeking quick gains, but the inherently speculative nature of SPACs carries significant risk.

          <p>The central U.S. is bracing for another round of severe storms, including potential tornadoes, large hail, and destructive winds, just days after extreme weather killed at least 29 people. Areas previously hit by tornadoes in Kentucky and Missouri are at risk, with flood watches in effect for parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. The National Weather Service warned of a "multitude of hazardous weather" impacting the U.S., from thunderstorms on the Plains to heavy mountain snow in the West and dangerous heat in the South.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer of CNBC advised investors to dismiss market fears following Moody's downgrade of U.S. debt, recalling similar downgrades in 2011 and 2023 that led to market declines. Cramer argued that Friday's downgrade triggered more fear than warranted by the economic environment. He suggested that investors view the downgrade as an early warning to increase savings rather than selling investments, and recommended gold and bitcoin as hedges against government borrowing. Cramer cautioned investors against succumbing to fear-mongering from those who benefit from market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists in the US and Japan are in a race to discover why our Universe exists, as the current theory of its creation cannot explain the presence of planets, stars, and galaxies. The US-led Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (Dune) in South Dakota and the Japanese-led Hyper-K project are building detectors to study neutrinos, hoping to find out why matter won over antimatter. Both are international collaborations. Scientists believe that studying how neutrinos and anti-neutrinos change as they travel may provide the answer to why matter and anti-matter didn't cancel each other out.</p>

The inmates, being held on charges including murder and armed robbery, left behind a taunting message.

Governor Jeff Landry demanded answers, emphasizing the need to address broader failings within the criminal justice system.

Finally, the government will strictly enforce fiscal discipline, signaling that housing will not be the cornerstone of Chinaâ€™s economic future.

          <p>Two crew members died and 22 others were injured aboard a Mexican Navy sailing ship, ARM CuauhtÃ©moc, when it drifted into the Brooklyn Bridge, smashing its masts and rigging. The ship, carrying 277 people, including 175 naval cadets, was on a good-will tour. The cause of the accident is still under investigation by the Mexican Navy, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the National Transportation Safety Board. The cadets were performing a traditional ritual of standing on the yards as a farewell to the port, when the ship drifted off course.</p>
