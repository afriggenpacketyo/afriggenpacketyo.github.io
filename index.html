          <h2>Chinese Mathematicians Crack Decades-Old Kervaire Invariant Problem</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 06:00:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese mathematicians from Fudan University Shanghai Centre for Mathematical Sciences and UCLA have successfully resolved the 65-year-old Kervaire invariant problem, which concerns the existence of specific topological spaces. This breakthrough involved advanced computational methods and confirms the existence of manifolds of Kervaire invariant one in dimension 126. The Kervaire invariant, introduced by John Milnor in 1950, is a function that assesses whether a smooth framed manifold can be converted into a sphere through surgery; the problem sought to identify dimensions where this invariant is non-zero, indicating the presence of unique shapes that cannot be transformed into a sphere. The findings, outlined in a paper yet to undergo peer review, provide a definitive answer to a mathematical mystery that has puzzled experts for decades, and could be applied to further problems in the field.</p>

          <p>Representatives from Iran and the United States have restarted high-level discussions in Oman to address disagreements over Tehran's nuclear program. The US is demanding Iran cease all uranium enrichment, while Iran insists on its right to enrich uranium for civilian purposes. Both sides have expressed a preference for diplomacy, but significant red lines remain, with the US potentially seeking the dismantling of Iran's enrichment facilities. Amidst these tensions, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio suggested Iran could import enriched uranium for civilian energy use as a possible solution, and President Trump is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates soon.</p>

Trump administration policies, including tariff policies and cuts to safe infant sleep campaigns, are causing anxiety and anger among parents. Democrats aim to persuade voters that the Trump administration is making their lives harder, particularly on issues like measles outbreaks and vaccine approaches. However, Democrats face challenges in effectively communicating and mobilizing parents, especially given the influence of movements like "Make America Healthy Again.</p>

          <p>As President Trump prepares for his first major foreign trip to the Middle East, a growing divide between him and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is emerging on critical security issues facing Israel. Despite initial alignment, Trump has rejected Netanyahu's desire for joint military action against Iran's nuclear capabilities and has instead begun talks with Iran. Trump's recent agreement with the Iranian-backed Houthi militias in Yemen to halt U.S. airstrikes, following a Houthi missile strike on Israel's main airport, further underscores the diverging paths, testing the relationship between the two leaders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has ended a duty-free loophole that allowed packages imported from China and Hong Kong valued under $800 to avoid tariffs, a move welcomed by some small businesses squeezed by Chinese e-commerce giants like Shein and Temu. This loophole had enabled these companies to gain market share by evading tariffs on low-value products. However, the benefits of ending this workaround are overshadowed by Trump's high tariffs on Chinese goods, which impose a rate of at least 145 percent on imports from China, offering little immediate relief to small businesses. Temu has already responded by shifting to shipping from local warehouses in the U.S., signaling a fundamental change due to the new taxes.</p>

          <p>Dartmouth College stands apart from its Ivy League peers as it avoids major funding threats and investigations from the Trump administration, largely due to its president, Sian Beilock's, approach. While other Ivies face funding cuts and scrutiny over antisemitism allegations, Dartmouth has remained relatively unscathed, in part due to Beilock's emphasis on free expression and dialogue. Beilock's critics suggest she is trying to appease conservatives, while supporters see her as a champion of open dialogue. Her actions, including a police crackdown on a pro-Palestinian demonstration and the hiring of a former Republican Party official, have further positioned Dartmouth in a favorable light with conservatives.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, without preconditions, in response to calls for an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. Putin referenced unsuccessful 2022 peace talks and stated his commitment to serious negotiations, not ruling out a ceasefire during direct talks. The proposal followed threats from European leaders to increase pressure on Moscow if it did not accept a 30-day ceasefire, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressing readiness for peace talks after a ceasefire is in place.</p>

          <p>Dr. James Ryan, an oral surgeon, is accused of providing his girlfriend, Sarah Harris, with surgical anesthetics to control her, leading to her eventual death from an overdose. Harris's mother became suspicious of Ryan, particularly after he admitted to noticing Sarah when she was only 14. Authorities discovered that Ryan had been supplying Sarah with habit-forming drugs, including propofol and ketamine, which ultimately contributed to her death. Ryan was charged with drug distribution, intent to distribute, and depraved heart murder, reflecting the reckless disregard for human life he allegedly demonstrated.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States has remained steady at 6.76%, close to its highest levels this year, but still below the 7.09% average from a year ago. Meanwhile, rates for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages have decreased slightly to 5.89%. These rates are influenced by factors including global demand for Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policy, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a sluggish start to the spring home-buying season.</p>

          <p>Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz has criticized the recently announced UK-US trade deal, calling it "not worth the paper it's written on" due to President Trump's unpredictable trade policies. Stiglitz suggested that the UK should have focused on strengthening its relationship with the EU instead, arguing that Trump's strategy is to divide and conquer weaker countries. The deal includes reduced tariffs on British car and steel exports to the US, while the UK has agreed to remove a tariff on ethanol, and opens a new agricultural exchange, but maintains existing food standards.</p>

          <p>Cuts to USAID funding by the Trump administration are having catastrophic consequences for healthcare in Africa, leading to the loss of access to medication for HIV patients and the halt of vital healthcare programs. The funding cuts are expected to lead to more than 500,000 deaths in South Africa alone and could result in up to 4 million additional deaths from treatable diseases across Africa. The cuts have also disrupted disease prevention efforts, leading to fears of a resurgence in malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV, and undermining years of progress in combating these diseases.</p>

          <p>Opposition politicians are disputing claims that Birmingham's bin collections have returned to normal, as industrial action by refuse workers from the Unite union continues. Despite the council's assertion that it has cleared the majority of rubbish, Conservative leader Robert Alden and Independent MP Ayoub Khan claim that bin lorries have stalled again, leading to waste accumulation. The dispute centers on changes to roles and pay, with striking workers seeking a fair deal amid rising living costs. The city council maintains that it has cleared a significant portion of the waste, but acknowledges the need for transformation in the service.</p>
