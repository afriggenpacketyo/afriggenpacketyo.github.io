          <p>Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor who worked on cases involving Jeffrey Epstein and Sean "Diddy" Combs, has been fired from her position in the Southern District of New York. The Department of Justice did not provide a reason for her termination, which sources confirmed to news outlets. The dismissal occurs amid a series of firings of lawyers who have been involved in investigations related to Donald Trump, and as her father, former FBI Director James Comey, faces a new DOJ investigation. This action adds to concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic lawmakers have introduced a bill aimed at preventing illegal price gouging by large corporations. The proposed legislation would grant the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general increased authority to litigate against companies that excessively raise prices, particularly in response to market shocks like new tariffs. The bill, which would require companies with over $100 million in revenue to report detailed pricing data, is a response to rising inflation and concerns that corporations are using economic conditions as cover for unfair price hikes.

          <p>Texas Senator John Cornyn, facing a primary challenge from State Attorney General Ken Paxton, revealed he has discussed a potential endorsement with Donald Trump. Cornyn stated that if Trump were to endorse him, the primary race would effectively be over, highlighting the former president's significant influence within the Republican Party. While Trump has not yet made an endorsement, Cornyn's campaign emphasized his strong alignment with Trump's voting record. This situation underscores the critical role Trump's backing plays in GOP primary contests across the country.</p>

          <p>Ruth Chepngetich, the Kenyan athlete who holds the world record in the women's marathon, has been provisionally suspended by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU). A sample collected from her in March tested positive for hydrochlorothiazide, a banned diuretic often used as a masking agent. Chepngetich, who shattered the world record at the Chicago Marathon in 2024, had voluntarily accepted a provisional suspension in April while the investigation was ongoing. The AIU has now formally issued a Notice of Charge, casting a shadow over her recent historic achievements.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has defended his decision to suspend four Labour MPs, stating that the party must address those who repeatedly defy its official positions. The disciplinary action, which also saw three other MPs lose their roles as trade envoys, followed a significant rebellion over a welfare bill. Starmer emphasized that MPs were elected on a Labour manifesto and are expected to support the government's agenda to enact change. The move has sparked internal debate about party discipline and the leadership's tolerance for dissent.</p>

          <p>Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve Governor and a reported candidate for Fed Chair, has called for significant changes at the central bank, including what he termed "regime change." In a television interview, Warsh criticized the current Fed leadership's hesitancy to cut interest rates and suggested a new "accord" between the Fed and the Treasury Department to manage the national debt. His comments align with President Trump's public pressure on the Fed to lower rates and suggest he would pursue a distinctly different policy direction if appointed to lead the institution.

          <p>A growing number of human rights activists, journalists, and civil society members are fleeing El Salvador, creating the largest exodus of political exiles since the country's civil war. This comes as President Nayib Bukele's government intensifies its crackdown on dissent, jailing critics and passing laws that restrict non-governmental organizations. Prominent human rights group Cristosal recently suspended its in-country operations and evacuated its staff, citing a lack of impartial institutions and the risk of imprisonment. The situation places El Salvador alongside other authoritarian Latin American nations where critics face a choice between prison and exile.</p>

          <p>Citing concerns that market expectations are too high, Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club has sold a small portion of its shares in GE Vernova. The move is intended to lock in profits from the stock's significant year-to-date run of 75% ahead of its upcoming earnings report. The article explains that while the long-term outlook for the company remains bright due to the AI-driven demand for power, a stock that enters earnings "too hot" is at risk of profit-taking even with strong results. The sale represents a tactical decision to manage risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Senate Judiciary Committee has advanced the judicial nomination of Emil Bove, a former defense lawyer for President Trump, in a chaotic session. Democrats on the committee walked out in protest after the Republican chairman refused to delay the vote or allow a Justice Department whistleblower who made allegations against Bove to testify. Bove's nomination to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has faced staunch opposition due to his alleged role in a quid pro quo scheme and accusations of unethical conduct. His nomination now moves to the full Senate, where its passage is uncertain.</p>

          <p>A new report from NHS England has exposed significant inequalities in waiting lists for non-urgent treatment, with women, people in the poorest communities, and those from Asian backgrounds waiting longer for care. The data shows that working-age individuals make up more than half of the total waiting list, and gynaecology has the largest backlog for this group. Women constitute 57% of those on waiting lists and are more likely to wait over a year for treatment. Health officials intend to use this data to help hospitals address these "unfair waits" and tackle health disparities.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has introduced legislation to amend the Stafford Act, aiming to classify extreme heat as a major disaster. This change would allow state and local governments to request federal funding from FEMA to respond to and prepare for deadly heat waves, which are currently not explicitly covered. Proponents argue the move is critical as heat kills more Americans than any other weather event, and funding could support cooling centers and heat adaptation projects. However, the bill faces opposition, with some arguing that extreme heat is already implicitly eligible for disaster declarations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate has narrowly passed a rescissions bill to claw back $9 billion in previously approved federal funding. The cuts, part of a Trump administration effort to reduce spending, will primarily affect foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds NPR and PBS. The bill passed 51-48 after an amendment was made to restore funding for the PEPFAR HIV/AIDS program, which had been a point of contention.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Nature reveals that migrants in Germany earn nearly 20% less than native-born workers. Researchers found this wage gap is not due to unequal pay for the same work, but rather to structural barriers that limit migrants' access to higher-paying industries and roles. The gap persists into the second generation, which still earns 7.7% less on average, a higher disparity than in comparable Western nations. The report suggests that improving integration requires better language support, recognition of foreign qualifications, and breaking down these structural barriers.</p>

          <p>Former chairs of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) are warning that President Trump's executive orders to accelerate nuclear power development could undermine the agency's independence and compromise public safety. The orders aim to quadruple nuclear power by 2050 and call for a "wholesale revision" of regulations to speed up plant approvals, accusing the NRC of "risk aversion." Critics, however, argue this approach threatens the regulator's crucial role in protecting the public from potential accidents by making it vulnerable to political and industry influence, drawing parallels to the conditions that led to the Fukushima disaster.</p>
