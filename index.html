        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an early US intelligence assessment, the US military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities have only set back the country's nuclear program by months, contrary to claims by President Trump and Defense Secretary Hegseth. The classified report from the Defense Intelligence Agency and U.S. Central Command indicates that while significant damage was done, it was mostly to above-ground structures, with enriched uranium and centrifuges largely intact. The White House disputed the assessment, with Press Secretary Leavitt alleging it was leaked to CNN by a "low-level loser" to demean President Trump. As more information is gathered on the attack, the assessment could change, but the current intelligence suggests a less devastating impact than initially portrayed by the administration.</p>

          <p>The prosecution and defense have rested their cases in the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial, where he is accused of sexual assault and racketeering conspiracy. The prosecution presented over 30 witnesses, including former employees and two former girlfriends, who testified about alleged drug-fueled sexual encounters orchestrated by Combs. The defense argued that texts and messages showed the women were willing participants and moved for acquittal, which the judge reserved judgment on. Combs affirmed his decision not to testify, and closing arguments are scheduled for Thursday, with deliberations potentially beginning next week, in this high profile case which could see Combs face up to life in prison if convicted. Optimism surrounding the outcome of the trial for Combs is relatively low given the serious nature of the charges.</p>

          <p>Daniel Park, charged with conspiring in the Palm Springs fertility clinic bombing, was found unresponsive and pronounced dead at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, according to the Bureau of Prisons. Park was arrested earlier this month at JFK Airport after fleeing to Europe following the May 17 bombing, which killed the primary suspect, Guy Edward Bartkus. Federal investigators allege Park shipped explosive materials to Bartkus as part of a plot motivated by their shared nihilistic beliefs, specifically an anti-natalism ideology. The FBI and United States Marshals Service have been notified and will investigate the death, which adds another layer of complexity to the already tragic case.</p>

The online discussion reflected mixed opinions on the topic, with some customers expressing disappointment while others noted the varying local ordinances. The article also mentions President Trump's executive order banning the federal use of paper straws, citing concerns about their functionality and environmental impact, as well as the fact that paper straws are sometimes individually wrapped in plastic.</p>

          <p>China is closely monitoring the conflict between Israel and Iran due to its significant reliance on Iranian oil imports, with approximately 90% of Iran's crude oil being exported to China despite U.S. sanctions. China purchases Iranian oil at a discounted rate, providing economic support to Iran and solidifying their partnership, even though the two countries have few political traits in common. The oil is transported through a "dark fleet" to circumvent sanctions and processed in small, private refineries in China. While China could source oil from other countries, doing so would be more expensive, and some state-affiliated refineries are seeking to end the sanctions-busting trade with Iran.</p>

Despite attempts to improve their finances through player sales and releasing high earners, Lyon failed to convince the DNGC of sufficient improvement. Lyon has the right to appeal, and their relegation could impact Crystal Palace's Europa League qualification due to UEFA rules preventing multiple teams under the same ownership competing in the same European competition.

          <p>A new report highlights the vulnerability of rural areas to extreme heat, with more than half of rural zip codes in the U.S. facing "high" heat vulnerability. Rural communities often have older populations with higher rates of chronic health conditions, less adequate infrastructure, and fewer public spaces to seek relief from the heat. Emergency response times are also longer, and healthcare access is limited, making it harder to treat heat emergencies. The report emphasizes the need for infrastructure upgrades, policy changes, and investments in rural healthcare to mitigate the dangers of extreme heat.</p>

          <p>This article compares the potential interest earned on a $10,000 1-year certificate of deposit (CD) versus a $10,000 high-yield savings account. With current rates at 4.45% for CDs and 4.30% for high-yield savings accounts, the CD is projected to earn slightly more interest over the year ($445 vs. $430). The article notes that CD interest rates are fixed, providing guaranteed earnings, while high-yield savings account rates are variable and subject to change. Given expectations of potential interest rate cuts, the article suggests a CD may be a more beneficial option for savers seeking to lock in a higher rate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A former attorney at the Department of Justice, Erez Reuveni, has alleged that Emil Bove, a DoJ leader and Trump's nominee for the US court of appeals, suggested the department should defy court orders blocking deportations. Reuveni's whistleblower letter claims Bove said the department “would need to consider telling the courts ‘fuck you’” when it came to orders blocking the deportation of undocumented people. Reuveni also claims he witnessed internal efforts to undermine the courts and the rule of law, and was subsequently terminated after refusing to misrepresent facts in a case. Bove is set for a confirmation hearing before the Senate judiciary committee.</p>
