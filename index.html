          <p>Sen. Jack Reed criticized President Trump's dismissal of his own intelligence chief's assessment that Iran is not currently building a nuclear weapon. Reed suggested that Trump's rejection of the intelligence community's conclusions is politically motivated, especially as Trump contemplates an attack against Iran. According to Reed, Trump needs to justify potential military action by claiming Iran has the intent and capacity to quickly develop nuclear weapons. Reed believes that if Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard made a false statement, it should be corrected immediately. The senator's comments highlight the growing tension between the Trump administration and the intelligence community regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities.</p>

          <p>The United States is maneuvering B-2 stealth bombers and refueling tankers in the Pacific as President Trump considers taking action in the conflict between Israel and Iran. The Israel Defense Forces reported completing strikes in southwestern Iran, targeting missile launchers and radar detection systems. The U.S. aircraft have no orders beyond that, according to sources. These maneuvers come amid heightened tensions and speculation about potential U.S. involvement in the escalating conflict.

          <p>A hot air balloon caught fire and crashed in Santa Catarina, Brazil, resulting in the deaths of eight people and injuries to thirteen others. The fire started in the balloon's basket, causing the pilot to attempt an emergency landing. Thirteen people, including the pilot, managed to jump from the balloon before it began rising again due to the reduced weight. Local authorities are investigating the cause of the crash, and Brazil's President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva has offered support to the victims' families. The company responsible for the balloon, Sobrevoar, has suspended all operations indefinitely.</p>

          <p>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced the killing of Saeed Izadi, an Iranian commander who allegedly helped fund and arm Hamas. Izadi, commander of the Palestine Corps in the Quds Force, was reportedly killed in an Israeli strike in Qom. The IDF also claimed Izadi was involved in orchestrating the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. The IDF further stated that it killed a second Iranian commander, Benham Shariyari, who was responsible for weapons transfers to Iranian proxies. The elimination of Izadi is considered a significant blow to Iran's support network for terrorist organizations.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist, stated that the Trump administration failed to suppress pro-Palestinian voices following his release from immigration detention. Khalil vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights and accused the White House of dehumanizing those who disagree with the administration. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Khalil's release demonstrates that the Trump administration is losing the legal battle to deport migrants who advocate for Palestinians. A judge ordered Khalil's release, determining he was not a flight risk or threat.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched in London and Berlin, calling for an end to Israel's war in Gaza. Demonstrators criticized German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's comment that Israel was doing the West's "dirty work" by bombing Iran. Protesters in London waved Palestinian flags and carried signs against arming Israel and war on Iran. The protests reflect ongoing concerns about the conflict and its impact on civilians. Gaza is suffering from famine-like conditions, according to UN agencies in the region following an Israeli aid blockade.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, has arrived in New Jersey after being released from ICE detention. Khalil, a green card holder, was in ICE custody for more than 100 days as the Trump administration sought his deportation for his role in campus protests against Israel. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called his detainment a violation of his First Amendment rights. A judge ruled that Khalil is neither a threat nor a flight risk, and that the government's actions were an effort to punish him for his anti-Israel speech.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from making cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation. The policy change could have stripped universities of tens of millions of dollars in funding. The judge ruled that the change was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. The ruling protects critical research in areas such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. The University of California estimated the change would have cost it nearly $100 million a year.</p>

The senator's spokesperson called the remark an "unserious comment from an unserious administration." Newsom said mixing up Padilla's name was "not an accident."</p>

          <p>Elon Musk announced that Neuralink will begin human trials for its first implants for vision within the next year. The implant, called "Blindsight," aims to restore vision to individuals who are completely blind by writing directly to the visual cortex. Musk says the vision offered from the implant would initially be in low resolution but will improve over time. The BCI has already seen some success in a paralyzed man who is now able to control computers with his thoughts. Long term, it'll be very high resolution and you'll be able to see multi-spectral wavelengths.</p>

          <p>The Senate parliamentarian has advised that a Republican proposal to shift some food stamps costs from the federal government to states violates Senate rules. This is a setback for President Trump's tax and spending cut bill. The loss is expected to be costly to Republicans, who have been counting on savings from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The parliamentarian did let stand a provision that would impose new work requirements for older Americans, up to age 65, to receive food stamp aid. (not investment advice)</p>
