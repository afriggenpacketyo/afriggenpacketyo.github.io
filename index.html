          <p>The Supreme Court has granted the Trump administration the ability to resume deportations of migrants to third countries without additional due process. The court's conservative majority did not explain their decision, but litigation is expected to continue for years. Justice Sotomayor, joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson, dissented, accusing her colleagues of condoning lawless behavior by the administration. The Trump administration has sent unauthorized immigrants to countries including El Salvador, Guatemala, South Sudan, and Libya, and DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin called the court's decision a major win for the safety and security of the American people.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites, Iran launched missiles against the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which were reportedly intercepted. Middle East security expert Burcu Ozcelik suggests potential Iranian responses could include attacks on U.S. military assets, closure of the Strait of Hormuz, and asymmetric warfare. The U.S. operates numerous military bases across the Middle East, including Al Udeid in Qatar and Naval Support Activity Bahrain. The Strait of Hormuz is a critical waterway for global oil transport, and Iran's navy could lay mines to disrupt passage, an action Ozcelik describes as a desperate act of last resort.</p>

          <p>Approximately 80 Labour MPs are supporting an amendment to block the government's proposed changes to the benefits system. The MPs are concerned about plans to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments, aiming to save Â£5 billion a year by 2030. The amendment outlines reasons for rejecting the bill, including the number of people expected to be pushed into relative poverty and a lack of consultation. If the reasoned amendment is selected by the House Speaker and gains majority support, the bill's passage through Parliament will be halted.</p>

The justices reversed a lower court order requiring the government to give migrants a "meaningful opportunity" to tell officials what risks they might face in being deported to a third country. The Supreme Court's three liberal justices dissented from the ruling. The ruling hands the Republican president another victory in his pursuit of mass deportations.</p>

Lammy repeated his plea for Iran to return to negotiations following US strikes on its nuclear program. The UK's Chief Rabbi, Sir Ephraim Mirvis, was among the passengers evacuated, and the Foreign Office indicated that further flights would depend on demand and security conditions.</p>

Justice Sotomayor wrote a dissent, arguing that the government took the opposite approach in matters of life and death.

          <p>President Trump has framed his strikes on Iran as a costless triumph, but this assessment may be premature. The most immediate impact for Americans could be economic, with rising oil prices due to the conflict. The nightmare scenario involves Iran choking off the Strait of Hormuz, which could send oil prices soaring. Beyond economics, over 40,000 US soldiers stationed in the Middle East are at risk. The strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities could lead to a more unstable situation and potentially increase the likelihood of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons.</p>
