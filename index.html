          <p>Workers installing a water pipeline in Dubrovnik, Croatia, a city known as a filming location for "Game of Thrones," have uncovered the remains of an 18th-century wooden boat. The vessel was found embedded about 30 inches beneath the seabed in the city's Old Town harbor. A marine archaeologist confirmed the boat's age through radiocarbon analysis, dating it to the late 1700s. The remains are now being protected for further examination, adding to a series of recent maritime archaeological finds across Europe.</p>

          <p>Amid a challenging business climate in China, some five-star hotels are adopting unconventional strategies to survive, including selling budget-friendly street food. For instance, the Zhongwu Hotel in Changzhou has started offering affordable boxed meals, featuring items like spicy crayfish and dim sum, prepared by its high-end catering team. This move reflects a broader trend of luxury establishments pivoting to mass-market offerings to maintain revenue as consumer spending habits shift and the high-end banquet market softens.</p>

          <p>The UK's Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, is set to meet with the British Medical Association (BMA) next week in an effort to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The dispute centers on pay, with doctors arguing that their real-terms salary is significantly lower than in 2008, despite recent increases. The government maintains it cannot improve its current 5.4% pay offer, while the BMA insists it will only call off the strike if a credible new offer is presented to its members.</p>

          <p>Forty years after its broadcast, the Live Aid concert is remembered as a monumental moment in music and charity, uniting billions to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, the event showcased an unprecedented lineup of rock royalty. However, modern analysis of its legacy is more complex, raising questions about its lack of African performers and female representation, and fueling debates over the "white savior" narrative. Despite the criticisms, the article notes its undeniable impact on fundraising and political lobbying for debt relief.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Attorney General has ordered the dismissal of all charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore Jr., a Utah plastic surgeon accused of destroying thousands of dollars worth of COVID-19 vaccines. The 2023 indictment alleged he distributed fake vaccination cards and administered saline shots to children at their parents' request. The charges were dropped "in the interests of justice," with the Attorney General stating the doctor "gave his patients a choice." The case had been highlighted by Republican politicians as an example of government overreach.</p>

          <p>A campaign in the UK is calling for cosmetic and skincare products to list ingredients in English, in addition to the currently required Latin-based scientific names. Proponents, including an MP with a severe nut allergy, argue that Latin names are unrecognizable to most consumers, putting those with allergies at serious risk of accidental exposure and life-threatening reactions. While some brands voluntarily provide English translations, the campaign seeks to make it a mandatory standard, similar to food allergen labeling, to improve safety and transparency for all consumers.</p>

          <p>After weeks of being denied entry, Florida lawmakers have toured the controversial new migrant detention facility in the Everglades, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz." The visit produced starkly different assessments from the two political parties. Democratic representatives described the conditions as "appalling," citing high temperatures, claims of inadequate food and water, and detainees yelling for help. In contrast, a Republican state senator stated he found the beds comfortable. The tour follows claims from detainees of inhumane conditions at the facility, which the state has consistently denied.</p>

          <p>The European Union and Mexico have strongly criticized a proposal from U.S. President Donald Trump to impose a 30% tariff on their imports starting August 1. The EU's chief threatened "proportionate countermeasures" if the tariffs are enacted, while Mexico's president called the plan unfair but expressed hope that a deal could be reached. In letters to both trading partners, President Trump cited persistent trade deficits and, in Mexico's case, insufficient efforts to curb drug trafficking. The move escalates global trade tensions and risks a wider trade war. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has publicly voiced his support for Attorney General Pam Bondi, addressing apparent tensions within his administration regarding the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation. The fallout stems from a Justice Department decision to not release additional records, which disappointed many of the president's supporters who had been promised explosive new revelations. The move reportedly led to a contentious confrontation between Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino. In his statement, Trump dismissed the Epstein case as unimportant and urged his team to remain unified.</p>

          <p>Irvine police have arrested three women on charges of organized retail theft after discovering more than $12,500 worth of stolen merchandise in their van.

After a brief foot pursuit, officers apprehended the suspects, Sara Alexandru, Simara Ghiocel, and Sara Mihalaiche.
