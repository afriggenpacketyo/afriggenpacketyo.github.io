          <h2>Trump's Risky Tariff Gamble: 'Liberation Day' or Economic Downturn?</h2>

          <p>President Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs, dubbed "Liberation Day," aiming to reduce reliance on foreign goods and boost domestic manufacturing.  However, economists warn of potential recession and market instability due to increased prices for consumers.  The move is a significant political gamble, given public disapproval of Trump's economic policies and the possibility of retaliatory tariffs from other nations.  The White House maintains that any short-term pain will be offset by long-term economic gains.</p>
