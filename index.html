          <p>This article reviews three new film releases: 'Ballerina,' a John Wick spin-off starring Ana de Armas; 'Dangerous Animals,' a thriller about a psychopathic tour guide; and 'The Ritual,' a horror film featuring Al Pacino as a priest involved in a publicized exorcism. 'Ballerina' is praised for its action sequences and Ana de Armas' performance, despite a weak script. 'Dangerous Animals' is noted for its suspense and the performances of its actors, while 'The Ritual' is criticized for its uninspired direction and overuse of jump scares, though Al Pacino's presence is highlighted as a potential draw for cinephiles.

The addition of visa overstays as a rationale could open the door for new legal challenges, according to migrant advocates. This strategy reflects a calculated approach to avoid repeating past legal pitfalls. The administration is aiming to create a more defensible policy by addressing previous court concerns.</p>

This limitation highlights disparities in the distribution of benefits and raises concerns about the effectiveness of the policy in reaching the most vulnerable families.
