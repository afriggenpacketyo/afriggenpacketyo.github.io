          <p>Following demonstrations against immigration raids in Los Angeles, President Trump has ordered at least 2,000 National Guard troops to the city. The protests erupted after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents arrested at least 44 immigrants in raids on multiple locations. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has condemned the ICE raids, stating they "sow terror in our communities," while White House aide Stephen Miller described the protests as an "insurrection against the laws and sovereignty of the United States." The deployment highlights the escalating tensions between the federal government and local leaders regarding immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's multi-trillion-dollar spending package, known as Section 899, is facing criticism from Wall Street. The House-approved measure would allow the U.S. to impose a new tax of up to 20% on foreigners with U.S. investments if their home country levies "unfair foreign taxes" on U.S. companies. Analysts warn that this "revenge tax" could have significant implications for the asset management industry, potentially impacting cross-border income earned by hedge funds and private equity funds. The Investment Company Institute has cautioned that the provision could limit foreign investment in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts warn that near-shore tsunamis, triggered by earthquakes just offshore, pose a significant risk to California's coastal communities due to the limited warning time. Life-threatening waves could arrive in as little as 10 minutes, potentially leaving insufficient time for alerts and evacuations. Data shows that locally generated tsunamis could reach significant heights in areas such as Los Angeles, Orange County, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The article underscores the need for preparedness and quick evacuation strategies, highlighting challenges such as densely populated areas and potential traffic congestion.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive assessment of tsunami risk along the California coast reveals varying degrees of potential damage and casualties depending on the source and location of the earthquake. Southern California faces significant risk from both distant-source and near-source tsunamis, with potential for hundreds of deaths and billions of dollars in damage. The Central Coast is also vulnerable, particularly to near-source tsunamis triggered by underwater landslides. The Bay Area faces a high casualty potential and substantial damage estimates, while the North Coast, especially Del Norte County, is highly exposed due to its proximity to the Cascadia subduction zone.</p>
