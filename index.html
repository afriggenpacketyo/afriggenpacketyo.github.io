        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case determining whether the president has the authority to remove members of the Federal Trade Commission without cause. This case challenges a nearly 90-year-old precedent that grants for-cause removal protections to officials at independent agencies, aiming to insulate them from political pressure. While the case is under review, the court has permitted the Trump administration to proceed with the firing of FTC Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, signaling a potential shift in the separation of powers and the independence of federal bodies.</p>

          <p>Disney has confirmed that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will resume its broadcast, ending an indefinite suspension that began last week. The network stated the initial decision to halt production was made to de-escalate a tense national situation following the host's controversial comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. After several days of discussions with Kimmel, the company decided to bring the late-night show back, a move that follows widespread debate over free speech and corporate responses to political pressure.</p>

          <p>Following a prolonged and deliberate violation of its airspace by Russian military jets, Estonia is urging NATO to adopt a more forceful response to such provocations. An Estonian lawmaker suggested that future incursions could be met with actions similar to Turkey's 2015 shootdown of a Russian bomber, highlighting the growing tension along NATO's eastern flank. While some allies like Poland support a firm stance, others caution against overreaction, creating a debate within the alliance on how to deter Russian aggression without escalating into a direct conflict.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's stop-work order against an offshore wind project, allowing Danish company Orsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind farm. The project, located off the coast of New England, is 80% complete and is expected to power over 350,000 homes. The judge ruled that Orsted was likely to succeed in its lawsuit, which argued the administration's order was unlawful and issued in bad faith, marking a significant setback for the administration's efforts to curtail the offshore wind industry.</p>

          <p>New York City's Democratic mayoral nominee, Zohran Mamdani, has withdrawn from a scheduled town hall on WABC-TV to protest the suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" by its parent company. Mamdani framed his decision as a stand against what he termed the Trump administration's "authoritarian" pressure on the media and corporate "cowardice" in response. The White House dismissed his actions, with a spokesperson calling the candidate "scared to defend his absurd policy positions," turning the boycott into a broader political confrontation over free speech and media independence.</p>

          <p>Southern California is expected to remain humid and muggy for the next several days due to tropical moisture moving in from the Pacific Ocean. The weather pattern is not predicted to bring significant rainfall to the Los Angeles area but will create unstable, "swampy" conditions with a chance of isolated showers and storms through the weekend. Forecasters note that another developing storm, Tropical Storm Narda, could funnel even more moisture into the region by early next week, prolonging the unusual weather.</p>

          <h2>Manchester City's Bernardo Silva Claims Premier League Scheduling Gave Arsenal an "Unfair Advantage"</h2>

          <p>Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva has criticized the Premier League's scheduling, stating it put his team at an unfair disadvantage in their recent match against Arsenal. City had only 66 hours to prepare following a Champions League game, while Arsenal had nearly two extra days of rest after their European fixture. Silva argued that for such an important match, the lack of adequate recovery time is not right and prevents players from performing at their best, echoing previous complaints from manager Pep Guardiola about the demanding schedule.</p>

          <p>Leaf-peepers can begin planning their autumn excursions, as forecasters have released predictions for when fall foliage will peak across the U.S. this year. Maps from sources like the Almanac suggest northern regions will see peak colors by early October, with New England and the Pacific Northwest following around mid-October. Experts note that climate change is generally delaying the season, but yearly variations in temperature and rainfall mean that timing can differ, so they advise checking local conditions for the most accurate viewing information.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines, which has filed for bankruptcy twice this year, is furloughing about 1,800 of its 5,200 flight attendants as part of its restructuring efforts.

          <p>Parents are currently navigating mixed messages regarding childhood vaccinations, leading to confusion and hesitancy. A federal advisory panel recently delayed a vote on the hepatitis B shot at birth and voted to stop universally recommending COVID-19 vaccines, while some states are forming coalitions to encourage widespread vaccination and others plan to roll back mandates. This divergence between federal recommendations and state-level policies is creating uncertainty for parents and pediatricians, who worry about the potential for an increase in vaccine-preventable illnesses.</p>

          <p>A Guardian editorial critiques President Trump's recent statement that he "hates" his opponents, arguing it exemplifies a dangerous approach to politics that weaponizes speech and state power. The article suggests the administration is creating a climate where dissent is treated as disloyalty, blurring the lines between truth and lies, as seen in its scientifically unsupported claims about Tylenol and autism. The editorial concludes that by selectively rewarding allies while degrading honest debate, Trump is inverting the American free-speech model to consolidate power rather than foster open dialogue.</p>

          <p>For 2025, the average monthly premiums for Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, can vary widely, typically ranging from $90 to $300 for popular mid-level plans. Costs depend heavily on the plan chosen, location, age, and other personal factors, with high-deductible options available for as little as $32 per month and the most comprehensive plans costing up to $550. To secure lower premiums, experts advise enrolling as soon as eligible, comparing different insurers, and considering plans with higher cost-sharing if one's health needs are minimal.
