          <p>Local elections in parts of England are underway, marking the first major electoral test for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Labour retained several mayoralties but with reduced majorities, while Reform UK showed strong performance, coming in second in all Labour-held mayoral races. A recount is ongoing in Runcorn and Helsby, with Reform and Labour separated by only four votes. Results from council elections are expected later, with Reform aiming for gains against both Conservatives and Labour, and these early results indicate potential shifts in the political landscape.</p>

          <p>China is considering U.S. overtures for trade negotiations, signaling a possible path toward resolving the ongoing trade war. A Chinese spokesperson stated that while they are assessing the possibility of talks, the U.S. must first remove all unilateral tariffs to demonstrate sincerity. Analysts caution that reaching a comprehensive deal will be complex due to President Trump's unpredictability and differing strategic priorities. U.S. officials have expressed optimism about easing tensions, but significant hurdles remain in achieving a lasting agreement between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has officially ended the de minimis rule, a loophole that allowed Americans to purchase cheap goods from China without tariffs. This move aims to support U.S. manufacturers struggling to compete with low-cost Chinese products, but it is expected to increase prices for American consumers who shop online. The loophole had allowed products up to $800 to avoid tariffs, leading to a surge in individually addressed packages from e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu. While proponents argue this will level the playing field for domestic businesses, opponents fear higher costs and disruptions to trade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Marine biologists are surveying fish populations in Douglas Lake, Tennessee, for the first time since Hurricane Helene caused significant debris accumulation. The study aims to determine the hurricane's impact on the sport fish population by comparing current data with surveys from the past 30 years. Initial findings suggest that things look within normal range, but the full data will provide a clearer picture. Sport fishing is crucial to the area's tourism, and the cleanup efforts are nearly complete, with over 112,000 cubic yards of debris removed.</p>

          <h2>Senate Votes to Overturn EPA Rule Limiting Hazardous Air Pollutants</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-01 23:13:39 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate has voted to overturn an EPA rule designed to limit hazardous air pollutants emitted by heavy industry, marking the first time Congress has moved to weaken the Clean Air Act. The rule required major sources of seven hazardous air pollutants to reduce their emissions by the maximum achievable amount. Republican lawmakers argued that the rule disincentivized companies from deploying new technology to reduce pollution, while environmental groups criticized the move, stating it would put children and communities at risk. The vote represents a victory for the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries.</p>

          <p>China's Commerce Ministry is evaluating an offer from the United States regarding tariff negotiations, but insists that the U.S. must demonstrate sincerity by correcting its wrong practices and canceling unilateral tariffs.

This unprecedented accumulation of titles raises questions about his ability to effectively manage all responsibilities, particularly given Trump's unconventional approach to governance. The appointment highlights the trust placed in Rubio by Trump and his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, but also raises concerns about potential conflicts of interest and the delegation of duties.</p>
