          <p>House Republicans' reconciliation legislation, known as the One, Big, Beautiful Bill, includes proposals aimed at boosting family finances, such as $1,000 investment "Trump Accounts" for newborns and an enhanced maximum $2,500 child tax credit. However, the proposed changes, which emphasize work requirements, may reduce aid for children in low-income families when it comes to certain tax credits, health coverage, and food assistance. According to the Congressional Budget Office, households in the lowest decile of the income distribution would lose about $1,600 per year from 2026 through 2034, mainly due to reductions in in-kind transfers like Medicaid and SNAP. The article further details how millions of children could be excluded from the full child tax credit and face new red tape for the earned income tax credit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Israel launched a major operation against Iran, with airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, scientists, and senior military commanders, prompting Iran to launch over 100 drones at Israel in retaliation. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the operation aimed to "roll back the Iranian threat," while Iranian officials threatened a harsh response. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, reported that Iran's Fordo nuclear site was not impacted, and no increase in radiation levels was observed at the Natanz site. This back-and-forth has heightened concerns about an escalating regional conflict and cast doubt on U.S.-Iran nuclear talks.</p>

          <p>Following Israeli airstrikes on Iran, world leaders are calling for restraint to de-escalate regional tensions, with Israel stating the strikes targeted Iran's nuclear program. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. was not involved and prioritized protecting American forces in the region, while the U.K., France, and Germany urged calm and a return to diplomacy. Malaysia condemned Israel's attack, and China offered to assist with de-escalation efforts, while Russia criticized the strikes as unacceptable attacks on a sovereign nation. The attacks have raised concerns about broader hostilities in a region already facing instability.</p>

          <p>Two women have died after being found in a pool at Wales' largest national park, Eryri National Park, also known as Snowdonia. North Wales Police were called to Nant Gwynant following reports of a woman in the pool on the Watkin Path, one of the main routes to the summit of Yr Wyddfa, Wales' tallest mountain. A second woman was pulled from the water but pronounced dead at the scene, prompting an ongoing investigation and appeals for witnesses to come forward.

          <p>The High Court has dismissed a legal challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees, a policy introduced on January 1 across the UK. Lawyers representing families and private schools argued the policy was discriminatory and breached human rights law, but the court found the government was entitled to prioritize revenue for public services. The government defended the policy, stating it would raise Â£1.8 billion a year by 2029/30 to improve state sector standards. Despite the court's acknowledgment that some families may no longer afford private school fees, the judges upheld Parliament's decision after full debate and manifesto commitment.</p>

The Guardian interviewed 25 people in the Christian music industry, most of whom say they had prior knowledge of allegations that Tait had engaged in abusive behavior. The men who have come forward and shared their alleged experiences â€“ two agreeing to go on the record with their names, while the rest spoke on the condition of anonymity â€“ were aged 13 to 29 at the time of their alleged experiences.</p>

          <p>Washington is set to host a military parade celebrating the US Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with Donald Trump's 79th birthday, featuring tanks, rocket launchers, and missiles. Critics argue the display resembles authoritarian regimes and serves to aggrandize Trump's ego, especially after he activated National Guard troops to quell protests against immigration raids. The event, estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million, involves thousands of troops, vehicles, and aircraft, leading to public opposition and planned protest events nationwide. The parade is viewed by some as a wasteful spectacle amid federal spending cuts, while others see it as Trump's attempt to link his power projection with military authority.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration may cut funding to the US Natural Sounds and Night Skies Division (NSNSD), an office focused on reducing noise and light pollution in national parks. Advocates argue the division's work is vital for plants and animals reliant on darkness and for mitigating insect die-offs. The office has led initiatives such as reducing light pollution at the Grand Canyon and snowmobile noise at Yellowstone. The proposed cuts to the National Park Service's stewardship budget threaten the NSNSD's operations, potentially shifting the agency's focus from preservation to visitor management. Without proper funding, the park service would become a "visitors' service agency", unable to protect cultural and natural resources, as is statutorily mandated.</p>

The indictment alleges that Abrego Garcia conspired to bring migrants from Latin American countries into the U.S. between 2016 and 2025.</p>

          <p>Unite Here Local 11, the union representing Southern California hospitality workers, has accused a group of airlines and hotel businesses of using misleading tactics to overturn a city ordinance that would increase the minimum wage for tourism workers to $30 an hour by 2028. The union filed a complaint alleging that petition circulators made false statements to convince voters to support the measure, while the business coalition accused the union of intimidation tactics. The L.A. Alliance for Tourism, Jobs and Progress, funded by Delta Airlines, United Airlines, and the American Hotel and Lodging Assn., needs to gather about 93,000 signatures by the end of June to qualify the measure for the ballot.</p>

The book details the physical and mental challenges of the job, including the dangers of the fires and the difficulties of working in a male-dominated environment. While the book also delves into Ramsey's personal life, its strength lies in its vivid descriptions of the fires and the demanding work of the Hotshots. The memoir serves as a companion piece to John Vaillant's "Fire Weather," offering a personal perspective on the fight against wildfires.</p>

          <p>The California Public Health Department has reversed its decision to suspend the license of Brier Oak on Sunset, a Hollywood nursing home, after determining that the timing of the incidents leading to AA violations did not meet the criteria for suspension. While Brier Oak received AA violation notices for patient deaths in 2022 and 2024, the incidents occurred more than 24 months apart. However, the state investigation found that staff oversights led to the deaths, with a family awarded $1.29 million in arbitration after a judge found the facility severely understaffed.

          <p>A new student loan program is emerging that features no interest, no fees, and a "pay-it-forward" model, aimed at helping students like Joshua Alferos, who almost had to drop out of college due to financial constraints. The program loans students money to finish college, with repayments starting once they earn a minimum salary, and some employers help pay off the loans. California is joining this effort with a San Diego county-run program and a bill in the Assembly, targeting majors in behavioral health. These programs aim to multiply the number of students who can benefit from financial aid and fill shortages in critical industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing movement in the construction industry promotes deconstruction, the practice of disassembling buildings for reusable materials, to limit the climate impact of the built environment. This approach creates a circular economy for building materials, keeping waste out of landfills and shrinking the carbon footprint of construction. Deconstruction and reuse industries have gained traction in cities like Portland, Ore., and Boulder, Colo., where old housing stock is being replaced. While deconstruction presents challenges like infrastructure needs and increased costs, it offers significant potential for reducing embodied carbon emissions and promoting sustainable building practices.</p>
