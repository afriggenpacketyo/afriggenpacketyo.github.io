          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, former President Donald Trump publicly called for an immediate end to the war, suggesting both sides should "stop where they are" and claim victory. This marks a shift in his position, as he also expressed hesitation about supplying Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles, citing the need to maintain U.S. stockpiles. Zelenskyy acknowledged the need to halt the fighting and begin talks but sidestepped questions about ceding territory. The meeting highlights the complex diplomatic maneuvering as Trump plans separate talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>Johnathan Walton, a podcaster who was instrumental in the capture and conviction of international con artist Marianne "Mair" Smyth, has voiced his disappointment with her four-year prison sentence in Northern Ireland. Smyth was convicted of defrauding mortgage clients of over $155,000, but this represents only a fraction of her extensive history of scams across the US and UK. Walton, who chronicled his own victimization by Smyth in a popular podcast, believes the sentence is too lenient for a serial fraudster he describes as incapable of changing. The case highlights the long reach of modern cons and the difficult path to securing justice for victims.</p>

          <p>A legislative impasse over extending COVID-era Obamacare tax credits is a central issue in the ongoing government shutdown. Democrats argue that letting the subsidies expire at the end of 2025 would make health insurance unaffordable for millions, while Republicans express concern over the program's high cost, estimated at over $30 billion annually. The GOP contends the credits were always meant to be temporary and contribute to the national deficit, highlighting a fundamental disagreement on fiscal policy and healthcare. The stalemate continues as both parties hold firm on their positions, preventing the passage of essential spending legislation.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has firmly positioned the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) as the main political opponent for his conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), rejecting any form of cooperation. He argued that the AfD's stated goal is to "destroy" the CDU, making any collaboration impossible despite the far-right party's growing strength in polls. Merz also attributed the AfD's rise partly to the migration policies of his predecessors, Angela Merkel and Olaf Scholz. This declaration aims to clarify the CDU's stance and draw a clear line against the far-right ahead of upcoming elections.</p>

          <p>Pratika Rawal, a 25-year-old opening batter for India, has become a key player at the Women's World Cup, realizing a dream her father once held for himself. Supported unwaveringly by her father, a former university-level cricketer, Rawal began playing at age three and quickly showed immense promise in a country where women's cricket has fought for recognition. Despite being overlooked in the Women's Premier League auction, she earned her first national call-up shortly after and has since become a consistent top-scorer. Her journey highlights a story of personal dedication, familial support, and breaking barriers in professional sports.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. and China prepare for a new round of trade talks, President Donald Trump has acknowledged that the current high tariff rates on Chinese goods are "not sustainable." This comment comes amid escalating trade tensions, including China's recent export controls on rare earth minerals, which prompted Trump to threaten even higher tariffs. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is scheduled to meet with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng to negotiate a truce before a key agreement expires in November. The discussions aim to de-escalate the economic conflict between the world's two largest economies.</p>

          <p>A new blood test called Galleri has demonstrated significant potential for early cancer detection, according to results from a large-scale trial in North America. The test successfully identified DNA fragments from over 50 different types of cancer, more than half of which were found at an early, more treatable stage. Notably, three-quarters of the cancers detected are types that currently have no routine screening programs, such as pancreatic and ovarian cancer. While researchers are optimistic that this could revolutionize cancer screening, further data, including from an ongoing NHS trial, is needed to confirm if it reduces mortality rates.</p>

          <p>Following what is reported as "intense pressure" from the King, Prince Andrew has announced he will give up his royal and military titles, including the Duke of York. The move is seen by Buckingham Palace as an attempt to end the "distractions" caused by the continuing controversy over his connections to the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. While UK newspapers have described the decision as a "fall from grace" and an "exile," the prince used his announcement to maintain that he vigorously denies the allegations made against him. The decision has been largely welcomed as a necessary step to protect the monarchy.</p>

          <p>Chinese car manufacturers have significantly increased their market presence in South Africa, with sales volumes surging by 86 percent in the first eight months of the year compared to the previous year. Brands like Chery and Haval are leading this growth, collectively capturing 15 percent of the country's SUV market. This rapid expansion comes at the expense of traditional market leaders from Japan, such as Toyota and Suzuki, who have seen their market share decline despite still holding the largest sales volumes. The trend indicates a major shift in consumer preference and competition within the South African automotive industry.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani achieved a legendary postseason performance, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to the World Series by sweeping the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Championship Series.

This dominant display, which earned him the NLCS MVP award, emphatically ended a recent hitting slump and solidified the Dodgers' position as favorites to become the first repeat champions in 25 years. His performance showcased his unique and unparalleled talent on baseball's biggest stage.</p>

          <p>The damage from a severe storm that flooded remote Alaska Native villages is so extensive that officials believe many of the 2,000 displaced residents may not be able to return home for at least 18 months. The remnants of Typhoon Halong destroyed a high percentage of homes in several villages, with one community seeing 90% of its residences lost. Governor Mike Dunleavy has requested a major disaster declaration from the White House to secure federal aid for the long-term recovery effort. Evacuees are being housed in temporary shelters in Anchorage, facing the challenge of starting new lives far from their homes.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 23:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba Cloud has introduced a new computing solution named Aegaeon that it claims can reduce the number of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) needed to run AI models by up to 82 percent. The system works by efficiently pooling GPU resources to serve multiple AI models concurrently, addressing the common issue of underutilized hardware. During a three-month beta test in Alibaba's model marketplace, the system cut the required number of high-end Nvidia GPUs from 1,192 to just 213. This innovation could lead to significant cost savings and improved efficiency for cloud service providers running large-scale AI operations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has set a deadline of June 1, 2026, for prosecutors to begin a retrial of Pedro Hernandez, the man previously convicted of the 1979 kidnapping and murder of 6-year-old Etan Patz. If a new jury is not selected by that date, Hernandez will be released. This will be the third time Hernandez faces trial for the crime, after his 2017 conviction was overturned by an appeals court due to incorrect jury instructions regarding his confession. Hernandez's attorneys have long maintained that his confession was false and a product of mental illness.</p>
