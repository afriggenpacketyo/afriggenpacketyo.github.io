          <p>The ringleader of a grooming gang in Rochdale, England, has been sentenced to 35 years in prison for committing sexual assault against two schoolgirls. Mohammed Zahid, 65, was one of seven men convicted for a series of sexual offenses that occurred between 2001 and 2006. The court heard that the men exploited the girls' troubled home lives, treating them as sexual slaves and plying them with drugs and alcohol. The judge described the men as predatory, noting they abused, degraded, and then discarded their victims, who were failed by police and social services at the time.</p>

          <p>New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone is facing scrutiny for his decision to pull starting pitcher Max Fried during a 3-1 playoff loss to the Boston Red Sox. Fried had pitched six scoreless innings before being removed in the seventh, after which the bullpen allowed the go-ahead runs. Boone defended the move, stating he felt Fried's command was weakening, a decision that has sparked debate among fans and analysts. The loss puts the Yankees on the brink of elimination in the AL Wild Card Series, highlighting the team's ongoing bullpen struggles this season.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old woman who was missing for two days in the Idaho wilderness was successfully rescued after being discovered by a group of mountain bikers. Heather Wayment was found wandering on a remote trail in her underwear with bloodied feet, approximately 17 miles from her vehicle. The bikers, who were not part of the official search party, provided initial aid and managed to contact emergency services using a satellite phone. She was later airlifted to a medical center, with authorities thanking the bikers for their crucial role in the successful rescue operation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. federal government has officially shut down after lawmakers failed to pass a funding extension, leading to an immediate political battle over responsibility. Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, blamed Democrats for voting against a stopgap measure, while Democrats asserted that the GOP, which controls the White House and Congress, is inept and owns the shutdown. The core of the dispute is the Democratic demand that any funding bill include an extension of healthcare subsidies. The impasse has halted many government services and furloughed thousands of federal workers.</p>

          <p>Private U.S. companies reduced payrolls by 32,000 in September, marking the largest decline in over two years, according to a report from ADP. This unexpected drop, contrary to economists' expectations of a modest gain, suggests a weakening labor market. The report gains added significance as the ongoing government shutdown will prevent the Bureau of Labor Statistics from releasing its official nonfarm payrolls data.

The site is located directly next to the historic Freedom Tower, which served as a processing center for Cuban refugees and is a symbol of hope for immigrants. Critics argue that placing a monument to Trump, known for his restrictive immigration policies, next to the tower is a betrayal of its legacy.

          <p>A new framework agreement proposed by President Donald Trump to end the war in Gaza has gained initial support from key Arab nations and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

While the document vaguely mentions a pathway to Palestinian statehood, Netanyahu has publicly reiterated his staunch opposition to such an outcome. This ambiguity allows both sides to claim the plan aligns with their goals, creating a fragile foundation for the difficult negotiations required to achieve a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>American households are facing sharply rising electricity bills, with residential rates having increased over 30 percent since 2020, outpacing inflation. This surge is driven by a combination of factors, including increased demand, volatile fuel prices, inflation, and delays in grid infrastructure projects. While the rising costs are creating a crisis for low-income households, experts note that overall household energy spending has remained relatively stable when accounting for gasoline and natural gas. In the long term, the shift to more efficient electric appliances and vehicles is expected to reduce the total share of income spent on energy.</p>

The industry has shed 4,000 positions this year as U.S. crude prices have fallen below the break-even point for many shale producers. Executives have criticized the Trump administration's policies, arguing that the push for lower oil prices combined with steel tariffs is making drilling unprofitable and forcing layoffs.</p>

          <p>The UK's first named storm of the season, Storm Amy, is expected to bring heavy rain and winds gusting up to 80 mph on Friday and Saturday. The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for wind and rain across Northern Ireland, Scotland, and parts of England and Wales. Forecasters warn of potential damage and significant transport disruption, including canceled ferries and flights, as the storm moves across the country. The strong winds pose a particular risk to trees that are still in full leaf, increasing the likelihood of them being toppled.</p>

          <p>Demand for mortgage refinancing in the U.S. plunged by 21% last week after interest rates rose to a three-week high, reversing a recent downward trend. The average contract rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage increased to 6.46%, diminishing the incentive for homeowners to refinance. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the sharp drop suggests that opportunities for refinancing will likely be short-lived in the current volatile rate environment. Applications for home purchases also saw a slight decline of 1%, indicating the housing market remains sensitive to rate fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is causing a delay in the release of key economic reports, including the highly anticipated monthly jobs data. This information blackout leaves policymakers, including the Federal Reserve, without crucial data needed to assess the health of the economy at a sensitive time when hiring has shown signs of slowing. If the shutdown persists, the release of inflation data could also be postponed, which would impact the calculation of the annual cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security recipients.

A state of emergency would grant Maduro special powers and allow for the temporary suspension of citizens' basic rights, escalating the already high tensions between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The current government shutdown was precipitated by a strategic shift from Congressional Democrats, who faced internal backlash for avoiding a similar confrontation with Republicans earlier in the year. This time, Democratic leaders are taking a harder stance by demanding an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies as a condition for funding the government. While this focuses the debate on favorable political ground for Democrats, the strategy is risky as they possess limited leverage. The outcome remains uncertain, with some Democrats potentially willing to compromise while others demand a more definitive legislative victory.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government plans to introduce a new law to permanently ban fracking for shale gas in England, according to Energy Secretary Ed Miliband. The announcement, made at the party's conference, aims to solidify the current moratorium on the controversial practice, which has faced opposition due to environmental and seismic concerns. Miliband stated that fracking would not lower energy bills and would undermine climate commitments. The move positions Labour in direct opposition to Reform UK, which has advocated for reviving fracking as part of its energy policy.</p>

While the popular sausage roll will not be affected in this round, the move reflects a broader trend of rising prices across the UK high street.

          <p>The U.S. government has shut down after Congress failed to pass a spending bill, primarily due to a standoff between Republicans and Democrats over healthcare subsidies. Because Republicans lack the 60 votes needed to pass the bill in the Senate, Democrats have leverage to demand policy concessions. The shutdown results in the furlough of non-essential federal workers, closure of national parks and museums, and potential delays in services and travel. Unlike past shutdowns, the Trump administration has indicated it may use the situation to permanently reduce the federal workforce, raising the stakes of the political impasse.</p>
