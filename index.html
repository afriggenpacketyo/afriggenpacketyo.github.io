          <h2>House Republicans Advance Tax Bill with SALT Deduction Debate Ongoing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 13:00:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans have moved forward with President Trump's tax bill, which includes trillions in tax breaks, after a party-line vote in the House Ways and Means Committee. A key point of contention remains the deduction for state and local taxes (SALT). The proposed bill would raise the SALT cap to $30,000 for individuals with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or less, but some lawmakers are pushing for a higher limit. The current $10,000 SALT cap was initially implemented to help finance the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and the bill could face significant changes in the Senate.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new legislation to address severe overcrowding in prisons in England and Wales. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood stated that while a Â£4.7 billion investment would fund new prisons, building alone cannot resolve the crisis. The measures include releasing offenders recalled to prison for breaching licenses after a fixed 28-day period, which is expected to free up approximately 1,400 prison spaces. These changes will apply to offenders with sentences between one and four years who have been released but recalled for license breaches, excluding those who commit serious offenses or pose a high risk. </p>

          <p>Senate Democrats, led by Senators Elizabeth Warren, Mark Warner, and Jeanne Shaheen, are requesting an investigation into whether the Trump administration is improperly aiding Elon Musk's Starlink in securing foreign deals. The senators are concerned about potential conflicts of interest, alleging that Musk may be leveraging his official role and proximity to the President for personal financial gain. They cite instances such as Starlink's expansion into Bangladesh and approvals in India, suggesting a quid-pro-quo exchange of Starlink access for tariff favors. The White House denies these claims, asserting that President Trump does not tolerate conflicts of interest and that all administration officials adhere to ethical guidelines.</p>

          <p>President Trump's visit to Qatar marks a significant turnaround from his previous stance, where he once labeled the country a funder of terrorism. Qatar has invested heavily in improving its global reputation through lobbying and hosting events like the FIFA World Cup. The visit also comes amid Qatar's role as a crucial mediator between Hamas and Israel. However, Trump's acceptance of a luxury jetliner as a gift from Qatar has drawn criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, raising ethical concerns and sparking debate over Qatar's motives, especially given its ties to Hamas.</p>

The girl's mother was deported to Venezuela, while her father was sent to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro thanked Mr. Trump for the return of the toddler, calling it a profoundly humane act.</p>
