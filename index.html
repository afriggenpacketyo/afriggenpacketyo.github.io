          <p>Ten Americans held in Venezuela, including a former Navy SEAL, have been freed and are returning to the U.S. following a complex prisoner exchange. The deal involved El Salvador returning 252 Venezuelan nationals, who had been deported from the U.S. and were allegedly gang members, to Venezuela. In addition to the Americans, Venezuela also released dozens of its own political prisoners. The swap was described as a humanitarian agreement and successfully concluded after tense, "down-to-the-wire" negotiations.</p>

          <p>Over 200 Venezuelan migrants, previously deported from the U.S. to a high-security prison in El Salvador, have been sent to Venezuela as part of a major prisoner exchange. The Trump administration had deported the men, alleging they were gang members, under the authority of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act. In exchange for their return, Venezuela released ten detained Americans and a number of Venezuelan political prisoners. Civil liberties groups have criticized the initial deportations, noting many of the men lacked criminal records and were denied due process.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a libel lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch, Dow Jones, and two Wall Street Journal reporters. The suit, filed in federal court in Florida, concerns an article that reported Trump sent a "bawdy" letter to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003. Trump has vehemently denied writing the letter, calling it a "FAKE letter" and a "Scam" on his social media platform. He stated he looks forward to deposing Murdoch as part of the legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, favor the United States returning to the moon and eventually undertaking missions to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The 1969 lunar mission is still viewed by a large majority as a worthwhile achievement that contributes to national pride. The poll also suggests that Americans believe the space program yields technological benefits for society as a whole.</p>

          <p>A new law signed by President Trump establishes a $250 "visa integrity fee" for many nonimmigrant visa holders, such as students and temporary workers. The fee, part of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is intended to be implemented in the current fiscal year. While the law suggests the fee could be reimbursed if visa holders comply with all regulations, the mechanisms for collection and reimbursement have not yet been established. Immigration advocates argue this adds another financial hurdle for legal visitors, on top of existing application fees.</p>

The decision reflects the declining cultural and financial power of traditional late-night talk shows in the streaming era.

          <p>The UK Met Office has issued an amber weather warning for southeast England, anticipating torrential rain and thunderstorms that could lead to dangerous flash flooding. Forecasters predict that over a month's worth of rain could fall in just a few hours on Saturday morning. The risk of flooding is heightened because the ground is parched from a recent heatwave, reducing its ability to absorb water. The warning indicates a likelihood of property flooding, significant transport disruption, and potential power cuts.</p>

          <p>The UK has imposed sanctions on three Russian military intelligence (GRU) units and 18 individual officers for conducting a "sustained campaign of malicious cyber activity." The Foreign Office stated the campaign aimed to destabilize Europe and targeted UK media, energy infrastructure, and political institutions. This action was coordinated with new EU sanctions against Russia, including a lower price cap on Russian oil, intended to pressure Moscow over the ongoing war in Ukraine. The UK's move is described as its largest action against Russian spies since the 2018 Salisbury poisonings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Increased production of rare earth minerals in Myanmar, much of which is sourced by China, is causing significant downstream environmental problems in neighboring Thailand. These minerals are essential components for modern technology, and China dominates the global market. However, the mining operations in Myanmar are reportedly leading to pollution and other ecological damage that affects Thai communities and ecosystems. The situation highlights the hidden environmental costs associated with the global technology supply chain and China's near-monopoly on these critical resources.</p>

          <p>The newly signed GENIUS Act establishes the first federal regulations for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to be less volatile by being pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The law provides consumer protection guardrails and creates a clear legal category for these digital assets, allowing regulated banks and credit unions to issue their own. Supporters believe this will facilitate faster and cheaper financial transactions, while critics note risks remain, such as the potential for a stablecoin to "depeg" from its underlying asset, as has happened in the past.</p>

The therapy's approval has been controversial from the start due to uncertain evidence of its effectiveness, and the new safety concerns have put the company's future in jeopardy, as Elevidys is its primary product.

However, the company noted a specific weak spot in spending on economy class domestic airfare, which was flat compared to the previous year. In contrast, spending on premium airline cabins and high-cost hotels remained robust. Despite beating profit and revenue expectations, Amex shares fell, partly due to investor concerns about the high costs of its rewards programs amid increasing competition in the premium card market.
