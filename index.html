          <p>In an interview, Senator Maria Cantwell addressed the need for significant investment in the nation's weather forecasting capabilities, particularly in the wake of deadly flooding in Texas. She criticized proposed budget cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), arguing that advanced technology and research are crucial for providing earlier warnings for extreme weather events. Cantwell also expressed deep concern over the ongoing trade wars, stating they are negatively impacting businesses in her state and that the full economic consequences have yet to be felt by the country.</p>

          <p>A new Senate committee report describes the attempted assassination of Donald Trump as a "cascade of preventable failures" by the Secret Service, highlighting mishandled communications and the denial of extra security. The investigation found that the gunman was able to evade detection for a significant period before opening fire at the Pennsylvania rally. The report, released one year after the event, criticizes the agency for a lack of accountability, noting that no one has been fired and calling for more severe disciplinary measures.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures reaching up to 33.1°C, leading to amber heat-health alerts and hosepipe bans for millions. The extreme weather has also raised significant safety concerns, following the death of a 15-year-old boy in a river in Glasgow as people sought relief from the heat. Fire services are battling wildfires, including a large one in Scotland, and have issued warnings about the increased risk of drowning, urging caution around bodies of water.</p>

          <p>The latest "Superman" movie launched with a strong $122 million domestic opening, marking a crucial first step in the reboot of the DC cinematic universe under James Gunn and Peter Safran. The film's debut is one of the best for a solo Superman feature and has received generally positive reviews from both critics and audiences. While its international performance was considered slightly soft, the overall success is seen as a much-needed revitalization for the Warner Bros. superhero brand after a series of underperforming films.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly defended Attorney General Pam Bondi against criticism from some of his own supporters regarding the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case. The frustration stems from a Justice Department memo that stated there was no "incriminating client list" and confirmed Epstein's death was a suicide, contrary to many theories. Trump urged his followers to let Bondi do her job and to stop focusing on Epstein, highlighting a growing rift between the DOJ and parts of the FBI over the investigation.</p>

          <p>In a significant development for player welfare, FIFA has agreed in principle with the global players' union, Fifpro, to introduce mandatory rest periods. The consensus includes ensuring a 72-hour gap between matches and a minimum three-week break for players at the end of each season. This agreement follows concerns and a lawsuit over an expanded fixture calendar, particularly the new 32-team Club World Cup, which critics argue places excessive strain on athletes and increases the risk of injury and burnout.</p>

          <p>A feature story details how investigative genetic genealogy, a technique pioneered by amateur sleuths like Barbara Rae-Venter, is cracking long-unsolved crimes. Rae-Venter famously used public DNA databases to identify the Golden State Killer, providing law enforcement with the crucial lead that led to his arrest. The method involves building extensive family trees from DNA matches to narrow down suspects, a process that has since helped solve dozens of cold cases, including murders and decades-old sexual assaults, raising both hope for victims and questions about genetic privacy.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice, under the direction of Attorney General Pam Bondi, has dropped all charges against Dr. Michael Kirk Moore, a Utah doctor accused of destroying government-provided COVID-19 vaccines. Moore was indicted in 2023 for allegedly administering saline shots to children instead of vaccines and selling fraudulent vaccination cards. The dismissal was praised by figures like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, reflecting a shift in the administration's stance on pandemic-related regulations and prosecutions.</p>

          <h2>Policy Adviser Argues Chinese Think Tanks Should Be 'Self-Centred' to Boost Soft Power</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a policy adviser in Beijing, has argued that Chinese think tanks must develop an "indigenous knowledge system" to effectively project the country's soft power. He stated that these organizations should focus on China's unique practical experiences rather than relying on Western academic models to explain Chinese policies and predict future developments. According to Zheng, this "self-centred" approach is essential for creating a narrative that accurately reflects China's governance and decision-making processes to a global audience.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese satellites, Shijian-21 and Shijian-25, appear to have docked in geostationary orbit, a maneuver that could signify a historic in-orbit satellite refueling mission. According to US-based space awareness provider COMSPOC, the two spacecraft were observed in prolonged close-proximity operations and appeared visually merged for several days. If confirmed, this would represent a significant advance in autonomous satellite servicing technology for China, a capability that the United States has yet to achieve in the same orbital regime.</p>

          <p>The head of the UK's media regulator, Ofcom, has stated that the BBC needs to handle controversies more quickly to avoid eroding public trust. Dame Melanie Dawes pointed to recent incidents, including a controversial Glastonbury broadcast and a withdrawn Gaza documentary, as "own goals" for the corporation. She expressed frustration that it can take the BBC a long time to acknowledge and investigate issues that are immediately apparent to the public, urging for faster conclusions and actions to maintain confidence.</p>
