          <p>Shares of WK Kellogg, the company behind iconic breakfast cereals like Fruit Loops and Rice Krispies, have skyrocketed by over 50% following reports of a potential takeover. Chocolate and confectionery giant Ferrero is reportedly in advanced talks to acquire the struggling cereal maker for approximately $3 billion, a deal that could be finalized this week. This acquisition would significantly expand Ferrero's footprint in the U.S. breakfast market and comes as traditional food companies face challenges from shifting consumer preferences.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, was subjected to another massive overnight drone attack by Russian forces, injuring at least 13 people and causing fires across multiple city districts. Ukrainian officials reported that drone wreckage struck residential buildings and other structures, prompting air defense systems to engage the incoming threats. The assault follows what Ukraine described as the largest aerial attack of the war just a day prior, highlighting an intensification of Russia's air campaign against Ukrainian cities.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative party, is proposing to bar some foreign nationals from claiming disability and sickness benefits as part of a plan for stricter welfare curbs. Describing the country's benefits bill as a "ticking time bomb," she aims to create a political dividing line with the Labour party, which recently scaled back its own welfare cut proposals. The plan would restrict benefits like Personal Independence Payment to British citizens, a move Labour argues could lead to reciprocal actions against British nationals abroad.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to maintain its policy interest rate at 2.5%, pausing to evaluate the impact of recent measures aimed at cooling Seoul's overheated housing market. The central bank is prioritizing financial stability due to a significant acceleration in housing prices and a rapid expansion of household debt, exacerbated by the country's unique "jeonse" rental deposit system. Analysts expect the bank may consider rate cuts later in the year once the housing market shows signs of stabilizing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a steep 50% tariff on all goods from Brazil, directly linking the trade measure to the ongoing criminal prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. In a letter, Trump condemned the legal proceedings against his ally as a "Witch Hunt" and an "international disgrace," demanding they cease immediately. The move is unusual as the U.S. currently holds a trade surplus with Brazil, and it has been met with a firm response from Brazilian President Lula da Silva, who affirmed his country's sovereignty and judicial independence.</p>

          <p>As deadly floodwaters rose rapidly in Kerr County, Texas, emergency alerts that could have warned residents were significantly delayed, according to radio traffic recordings and a former county official. A firefighter's request to activate the CodeRED alert system was met with a response that it required supervisor approval, a process that took critical time as the disaster unfolded. Many residents, including families who narrowly escaped, reported receiving no official warnings, raising serious questions about the local emergency response system.</p>

          <p>The European Union is expressing hope that a framework for a trade agreement with the United States could be finalized within days, aiming to avert new duties. This comes as the Trump administration escalates its trade-war footing, announcing a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports and threatening levies on goods from several other nations. While EU officials signal progress in negotiations, the White House continues its strategy of using tariff threats to pressure trading partners, creating significant uncertainty in the global economy.</p>

          <p>The United States has confirmed 1,288 cases of measles so far this year, marking the highest number of infections recorded since 1992 and surpassing the total for all of 2019. The surge is largely driven by a major outbreak in West Texas, and cases have now been reported in 38 states. Health officials attribute the resurgence of the nearly-eliminated virus to declining vaccination rates in some communities, and they continue to strongly recommend the safe and effective MMR vaccine as the best form of protection.</p>

The proposed three-year contract includes annual 3% raises and a one-time bonus, a figure significantly lower than the union's initial demands, but workers began returning to their jobs immediately to start the cleanup.</p>

          <p>This commentary article explores how Pixar's animated film "Elio," about a boy who feels like an outsider, resonates with the current political climate surrounding immigration in the United States. The author argues that the movie's themes of alienation and finding a sense of belonging speak directly to the experiences of Latino children witnessing aggressive ICE raids and hostile political rhetoric. While not an overtly political film, its story of a young hero redefining "home" offers a relevant narrative in a time of fear for many immigrant communities.</p>
