          <p>The Trump administration plans a 5% tax on remittance transfers from the U.S., primarily affecting Latin American countries, which receive about $160 billion annually. Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum criticized the proposal, arguing it amounts to double taxation. The tax aims to curb illegal migration by requiring identity verification for money transfers, a move deemed discriminatory by Mexican Senator Antonino Morales. Experts warn the tax could push transfers into informal channels, increasing black market activity, and alienate Latino voters ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has issued a preliminary injunction, indefinitely pausing President Trump's sweeping overhaul of the federal government. The judge, Susan Illston, stated that agencies cannot conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force without Congressional approval. The lawsuit was brought by a coalition of labor unions, nonprofits, and local governments, who argued that Trump lacks the authority to carry out such changes unilaterally. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Doctors in England are threatening strike action after being offered a 4% pay rise, which the British Medical Association (BMA) deems "derisory." The BMA argues that doctors' pay is still significantly lower than it was 16 years ago, accounting for inflation. Meanwhile, the National Education Union (NEU) may dispute the government if it doesn't fully fund the 4% pay rise for teachers. Health Secretary Wes Streeting defended the offers, stating they are above inflation.</p>

          <p>A sprawling legislative package passed by House Republicans skews heavily toward benefiting the wealthiest Americans through tax cuts, while low-income households would be worse off due to reductions in social safety net programs. Analyses from the Congressional Budget Office and the Yale Budget Lab indicate that the bottom tenth of households could see a 2% to 4% income drop, while the top 10% could gain 2% to 4%. The bill's tax breaks disproportionately favor high earners, and cuts to Medicaid and SNAP would affect lower-income individuals.</p>
