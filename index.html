          <p>A parenting expert identifies five key characteristics of parents who raise highly successful children, emphasizing the importance of optimism, tailored motivation, and fostering a love of learning. Parents should encourage a sense of possibility and positivity, adapting their motivational approach to their child's interests. Learning and empowerment can happen anywhere, and parents should foster self-sufficiency rather than intervening in every task. A genuine love for knowledge matters, and parents should motivate with love rather than being overly critical.</p>

          <p>UK doctors are trialing "poo pills" containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors to eliminate superbug infections. The stool samples are packed with beneficial bacteria that can replace drug-resistant bacteria in the gut. Early data indicates that this approach may help tackle antibiotic-resistant infections, which claim a million lives annually. The study suggests that donor bacteria can compete with superbugs for resources in the gut, potentially eliminating them or reducing their levels.</p>
