          <p>Doordash has announced its acquisition of restaurant booking platform SevenRooms for $1.2 billion, a move aimed at expanding its services beyond food delivery. However, the company's first-quarter revenue fell short of expectations, reporting $3.03 billion against an expected $3.09 billion. This mixed news highlights the challenges Doordash faces in balancing growth through acquisitions with meeting financial targets in a competitive market. The acquisition of SevenRooms will allow Doordash to integrate booking services, offering a more comprehensive platform for restaurants and consumers alike. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Friedrich Merz, the designated Federal Chancellor of Germany, experienced a setback after failing to secure a majority in the first round of parliamentary voting. Merz received 310 votes, falling short of the required 316 from the 630 members of parliament. Despite this unexpected outcome, analysts anticipate that Merz will eventually garner sufficient support to assume the chancellorship. The delay, however, raises concerns about his ability to effectively pursue his agenda both domestically and internationally, potentially impacting his authority. The result led to a temporary halt in the parliamentary session and a dip in the German Dax stock market index.</p>

          <p>A Reddit user ignited a viral debate after sharing his discomfort with a friend of his girlfriend's request to use their kitchen for an entire week. The user, who enjoys cooking and considers the kitchen his personal space, felt the request was entitled and lacked social consideration. While some commenters sided with the user, deeming the request absurd, others viewed it as a normal request, suggesting the friend might miss cooking due to dorm living. Etiquette expert Diane Gottsman advises setting boundaries and suggests the friend should offer some form of compensation for the extended use of the kitchen.</p>

          <p>House Judiciary Committee Democrats have launched an investigation into the Trump administration's decision to freeze funding for nearly 400 nonprofit and crime victims' groups. The probe seeks to understand the rationale behind the funding cuts, with lawmakers questioning whether the decisions were influenced by cost-cutting measures or shifts in Justice Department priorities. The Democrats have requested detailed information from Attorney General Pam Bondi regarding the criteria used to terminate and restore funding to these organizations. The impacted programs include initiatives aimed at reducing hate crimes, preventing school shootings, and supporting victims of human trafficking and sexual assault.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several major consumer companies, including Coca-Cola and Constellation Brands, have reported a slowdown in sales from Hispanic shoppers in North America. Executives attribute this decline to economic concerns and fears surrounding stricter immigration policies. Constellation Brands, which relies heavily on Hispanic consumers for its beer sales, provided a weaker-than-expected outlook, citing these factors. The Latino unemployment rate has also seen a slight increase, contributing to the decreased spending on social gatherings and consumer packaged goods. The White House's hard-line immigration stance and broader economic concerns have led some Hispanic consumers to pull back their spending.</p>

          <p>Hamas has dismissed ceasefire talks with Israel as pointless, citing Israel's ‚Äúhunger war‚Äù in Gaza as famine looms and preparations for a broader military assault continue. This declaration follows Israel's approval of a military plan that includes the ‚Äúconquest‚Äù of Gaza, displacing nearly all of its 2.3 million residents and exacerbating the humanitarian crisis with a two-month blockade. Despite ongoing efforts by Qatar to mediate a ceasefire, a Hamas official stated that engaging in talks is senseless while the ‚Äúextermination war‚Äù persists.

          <h2>China Refrains from Disruptive De-Dollarization Despite Trade War with US</h2>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions with the United States, China has largely avoided measures that would significantly de-dollarize its economy, according to an Oxford Economics report. The report suggests that China's export-oriented economy necessitates substantial dollar assets, and the country lacks readily available alternatives for its vast foreign exchange reserves. Instead of selling off US Treasury assets, China is more likely to weaken the yuan to support its exporters. This approach underscores China's cautious stance in navigating the trade war and its reluctance to disrupt the global financial system.</p>
