            <p>The Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) has issued a cease and desist order to Google for violating anti-monopoly laws by requiring Android device manufacturers to prioritize Google's search apps and services through licensing agreements. The JFTC stated that Google mandated manufacturers to preinstall and prominently feature Google Search and Chrome, with at least six such agreements in effect as of December 2024. This action follows similar crackdowns on Google in the UK and the U.S. The commission also noted that Google required manufacturers to exclude rival search services as a condition of its advertising revenue-sharing model.</p>

            <p>China has appointed Li Chenggang as the new vice minister of commerce and top representative for international trade negotiation, replacing Wang Shouwen, as trade tensions with the U.S. escalate. Li's appointment makes him a key figure in China's trade negotiation team amidst ongoing trade disputes with the U.S., where there have been no signs of near-term trade talks as both sides have increased tariff tensions. Li was also among the Chinese officials who met with top entrepreneurs last month to address the concerns of private companies after President Xi Jinping expressed support for businesses in February. This move comes as part of a wider reshuffle in Beijing's top leadership.</p>

            <p>The White House is implementing a new media policy that significantly restricts access to the president, particularly for wire services like the Associated Press (AP), Reuters, and Bloomberg. This move follows a court ruling that the White House improperly punished the AP for refusing to rename the Gulf of Mexico, violating the organization's free speech rights. The new policy will limit the number of wire service reporters in small-space events and give the press secretary final say over who questions the president. Critics argue that this policy allows for viewpoint discrimination and restricts the independent media's ability to cover the president.</p>

            <p>A new Texas bill, Senate Bill 6, could potentially delay or derail President Trump's "Stargate" AI initiative, which aims to build ultra-powerful data centers across the country. The legislation adds a six-month regulatory review on top of existing timelines, requires new fees, and mandates backup generators, potentially increasing costs and delaying project timelines. While proponents argue the bill safeguards against power grid failures, critics warn it could push billion-dollar AI projects out of Texas, even as rival states actively court these businesses. Experts fear these regulations could put the U.S. behind China in the global AI race.</p>

            <p>Since President Trump's inauguration, his administration has faced allegations of violating court orders on multiple occasions, raising concerns about the separation of powers. These clashes include issues such as freezing federal funding, using the Alien Enemies Act for deportations, and the removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. While the Justice Department defends the administration's actions, judges have expressed concerns about compliance with court orders. The Trump Administration now faces arguably its most high-profile legal battle, as it attempts to keep Kilmar Abrego Garcia in Salvadoran custody despite the Supreme Court ordering his administration to facilitate his release.</p>

            <p>China's economy grew by 5.4% in the first quarter, exceeding expectations, but concerns remain over the impact of an escalating trade war with the United States. The growth figure is in line with the previous quarter, but worries are mounting about achieving the annual growth target of around 5%. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) acknowledged that the external environment is becoming more complex and that domestic demand remains insufficient. The Chinese government aims to maintain economic momentum despite external pressures.</p>
