            <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump stated his hope for a deal between Russia and Ukraine this week, suggesting it would lead to increased business with the United States. He called on both Kyiv and Moscow to show a willingness to compromise in the ongoing war, which began with Russia's invasion in February 2022. Trump's statement followed a brief Easter ceasefire announced by Russian President Vladimir Putin, which both sides have accused each other of violating. The details of the potential deal and its implications remain unspecified.</p>

            <p>With mortgage rates expected to decrease, first-time home buyers are exploring various strategies to enter the housing market. Experts recommend starting to save early, utilizing Lifetime ISAs, and considering low-deposit mortgage options. Shared ownership schemes, allowing buyers to purchase a portion of a property, and 'income boost' mortgages, where family members support borrowing, are also viable alternatives. These approaches aim to overcome deposit hurdles and make homeownership more accessible to a broader range of individuals. (not investment advice)</p>

            <div class="timestamp">2025-04-20 20:17:45 EDT</div>
          </div>
          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>A recent study highlights that men visit doctors less frequently than women, often delaying medical attention until symptoms become severe. This reluctance stems from societal pressures to appear tough and self-reliant, as well as appointment systems that don't accommodate working patterns. The NHS survey data indicates that men are more likely to self-manage conditions, while women are more likely to seek help from pharmacies or call helplines. Addressing these barriers is crucial for improving men's health outcomes and promoting preventative care.</p>

            <p>San Jose is considering arresting unhoused individuals who repeatedly refuse offers of shelter, according to Mayor Matt Mahan. The proposal would involve issuing citations or warnings before resorting to arrest after three refusals. The city operates various temporary housing sites, but faces challenges in persuading people to accept beds. Mahan argues that those rejecting shelter may have chronic homelessness, behavioral health issues, or addiction. The city aims to divert individuals to mental health or drug court, viewing trespassing laws as a last resort.</p>

Hogg stated this was to demonstrate his commitment to winning back the House and electing Hakeem Jeffries as Speaker. His organization, Leaders We Deserve, plans to dedicate $20 million to elect younger primary candidates against older incumbents. This initiative drew criticism from veteran strategist James Carville, who questioned Hogg's fiduciary duty to the Democratic Party.

            <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Japan sent a ritual offering to the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which is viewed by neighboring countries as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. Ishiba is not expected to visit the shrine during the three-day spring festival, likely due to diplomatic considerations as Japan's relations with China and South Korea improve. The shrine honors wartime leaders, including those convicted as war criminals. Past visits by Japanese leaders have drawn criticism from China and South Korea.</p>
