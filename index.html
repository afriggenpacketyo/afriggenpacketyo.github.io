          <p>Northern Ireland's communities minister, Gordon Lyons, has stated that a significant shortage of social housing is fueling racial tensions in the region. He clarified that while racism is inexcusable, community concerns are understandable when long-time residents wait years for housing while asylum seekers are accommodated more quickly. Lyons proposed using surplus public sector land to build more social homes to address the crisis, as the current construction rate falls far short of government targets. The issue is highlighted by recent violent disorder in Ballymena, which police described as racist thuggery.</p>

          <p>An Islamic boarding school building in Indonesia's East Java province collapsed, resulting in at least one death and trapping dozens of students and workers. The collapse occurred during afternoon prayers when a fourth floor, which was being constructed without authorization, gave way. Over 100 people have been rescued, but the exact number of those still trapped remains unclear, with reports varying. Rescue operations are ongoing but are complicated by the instability of the remaining structure, preventing the use of heavy machinery.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has proposed a 20-point peace plan for Gaza, which has received initial welcoming statements from leaders in the Middle East and Europe. The plan calls for an immediate ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, with future governance of Gaza handled by a technocratic committee. While Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu publicly backed the plan, he later reiterated his opposition to a Palestinian state, a point of divergence from the proposal's text. Hamas has received the plan and stated it will review any proposal that could end the war.</p>

          <p>The West Bank remains a critical component of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the proposed two-state solution, which envisions it as part of an independent Palestine. Occupied by Israel since the 1967 Six-Day War, the territory is now home to up to 800,000 Israeli settlers in communities considered illegal under international law. The Oslo Accords divided the area into zones with varying degrees of Palestinian Authority (PA) and Israeli control, but settlement expansion and movement restrictions complicate daily life for its 3.2 million Palestinian residents. Recent violence and political stagnation have further diminished hopes for a contiguous and viable Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government plans to launch a new "NHS Online" hospital service by 2027 to help reduce patient waiting times. Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced that the digital service will have its own dedicated doctors and nurses for online assessments, consultations, and follow-up appointments. Accessible via the NHS app, the initiative aims to deliver up to 8.5 million appointments in its first three years, focusing on conditions that may not require inpatient treatment.

          <p>Federal prosecutors are seeking a prison sentence of at least 11 years for Sean 'Diddy' Combs, who was convicted in July on two counts of transportation for the purposes of prostitution. In a sentencing memo, prosecutors argued that despite his acquittal on more severe charges, his "decades of unchecked violence" and unrepentant attitude warrant a significant sentence. They highlighted the physical abuse inflicted upon victims like Cassie Ventura, stating the punishment should reflect the extensive damage he caused. Combs' defense attorneys have characterized the recommendation as "draconian," arguing for a sentence closer to time served.</p>

After being replaced as captain by Nat Sciver-Brunt, Knight has embraced a newfound freedom, even reviving a playful "alter ego" from her early career. The injury, which sidelined her for the summer, provided unexpected time for reflection on her successful captaincy, including the 2017 World Cup victory.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the indictment against former FBI Director James Comey is a vindictive prosecution driven by Donald Trump's personal animus. It presents a timeline of Trump's public statements, where he repeatedly accused Comey of crimes, called for his arrest, and demanded retribution. The analysis highlights Trump's ousting of a prosecutor who was hesitant to bring charges and his subsequent appointment of a former personal lawyer to oversee the case as evidence of improper influence. The author concludes that the case is legally weak and should be dismissed on the grounds that it would not have been pursued without Trump's vindictive motivations.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick revealed that the Trump administration is actively encouraging Taiwan to shift semiconductor investment and production to the United States. The goal is a "50-50" split, where half of the chips America uses would be manufactured domestically, significantly reducing reliance on Taiwan, which currently produces over 90% of the world's advanced chips. Lutnick argued this move would enhance both U.S. national security and Taiwan's safety, countering the "Silicon Shield" theory. This push aligns with efforts to onshore critical manufacturing, with TSMC already planning to increase its total U.S. investment to $165 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

In its statement, the RBA acknowledged that inflation might be more persistent than previously expected but noted uncertainty in the economic outlook. Despite cutting rates by 75 basis points this year, the central bank is remaining cautious while focusing on bringing inflation back to its target range of 2-3%. (not investment advice)</p>

This shift is fueled by rhetoric from the far-right AfD party, which frames diversity as "ideological indoctrination," and is subtly supported by insiders who resist change.

          <p>Major grocery retailers in China, including Walmart and Alibaba's Freshippo, are revamping their stores to emulate the tactics of European discounters like Aldi. Facing flat sales and an economic slowdown, these chains are reducing clutter and heavily promoting their own private-label products, which offer similar quality to name brands at lower prices. This strategy aims to appeal to increasingly frugal Chinese consumers who are prioritizing value for money amid economic uncertainty. By streamlining operations and focusing on store brands, retailers hope to regain momentum in a competitive and challenging market.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Humberto, currently a major Category 3 storm in the Atlantic, is expected to generate dangerous swells affecting most of the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda this week. The National Hurricane Center has warned that these swells will likely cause "life-threatening surf and rip current conditions" along the coastline. While the storm's center is forecast to pass to the west and north of Bermuda, tropical storm conditions are still possible for the island. Humberto is one of two storm systems in the western Atlantic, with the other, Tropical Storm Imelda, also being closely monitored by forecasters.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda, the ninth named storm of the Atlantic season, is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane but is projected to move away from the southeastern United States. The storm's path is expected to take it northeast into the Atlantic, approaching Bermuda by Wednesday, for which a hurricane watch has been issued. While a direct U.S. landfall is not anticipated, swells generated by Imelda, along with Hurricane Humberto, will still affect the U.S. East Coast, creating the potential for life-threatening surf and rip currents. The storm is also expected to bring significant rainfall to parts of Cuba and the Bahamas.</p>

          <p>Thousands of current and former British military personnel have initiated legal action against the industrial company 3M, alleging that combat earplugs supplied to the Ministry of Defence were faulty and caused hearing loss and tinnitus.

Veterans state the hearing damage has had a significant impact on their family lives. While 3M has never admitted liability, arguing the product is effective when used correctly, the UK claimants are seeking compensation and justice for their injuries.</p>

Qian led a massive investment scam in China between 2014 and 2017, defrauding over 128,000 victims before fleeing to the UK and attempting to launder the stolen funds. The conviction is the result of a complex, seven-year investigation by London's Metropolitan Police into a global money laundering network. A co-conspirator was previously jailed for her role in helping to launder the proceeds.</p>

          <p>The Miami Dolphins defeated the New York Jets 27-21 for their first victory of the season, but the win was overshadowed by a severe injury to star wide receiver Tyreek Hill. Hill dislocated his left knee in the third quarter after a tackle and was carted off the field, with the injury almost certain to end his season. In his return from retirement, tight end Darren Waller scored two touchdowns for Miami. The Jets, now 0-4, struggled with turnovers and penalties, ultimately falling short despite a late-game rally, ending the game with an illegal forward pass on a desperate lateral play.</p>

The cubs were cared for at the San Diego Humane Society’s Ramona Wildlife Center, where human interaction was minimized to ensure they did not become habituated. This approach is crucial for their survival, as wild mountain lions in California face numerous threats, including habitat loss and vehicle collisions. The state's mountain lion population is estimated to be between 3,200 and 4,500, and is classified as a "near-threatened" species.</p>
