          <p>Nvidia has become the first company in history to achieve a market capitalization of over $4 trillion, driven by the immense demand for its artificial intelligence hardware. This milestone solidifies its position as the world's most valuable company, surpassing tech giants like Microsoft and Apple. The chipmaker's value has surged dramatically since the launch of ChatGPT, reflecting its dominance in producing the graphics processing units essential for generative AI. This rapid growth has occurred despite geopolitical tensions and export restrictions that have impacted sales to China.</p>

          <p>Just two days before a devastating flood killed more than two dozen people, state inspectors approved the written emergency plan for Camp Mystic in Central Texas. Despite meeting state regulations on paper, the camp did not evacuate its hundreds of campers even after the National Weather Service issued a flood watch more than 12 hours before the disaster. The Guadalupe River rose with shocking speed, overwhelming the camp and leading to immense loss of life. The tragedy has raised serious questions about the adequacy of the camp's preparedness and response.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Russia has introduced a "Shared Values Visa" to attract Western expatriates who disagree with progressive social policies in their home countries. The visa, framed as an "anti-woke" initiative, is designed for those who share what Russia defines as traditional spiritual and moral values. Analysts view the program as a symbolic propaganda tool to both praise Russia's perceived conservatism to its own citizens and to help address the country's serious demographic challenges. Reports suggest Russian state media is actively involved in promoting the narrative of successful resettlement.</p>

He has long disputed the official finding, stating that his brother was looking forward to a bail hearing and that autopsy results were inconsistent with suicide. The FBI memo also concluded that after reviewing extensive data, there was no credible evidence of a "client list" or that Epstein had blackmailed prominent individuals, a conclusion Mark Epstein finds laughable.</p>

          <p>This article provides a snapshot of current interest rates for Certificates of Deposit, highlighting that many top accounts are offering yields that outpace the rate of inflation. It explains that online banks generally provide more competitive rates compared to traditional institutions, largely due to their lower overhead costs. The report also touches on the current inverted yield curve, a phenomenon where short-term CDs often feature higher interest rates than their long-term counterparts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's announcement of a potential 50% tariff on copper imports has caused the metal's price in the U.S. to skyrocket, creating a massive premium over the global benchmark. Analysts are warning of severe economic consequences, as the increased cost of this essential material will impact everything from consumer electronics and cars to major housing and infrastructure projects. This price shock is expected to hit U.S. businesses and consumers directly, with domestic production unable to quickly fill the import gap. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Telehealth company Hims & Hers Health has announced its expansion into Canada, where it will begin offering a generic version of the popular weight-loss drug semaglutide. This move is possible because the patent held by Novo Nordisk for its brand-name drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, is set to lapse in Canada in January. The development signals increased competition in the highly profitable GLP-1 drug market and is expected to make the treatment more accessible and affordable for Canadians.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the new federal budget reveals massive funding increases for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), positioning it to become the largest and most well-resourced domestic police force in the United States. The budget allocates billions for detention facilities and thousands of new agents, creating a force larger than the FBI. Critics and civil liberties advocates are raising alarms, arguing that this colossal buildup creates a powerful internal security apparatus with the potential for broad surveillance and enforcement powers beyond just immigration.</p>

          <p>Australia and the Pacific nation of Tuvalu have enacted a landmark treaty creating a "special mobility pathway" for Tuvaluans threatened by rising sea levels. The agreement, a world-first, allows 280 citizens per year to migrate to Australia with a path to permanent residency, explicitly recognizing climate change as a driver for dignified movement. This proactive approach preserves the sovereignty of Tuvalu while providing a vital safety net, and it is being viewed globally as a potential model for addressing climate-driven displacement.</p>

The report criticizes the slow pace of payments to the thousands infected with HIV and hepatitis C in the 1970s and 80s.
