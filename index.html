          <p>Colombian President Gustavo Petro alleged that a boat struck by the U.S. military in the Caribbean Sea last week carried Colombian citizens, a claim the White House swiftly dismissed as "baseless and reprehensible." This allegation intensifies scrutiny of the Trump administration's campaign against alleged drug-carrying vessels, which has seen four strikes and 21 deaths since last month. The U.S. argues these attacks are necessary to halt drug trafficking, but critics question their legality and congressional authorization. The ongoing dispute highlights strained relations between the two nations, with the U.S. having previously accused Petro's government of non-cooperation on anti-drug efforts.</p>

          <p>SoftBank's shares surged 13% after announcing a $5.4 billion deal to acquire the robotics division of Swiss engineering firm ABB, expanding its footprint in artificial intelligence. This acquisition aligns with SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son's vision of "Physical AI" and Artificial Super Intelligence, which he believes will propel humanity forward. The deal means ABB will no longer pursue a separate listing for its robotics business. This article also briefly mentions HSBC's proposal to privatize Hang Seng Bank, indicating broader market activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eight individuals linked to a Houston-area midwife, Maria Margarita Rojas, have been arrested and indicted for practicing medicine without a license in Texas. Attorney General Ken Paxton described the group as "abortion-loving radicals" who endangered patients, reinforcing his commitment to enforcing the state's strict abortion laws. Rojas herself faces 15 felony counts under the Texas Human Life Protection Act. Critics, including the Center for Reproductive Rights, argue these indictments are an escalation of a "scare campaign" targeting healthcare workers and low-income, uninsured immigrants.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old man, Jonathan Rinderknecht, has been arrested in Florida on suspicion of starting the Pacific Palisades fire in Los Angeles, which killed 12 people and destroyed thousands of homes. Investigators found an image he generated on ChatGPT depicting a burning city, along with other digital evidence like videos of firefighters and suspicious 911 calls. Authorities allege Rinderknecht started an initial fire that smoldered before reigniting into the devastating blaze. The use of AI-generated images as evidence marks a novel aspect of this significant criminal investigation.</p>

          <p>Hang Seng Bank shares surged by nearly 30% following an announcement that its parent company, HSBC, plans to take it private in a deal valuing the lender at over $37 billion. HSBC aims to acquire the remaining 37% of Hang Seng Bank, offering a 33% premium on its recent share price. This move is part of HSBC's strategy to strengthen its banking presence in Hong Kong and the broader Asia-Pacific region. Analysts view the privatization as a positive, long-overdue step to address governance issues associated with parent-subsidiary double listings, despite Hang Seng Bank's recent uptick in bad loans.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a peace deal, which includes the release of hostages, potentially by Monday, and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops. The IDF has been instructed to prepare strong defenses and for any scenario, while Hamas submitted a list of Palestinian prisoners for release. This initial agreement focuses on immediate steps, with more contentious issues like Gaza's governance and Hamas disarmament still needing negotiation. The announcement sparks cautious optimism, though previous multi-phase agreements have faltered.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Priscilla has weakened from a hurricane off Mexico's Pacific coast, now below the Category 1 threshold with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph. While no longer a hurricane, it continues to bring high surf conditions and gusty winds to Baja California Sur, where a tropical storm watch remains in effect. The storm's center is expected to move parallel to the coast, remaining offshore, and further weakening is forecast over the next 48 hours. Forecasters warn of life-threatening surf, rip currents, and coastal flooding.</p>

          <p>Supreme Court justices, both conservative and liberal, expressed skepticism in a case where a Republican candidate, Rep. Michael Bost, sued over Illinois' ballot counting regulations despite winning his election. Bost's lawyer argued harm due to a lowered margin of victory and extended staffing costs. However, justices questioned the standing of a winning candidate to challenge election rules, with Chief Justice Roberts noting the argument boiled down to "I'm a candidate. These rules apply to me, and I'm suing." The case highlights complex legal questions about electoral challenges.</p>
