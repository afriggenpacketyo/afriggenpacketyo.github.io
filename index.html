          <p>Shares of steel manufacturer Cleveland-Cliffs surged by 17% following the company's announcement that it is exploring the possibility of entering the rare earths mining business. CEO Lourenco Goncalves revealed that geological surveys have indicated the presence of these critical minerals at two company sites in Michigan and Minnesota. This strategic move aligns with the national goal of achieving material independence from China, which currently dominates the global supply chain. Rare earth elements are vital for manufacturing magnets used in electric vehicles, advanced weaponry, and semiconductors. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple's stock experienced a nearly 3% rise after a new report from Counterpoint research indicated strong initial sales for the iPhone 17 series in both the United States and China. The latest models reportedly outsold the previous iPhone 16 series by 14% within the first ten days of availability, driven by the compelling value of the base model. This positive market reception prompted investment bank Loop Capital to upgrade Apple's stock from "hold" to "buy," significantly raising its price target. The strong demand suggests potential for material upside beyond current Wall Street expectations.</p>

          <p>A significant outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS), originating from its US-East-1 region in Virginia, caused widespread disruptions for numerous major websites and online services globally. The issue was attributed to DNS problems with DynamoDB, a core database service, affecting companies like Disney+, Reddit, and even Amazon's own internal operations. While AWS reported that the initial DNS issue was mitigated and services were recovering, it later noted ongoing API errors and connectivity issues. The event highlights the internet's heavy reliance on a few major cloud providers for its infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Tufan Erhurman, a moderate candidate backed by left-wing parties, has won the Turkish Cypriot leadership election with a decisive 62.8% of the vote, defeating the incumbent Ersin Tatar. Erhurman's victory is seen as a clear message in favor of resuming negotiations for a federal solution to the long-standing Cyprus problem, a departure from the two-state solution pursued by his predecessor and Turkey. His campaign also emphasized preserving the secular identity of the Turkish Cypriot community against perceived interference from Ankara. Greek Cypriot leaders have welcomed the result as an opportunity to restart stalled peace talks.</p>

          <p>Pizza Hut's UK restaurant operator, DC London Pie Limited, has fallen into administration, leading to the closure of 68 restaurants and 11 delivery locations, resulting in 1,210 job losses. This marks the second time the UK restaurant division has faced administration in less than a year. However, Pizza Hut's global owner, Yum!

The company stated its immediate priority is to ensure operational continuity at the acquired sites and support employees through the transition period.</p>

          <p>Top White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett expressed optimism that the ongoing government shutdown is likely to conclude this week. Speaking on CNBC, Hassett stated that if a resolution is not reached, the Trump administration might consider implementing "stronger measures" to compel Democrats to negotiate. The shutdown stems from a partisan disagreement over federal funding, with Democrats demanding that any stopgap bill include an extension of enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits. Hassett suggested that moderate Democrats might soon move forward to reopen the government, allowing for policy negotiations to resume through regular order.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the perplexing 40-day managerial reign of Ange Postecoglou at Nottingham Forest, which ended with his dismissal after a 3-0 home defeat to Chelsea. The appointment is framed as an obvious mismatch from the start, questioning why owner Evangelos Marinakis hired a manager known for high-pressing, attacking football for a squad built to play defensively on the counter. The piece suggests Postecoglou's decision to take the job has severely damaged his reputation and prospects for future Premier League roles. It explores potential motivations, including ego or desperation, concluding that the misjudgment itself renders him unsuitable for top-tier management.</p>

Burrello highlights that this approach is advantageous in the current rate-cutting cycle, as it offers a diversifying source of income without depending on Federal Reserve policy.

This charge is connected to his alleged role in orchestrating the 2013 murder-for-hire of a man in a Southlake, Texas, shopping center. Authorities state the killing was an act of revenge against a lawyer for a rival cartel allegedly responsible for the death of Villareal-Hernandez's father. After years on the run, he was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and extradited to the U.S.; if convicted, he could be eligible for the death penalty.</p>

          <p>The Louvre Museum remained closed as authorities investigate a daring daytime heist where thieves stole eight priceless treasures from the Apollon Gallery, which houses the French crown jewels. Among the stolen items are the Pearl and Diamond Tiara commissioned by Napoleon III, a sapphire set possibly linked to Marie Antoinette, and an emerald necklace gifted by Napoleon to his second wife. In their escape on motorcycles, the robbers dropped one significant piece, the diamond- and emerald-encrusted crown of Empress Eugenie, which was recovered outside the museum. Officials believe the robbery was the work of highly organized professionals.</p>

          <p>China's Communist Party is convening to chart its next five-year economic plan amid significant structural challenges, including sputtering exports and weak domestic consumption. Analysts indicate that Beijing is balancing the urgent need to stimulate consumer spending with the strategic priority of developing high-tech industries, like advanced semiconductors, to achieve technological sovereignty from the U.S. While some measures to boost household income have been introduced, the government's primary focus appears to be on industrial policy and manufacturing. This prioritization of technology over consumption reflects geopolitical pressures and President Xi Jinping's vision for national resilience.</p>

There are ongoing calls for his titles to be formally and permanently removed through an act of Parliament, with one MP citing overwhelming support from her constituents in York. The Metropolitan Police are also investigating claims related to Virginia Giuffre, who has accused the prince of sexual assault. The recent posthumous publication of Giuffre's memoir has further intensified the pressure on the prince and the Royal Family.</p>

          <p>This article argues that state Medicaid programs should cover new weight-loss drugs known as GLP-1s, such as Ozempic and Wegovy, for the millions of low-income Americans suffering from obesity. While the high cost of these medications presents a significant budgetary challenge, the author contends that the long-term benefits, including reduced healthcare spending on obesity-related diseases, would offset the initial expense. The piece suggests that costs are overstated, as Medicaid pays significantly less for drugs than private insurers, and prices are expected to fall as more competitors enter the market. Denying coverage creates further health inequalities for an already vulnerable population.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical account of the 14 U.S. government shutdowns that have occurred since 1980, when a new legal interpretation required agencies to cease operations during funding lapses. The piece details each shutdown, from the eight brief ones under President Ronald Reagan to the longer, more contentious ones under Presidents Clinton, Obama, and Trump. It explains the political disputes that triggered each funding gap, such as disagreements over budget cuts, healthcare policy, and immigration.

          <p>A prolonged U.S. government shutdown could lead to significant disruptions for air travelers, even though most FAA and TSA employees are deemed essential and required to work without pay. Travel industry experts warn that if a shutdown persists, financially strained airport screeners and air traffic controllers may start calling in sick, as occurred during the 2018-2019 shutdown. This could lead to labor shortages, resulting in longer security lines, flight delays, and cancellations. The U.S. Travel Association estimates that a shutdown could cost the travel economy $1 billion per week and halt the hiring and training of new air traffic controllers.</p>

          <p>Columbia University business psychology professor Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic argues that mastering specific social skills is more crucial for career success than simply "being yourself." He identifies three key abilities: being receptive to critical feedback, cultivating social awareness by focusing on others' needs, and demonstrating adaptability by stepping out of one's comfort zone to learn new skills. According to Chamorro-Premuzic, these components of emotional intelligence make individuals more employable and rewarding to work with. He advises soliciting honest, constructive criticism to close the gap between self-perception and actual performance, thereby fostering professional growth.</p>
