          <p>England and Wales will introduce a free chickenpox vaccine for all young children through the NHS starting January 2026. This two-dose vaccine, administered at 12 and 18 months alongside the MMR jab, aims to protect against severe complications and reduce parental work absences. A catch-up campaign is planned for slightly older children to ensure broad coverage. This initiative brings the UK in line with other nations and seeks to significantly decrease chickenpox cases and related serious illnesses.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to China, his first in seven years, signals a potential thaw in relations between the two Asian giants, despite historical tensions and border disputes. Both nations face economic challenges, including U.S. tariffs, which could drive reluctant cooperation. Experts remain cautious, noting deep suspicion in India and China's close ties with Pakistan, but the meeting at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit offers an opportunity for dialogue. Economic necessity, particularly India's reliance on Chinese raw materials for its manufacturing ambitions, may push for strengthened trade, even as India seeks to curb its widening trade deficit with Beijing.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has initiated an investigation into the California Environmental Protection Agency (CalEPA) regarding accusations of discriminatory hiring practices based on race, color, sex, and national origin. The probe focuses on CalEPA's "Practices to Advance Racial Equity in Workforce Planning" document, which advocates for a "racial equity lens" in workforce development and diverse interview panels. DOJ officials assert that race-based employment policies violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. This investigation highlights ongoing legal scrutiny over diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in state agencies.</p>

          <p>Italy's recent wave of banking mergers and acquisitions has encountered significant obstacles, with several high-profile bids collapsing due to regulatory conditions and shareholder dissent. UniCredit dropped its bid for Banco BPM, citing government "golden power" rules, while Mediobanca's offer for Banca Generali was rejected by shareholders. Despite these setbacks, analysts believe the consolidation trend is far from over, with ongoing interest from Monte dei Paschi and Credit Agricole. The European Union is closely observing Italy's banking sector as a case study for M&A evolution, pushing for greater cross-border integration. (not investment advice)</p>

This medium-class launch vehicle, equipped with powerful RD-171MV engines, represents a domestic successor to the Ukraine-manufactured Zenit-2. The launch is a significant undertaking for Roscosmos, which has faced funding shortages and severed ties with the European Space Agency since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Despite these challenges, Russia is leveraging Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome to continue its space endeavors.</p>

          <p>South Korea has reportedly indicted former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo for abetting the martial law bid of ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol, and ex-first lady Kim Keon Hee on corruption and bribery charges.

These indictments stem from special investigations approved by President Lee Jae Myung following Yoon's impeachment and removal from office earlier this year.

          <p>UK firms are voicing significant concerns over the new U.S. tariffs on low-value parcels, which ended the "de minimis" exemption for goods under $800.

Small businesses, like hand-dyed wool and gift companies, report suspending U.S. shipments due to uncertainty about costs and the inability to provide upfront pricing to customers.

          <p>Large, brown cage-free eggs from Country Eggs LLC in Lucerne Valley, California, are at the center of a salmonella outbreak that has sickened at least 95 people across 14 states.

          <p>The UK, France, and Germany (E3) have begun the process to reimpose major UN sanctions on Iran, utilizing a "snapback" mechanism from the 2015 nuclear deal. This move comes amid escalating tensions over Tehran's nuclear program, which the E3 asserts has "no civilian justification" for its highly enriched uranium stockpile. Iran's foreign minister rejects the E3's legal jurisdiction and maintains readiness for "fair and balanced" negotiations, supported by Russia and China. The action, taken after U.S. withdrawal from the deal and subsequent Iranian non-compliance, could see sanctions return within 30 days.</p>
