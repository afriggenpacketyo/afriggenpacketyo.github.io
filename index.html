          <p>Families of Israeli hostages held by Hamas are publicly accusing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of being the primary obstacle to securing their release. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum claims that every time a deal appears close, Netanyahu sabotages it, pointing to a recent Israeli strike in Qatar as the latest example. This public dissent highlights the immense pressure on the Israeli government as it continues its military offensive in Gaza while facing international condemnation and domestic frustration over the fate of the remaining captives.</p>

          <p>A central London rally organized by far-right activist Tommy Robinson resulted in twenty-six police officers being injured, with four seriously hurt. The 'Unite the Kingdom' protest, which drew up to 150,000 people, saw clashes where projectiles were thrown at police as they tried to keep the demonstrators separate from a nearby counter-protest. The Metropolitan Police made 24 arrests for various offenses, describing the violence as "wholly unacceptable" and vowing to identify more individuals involved in the disorder. Tech billionaire Elon Musk also made a surprise video appearance, calling for a new UK election.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has arrived in Israel for a two-day visit as the Israeli military intensifies its attacks on northern Gaza, resulting in further Palestinian casualties. Rubio's visit aims to seek clarity on Israel's strategy following its controversial strike on Hamas leaders in Qatar, which has strained diplomatic efforts for a ceasefire. The trip underscores the delicate balance the U.S. is trying to maintain, showing support for Israel while managing international condemnation and the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, where malnutrition-related deaths are reportedly rising.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues against the deportation of Kelvin, a man who served time for armed robbery but underwent significant rehabilitation while incarcerated. The author, who adopted his children, describes how Kelvin transformed his life, only to be deported to El Salvador upon parole due to an old order, where he was immediately imprisoned under harsh conditions. The article contends that deporting individuals who have demonstrated genuine reform does not enhance national security and wastes the state's investment in their rehabilitation, ultimately making the country less humane.</p>

          <p>As Israel calls up 60,000 more reservists for its Gaza offensive, a contentious domestic debate over mandatory military service for the Ultra-Orthodox (Haredi) community has reignited. This long-standing exemption, dating back to 1948, is facing intense scrutiny as the prolonged war strains the military and society. Prime Minister Netanyahu's coalition is under pressure to pass new legislation, balancing the army's need for soldiers with the Haredi leadership's resistance to integration. The issue highlights a deep societal rift over equality and civic duty during a time of national crisis.</p>

          <p>According to Chinese defense scientists, a new artificial intelligence-powered anti-submarine warfare (ASW) system could reduce a submarine's chance of escape to just 5 percent. The system moves beyond traditional search patterns by functioning as an intelligent command center. It integrates data from various sources, including sonar buoys, underwater sensors, radar, and even oceanographic information like temperature and salinity. This allows it to create a comprehensive, real-time operational picture of the undersea environment, significantly enhancing detection and attack capabilities.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from a group of scholars warns that the Colorado River's reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, are so depleted that another dry year could trigger a severe crisis. The researchers are calling on the Trump administration to impose immediate and substantial water use cutbacks across the seven states reliant on the river. The report highlights a grim outlook, stating that without significant reductions, water usage would again far exceed the river's natural flow, pushing the system toward dangerously low levels and necessitating more draconian measures in the future.</p>

Baca's decision to confront the FBI rather than cooperate led to the indictment of 22 department members and his own conviction for obstruction of justice, exposing the deep-seated institutional rot he failed to address.</p>

          <p>Residents of Henllys, a village in Cwmbran, Wales, came together to clean graffiti that included St. George's Crosses, swastikas, and anti-immigrant text reading "Stop the boats." About 20 signs and a subway used by schoolchildren were vandalized, prompting a community-led cleanup effort. Participants said the act of uniting against what they see as divisive and hateful vandalism sent a powerful message of solidarity. Gwent Police are investigating the incident, which follows a pattern of similar flag-related symbols appearing across the UK, sometimes associated with nationalist or far-right sentiments.</p>

          <p>A seemingly ordinary working father, Robert Andrews Jr., was exposed as the mastermind of a multi-million pound cocaine and heroin empire in south Wales. Police were alerted to his operation after discovering revealing WhatsApp messages on another gang leader's phone, where the two joked about becoming millionaires or cellmates. A covert surveillance operation then captured Andrews Jr. conducting large-scale drug deals and cash handovers in broad daylight. His arrest and subsequent conviction for 14 years highlight how digital communications can provide crucial evidence in dismantling major organized crime groups.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study indicates that women trying to conceive should avoid cannabis, as its active ingredient, THC, may negatively affect female fertility. Researchers found that THC can disrupt the development and genetic stability of egg cells, both in laboratory settings and in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). The study showed that THC-positive patients had a significantly lower rate of genetically healthy embryos, which could reduce the chances of a successful pregnancy. The findings suggest THC alters genes responsible for correct chromosome distribution and cell stabilization, crucial for embryo development.</p>

          <p>China has issued four travel advisories for the Philippines since April, citing an "unstable" public security situation and crimes targeting Chinese citizens. Analysts suggest that if these warnings are heeded, they could slow down two-way trade, investment, and educational exchanges between the nations. The frequent advisories come amid heightened geopolitical tensions in the South China Sea. While ordinary Chinese visitors for legitimate purposes rarely encounter trouble, the repeated official warnings could create a chilling effect on economic and personal travel, potentially harming bilateral relations.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the end of Nazi rule, the racist ideology of the 1935 Nuremberg Laws, which stripped Jewish people and other minorities of their rights, still resonates in modern Germany. Historians and activists draw parallels between the Nazi distinction of 'Reich citizens' versus 'state citizens' and the rhetoric of the far-right AfD party, which differentiates between 'real Germans' and 'passport Germans.' The article examines how this legacy of ancestry-based discrimination persists, challenging Germany's constitutional promise of equality and fueling contemporary debates on immigration, citizenship, and national identity.</p>

          <p>Turkey's largest opposition party, the CHP, is facing a critical legal challenge that could nullify its recent party congress and delegitimize its entire reform-minded leadership. The lawsuit, filed by the party's old guard following their defeat, claims the election of new chairman Ozgur Ozel and the empowerment of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu were illegal. A court ruling against the new leadership could plunge the party into chaos, potentially reinstating the former chairman and derailing the opposition's momentum just as it has been mobilizing large protests against President Erdogan's government.</p>

The piece calls for European and other democratic nations to stop deferring to a weak and ineffective U.S. administration and take decisive action to halt the aggression, warning that failure to do so risks a descent into global anarchy.</p>
