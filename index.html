          <p>Makena White, the 28-year-old girlfriend of PGA Tour golfer Jake Knapp, has tragically passed away, leaving her family, friends, and beloved dogs deeply mourning her loss. Loved ones remembered her as "one of a kind," known for her unique ability to make others feel special, her immense heart, and a spirit that brought endless laughter and joy, despite a demanding travel schedule. The social media announcement encouraged donations to the Bruyère Brain Health & Memory Clinic or the Griffin Bell Endowment Fund in her memory, reflecting her mother's past battle with Alzheimer's disease. While additional details surrounding White's cause of death were not released, her unexpected departure marks a profound and sorrowful event for those who cherished her.</p>

          <p>Travis Decker, the 32-year-old former Army soldier accused of the horrific murders of his three young daughters, has been confirmed dead following DNA testing of human remains found in a remote Washington state area. This identification brings a grim end to a monthslong manhunt, prompting prosecutors to officially drop the charges against him. The Chelan County Coroner indicated that the exact cause and manner of Decker's death might never be determined due to the minimal skeletal remains and the significant time elapsed. His ex-wife had previously voiced concerns about his deteriorating mental health, and the girls' bodies were discovered days after they were not returned from a scheduled visit.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump publicly demanded that Microsoft fire Lisa Monaco, the company's president of global affairs and a former Deputy Attorney General under the Biden administration. Trump posted his request on Truth Social, alleging Monaco is a "menace to U.S. National Security" due to her "wrongful acts" and claiming her security clearances were stripped, impacting Microsoft's government contracts. This intervention follows Microsoft's recent decision to halt cloud services to a unit of the Israeli military, a move preceding Trump's upcoming meeting with Israel's prime minister. The article highlights the ongoing political pressure exerted by Trump on individuals and corporations he perceives as adversaries.</p>

During this assembly, Hegseth intends to outline his vision for restoring the "warrior ethos" within the U.S. military and introduce new standards aimed at achieving this objective, directly addressing command officers from around the world. The event, anticipated to be brief but impactful, allows the Secretary to personally convey his directives.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 19:06:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has allowed the Trump administration to continue withholding over $4 billion in foreign aid that Congress had already approved. The 6-3 decision, split along ideological lines, affirmed the President's foreign policy authority over the objections of international aid groups who had sued. Justice Elena Kagan, in a sharp dissent, criticized the expedited process through the emergency docket, noting the lack of thorough briefing and deliberation for such a significant ruling. This outcome marks a notable victory for the administration, upholding its controversial use of a "pocket rescission," a rarely invoked power that enables the president to effectively cancel appropriated funds without direct legislative approval.</p>

          <p>A major development in the infamous 1991 Austin, Texas, yogurt shop murders has led to the identification of deceased serial killer and sexual assaulter Robert Eugene Brashers as a suspect. Retired Austin detective John Jones, who worked the original case, revealed that DNA evidence established a connection, and a bullet casing found in the shop's drain matches a gun Brashers used before his 1999 suicide during a police standoff. This breakthrough offers a potential answer to the brutal killings of four teenage girls, who were found gagged, tied, shot, and the shop set on fire. The long-haunted case, which previously saw overturned convictions, may finally be nearing a definitive resolution.</p>

Notable performances from players like Jon Rahm and Tommy Fleetwood were crucial in securing their advantage, with Fleetwood's putting particularly impressive. This strong European start puts them in a favorable position for the remainder of the tournament, while the US team faces pressure and criticism for their initial strategic decisions and overall performance, as the home crowd's mood was visibly deflated.</p>

Critics, including former federal prosecutors, argue that Trump's repeated calls for Comey's prosecution and the swift appointment of a White House aide as the top prosecutor could lead to successful claims of selective or vindictive prosecution.

          <p>Supporters of California's Proposition 50, a November ballot measure aiming to redraw congressional districts, have significantly out-raised their opponents, collecting a substantial $77.5 million. Led by Governor Gavin Newsom, this ambitious effort is designed to help Democrats gain crucial control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the upcoming election cycle. Opponents, who have raised $35.3 million, vehemently criticize the measure as a blatant political power grab, arguing it fundamentally undermines the voter-approved independent redistricting commission. This special election, projected to cost the state and counties $282 million, is seen as pivotal for influencing national political power, particularly impacting President Trump's agenda.</p>

          <p>The upcoming APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting in Gyeongju, South Korea, is poised to offer a significant diplomatic stage for the US, China, and the two Koreas to pursue crucial peace initiatives. With both Presidents Trump and Xi expected to attend, the summit could potentially pave the way for a US-North Korea summit or even a trilateral meeting involving South Korea, especially following North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's recent visit to China. The article suggests China's mediation will be essential, while South Korea must actively assume the role of "pacemaker" in guiding the process. This non-binding forum is seen as an ideal venue for building consensus and encouraging dialogue amid persistent regional tensions.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that 20 U.S. soldiers involved in the 1890 Wounded Knee massacre will retain their Medals of Honor, reversing a previous review order. Hegseth, citing a panel's conclusion, called the men "brave soldiers" and dismissed calls for revocation as "politically correct," asserting their place in history is no longer debatable. This decision effectively halts efforts by Democratic lawmakers and Native American groups who view the event as a brutal massacre of unarmed Lakota people, not a battle, and have long pushed for the medals to be rescinded. The move is part of the Trump administration's broader reinterpretation and "sanitization" of U.S. history.</p>

The files include itineraries and flight logs, showing Musk was invited to Epstein's private island in 2014, an invitation he previously stated he declined. Prince Andrew is explicitly listed on a May 2000 flight manifest with Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of conspiring to traffic girls for sex. The release, which also mentions Peter Thiel, Steve Bannon, and Bill Gates, is part of an ongoing probe into the handling of Epstein's case, with Democrats urging for more transparency and full disclosure.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s health policy approach, termed MAHA ("Make America Healthy Again"), is analyzed as a conservative ideology deeply rooted in nostalgia for a purportedly healthier past. The article suggests his views, including strong vaccine skepticism and advocating for the "purity" of natural resources, align with a desire to conserve and unwind modern medical and food policies. This perspective has gained significant traction due to declining public trust in institutions like HHS and the CDC following the COVID-19 pandemic. Critics warn that such widespread skepticism, exemplified by advocating for practices like raw milk consumption, poses serious public health risks by rejecting established medical wisdom and scientific consensus.</p>

The program was temporarily pulled following controversial comments Kimmel made about the alleged murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and President Trump's MAGA movement, which prompted concerns from station owners. Both companies emphasized their unwavering commitment to responsible broadcasting and free speech, explicitly denying any government interaction or influence in their initial decision to preempt the program. This resolution follows constructive discussions with Disney executives and aims to balance programming accuracy with the diverse interests of their local communities, despite ongoing debates about media influence and censorship.</p>

His attorney states Shouhed suffered significant injuries, including broken ribs and a traumatic brain injury, accusing agents of violating the Constitution, California civil rights law, and basic human decency. The incident, reportedly captured on video, occurred amidst the Trump administration's aggressive mass deportation campaign in Southern California. Shouhed was ultimately released without charges, and his lawsuit highlights profound concerns about federal agents' conduct and racial profiling during immigration operations.</p>

Memphis Mayor Paul Young acknowledged community questions and strong feelings, but emphasized the goal of using these resources effectively to benefit residents. This deployment, characterized by Trump as a "replica" of actions in other Democratic-led cities, aims to combat violent crime, though it has drawn accusations of unfairly targeting such areas.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice informed the Supreme Court that financial markets would not suffer a "disaster" if President Trump were permitted to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that Trump suffers "irreparable harm" from lower-court rulings preventing Cook's removal, which he seeks based on allegations of mortgage fraud predating her Fed appointment. Cook's attorneys, however, contend Trump's "manufactured charges" do not meet the "for cause" removal requirement stipulated by the Federal Reserve Act. They warned that allowing her dismissal could fundamentally undermine the Federal Reserve's traditional independence, risking significant market chaos and disruption. (not investment advice)</p>
