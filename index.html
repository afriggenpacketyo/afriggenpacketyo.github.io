          <p>Following a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at Pope Francis' funeral, former U.S. President Donald Trump has expressed doubts about Vladimir Putin's sincerity in seeking peace in Ukraine. Trump noted recent Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilian areas, suggesting Putin may not be genuinely interested in ending the war, which could be dealt with through 'Banking' or 'Secondary Sanctions'. The meeting between Trump and Zelensky was described as 'very productive' by the White House and 'potentially historic' by Zelensky, marking their first face-to-face encounter since February.</p>

          <p>Virginia Giuffre, a prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein, has died by suicide at her farm in Western Australia at the age of 41, according to a statement from her family. Giuffre alleged that Epstein sexually trafficked her to Prince Andrew and others, which Andrew has denied, and they reached an out-of-court settlement in 2022. Her family said she was a lifelong victim of sexual abuse and sex trafficking, and formed a nonprofit called Speak Out, Act, Reclaim (SOAR) to advocate for other victims. Giuffre's attorney, Sigrid McCawley, described her as a dear friend and champion for other victims.</p>

          <p>Recent polls indicate a decline in Americans' confidence in Donald Trump across various issues, with a majority describing his second term as "scary." The polls reveal low ratings on the economy and immigration policy, with only 24% believing Trump is focusing on the right priorities. Even among Republicans, support is not overwhelming, and independent voters show significant disapproval. The negative reviews come as Trump approaches 100 days in office, suggesting growing fatigue among voters.</p>

This marks a potential shift in Trump's perspective, as he has previously been criticized for being too lenient towards Russia. The meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy, held against the backdrop of the Vatican, could signal a new hope for intervention in the conflict, although Trump's views remain unpredictable.</p>

          <p>A letter written on board the Titanic by first-class passenger Archibald Gracie IV, a famous survivor of the disaster, has been auctioned for £300,000 ($399,390). The letter, penned on April 10, 1912, the day the Titanic set sail, expresses Gracie's anticipation of the journey. Gracie, who survived the sinking by clinging to an overturned lifeboat, later wrote a detailed account of the disaster. He died shortly after due to complications from hypothermia.</p>

          <p>Craig Moffett, a top analyst, has expressed skepticism about Apple's plans to shift iPhone assembly to India, citing concerns about the continued reliance on Chinese-made components and potential backlash in China. Moffett suggests that moving assembly to India may not effectively reduce costs related to tariffs and that Apple's supply chain would remain anchored in China. He also anticipates that consumer demand may slow due to the macro economy and potential price increases from tariffs. Moffett has a 'sell' rating on Apple and recently cut his price target for the stock.</p>
