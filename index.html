          <p>At least 13 people have died after catastrophic flash floods struck the Texas Hill Country. The Guadalupe River rose by an astonishing 26 feet in just 45 minutes, causing what officials describe as a destructive and life-threatening situation. Search and rescue operations are extensive, involving hundreds of personnel, drones, and helicopters, with the death toll expected to rise. A significant concern is Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer camp, where approximately 20 children remain unaccounted for after the area was inundated, losing all power and access.</p>

          <p>Authorities have discovered human remains at the site of a major explosion and fire at a fireworks warehouse in Esparto, California. The incident at Devastating Pyrotechnics on Tuesday resulted in a massive blaze and subsequent grass fires, with seven people being reported as unaccounted for. Investigations revealed the facility was operating without local permits for fireworks storage on agricultural land. A Yolo County Sheriff's Lieutenant who owns the property is not involved in the investigation, which is now being led by Cal Fire and the ATF.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed a controversial and massive spending bill into law during the White House's Fourth of July celebrations. The legislation makes significant cuts to social benefits like Medicaid, increases funding for immigration enforcement, and enacts what the president called the largest tax cut in U.S. history. The signing followed a contentious legislative battle, with Democrats strongly opposing the cuts to services for low-income Americans and the new work requirements for Medicaid. The president framed the bill as a historic achievement that would eliminate government waste, fraud, and abuse.</p>

          <p>Italian luxury brand Prada is facing accusations of cultural appropriation from artisans in Kolhapur, India, after releasing a line of sandals strikingly similar to the traditional Kolhapuri design. The local artisans, who handcraft the leather sandals for a fraction of Prada's expected retail price, are demanding recognition and compensation. The controversy has highlighted the vulnerability of traditional crafts, which are protected by a Geographical Indication (GI) tag within India but lack binding international protection. Industry groups are now in talks with Prada, seeking a collaboration that could benefit the struggling artisan community.</p>

          <p>The article explores whether crying at work is a sign of weakness or an acceptable display of human emotion in modern professional environments. While some still view it as a potential career liability, many experts and employees now see it as a sign of emotional intelligence and strength. The piece discusses how perceptions can differ based on gender and seniority, with leaders showing emotion sometimes being seen as more authentic. Ultimately, the consensus is that while a single instance of crying is unlikely to ruin a career, fostering a compassionate workplace culture is beneficial for employee motivation and well-being.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New scientific research reveals that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are crucial in combating global warming through their annual migration in the Southern Ocean. These animals gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface, grow fat, and then sink deep into the ocean to hibernate, locking away vast amounts of carbon. The study quantifies this process, finding it stores as much carbon as the annual emissions of 55 million cars, a far greater amount than previously understood. This discovery highlights the overlooked importance of these creatures in regulating the planet's climate.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over 20 years of experience treating heart disease outlines five types of food he avoids giving his children to promote lifelong health. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which contain harmful preservatives. He also advises against sugary cereals and deep-fried foods, which contribute to inflammation and poor metabolic health. The doctor recommends healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and lean, unprocessed proteins.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ, arguing it created the novel concept of a 'citizen'. He emphasized that the nation was born from deep division and that understanding this complex, violent history is essential for navigating today's political climate. Burns advocates for telling fuller, more complicated stories that include diverse voices and acknowledge the founders' flaws, stating this makes history more accessible and powerful, rather than diminishing it. He believes this approach helps reunite Americans with their shared, albeit messy, origins.</p>

          <p>England's Jamie Smith scored a remarkable 184 not out against India, setting a new record for the highest Test score by an England men's wicketkeeper. The 24-year-old's aggressive and powerful innings at Edgbaston has solidified his place in the team and drawn comparisons to Australian legend Adam Gilchrist. Since his debut a year ago, Smith has quickly adapted to international cricket, demonstrating the attacking style favored by England's leadership. His performance suggests he has the potential to become one of England's greatest-ever wicketkeeper-batters if his current trajectory continues.</p>
