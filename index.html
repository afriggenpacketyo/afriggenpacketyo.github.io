          <p>British Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has described language used by Elon Musk at a London rally as "abhorrent." Speaking via video link at the event, the tech billionaire criticized "uncontrolled migration" and stated that violence was coming to citizens whether they chose it or not, urging them to fight back. His comments, which also called for a new government in Britain, drew sharp rebukes from multiple political leaders who accused him of using dangerous and irresponsible language that threatens British democracy.</p>

          <p>In a strategic display of space-based surveillance capabilities, a Chinese satellite has photographed an American satellite that was itself observing China's space station. The images, captured by China's Jilin-1 constellation, were released publicly and follow a similar move by U.S. company Maxar Intelligence, which had previously published high-resolution images of a Chinese satellite. Analysts describe the incident as a tit-for-tat exchange that highlights the growing strategic competition and reconnaissance efforts between the two nations in the space domain.</p>

          <p>Manchester United legend Paul Scholes has sharply criticized the club's summer transfer strategy and manager Ruben Amorim's adherence to a 3-4-3 formation. Scholes argues that despite spending £200 million on forwards, the team lacks quality in the midfield and has failed to address key weaknesses, contributing to their worst start to a league season since 1992-93. While senior club officials reportedly maintain their support for Amorim, Scholes believes a change in tactics is essential to reverse the team's poor results and mounting pressure.</p>

          <p>While guest-hosting "The Charlie Kirk Show," Vice President JD Vance called for people who publicly celebrate the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk to be held accountable, suggesting they be reported to their employers. His comments come as several professionals, including pilots and a Secret Service employee, have been suspended or fired for inappropriate social media posts about Kirk's death. Vance argued against political violence and what he described as a lack of civility, a sentiment echoed by other Republican lawmakers calling for similar consequences.</p>

          <p>Grammy-winning artist Lil Nas X is reportedly in an out-of-state treatment program following his arrest last month in Studio City. A judge modified the terms of his release to allow for the treatment, the details of which remain private. The musician was arrested on suspicion of charging at a police officer while naked and was hospitalized for a possible overdose. He has pleaded not guilty to four felony counts, including battery on a police officer, and faces up to five years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. military conducted a second strike on a boat in international waters, killing three people he identified as "narcoterrorists" from Venezuela. The attack follows a previous deadly strike and is part of an increased U.S. military presence in the Caribbean aimed at countering narcotics trafficking. The action has intensified tensions with Venezuela, whose President Nicolás Maduro condemned the U.S. operations as "aggression" and asserted his country's right to self-defense.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. companies should report their earnings every six months instead of the current quarterly basis, a change he argues would promote long-term business strategy over short-term profits. The proposal, which would require approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), revives a long-standing debate in financial circles. While some business leaders agree that quarterly guidance can create unhealthy pressure, critics argue that less frequent reporting would reduce transparency for investors.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut its benchmark interest rate, this article explains the indirect relationship between the Fed's actions and mortgage rates. The central bank controls the short-term federal funds rate, whereas mortgage rates are more closely influenced by long-term 10-year Treasury note yields. Experts note that financial markets have largely priced in the anticipated cut, so homeowners may not see an immediate, significant drop in borrowing costs, making future guidance from the Fed Chair potentially more impactful.
