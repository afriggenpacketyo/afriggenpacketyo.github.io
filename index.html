            <p>This article examines Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's systematic dismantling of democratic institutions, media, and universities, drawing parallels to strategies employed by Vladimir Putin. Orban's government has consolidated power by taking control of the media landscape, purging unfriendly voices from public media, and restructuring universities under loyalist control. The article highlights the chilling effect on press freedom, where independent newspapers are forced to print outside the country due to fear of government reprisal. The analysis also touches on the concerns about freedom of assembly and the use of LGBTQ+ issues as a tool to suppress dissent, as well as the ways in which Trump is taking similar actions in the US at a faster pace.

          <div class="flip-card-back">
            <p>Experts are warning that tongue-scraping, a dental habit that has gained popularity, could pose heart health risks due to potential cuts on the tongue that may introduce bacteria into the bloodstream. This can increase the risk of endocarditis, an infection of the heart valves, which can lead to severe heart damage if untreated. Additionally, over-scraping can lower nitric oxide levels, potentially increasing the risk of high blood pressure. Experts emphasize that maintaining good oral hygiene through regular dental visits, brushing, and flossing is more important, as the benefits of tongue scraping are minimal. Optimism score: 60</p>

            <p>This article explores the Texas tradition of cascarones, confetti-filled eggs, and their significance in connecting generations. The tradition is especially prevalent in Texas and Northern Mexico, where children playfully break the eggs over each other's heads during Easter celebrations. The article recounts how one woman continued the tradition after her mother's death, finding solace and connection through making cascarones for her family. The egg is also a symbol of fertility and rebirth in pre-Christian Europe that was later adapted to the Easter holiday, with the tradition having been a part of Texan Easter celebrations since the state was part of Mexico.

            <p>China is taking a more direct approach in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda conflict, urging Rwanda to cease supporting the M23 rebel group and withdraw its troops from the DRC. This marks a departure from China's usual non-interference policy in African conflicts. China's actions are driven by its need to protect its mining interests and maintain relationships with both countries. The article notes that China also voted in favor of a UN Security Council resolution condemning Rwanda's role in the conflict, further illustrating its shift in approach. Optimism score: 50</p>

            <p>DHL Express is temporarily suspending deliveries to American consumers for shipments worth over $800 due to increased customs red tape following the implementation of Donald Trump's new tariff regime. The changes have caused a surge in formal customs clearances, leading to multi-day delays for shipments over $800. The White House is also set to close a loophole on May 2, impacting low-value packages from China and Hong Kong by removing the 'de minimis' rule. This will likely lead to increased prices for consumers, particularly from fast-fashion firms like Shein and Temu, who have already warned of price increases. Optimism score: 40</p>

            <p>This article critiques the Trump administration's demands for Harvard University to overhaul its governance and faculty hiring practices to ensure viewpoint diversity. The author argues that while fostering a culture of intellectual engagement is vital, Trump's approach is a political cudgel that undermines academic freedom. The author highlights the contradictions in demanding viewpoint diversity while simultaneously insisting on abolishing ideological litmus tests in admissions and hiring. The article suggests that true diversity of thought requires rethinking social and political engagement and encouraging the capacity to move between different points of view. Optimism score: 45</p>
