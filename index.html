          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte are suing American commentator Candace Owens for defamation in a US court. The lawsuit follows Owens's online series which spread false claims that Brigitte Macron was born male and that the president was part of a CIA mind-control program. The Macrons describe the claims as a harassment campaign designed for Owens's self-promotion, while Owens's spokesperson frames the lawsuit as an attack on American First Amendment rights. This legal action follows previous, similar cases pursued by Brigitte Macron in French courts over the same conspiracy theories.</p>

          <p>The wreckage of an Angara Airlines An-24 passenger plane has been discovered in Russia's far-eastern Amur region after it disappeared from radar. The aircraft, carrying 48 people including five children, crashed approximately 16 kilometers from its destination, Tynda airport. Emergency services reported seeing the fuselage burning in a dense woodland area, and initial reports suggest there are no survivors. Authorities are investigating potential causes, including pilot error in poor weather or a technical malfunction, noting the nearly 50-year-old plane had a history of incidents.</p>

          <p>The European Union and the United States are in tense negotiations over a potential trade agreement, with an August 1 deadline looming. While a base-case scenario suggests a 15% tariff rate on EU imports, down from a threatened 30-50%, nothing is finalized, and the decision rests with President Trump. In the absence of a guaranteed deal, the EU is preparing countermeasures, including retaliatory tariffs on US goods and a potential "Anti-Coercion Instrument" that could restrict US market access. The uncertainty highlights the fragile nature of current transatlantic trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), car output fell by 7.3% and van production plummeted by 45%, partly due to the closure of Vauxhall's Luton plant. Uncertainty over US tariffs contributed to the slowdown, though a recent deal may help restore confidence.

          <p>Irish centre Garry Ringrose has been forced to withdraw from the British and Irish Lions' second Test match against Australia due to concussion symptoms. After being selected for the crucial game in Melbourne, Ringrose reported feeling unwell during training, a selfless act praised by the head coach and captain for prioritizing team safety. This is his second head-injury-related setback on the tour, ending his Test series hopes. Huw Jones will now start alongside Bundee Aki in a new-look centre partnership as the Lions aim to secure a series victory.</p>

          <p>Renewed border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia over disputed territory have turned deadly, with a Cambodian rocket and artillery strike killing at least nine Thai civilians. The fighting erupted near ancient temples along the border, with both governments blaming each other for initiating the violence. Thailand deployed F-16 fighter jets in response, and Cambodia has requested an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council to address what it calls "unprovoked military aggression." The conflict marks a serious escalation in a long-standing territorial dispute between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Court documents from a New Orleans lawsuit reveal that the late Jesuit global leader Pedro Arrupe, a candidate for sainthood, was warned about a priest-in-training's history of sexual misconduct with minors. Despite the warnings in the late 1970s, the man, Donald J. Dickerson, was ultimately ordained and later accused of molesting more children. The revelations raise serious questions about Arrupe's role in enabling an abuser and have led to calls for his sainthood process to be halted.
