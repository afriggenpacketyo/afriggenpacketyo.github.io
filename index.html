          <p>Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old founder of the conservative group Turning Point USA, was fatally shot while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University. Utah's governor has described the incident as a "political assassination," and it has prompted widespread condemnation from figures across the political spectrum, including President Trump and former President Biden. Kirk was reportedly struck by a single shot fired from a distance, and authorities have since taken a person of interest into custody. The shooting has intensified national conversations about the rise of political violence and the safety of public figures in an increasingly polarized environment.</p>

          <p>Poland's military, with assistance from NATO allies, scrambled fighter jets to shoot down multiple Russian drones that violated its airspace during a large-scale attack on Ukraine. The Polish government has condemned the incursion as an "act of aggression" and formally invoked Article 4 of the NATO treaty, which calls for urgent consultations when a member's security is threatened. This marks the first instance of a NATO country engaging and destroying hostile Russian aircraft during the war. The incident has escalated tensions, with European leaders suggesting the violation was intentional and calling for a strengthened response to Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>China's domestically produced C919 passenger jet is poised for a significant international breakthrough, as the CEO of AirAsia's parent company confirmed active discussions to purchase the aircraft. This would make it the first major foreign airline to place an order for the C919, which is manufactured by the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac). The single-aisle jet is designed to compete directly with the popular Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 models. The growing interest in the C919 reflects expanding economic ties and flight connections between China and Southeast Asian nations.</p>

          <p>A shooting at Evergreen High School in Colorado has left two students wounded, with the juvenile male suspect also hospitalized with injuries. The incident occurred shortly before 12:30 p.m., prompting a swift response from law enforcement who were on the scene within minutes. Officials stated that shots were fired both inside and outside the school building from a handgun. St. Anthony's Hospital confirmed it is treating three minors for gunshot wounds, two of whom are in critical condition. The event has once again raised concerns about school safety, particularly how to prepare for attacks that occur outside of traditional classroom settings like the cafeteria.</p>

          <p>Six months into an all-out bin strike in Birmingham, residents continue to face significant disruption, with many storing uncollected recycling inside their homes and dealing with overflowing communal bins. While the council has managed to maintain largely regular collections of general waste, the ongoing dispute with the Unite union means recycling and some commercial waste services remain suspended. Residents express feelings of frustration and neglect, citing issues with pests and the negative impact on the city's reputation.

          <p>Qatari authorities are continuing search operations and identifying human remains following an Israeli airstrike in Doha that targeted senior Hamas leaders. The attack killed five lower-level Hamas members and a Qatari security officer, but Hamas claims its top negotiators, including Khalil al-Hayya, were unharmed. Qatar's prime minister condemned the strike as "state terror" and suggested it may have destroyed any remaining hope for a ceasefire and hostage release deal. The incident has created a diplomatic crisis for Israel, which acted inside the territory of Qatar, a key U.S. ally and mediator in the conflict.</p>

          <p>One day after joining a Supreme Court majority decision allowing federal agents to conduct immigration raids in Southern California based on racial profiling, Justice Amy Coney Barrett appeared at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library to promote her new memoir. While her speech largely avoided controversial topics, she alluded to the 4th Amendment, which was central to the previous day's ruling, describing its protections against "unreasonable search and seizures" as having "play in the joints." The event drew a supportive crowd, with many attendees praising her role in overturning Roe v.

          <p>A long-standing perk for California's electric vehicle drivers is ending, as a federal program allowing solo occupants of clean-air vehicles to use carpool lanes will expire on October 1. The program, which required congressional approval for an extension, was not renewed, affecting roughly half a million drivers with active decals. Governor Newsom criticized the expiration, blaming Republicans in Congress and framing it as a setback for environmental incentives. After the deadline, EV drivers must meet standard multi-occupant requirements to use the lanes, and reduced toll rates for decal holders will also be discontinued, marking a significant policy shift for the state's transportation landscape.</p>

          <p>State lawmakers in California have introduced legislation to significantly reform Measure ULA, the controversial Los Angeles property sales tax often called the "mansion tax." The proposal, negotiated with Mayor Karen Bass, aims to address criticisms that the tax has stifled the construction of new apartment buildings and other commercial properties. The bill would lower the tax rate from 4-5.5% to 1.5% for newly constructed commercial and multi-family residential buildings sold within 15 years of being built. This move is part of a broader political strategy to counter a statewide ballot initiative that seeks to nullify Measure ULA entirely.</p>

          <p>The once-dominant genre of television cooking shows is experiencing a steep decline, with commissions for new food programs on British TV dropping by 44% in a single year. This shift is largely attributed to the explosion of food content on platforms like YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram, where creators can respond to trends almost instantly. Unlike traditional television, which involves lengthy production processes and regulatory compliance, online influencers offer a sense of authenticity and direct community engagement that resonates with modern audiences. This trend reflects a broader cultural shift where viewers, particularly younger demographics, increasingly prefer the "rough and ready" style of online content over polished television productions.</p>

They hypothesize that the key may lie in the spiders' 'dark DNA'—the vast, non-gene portions of the genetic code whose functions are largely unknown. These spiders possess three times more dark DNA than humans, and scientists believe it may enable them to adapt and evolve into new species with unique colors and mating dances very rapidly. By decoding the genetics of these extreme examples of variation, the project aims to uncover fundamental principles of evolution that apply across the natural world.</p>

          <p>As part of his upcoming three-day state visit to the United Kingdom, U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the tomb of the late Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle and lay a wreath. The visit will also include meetings with King Charles, Queen Camilla, and the Prince and Princess of Wales, as well as a formal state banquet at the castle. Additionally, President Trump will hold talks with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer at the country residence of Chequers. The visit has prompted plans for protests by the Stop Trump coalition, which has called for the visit to be canceled.</p>

          <p>The internal watchdog for the U.S. Department of Labor is launching a review of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and its methods for compiling key economic data. The probe will examine how the agency collects and reports its closely watched monthly data on jobs and inflation. This review follows recent large downward revisions to previous job growth estimates and the firing of the former BLS commissioner by President Trump, who accused the agency of political bias. The move has raised concerns among economists about maintaining the integrity and trustworthiness of official government statistics, which are crucial for financial markets.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined an emergency request from South Carolina officials, allowing a transgender male student to continue using the boys' restroom at his high school for the time being. The decision lets a lower court's injunction remain in place while the student's lawsuit against a state policy restricting bathroom access proceeds. The state rule ties school funding to compliance with the ban. The Supreme Court's unsigned order is not a final ruling on the merits of the case, but it allows the student to avoid being singled out as his legal challenge continues through the appeals process.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Forest Service is reversing its decades-long ban on firefighters wearing protective masks and will now issue N95 respirators to crews battling wildfires. For years, the agency argued that masks posed a risk of heat exhaustion, a stance contrary to practices in other fire-prone nations and recommendations from health agencies. The policy change follows reports detailing the health risks faced by firefighters from smoke inhalation, including increased rates of cancer and organ damage. This move is seen as an implicit acknowledgment of these dangers and comes as lawmakers are pushing for greater safety legislation for wildland firefighters.</p>

          <p>Gary Lineker has won the award for Best TV Presenter at the National Television Awards, ending the unprecedented 23-year winning streak of duo Ant and Dec in the viewer-voted category. Lineker, who recently departed the BBC's "Match of the Day" after 26 years, accepted the prize by stating it "demonstrates that it is OK to use your platform to speak up on behalf of those who have no voice." His departure from the BBC followed controversies surrounding his social media use. Other major winners of the night included the finale of "Gavin and Stacey" for Best Comedy.</p>

          <p>China's recent Victory Day parade commemorating the end of World War II is analyzed in this article as a key moment in its effort to shape a new global narrative. President Xi Jinping used the event to position China on the right side of history, contrasting its vision with what it portrays as a retreating post-war order once led by the U.S. The parade also highlighted unresolved historical tensions, particularly with Japan, whose perceived lack of remorse for its wartime actions continues to fuel regional friction. Both China and Russia are actively challenging the Western-centric view of the victory over fascism, asserting their own instrumental roles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AT&T CEO John Stankey has suggested that the era of massive sales "super cycles" for new iPhones may be over, unless Apple can deliver significant advancements in artificial intelligence. He argued that smartphones are now primarily software-driven devices, and without a major leap in AI capabilities, new hardware releases risk being seen as merely incremental upgrades. Stankey's comments reflect a growing investor concern that Apple is lagging behind competitors like Google and Microsoft in the AI race. He predicted that while the next iPhone will sell, it is unlikely to generate the record-breaking lines and excitement of past launches without compelling new software features.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent Russian drone incursion into Poland is presented in this article as a pivotal moment that forces a direct confrontation with the question of American commitment to NATO. The author contends that Russian President Vladimir Putin deliberately escalated his "shadow war" to test the alliance, particularly under a Trump administration that has been openly skeptical of its security guarantees. The article argues that for years, the U.S. has practiced self-deterrence to avoid direct conflict, but Putin has now forced the issue. How the U.S. responds to an overt attack on a NATO ally will determine the future credibility and existence of the alliance.</p>

          <p>NASA has enacted new internal security measures that restrict access for Chinese nationals to its facilities, materials, and networks. While the agency has long had limitations on employing Chinese citizens directly, the new policy appears to affect a broader group, including contractors, graduate students, and university scientists working on NASA projects who hold U.S. visas. The move comes amid a heightened sense of competition between the U.S. and China in space exploration, with both nations planning crewed missions to the moon in the coming years. The acting NASA administrator recently stated that beating China in this new space race is "critically important."</p>

This statement echoes a previous incident where he told police he believed he was being controlled by "man-made material."

Ellison's net worth jumped to $393 billion on Wednesday morning, eclipsing Musk's $385 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The stock rally was driven by Oracle's optimistic forecast for its cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence businesses, which have seen a surge in demand. However, by the end of the trading day, Oracle's shares had retreated slightly, allowing Musk to reclaim the top spot he had held for nearly a year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article analyzes President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to police Washington, D.C., arguing it represents a concerning convergence of military and police power. The author, joined by law professor Rosa Brooks, discusses how these deployments serve as a show of force, projecting the power of the federal government and "red" hinterlands over "blue" cities. The discussion raises constitutional concerns about militarized policing, the use of unidentified federal agents, and the potential for such actions to normalize authoritarian tactics. It also explores the strain these domestic missions place on the National Guard, a force primarily intended for disaster relief and military support.</p>
