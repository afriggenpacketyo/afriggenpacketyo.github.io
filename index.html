          <h2>IMF Predicts German Fiscal Boost Insufficient to Offset Tariff Impact on Eurozone</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-28 02:26:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the IMF's European department director Alfred Kammer, increased infrastructure spending in Germany will not be enough to counteract the drag from U.S. tariffs on the Eurozone's economic growth. The IMF has downgraded its Eurozone growth forecasts for 2025 and 2026 by 0.2 percentage points each, citing trade tensions as a primary concern. Kammer noted that the negative impact of tariffs outweighs the positive effects of Germany's fiscal measures, which include increased defense spending and a substantial infrastructure and climate fund aimed at revitalizing the German economy.

          <p>The 64th German finger wrestling championship, known as Fingerhakeln, took place in Pang, Bavaria, attracting around 180 competitors. Fingerhakeln, a traditional sport popular in the German Alpine region and Austria, involves contestants attempting to pull each other across a table using only their middle fingers hooked through a leather loop. Despite the risk of minor injuries, the sport is highly organized with strict rules and techniques, and is considered a test of strength and skill. The Bavarian championships will offer another opportunity for finger wrestlers to compete later in the summer.</p>

          <p>A study corroborates historical accounts of the Han dynasty's conquest of the Nanyue kingdom in southern China in 112BC, linking the military campaign to the decline of the Chinese swamp cypress. Researchers analyzed geological evidence, pollen analysis, and historical records to understand how the Han's riverine warfare tactics impacted the Pearl River Delta's ecosystem. Sediment samples from ancient battlegrounds revealed a significant decrease in swamp cypress pollen around 100BC, coinciding with the Han's assault on Panyu, the capital of Nanyue, which was set ablaze.</p>

          <p>Australian opposition leader Peter Dutton has sparked controversy by criticizing the frequency of Indigenous "welcome to country" ceremonies, arguing they are "overdone" and cheapen the tradition's significance. His comments follow an incident where an Aboriginal elder was heckled during an Anzac Day ceremony. While Prime Minister Anthony Albanese defends the ceremonies as a matter of respect, Dutton, who played a key role in the defeat of the Voice to Parliament referendum, suggests they should be reserved for significant events. He has also stated he would remove the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags from official press conferences if elected.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's tariffs, intended to protect the U.S. auto industry, risk isolating it from innovation and hindering its ability to compete globally. While China is making significant advancements in next-generation vehicles through state subsidies, U.S. automakers are falling behind in electrification, digitization, and automation. The author warns that losing the auto industry's supply chains and industrial capabilities could jeopardize the U.S.'s capacity to manufacture vital technologies and military equipment. The piece draws a parallel to the 1980s when temporary import limits allowed American automakers to catch up with Japanese competitors.</p>

          <p>A Jewish student at the University of Florida, Tess Segal, faced arrest and suspension for participating in a campus protest advocating for divestment from weapons manufacturers and a boycott of Israeli academic institutions. Despite charges being dismissed, the university initially banned her from campus and proposed a one-year suspension. The dean of students later increased the suspension to three years, citing major disruption to university functions. This case highlights the complex issues surrounding campus protests and the consequences faced by student activists.</p>

          <p>Planned changes to school uniform policy in England will affect over four million pupils, with the government aiming to reduce the number of compulsory branded items to three, plus a tie for secondary students. The government hopes this will save families money, but school wear manufacturers warn the plans could increase costs. Uniform retailers argue that parents might spend more on replacing lower-quality generic garments and that branded uniforms play a role in reducing inequality in schools. The government hopes to introduce the changes in September 2026.</p>

The election is viewed as a referendum on how Canada should approach Trump, with Carney positioning himself as best equipped to counter Trump's policies.
