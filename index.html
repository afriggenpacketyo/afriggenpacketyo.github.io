          <h2>Trump Discusses Potential Third Term, Raising Constitutional Questions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's comments about potentially serving a third term, despite constitutional limitations, have sparked debate.  While he claims it's not a joke, his statements highlight the 22nd Amendment's prohibition on more than two terms.  This raises concerns about his respect for democratic norms and the potential for a constitutional crisis if he actively pursues such an endeavor. The lack of concrete plans further fuels speculation about the political motivations behind his remarks.</p>
