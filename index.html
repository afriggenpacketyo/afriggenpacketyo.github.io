          <p>Mark Zuckerberg, frustrated with Meta's position in the AI race, is reportedly investing $14 billion in Scale AI and attempting to recruit CEO Alexandr Wang to lead a new AI research lab. Meta aims to leverage Wang's expertise in AI's technical aspects and business development, hoping to improve the execution of Meta's AI ambitions after the lukewarm reception of the Llama AI models. This strategic move mirrors other tech giants' approaches of acquiring AI talent through substantial investments rather than outright acquisitions, possibly to avoid antitrust concerns given Meta's ongoing trial with the FTC. The partnership aims to strengthen Meta's AI capabilities by incorporating Scale AI's data-labelling and training intelligence. </p>

          <p>Elon Musk stated on the X social media platform that he regrets some of his recent social media posts about President Donald Trump, acknowledging that they "went too far." The feud between Musk and Trump had previously dissolved a close partnership that saw Musk leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Trump's administration, causing market concerns for Tesla and SpaceX. The conflict began due to Musk's opposition to Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" tax and spending bill, with Musk arguing it undermines DOGE's work and increases the U.S. budget deficit. </p>

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts along the border with North Korea as part of President Lee Jae Myung's efforts to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The broadcasts, which had resumed in June of the previous year under former President Yoon Suk Yeol in response to North Korea's actions, have been halted to restore trust in inter-Korean relations and achieve peace. This decision follows recent appeals from South Korea's Unification Ministry for activists to cease distributing anti-North Korea leaflets, citing heightened tensions and risks to residents in border areas. This action is intended to reduce military confrontation and open the door for rebuilding mutual trust. </p>

          <p>Mortgage application volume increased by 12.5% last week, reaching the highest level in over a month, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The rise is attributed to a post-Memorial Day rebound, with both refinance and purchase applications increasing significantly. Despite the increase, overall volume remains low historically, with the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages at 6.93%. Increased housing supply and slightly easing home prices may be contributing to the increased demand, as homebuyers take advantage of more available listings in certain markets. </p>

It features an interview with Charlie Harding, cohost of Switched on Pop, who argues that music does not necessarily reflect larger economic trends. Harding explains that recession pop is a made-up genre and that music of all kinds, both upbeat and downbeat, existed during the Great Recession. The article suggests that the current interest in recession pop may be more related to millennials aging out of being cool than to actual economic indicators. </p>

          <p>France is preparing to ban smoking in most outdoor public spaces, prompting reflection on the role of cigarettes in French national identity. The article explores how smoking has historically been intertwined with French culture, representing a form of punctuation in daily life and a symbol of existential freedom. While acknowledging the health risks of smoking, the author laments the potential loss of a cultural tradition that encouraged moments of idleness and acute presence. The new law, carrying a 135-euro fine, has garnered support from a majority of French people, signaling a shift in attitudes towards smoking in public places. </p>
