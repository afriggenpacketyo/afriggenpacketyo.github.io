            <p>Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen is in El Salvador seeking answers about the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Van Hollen stated that the El Salvador government couldn't provide evidence of Abrego Garcia's involvement with MS-13, countering President Trump's narrative about gang violence. The senator emphasized his commitment to fighting MS-13 and upholding the court system to ensure fair punishment for criminals. He aims to bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States, challenging the Trump administration's actions.</p>

            <p>California will sue the Trump administration, challenging the president's authority to impose sweeping tariffs.

The lawsuit follows Newsom's request for countries to exempt California exports from retaliatory tariffs.

            <p>A CDC study reveals that 1 in 31 children, or more than 3%, have been identified with autism, prompting Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to call it a growing "epidemic." Kennedy plans to investigate environmental toxins as potential causes, while experts emphasize improved screening and a broader definition of autism. The CDC report also notes higher prevalence among Asian, Black, and Hispanic children, with potential contributing factors like disparities in preterm birth and lead poisoning. The findings highlight the ongoing efforts to understand and address autism.</p>

            <p>After British actress Aimee Lou Wood criticized an SNL sketch for using exaggerated prosthetic teeth in an impersonation of her, comedians have discussed the fine line between humor and offense. The sketch, titled 'The White Potus', parodied Wood's White Lotus character, leading her to call it "mean and unfunny." Impressionists debate whether the sketch crossed the line by making fun of Wood's appearance, with some arguing that the joke "punched down." Others believe that those in the public eye should expect to have the "mickey taken out of you occasionally."</p>

            <p>The discovery of life on another world is inching closer, with signs of a gas produced by simple marine organisms found on a planet called K2-18b. Scientists are developing instruments to analyze the chemical composition of exoplanet atmospheres. Prof Madhusudhan hopes to have enough data within two years to demonstrate categorically that he really has discovered the biosignatures around K2-18b. Such a discovery would allow us a better understanding about how we might have evolved and would be comforting to know that we're a fabric of something larger.</p>

            <p>Scientists have detected potential signs of life on the distant planet K2-18b using the James Webb Space Telescope. A Cambridge team studying the planet's atmosphere found molecules associated with life, such as dimethyl sulphide (DMS) and dimethyl disulphide (DMDS). More data is needed to confirm these results and rule out non-biological explanations for the presence of these gases. The discovery could indicate that life is common in the galaxy, but further research is required to determine the true origin of the biosignatures.</p>

            <p>A Maryland judge is demanding the Trump administration return Kilmar Ábrego García, a man mistakenly deported to an El Salvador mega-prison. Trump officials claim Ábrego García has ties to the MS-13 gang, while his family and lawyers dispute this. The government claims Ábrego Garcia was a member of an MS-13 gang in New York based on his clothes - which included Chicago Bulls merchandise - and the word of an unknown informant. The federal judge presiding over his case has said Mr Ábrego García has no criminal record in the US or El Salvador, and has called the gang ties "a singular unsubstantiated allegation".</p>
