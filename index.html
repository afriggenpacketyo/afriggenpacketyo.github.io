          <p>Simon Yates, a British cyclist, delivered an exceptional performance in the penultimate stage of the Giro d'Italia, seizing the pink jersey from Isaac del Toro to secure his second Grand Tour title. Yates launched a decisive attack on the Colle delle Finestre, overcoming a previous setback at the same location in 2018. His Visma-Lease A Bike team strategically positioned Wout van Aert in the breakaway group, enabling Yates to catch him on the descent and establish a significant lead. Yates expressed his emotions after the victory, acknowledging the years of hard work and setbacks that led to this achievement, becoming the third British rider to win the Giro. The win solidifies Yates's place among cycling's elite, marking a significant milestone in his career.</p>

          <p>The European Union has voiced strong disapproval of President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel imports from 25% to 50%, citing concerns about global economic stability and increased costs for businesses and consumers. An EU spokesperson stated that the move undermines ongoing efforts to reach a negotiated solution in the trade war and indicated a readiness to impose countermeasures. The EU had previously paused countermeasures on April 14 to facilitate negotiations, but they are prepared to reinstate those measures, along with additional ones, if a mutually acceptable agreement is not reached. The EU is currently finalizing consultations on expanded countermeasures, with a potential effective date of July 14 or earlier depending on circumstances.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth warned that China's military is actively "rehearsing for the real deal" and that a full-scale invasion of Taiwan "could be imminent." While Beijing denies any aggressive intentions, a growing body of evidence suggests China may indeed be preparing for a military move against Taiwan. These indicators include intensified military exercises, strategic deployments of nuclear-capable bombers, gray-zone operations, and infrastructure mobilization across the Taiwan Strait. The international community is urged to take this threat seriously by strengthening deterrence, improving intelligence sharing, and reinforcing Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities to avoid a regional catastrophe.</p>

          <p>The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has reported that Iran has significantly increased its production of highly enriched uranium, now possessing over 400kg enriched to 60% purity, a level close to weapons grade. The IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi expressed serious concern over this development, noting that Iran is the only non-nuclear-armed state producing uranium at this level. Israel has accused Iran of being "totally determined" to acquire nuclear weapons, while Iran maintains its program is peaceful. The IAEA assessment also detailed troubling findings about Iran's past nuclear work, concluding that Tehran conducted undeclared nuclear activities at three previously unknown sites.</p>

          <p>Blue Origin successfully launched six passengers on a sub-orbital trip to the edge of space, providing them with a few minutes of weightlessness and views of Earth. The New Shepard rocket climbed to nearly 65 miles above Earth, allowing the crew to experience weightlessness before descending back to the West Texas landing site. The flight marked Blue Origin's twelfth passenger flight since July 2021, bringing the total number of passengers launched to 68, including four who have flown twice. Blue Origin has dominated the sub-orbital passenger market since Virgin Galactic paused flights to focus on upgrading its spacecraft.</p>

          <p>Job seekers are experiencing a phenomenon known as the "Glass Wall," where they can see job openings but struggle to access them, despite sending numerous applications and seeking referrals. This experience has left many feeling defeated due to a lack of response from potential employers. Experts recommend strategies for overcoming this obstacle, such as networking, tailoring applications, and leveraging social media to increase visibility and connect with recruiters.</p>

          <p>Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, according to a confidential report by the United Nations nuclear watchdog. The report indicates that Iran has amassed 900.8 pounds of uranium enriched up to 60%, an increase of 294.9 pounds since February, raising concerns about its nuclear program. The IAEA has called on Tehran to urgently change course and cooperate with the agency's probe. Israel has responded by stating that the report is a clear warning sign that Iran is determined to complete its nuclear weapons program.</p>

The arrests are part of a series of actions against the government's political opponents, beginning with the imprisonment of Istanbul's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu. Imamoglu, who is part of the Republican People's Party (CHP), sent a letter from prison condemning the arrests as unjust and unlawful.

          <p>A new study suggests that a passing star could disrupt the orbits of planets in our solar system, potentially flinging Earth into the void of interstellar space or causing another planet to collide with Earth. The study indicates a five percent chance that a wayward star could come within 100 astronomical units of our solar system in the next five billion years. The simulations suggest that Mercury's orbit could become so elliptical that it collides with the Sun or Venus, which could then cause Venus or Mars to crash into Earth. While these scenarios are improbable, the research highlights the vulnerability of our solar system to external influences.</p>

After this date, involuntary separations are expected to begin for those who remain.
