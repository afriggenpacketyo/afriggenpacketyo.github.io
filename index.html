            <p>President Donald Trump is in excellent cognitive and physical health according to his White House physician, Captain Sean Barbabella. The doctor's memo, released after Trump's annual physical, indicated robust cardiac, pulmonary, neurological, and general physical function. Trump, at 78, is the oldest person to be sworn in as president at his inauguration in January, although his predecessor, Joe Biden, was older at 82 by the time he left office. Trump also claimed he got "every answer right" on a cognitive exam.</p>

            <p>Renewable energy companies face a significant stress test due to rising electricity grid demands, potential funding freezes, subsidy reductions, and tariffs on key components. While experts believe renewable energy is crucial, President Trump's administration is targeting these solutions, favoring fossil fuels. Companies are striving to achieve cost parity, but the combination of subsidy decreases and tariff increases poses substantial challenges. Despite the challenges, some renewable energy sources like solar and energy storage have reached cost parity with or are even below natural gas or coal in certain regions. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts recommend authoritative parenting, as it fosters better communication and mental health outcomes for children.

            <p>The Federal Trade Commission's antitrust case against Meta has begun, scrutinizing the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp. The FTC argues that Meta used a "buy or bury" strategy to eliminate competition and maintain monopoly power. The government seeks to force Meta to unwind its purchase of both Instagram and WhatsApp, while Meta argues it is being punished for being innovative and competitive. The outcome could significantly impact Meta's advertising business and the future of social media competition.</p>

            <p>A study reveals that many used luxury cars experience significant depreciation, making them poor investments for the middle class. Models like the Jaguar I-PACE, BMW 7 Series, Tesla Model S, and Maserati Ghibli lose a substantial portion of their value within five years. High maintenance costs and reliability issues further contribute to the financial burden of owning these vehicles. While luxury cars may seem appealing, their depreciation rates and potential repair expenses can quickly erode their value. (not investment advice)</p>

Female celebrities are leveraging their personal brands into actual brands, launching beauty lines, homeware brands, and beverage companies. In a challenging economic climate, alchemizing social media attention into a revenue stream seems like solid good sense, and there’s something quite satisfying in hearing Paltrow ditch the woo-woo momentarily, and talk like the steely businesswoman she obviously is.</p>

            <p>A financial therapist explains how attachment styles can influence money management. Anxious attachment leads to clinging to every dollar and constant checking, while avoidant attachment results in ignoring bills and avoiding budgeting. Secure attachment, on the other hand, fosters a healthy relationship with money. Understanding one's attachment style can be key to changing financial behaviors and developing a more balanced approach to money management.</p>

            <p>The former CEO of fintech startup nate, Albert Saniger, has been indicted for allegedly defrauding investors by falsely claiming the app was powered by AI. Instead of AI, the app relied heavily on overseas workers manually processing transactions, mimicking what users believed was being done by automation. Saniger allegedly raised over $40 million based on the premise of custom-built "deep learning models" and told investors and the public that the transactions were being completed by AI. The company's fallout in 2023, left investors with near-total losses.</p>
