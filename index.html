          <p>A powerful storm system swept across the upper Midwest, resulting in three fatalities in Enderlin, North Dakota, due to a tornado. The storm, confirmed as a tornado by the National Weather Service, caused extensive damage in Cass and Ransom counties, leaving approximately 20,000 customers without power in North Dakota. In Minnesota, a tornado warning was issued for Beltrami County, with Bemidji experiencing flash flooding, downed trees, and widespread property damage, including roofs torn off buildings and numerous gas leaks; over 25,000 customers in northern Minnesota are without power. Itasca State Park also suffered significant wind damage, leading to the closure of buildings and programs, while the region grapples with dangerous heat, with heat indices reaching the 100s. The clean-up efforts are underway amid extreme heat warnings and advisories affecting nearly 150 million Americans. The optimism score for this article is 30.</p>

          <p>Sergei Tikhanovsky, the husband of Belarusian opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, has been unexpectedly released from prison in Belarus after five years, along with 13 other political prisoners. Tikhanovsky, an opposition activist himself, has been moved to Lithuania and reunited with his wife, who is living in exile in Vilnius; his release came as US special envoy Keith Kellogg visited Minsk and met with authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko. While other prisoners remain incarcerated, Tikhanovskaya expressed gratitude to US President Trump and European allies for their efforts in securing her husband's release, describing it as a significant diplomatic breakthrough for Lukashenko, potentially easing his isolation and opening avenues for discussing war and peace with the US. Despite this release, political repression continues in Belarus, with hundreds still imprisoned for opposing Lukashenko's rule. The optimism score for this article is 50.</p>

          <p>Weaver Nut Company, Inc. has issued a recall for multiple batches of chocolate nonpareils sold across the U.S. due to the potential presence of undeclared milk allergens. The recall includes six lots of semi-sweet chocolate with "Christmas Seeds" colored nonpareils and 15 lots of semi-sweet chocolate with white nonpareils, with the FDA warning that consumption of these products could pose a risk of serious allergic reactions for individuals with milk allergies or sensitivities. The company initiated the recall after a wholesale customer complaint led to a lab test confirming the presence of milk, and while no illnesses have been reported, Weaver Nut Company is collaborating with the FDA to ensure product safety.

          <p>Tensions flared during a game between the Houston Astros and Los Angeles Angels when Astros pitcher Hunter Brown hit Angels shortstop Zach Neto with a pitch, leading to a heated confrontation and a bench-clearing incident. Neto immediately reacted, yelling at Brown, who responded by walking toward Neto and engaging in a verbal exchange; both teams' dugouts and bullpens emptied, but order was eventually restored without any punches thrown or ejections.

          <p>UBS has maintained a 'Hold' rating for Conagra Brands, Inc., citing growth pressures and an anticipated decrease in earnings per share by fiscal year 2026, although these concerns are largely factored into the company's current valuation. Conagra's financial stability is supported by a 6.49% dividend yield and 14% free cash flow yield, which balances its risk-to-reward profile, and the company has streamlined its portfolio by selling its Chef Boyardee and Van de Kamâ€™s brands.

The U.S. State Department confirmed that several U.S. citizens sustained minor injuries from an Iranian missile strike, as President Trump considers whether to militarily intervene, facing pressure to find a diplomatic resolution, with the conflict escalating and continuing in Gaza.

          <p>Face yoga, a trendy facial workout involving exaggerated poses and repetitive movements, is gaining popularity for its potential slimming and anti-aging effects, but experts offer mixed opinions on its effectiveness. While some influencers claim it can provide a natural facelift, toning, and reduce fine lines, a dermatologist and the author of a face yoga study suggest it may improve facial fullness and circulation, but is not a replacement for cosmetic procedures. Face yoga could also help relax facial muscles and increase blood flow, but generally, face yoga exercises are harmless, and those seeking more dramatic interventions should consult a dermatologist.

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist recently released from immigration detention, asserts that the Trump administration's efforts to suppress pro-Palestinian voices have failed. Speaking after his release, Khalil vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights and the rights of immigrants, accusing the White House of attempting to dehumanize dissenters; Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez supported Khalil, stating his release demonstrates the Trump administration's losing legal battle to deport pro-Palestinian migrants. Khalil's remarks follow a judge's order for his release, determining he was not a flight risk or threat, although the Trump administration has vowed to appeal and continue efforts to remove him from the U.S. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>
