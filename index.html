Gottlieb highlighted the removal of CDC information debunking links between the preservative thimerosal and autism as a worrying development.

The author argues that China's dominance in mining and refining these minerals, coupled with its use of export controls, exposes a critical American vulnerability that has been ignored for years. Despite recent diplomatic agreements, the piece expresses skepticism, stating that China's licensing process amounts to "competitive surveillance."

He asserted that these cuts are being made to provide tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans while adding trillions to the national debt.

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary highlights a significant shift in the party's stance on Israel, particularly within America's largest Jewish community. Mamdani, a democratic socialist and outspoken critic of Israel, defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo despite his controversial positions, such as supporting the BDS movement. His success suggests that criticism of Israeli government policy is no longer a disqualifying factor for many Democratic voters, including a growing number of progressive Jews. However, his nomination has also alarmed some in the Jewish community who fear it signals waning political influence.</p>

          <p>An intense and early-season heatwave is affecting much of Europe, with temperatures soaring past 40 degrees Celsius (104 F) and breaking records. Spain recorded its hottest June day ever at 46Â°C (114.8Â°F), while Italy placed 21 cities on high alert, and Greece issued wildfire warnings. The extreme heat is expected to continue, with London anticipating its hottest day of the year. Meteorologists attribute the increasing frequency and intensity of such heatwaves to human-driven climate change, warning that these extreme weather events will become more common.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With extreme temperatures affecting many regions, animal welfare charities are urging dog owners to take precautions to prevent heat-related illness, which can be fatal for canines. The RSPCA notes that dogs are more likely to suffer from overheating during exercise than from being left in hot cars. Key signs of heatstroke include heavy panting, lethargy, and vomiting. Experts advise against walking dogs in the heat of the day, suggesting early morning or late evening instead, and recommend checking pavement temperature to avoid burning their paws.</p>

          <p>The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, has stated that Iran could restart its uranium enrichment activities within "a matter of months." This assessment follows recent U.S. military strikes on three of Iran's nuclear facilities. In a television interview, Grossi noted that while the sites sustained severe damage, it was not total, and Iran retains the knowledge and industrial capacity to rebuild. His comments contrast with the Trump administration's claims that the facilities were "totally obliterated," suggesting the setback to Iran's program may be temporary.</p>

Read was accused of hitting O'Keefe with her SUV, but her defense argued she was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement. The first trial ended in a hung jury, leading to a highly publicized retrial. After months of testimony and intense public interest, Read was acquitted of the most serious charges, including murder and manslaughter, but convicted of driving under the influence.</p>
