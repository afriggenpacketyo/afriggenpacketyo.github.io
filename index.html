        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Harvard Chan School study reveals that a moderate intake of healthy animal-based foods and a lower intake of ultra-processed foods significantly increases the likelihood of healthy aging.  The Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), rich in plant-based foods and healthy fats, showed the most benefits.  However, the study's limitation of focusing solely on health professionals might introduce bias, potentially underrepresenting the dietary habits of diverse populations.</p>

          <p>WPP, a British advertising giant, removes references to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) from its annual report, possibly in response to the Trump administration's anti-DEI policies.  The change reflects the growing pressure on companies to align with the administration's stance.  The Guardian's report provides a neutral account, but the framing might subtly emphasize the influence of political pressure on corporate decisions.</p>
