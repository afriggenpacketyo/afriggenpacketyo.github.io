          <p>Congressional budget disagreements are affecting the Pentagon's defense priorities, particularly concerning the development of sixth-generation fighter jets for the Air Force and Navy. The urgency is heightened by China's own rapid progress on a similar aircraft, which could alter the strategic balance in a potential conflict over Taiwan. This internal U.S. debate over funding allocation for programs like the next-generation air dominance fighter, reportedly named the F-47, has significant implications for America's military readiness and its ability to deter China in the Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Following the Senate's narrow passage of a revised tax-and-spending megabill, House Republicans now face a challenging path to getting it approved. Speaker Mike Johnson must navigate a slim majority where several conservative members have already voiced objections to the Senate's version. Key points of contention include a higher overall price tag and a larger increase in the debt ceiling compared to the bill the House originally passed. With a self-imposed July 4 deadline approaching, the leadership has very little room for error or defections to pass the legislation.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited a new, controversial migrant detention facility in the Florida Everglades, which is expected to hold around 3,000 people. Dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," the administration claims the surrounding wetlands, filled with alligators and pythons, will serve as a natural deterrent to escape. The facility has drawn criticism from environmental groups and local residents over potential damage to the sensitive Everglades ecosystem. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis also announced plans to deputize National Guard lawyers as immigration judges to expedite deportations from the site.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly rebuked Republican Representative Thomas Massie for his opposition to the large tax-and-spending bill recently passed by the Senate. Speaking from Air Force One, Trump predicted Massie would face a strong primary challenger and lose his seat, calling him "'Rand Paul Junior'" for his consistent "no" votes on major legislation. Massie has opposed the bill on fiscal grounds, arguing it would significantly increase the national debt. The comments highlight the internal GOP divisions over the legislation as it heads back to the House for a final vote.</p>

          <p>The UK government successfully passed a vote on its contentious benefits bill, but only after making significant last-minute concessions to rebel MPs within its own Labour party. The initial plans to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) were walked back, gutting the bill of its most controversial measures and delaying or losing billions in potential savings. This chaotic process has been criticized as undermining the authority of Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall, raising questions about the government's fiscal credibility and legislative competence.</p>

          <p>A government advisory panel, recently restructured with new members skeptical of immunizations, has voted to recommend against the use of thimerosal in flu shots. Thimerosal is a mercury-containing preservative that has been a long-standing target of the anti-vaccine movement, despite numerous studies finding no evidence of harm. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must still approve the recommendation, but if adopted, it would affect the small percentage of the U.S. flu vaccine supply that still uses the preservative, potentially reinforcing unfounded public fears about vaccine safety.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever rookie Caitlin Clark, who received a record number of fan votes for the WNBA All-Star game, finished ninth in the voting conducted among her fellow players. Despite the low ranking from her peers, Clark will serve as an All-Star team captain due to the overwhelming fan support. The results from the player poll have fueled an ongoing narrative that some WNBA veterans are jealous of the attention Clark receives. Her overall weighted score, which combines fan, player, and media votes, still secured her a starting position in the July 19 event.</p>
          <p>45/100</p>
