          <p>France and Indonesia have jointly called for mutual recognition between Israel and Palestine, emphasizing the need for a political solution to restore peace. French President Macron, during his visit to Jakarta, highlighted the absence of double standards in France's Middle East policy. Macron announced plans to co-organize a conference on Gaza in New York with Saudi Arabia, aiming to revitalize recognition of a Palestinian state and Israel's right to peaceful existence. Both Macron and Indonesian President Subianto condemned Israeli control plans in Gaza and displacement efforts of Palestinians. Optimism score is calculated on the basis of the potential for diplomatic progress and stability in the region.</p>

          <p>The Defense Department has ceased requiring civilian employees to submit weekly reports detailing their accomplishments, a practice initiated by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in February. Jay Hurst, performing the duties of undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, announced that employees should instead offer ideas to improve efficiency or eliminate waste. This decision aligns with similar actions taken by other agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health. The weekly reports, involving a "five bullet exercise," were part of Elon Musk and DOGE's efforts to reduce federal government waste.</p>

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation acknowledged the overwhelming needs on the ground, leading their team to retreat temporarily to ensure safe distribution.

          <p>The German government plans to suspend family reunification for refugees with subsidiary protection status for at least two years, primarily affecting Syrian families. This decision is driven by concerns over the country's integration capacity, with officials citing limitations in cities and municipalities. The move has sparked debate, with critics warning of psychological strain and irregular immigration risks due to the separation of families. The German Cabinet approved the restrictions on family reunification on Wednesday, May 28, 2025, but the draft bill must still pass in the Bundestag to come into effect.</p>

          <p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley emphasized the need for increased funding to meet the government's anti-crime pledges, including halving knife crime and violence against women, while boosting neighborhood policing.

He also advocated for radical policing reform, including fewer policing organizations and a national police agency.

The letter raised concerns about the costs of electronic tagging and repeat offenders avoiding jail. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood accepted most of the proposals, but ruled out early releases for the most serious offenders, such as those jailed for terror offences.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has been fined Â£122.7m for breaching regulations related to sewage spills and shareholder payouts, marking the largest penalty ever issued by Ofwat. The water industry regulator found that Thames Water failed to protect the environment and let down its customers. Ofwat's investigation indicated that a significant portion of Thames Water's storm overflows were spilling routinely rather than in exceptional circumstances. The company also faced fines for shareholder payouts that did not reflect its delivery performance, with the regulator emphasizing that the fines will be paid by the company and its investors, not customers.</p>

Construction of single-family homes has dropped, and the tariff debate has created uncertainty for builders, particularly regarding lumber costs.

The proposed cuts, which include work requirements and increased paperwork, could reverse gains made by the Affordable Care Act, impacting low-income and disabled individuals.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "pride" has transformed from a vice to a symbol of LGBTQ+ empowerment, with Pride month celebrations occurring globally. Originating from an "inordinate self-esteem," pride became associated with the LGBTQ+ community through the civil rights movement. L. Craig Schoonmaker advocated for "pride" as a rallying cry, emphasizing self-esteem rather than power. The concept of embracing "pride" allowed the LGBTQ+ community to reject negative labels and assert their worth, though debates about its use continue. The rise in anti-LGBTQ+ legislation underscores the ongoing importance of Pride as a symbol of resilience.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of energy customers will receive payouts of up to Â£1,000 each, and may have debts written off, following a scandal over forced prepayment meter fittings. Energy companies are disbursing over Â£70m in compensation and support, responding to Ofgem's review of suppliers switching vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without consent. Customers could receive payments from Â£40 to Â£500, with Â£1,000 for inappropriate installations, and debt write-offs for forced meter installations. Ofgem suspended forced installations and introduced stricter conditions, with enforcement investigations continuing for British Gas, Utilita, and Ovo.</p>

          <p>Tesco's introduction of AI technology at self-checkouts, featuring overhead cameras and live-action replays, has drawn mixed reactions from shoppers, with some mocking the system's resemblance to football's VAR. The technology aims to reduce shoplifting by identifying unscanned items, but some customers find it invasive and have vowed to avoid self-checkouts. Shoplifting in the UK has reached a record high, prompting retailers to implement security measures. The system shows customers a video of their attempt to scan an item if it fails, accompanied by a message prompting them to try again.</p>

          <p>Stellantis has appointed Antonio Filosa, the North American chief operating officer, as its new CEO, succeeding Carlos Tavares. Filosa will assume the role on June 23, with an extraordinary shareholder meeting scheduled for his election to the board. This decision follows Tavares' unexpected resignation in December, prompted by declining profits, sales, and challenges in the U.S. Filosa, a 25-year company veteran, previously served as Jeep brand CEO and chief quality officer. Stellantis recently reported a 14% year-on-year downturn in first-quarter net revenues and withdrew its full-year financial guidance due to trade policy uncertainties.</p>
