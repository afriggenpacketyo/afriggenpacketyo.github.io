Cole Prosek, an Ole Miss commit, earned the MVP award for his crucial contributions, including two RBI singles that fueled his team's comeback from a 4-0 deficit. The annual event, held at Petco Park, provides a national stage for elite prospects in front of MLB scouts and executives.

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur's club captain, Cristian Romero, has signed a new four-year contract, securing his position with the North London team until 2029. The 27-year-old Argentina centre-back has been a key player since joining from Atalanta in 2021, making 126 appearances and recently captaining the side to a Europa League victory. This deal ends summer speculation linking him to a move to Atletico Madrid and follows right-back Djed Spence in committing to a new long-term contract. Romero's extension solidifies his leadership role under new head coach Thomas Frank.</p>

          <p>After a two-week walkout to stall the process, Texas House Democrats have returned to Austin, allowing the Republican-led legislature to resume its efforts on a controversial mid-decade redistricting plan. The proposed maps aim to create up to five more GOP-winnable congressional seats, a move initiated at the urging of President Trump to bolster the Republican majority in the U.S. House. In response, California Democrats are advancing their own redistricting proposal to counteract the potential gains in Texas, setting the stage for a wider national political battle over electoral maps ahead of the 2026 midterms.</p>

          <p>In the California Area School District in Pennsylvania, Superintendent Dr. Laura Jacob is using 3D printing technology to create violins for students, overcoming the financial barrier of expensive instrument rentals. Inspired by the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra, she produces the instruments for about $50 each and offers them for free to any student in the district, where over 70% are from low-income families. The program has produced over 200 violins in five years and now includes a weekly 3D violin club, aiming to foster a lifelong love for music and build student confidence.</p>

          <p>As interest rates on certificates of deposit (CDs) remain attractive, financial experts advise savers to carefully consider their personal financial situation before investing. Key factors include ensuring a sufficient emergency fund is maintained and assessing liquidity needs to avoid early withdrawal penalties. Experts also suggest comparing CD rates with other low-risk options and considering the potential for future Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could make locking in current rates advantageous. A CD laddering strategy, which involves spreading funds across multiple CDs with different maturity dates, is recommended to maintain flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

Hill stated that Putin's goal is to sow chaos in the American electoral system and that Trump has effectively ceded narrative control to the Russian leader.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has proposed a new rule to prevent employees of certain organizations from receiving benefits under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. The administration aims to halt forgiveness for those working for groups deemed to be "undermining national security and American values," a move advocates fear could be used to target non-profits based on political ideology. The proposed changes, which are open for public comment, would not be retroactive for past service but could delay or prevent forgiveness for a subset of future borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, is forecast to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast this week, though it is not expected to make landfall. After briefly reaching Category 5 strength, the storm is now a powerful Category 4 hurricane moving north of the Caribbean. While the storm's center is projected to pass between Bermuda and the U.S., its large size will cause dangerous coastal conditions, with high waves and strong winds possible for areas like North Carolina's Outer Banks. Tropical storm warnings are in effect for the Turks and Caicos and parts of the Bahamas.</p>

The BBC did not provide a reason for the sudden removal from the schedule but stated that new transmission details would be confirmed later. The documentary was originally planned as a 10-part series but was re-conceived as a single film as the musician's health declined.</p>

          <p>An article from Deutsche Welle examines the factors contributing to the German Bundesliga's decline in prestige compared to England's Premier League and Spain's La Liga. The departure of star players like Florian Wirtz and Kingsley Coman highlights a trend of top talent leaving Germany. Financially, the Bundesliga lags significantly in television revenue and has recently been surpassed in average attendance by the Premier League. Former Bayern Munich chairman Oliver Kahn warns that the league's appeal is deceptive and that it has lost ground both sportingly and commercially on the international stage.</p>

The election, which opponents have widely dismissed as a sham, is seen as an attempt by the military to legitimize its rule amid an ongoing civil war. Voting will be held over three separate days in over 300 constituencies, including in some areas currently controlled by rebel forces. The party of ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been banned from participating, and many opposition groups have called for a boycott.</p>

In a first for the U.S. utility industry, Kairos and Google will assume the financial risk of building the plant, while TVA will purchase the power, a model designed to avoid passing construction costs to consumers.
