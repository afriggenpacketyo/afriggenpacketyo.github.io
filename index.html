          <p>Archaeologists have identified the wreckage of the Koning Willem de Tweede, an 800-ton Dutch merchant ship that sank off the coast of Australia in 1857, resulting in 16 deaths. The discovery, announced by the Australian National Maritime Museum and the SilentWorld Foundation after a four-year search, reveals components of the ship, including its windlass. The ship had previously transported over 400 Chinese miners just before its sinking, connecting the find to stories of trade and migration. Future monitoring visits are planned to further assess the site and uncover more of this important piece of maritime history.</p>

          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested outside an immigration detention facility in Newark during a protest, leading to conflicting accounts between the Trump administration and Democratic lawmakers. Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman, Rob Menendez, and LaMonica McIver, who were visiting the facility, allege they were "manhandled" by agents during the arrest. The Department of Homeland Security claims the lawmakers assaulted ICE officers, including a body-slamming incident, and suggested they could face charges. The situation escalated after Baraka, a Democrat running for governor, repeatedly requested entry to inspect the facility, leading to disputes over permits and accusations of political stunts.</p>

          <p>Nearly 50 years after the strangulation of Jeannette Ralston in San Jose, California, authorities have arrested Willie Eugene Sims, 69, in Jefferson, Ohio. Ralston, a 24-year-old mother, was found strangled in her car in 1977, and the case went cold due to a lack of credible leads. The break came when an upgraded F.B.I. fingerprint search algorithm matched Sims' thumbprint on a cigarette carton found in the victim's car. Sims, who had a prior conviction for assault to commit murder, was linked to the crime through DNA evidence and a sketch resembling his booking photo from 1977.</p>

          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China have resumed trade negotiations in Geneva, aiming to de-escalate tensions that have disrupted the global economy. The meetings, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, follow increased tariffs imposed by both countries, leading to concerns about slower growth and higher prices. While expectations for a major breakthrough are low, the fact that talks are occurring has raised hopes for reduced tensions. The negotiations focus on each side's demands and potential steps toward lowering tariffs, with the global economy closely watching for any signs of progress.</p>

          <p>China has imposed export controls on rare earth elements, critical for manufacturing military equipment and space technology, in response to increased U.S. tariffs.

          <p>Bill Gates has announced plans to donate most of his wealth by 2045 to address urgent global needs and criticized Elon Musk for his role in cutting US foreign aid. Gates expressed concern that USAID cuts would increase childhood deaths in poor countries. He also revealed that the Gates Foundation would double its giving to $200 billion by 2045, after which it will be dissolved. Gates' fortune stems from co-founding Microsoft, and he has since diversified his assets into various business endeavors.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's crypto agenda faces challenges due to concerns that his personal cryptocurrency ventures create conflicts of interest. Lawmakers rejected the GENIUS Act, a stablecoin bill, citing the president's meme coin, $TRUMP, and family crypto ventures. Critics argue that individuals can enrich the president by buying cryptocurrency he controls, endangering national security. The failure of the bill highlights the impact of Trump's financial entanglements on legislative efforts and the reputation of the U.S. crypto industry.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may struggle to avoid the "Too Late" label, as the Fed navigates challenges balancing full employment and low inflation. Despite President Trump's urging for rate cuts, Powell has maintained a steady course, citing a "solid" economy. Economists suggest Powell is in a no-win situation, with Trump's tariffs threatening both growth and inflation. Some analysts believe the Fed's reliance on lagging indicators like the labor market could lead to delayed action and potential economic consequences.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to encourage ceasefire talks with Pakistan after the US received alarming intelligence. Vance made clear to the Indian prime minister that the White House believed there was a high probability for dramatic escalation as the conflict went into the weekend. The US believed the nuclear-armed neighbors were not talking, and it needed to get them back to the bargaining table.</p>
