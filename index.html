          <p>Candidates vying to become California's next governor in 2026 are offering varied perspectives on the tenure of current Governor Gavin Newsom. Democrats like Toni Atkins and Xavier Becerra have praised his economic management and challenges to the Trump administration, while suggesting improvements in areas like housing and high-speed rail. Republican candidates, including Sheriff Chad Bianco and Steve Hilton, have been more critical, with Bianco stating the only thing Newsom has done well is "acting like a Republican."</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate confirmed Stephen Miran, a senior Trump official, to the Federal Reserve's board of governors, strengthening the president's influence over the central bank. This occurred just as a federal appeals court blocked the administration's attempt to fire another governor, Lisa Cook, before a key interest rate meeting. The confirmation marks a rare instance of a sitting White House official joining the Fed's board, raising concerns about the institution's political independence. These events unfold as President Trump continues to publicly pressure the central bank to implement significant interest rate cuts.</p>

          <p>President Trump has attributed the brutal killing of a Dallas motel manager to the immigration policies of the previous administration. The suspect, a Cuban national, was allowed to remain in the U.S. under an order of supervision despite prior arrests, as Cuba reportedly refused to accept his deportation. In a social media post, Trump blamed his predecessor for the suspect's release and vowed that his administration would take a harder stance on what he termed "Illegal Immigrant Criminals."</p>

          <p>A final report from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health has found that significant levels of lead contamination persist in Altadena's soil following the Eaton fire. The lead, believed to originate from incinerated paint from older homes, was not fully removed by cleanup crews, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. High levels of lead were detected in the yards of both destroyed and still-standing homes, posing a potential health risk, particularly to children, and leaving homeowners to navigate remediation on their own.</p>

          <p>The Senate narrowly confirmed Stephen Miran, President Trump's top economic advisor, to a seat on the Federal Reserve's board of governors. The confirmation was fast-tracked to allow his participation in the upcoming interest rate policy meeting. Miran's appointment is controversial because he plans to take an unpaid leave from his White House role rather than resign, fueling concerns among critics about the erosion of the central bank's independence. His presence on the board is seen as a move to further the administration's push for aggressive rate cuts.</p>

          <p>As autumn approaches, organization experts suggest that decluttering can reduce stress and provide a sense of a fresh start. They recommend four main strategies: begin with small, manageable tasks like a single drawer to avoid feeling overwhelmed; plan ahead for where discarded items will go; focus on keeping quality items that bring joy rather than aiming for sheer quantity; and distinguish between items kept for genuine sentimental value versus those kept out of a vague sense of nostalgia.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it has reached a "framework" deal with China that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States, avoiding a potential ban. The agreement would require the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell TikTok to a U.S.-based owner to mitigate national security concerns over user data and potential propaganda. While details are still being finalized, the move signals a potential resolution to a politically sensitive issue affecting TikTok's 170 million American users.</p>

          <p>A jury has awarded a combined $13.6 million to five women who were sexually assaulted by their former English teacher and coach at Rolling Hills High School during the 1980s. The verdict found the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District negligent for failing to prevent the abuse by teacher Garry Poe, which occurred during chaperoned European tours after the students had graduated. The women testified that Poe groomed them on campus before assaulting them on the trips.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis explores Tesla's proposal for a new compensation package that could make CEO Elon Musk a trillionaire if he grows the company to an $8.5 trillion valuation. The plan is seen as a direct response to Musk's public statements that he might focus his innovative efforts elsewhere if he cannot increase his ownership stake to around 25%. The article suggests that Tesla's board believes Musk's personal involvement is intrinsically tied to the company's high valuation, making this massive incentive a strategic bid to retain his dedicated attention.</p>

Mahmood and other UK political leaders condemned the remarks as dangerous, inflammatory, and an unacceptable attempt by a "hostile billionaire" to interfere with British democracy.</p>

          <p>Manchester United icon Paul Scholes has criticized the club's recent performance, attributing their poor start to the season to a flawed summer transfer strategy and a lack of players suited to manager Ruben Amorim's 3-4-3 system. Scholes argued that despite spending heavily on forwards, the club's top priority should have been acquiring a dynamic central midfielder. He warned that Amorim must consider changing his tactical approach, as the current results are not good enough for a club of United's stature.</p>

          <p>According to a new report from the California Budget and Policy Center, California's poverty rate stood at 17.7% last year, tying it with Louisiana for the highest in the nation. The analysis, which factors in the state's high cost of living, found that seven million Californians lack the resources to meet basic needs. Researchers attribute the significant increase from a historic low in 2021 to the expiration of federal and state pandemic-era aid programs, such as expanded tax credits and rental protections.</p>
