Pugh undertook the swim to raise awareness about the threats faced by sharks and to challenge negative perceptions perpetuated by films like Jaws. Despite enduring cold water, strong winds, and the presence of sharks, Pugh swam for approximately 24 hours to highlight the ecocide of sharks, with nearly 100 million killed annually.

Trump criticized the Biden Department of Justice and the judge in the case, claiming Jenkins was unfairly persecuted.

          <p>A report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) suggests that the official unemployment rate of 4.2% may not accurately reflect the economic struggles of many Americans. LISEP's "true rate" of unemployment, which includes those seeking full-time employment, but unable to find it, as well as those earning poverty-level wages, stands at 24.3%. The study highlights that millions of households are struggling to maintain a minimal quality of life, with Hispanic, Black, and women workers disproportionately affected. The discrepancy between the official rate and LISEP's measure raises concerns about the effectiveness of current policies and the need for greater attention to the needs of low- and middle-income Americans.</p>

          <p>President Trump delayed tariffs on the European Union, providing an opportunity for new trade negotiations. Despite the delay, the United States and the European Union still have differing priorities that could hinder reaching an agreement. European negotiators have been hesitant to agree to many of Trump's demands, such as changing their consumption tax system or rolling back digital regulations. The goal is for the two sides to reach some solution before the new July 9 deadline.</p>

Despite increased police presence and a curfew for minors, the holiday weekend brought approximately 100,000 visitors and numerous incidents, leading to the proactive shutdown to ensure public safety.</p>

          <p>Analysts caution that the potential for a trade war between the U.S. and the EU remains despite President Trump's decision to delay implementing tariffs on European goods. The extension has provided the two parties with more time to negotiate, but investors should prepare for continued volatility. Experts emphasize that the underlying issues remain unresolved and that Trump's negotiating tactics could lead to further escalation. While the delay has sparked a "tentative risk-on rally," the outcome of the negotiations remains uncertain.</p>
