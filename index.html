          <p>Nvidia's recent earnings report reveals a complex landscape of growth and obstacles. While the company experienced a 69% sales increase, U.S. export controls are hindering its potential in China, a market Nvidia estimates could reach $50 billion. Despite these challenges, Nvidia's data center division continues to thrive, with cloud providers remaining key customers, and the company is focusing on AI inference, where its Blackwell chips are designed to meet surging demand. Nvidia's leadership in silicon/hardware/software platforms and its aggressive product launch cadence position it favorably in the AI market, though the China situation remains a significant factor. Optimism among analysts remains high regarding Nvidia's overall business acceleration and durable growth drivers.</p>

          <p>The article discusses how Harvard University's status as a global leader in education, science, and research, fueled by its ability to attract international talent, is being threatened by the Trump administration's policies. These policies include cutting federal funding and barring international students, which could undermine America's scientific supremacy and economic growth. The author argues that America's K-12 education system is mediocre, and the country relies on elite universities like Harvard to compensate for this weakness. Losing the privilege of attracting top international students would force the US to confront its educational failures and potentially diminish its scientific brainpower. The article highlights the importance of foreign talent to American science and innovation.</p>

          <p>A panel of U.S. federal judges blocked a set of across-the-board tariffs threatened by the Trump administration, leading to a cautious response from trade experts and America's trading partners. While stocks rose internationally on the news, economists cautioned that President Trump could pursue other legal avenues to enact tariffs. The court's decision offers a fragile chance at reprieve for economies, but continued chaos is all but guaranteed. The ruling does not roll back sector-specific tariffs, such as those on steel and aluminum, leaving the U.S. and its trading partners to negotiate on those sectors in the coming weeks.

The bucket, dating back to the 6th century and decorated with a hunting scene, is believed to have originated from Antioch in the Byzantine Empire.

          <p>Israel bombarded Gaza, resulting in over 60 deaths, as Palestinians struggled to obtain aid under a new Israeli-backed operation. The UN criticizes the new system, citing its inadequacy to meet basic needs, and a WFP warehouse was looted, resulting in casualties. Israel and Hamas are considering a new cease-fire proposal, involving hostage releases and prisoner exchanges, but disagreements persist over guarantees of a permanent cessation of hostilities. The war, ongoing since October 2023, has caused significant casualties and a humanitarian crisis in Gaza.</p>

The plaintiffs, from climate-impacted states, assert that these orders have violated the state-created danger doctrine. The youth are asking the court to declare the executive orders unconstitutional and block their implementation, demanding protection of the right to a clean environment.</p>

          <p>Harvard and Trump administration attorneys are set to make their first in-person arguments in court regarding the administration's attempt to ban the university from enrolling international students. Harvard's strategy will use President Trump's public statements as evidence that the government is on a political crusade against the school, violating its First Amendment rights. At stake is Harvard's 70-year tradition of admitting top students from around the globe, with a ban affecting 7,000 students. The Trump administration argues that Harvard has fostered violence and antisemitism, accusations the university denies.</p>

The ruling does block Trump's imposition of blanket tariffs on other UK goods, but the White House intends to appeal the decision.
