          <p>Ghislaine Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring, was interviewed by a senior Department of Justice official. Her lawyer stated that she was questioned about approximately 100 different people and answered all questions truthfully without holding anything back. The meeting occurred as President Trump deflected questions about his own past association with Epstein, suggesting focus should be on others like Bill Clinton. Maxwell's lawyer confirmed no offers of clemency have been made in exchange for her cooperation.</p>

          <p>As President Trump visits Scotland to open a new golf course, local residents near his Aberdeenshire resort express divided opinions. Some neighbors, like David Milne, remain critical of the development, citing the disruption to the natural landscape and Trump's past treatment of property owners. Protests are planned, reflecting broader unfavorable opinions of the president in Scotland. However, others in the community acknowledge the positive economic impact and employment the course has brought to the area, separating the business from the politics.</p>

          <p>Democratic lawmakers at both federal and state levels are pushing for legislation to prohibit federal agents, particularly those involved in immigration enforcement, from wearing masks that conceal their identities. Bills like the "No Secret Police Act" aim to prevent agents from using non-tactical masks, a practice that has grown under the Trump administration. While proponents argue this is crucial for democratic accountability, law enforcement advocates raise concerns about officer safety, citing threats like doxing. The debate also involves the legal question of whether states can regulate federal agents' conduct.</p>

          <p>In a speech at a progressive youth summit, Democratic Representative Ro Khanna of California issued a strong call for a fundamental change within his party. He argued that the "old guard needs to go" and that the Democratic Party requires a "rebirth" to better represent the working class, human rights, and transparency over the interests of wealthy donors. Khanna connected the need for change to restoring public trust, citing the Jeffrey Epstein case as an example where more transparency is needed. His populist message contrasts with the more establishment presence of figures like former Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the same event.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times argues that the widespread public ridicule of the "kiss-cam" couple from a Coldplay concert is a healthy societal response. The viral video captured a tech CEO and his HR head, who were not married to each other, in an intimate moment. The author, referencing George Orwell, suggests that the humor and shaming reflect a society that still takes marital fidelity seriously, rather than a purely sadistic "pile-on." The column posits that laughing at such relatable human failings is a sign of a society with a robust respect for marriage.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that his administration is considering a "little rebate" for some Americans, funded by the increased revenue from tariffs imposed on U.S. trade partners. He suggested the rebate could be targeted at individuals of a certain income level, though he also mentioned paying down the national debt as a priority for the incoming funds. Experts note that it is unclear if such a rebate could be implemented without congressional approval. The idea raises questions about its potential impact on inflation and the federal budget deficit.

          <p>"Diciannove (Nineteen)," a new Italian film from director Giovanni Tortorici and producer Luca Guadagnino, is reviewed as a vibrant and messy coming-of-age story. The film follows Leonardo, an arrogant literature student in Siena, as he navigates his consequential 19th year with a mix of intellectual pretension and youthful confusion. The review praises the film's energetic, playful style and the compelling performance of first-time actor Manfredi Marini. While the restless filmmaking can sometimes be tiring, the movie is lauded for its witty and honest portrayal of youth's chaotic journey of self-discovery.</p>

          <p>A coroner has concluded that there were failings in the care provided to former England cricketer Graham Thorpe, who died by suicide in August 2024. The court heard that healthcare professionals did not perceive Thorpe to be in a crisis situation, even after his wife reported he had asked for help to end his life. Thorpe, who had been struggling with depression after losing his coaching job, was not seen in person by mental health services for over four months before his death. The coroner noted these "shortcomings" in care, though they did not amount to gross misconduct.</p>

Police later issued a categorical statement clarifying that only the remains of one man, Daniel Coleman, have been recovered from the scene.

The mission, led from a new command center in Arizona, utilizes armored vehicles, helicopters, and drones.

At 34 years old, Root is now just 2,512 runs behind Tendulkar's record, a milestone once considered unbreakable but now seemingly within his reach.

This puts pressure on the Prime Minister, who has stated that recognition must be part of a broader, practical peace plan, not an isolated gesture.

          <p>A review of Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" finds the film to be a handsome and well-acted reboot that unfortunately lacks a sense of fun. The movie, directed by Matt Shakman, quickly moves past the team's origins and family dynamic to focus on a serious, world-ending threat from the villain Galactus. The reviewer notes that this leaves little room for the playful banter and chemistry that define the characters in the comics. While the film successfully relaunches the franchise with a new retro-futuristic aesthetic, it is criticized for being too somber and portentous.</p>
