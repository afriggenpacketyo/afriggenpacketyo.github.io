          <p>President Trump posthumously honored conservative activist Charlie Kirk with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, on what would have been Kirk's 32nd birthday. During a White House ceremony, Trump praised Kirk as a "fearless warrior for liberty" and a key ally who helped shape his movement and secure young voter support. The medal was accepted by Kirk's widow, Erika Kirk, following his fatal shooting on a Utah college campus a month prior. Prosecutors have charged a 22-year-old with aggravated murder in connection with his death.</p>

Four more bodies of deceased hostages have been returned to Israel for identification, though about 20 bodies are believed to remain in Gaza. The UN reports improved access for aid organizations in areas from which Israeli forces have withdrawn, allowing for scaled-up humanitarian responses.

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at the Los Indios International Bridge in Texas seized over $1.3 million worth of methamphetamine and black tar heroin.
