The writ of habeas corpus has been suspended only a few times in U.S. history, including during the Civil War and in specific territories during insurrections.</p>

Trump suggested a potential reduction in tariffs to 80%, but this would still be prohibitively expensive for many businesses.

          <p>An opinion article discusses the inherent problems with the death penalty, focusing on a recent execution in South Carolina. Mikal Mahdi was executed by firing squad, but the autopsy revealed only two wounds, neither directly hitting his heart, suggesting a prolonged and painful death. The article argues that there is no acceptable or morally justifiable way to execute a human being. It highlights the conflicting views on humane execution methods and the barbaric nature of the death penalty itself.</p>
