          <p>The Camogie Association is under pressure to relax its rule mandating skorts in matches, with critics calling it sexist. Former All-Star Jane Adams argues that players should have a choice between skorts and shorts for comfort. A recent survey revealed that 70% of players find skorts uncomfortable, and 83% want the option to wear shorts. The Camogie Association has called a Special Congress for May 22 to vote on the issue, amidst growing discontent and concerns about player welfare.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article details how a January order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth led to significant curriculum changes at West Point, including canceled classes and book bans. The order directed military service academies to remove ideologies deemed divisive, leading to the removal of readings focused on race, gender, and darker aspects of American history. Two classes were scrapped, and works by Black authors were purged, prompting resignations from tenured professors in protest. The situation has ignited debate over academic freedom versus adherence to government directives within military institutions.</p>

          <p>This Atlantic article cautions against focusing on federal judges as personalities, arguing that it shifts the focus from the rule of law to individual actors. The author notes that while scrutiny of public officials is important, the increasing attention on judges risks undermining the legitimacy of the court system.
