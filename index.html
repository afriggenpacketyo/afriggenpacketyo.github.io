          <p>President Trump has nominated E. J. Antoni, a Heritage Foundation economist, to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Antoni recently suggested that the BLS should suspend its monthly jobs reports, a key economic indicator, questioning their accuracy and arguing for a reliance on more precise quarterly data instead. This nomination follows the firing of the previous BLS commissioner, whom Trump accused of "rigging" data, and has drawn significant criticism from economists concerned about the integrity of vital economic statistics.

The conflict saw widespread jamming of satellite navigation systems, including the US GPS, EU's Galileo, and China's own Beidou system, which presented a valuable opportunity for China to observe and learn from these advanced electronic countermeasures. This analysis aims to draw lessons from the jamming and counter-jamming operations between Russia and Western powers to enhance China's own capabilities.</p>

          <p>Alaska's Mendenhall Glacier has begun to release a massive volume of water from an upstream basin, triggering a glacial outburst flood and prompting evacuation advisories for some residents of Juneau. The National Weather Service issued a flood warning as water from the ice-dammed Suicide Basin flows into the Mendenhall River, with water levels expected to reach record highs. This annual event has become increasingly severe in recent years, previously causing significant property damage and destroying homes along the riverbank.</p>

The new law requires law enforcement agencies to review an applicant's complete employment and disciplinary records before making a job offer, aiming to prevent officers with problematic histories from being rehired.</p>

          <p>An opinion article from The Atlantic argues that a key aspect of Donald Trump's political strategy is compelling his opponents to choose between undesirable options, thereby eroding democratic norms regardless of their decision. The article cites examples such as Democrats considering gerrymandering to counter Republican efforts, and former aides disobeying presidential orders, to illustrate this dilemma. This dynamic creates a no-win situation where resisting Trump's actions can involve adopting similarly problematic tactics, ultimately challenging the principles his opponents seek to defend.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave fell by 11% in after-hours trading, even after the company announced second-quarter results and future guidance that exceeded analyst expectations. The company reported revenue of $1.21 billion, more than tripling year-over-year, but also posted a net loss of $290.5 million and noted that growth remains constrained by capacity as demand for its services outpaces supply. Despite the positive growth outlook and expansion with major clients, investors reacted negatively to the significant net loss. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities have reportedly instructed companies to avoid using Nvidia's H20 and certain AMD artificial intelligence chips, particularly for government and national security purposes. This development comes shortly after the U.S. government approved the export of these less-advanced chips to China. The move signals China's continued push for technological self-reliance and skepticism about the security of U.S. hardware, further complicating the landscape for American chipmakers in a key market.

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the increasing revenue generated from tariffs could make it more difficult for the Supreme Court to rule against the Trump administration's tariff policies. Speaking on Fox Business, Bessent referenced a case currently before the U.S. Court of Appeals that challenges the legality of the administration's "reciprocal" tariffs. His comment implies that the significant cash flow to the Treasury from these duties might influence any potential high court decision on the matter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England has officially entered its fourth heatwave of the summer, with temperatures exceeding 30°C for three consecutive days in multiple regions and a peak of 33.4°C recorded in London.

Amber heat health alerts are in effect for much of the country, and millions of people are now under hosepipe bans to conserve water.</p>
