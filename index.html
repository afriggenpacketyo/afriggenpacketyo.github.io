        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As college graduates transition into adulthood, financial experts emphasize the importance of starting retirement savings early to harness the power of compound interest. Setting up a consistent investing routine, even with small monthly contributions, can lead to significant long-term financial stability. Experts recommend investing in low-cost index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track broad market indexes for diversification. It is crucial to understand one's risk tolerance and avoid making impulsive decisions based on market volatility, focusing instead on the principle that time in the market is more beneficial than timing the market.

          <p>The Trump administration, through FEMA, has denied North Carolina's request for 100% federal cost-sharing for Hurricane Helene cleanup, reverting to the traditional 75%-federal, 25%-state model. This decision, a reversal of a Biden administration directive, will cost the state hundreds of millions of dollars, impacting funds available for small businesses and infrastructure repairs. The move comes as the Department of Homeland Security considers eliminating FEMA, with Secretary Kristi Noem criticizing the agency's effectiveness. An internal review also indicated that FEMA is unprepared for the upcoming hurricane season, citing staffing and coordination issues, while North Carolina is the second state to have a FEMA aid request denied.</p>

          <p>The United Nations has condemned Israel's new aid operation in southern Gaza, citing a chaotic start and violations of humanitarian principles. The Israeli initiative aims to bypass the UN and Hamas, but aid groups argue it is inadequate and politicized. The program involves Israeli soldiers securing aid sites, overseen by private U.S. contractors, a move criticized by the UN for replacing numerous distribution points with just four. European diplomats have also expressed concern, urging that aid not be politicized or militarized, as the Trump administration presses for a cease-fire in Gaza.</p>

Trump asserted that his tariff threats have spurred trade talks with the European Union, emphasizing that these actions are part of a negotiation strategy rather than a sign of weakness. Stocks initially fell following Trump's threat of tariffs on the EU, but rallied after he delayed the deadline, which Trump credits to jumpstarting trade talks between the U.S. and the EU.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has relaxed barriers for including cryptocurrency and related digital assets in 401(k) plans, rescinding guidance from the Biden era. The previous guidance cautioned employers about the risks of offering crypto investments, citing concerns about fraud and theft. This shift signals a more open approach to digital assets in retirement plans, though employers still have a fiduciary duty to act prudently.

          <p>President Donald Trump's executive orders on nuclear power could lead to the deployment of small modular reactors (SMRs) in the U.S. by late 2030, according to GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik. Trump's order directs the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to expedite decisions on new nuclear plant applications. Strazik believes this could result in approvals to begin building SMRs by 2027, potentially adding these reactors to the U.S. nuclear fleet in the early 2030s. GE Vernova recently received approval to deploy its BWRX-300 reactor in Ontario, Canada, and has an application pending with the NRC to build a reactor in Tennessee.</p>

The company plans to increase PHEVs from 2.4% of its U.S. sales volume to roughly 20% by 2030. This strategy aligns with the California Air Resources Board's Advanced Clean Cars II rule, which requires automakers to exclusively sell zero-emissions vehicles in the state by 2035. Toyota's focus on PHEVs provides a stepping stone for consumers hesitant to fully commit to electric vehicles while meeting emissions regulations.</p>
