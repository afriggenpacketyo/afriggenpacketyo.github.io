          <p>The article provides an overview of the current price of gold, noting it stands at $3,638.08 per ounce as of September 11, 2025, according to American Hartford Gold. It also discusses the various factors that influence gold prices, including supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation rates, interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies. Gold is traditionally seen as a safe-haven asset, especially during times of economic uncertainty, and as a hedge against inflation. The price of gold is subject to constant fluctuations due to a variety of factors, so it's important to monitor these changes when considering investing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that the suspect in the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk is in custody, citing information from someone close to the suspect who turned them in. The remarks were made shortly before authorities were scheduled to hold a news conference on the manhunt for the person who fatally shot Kirk at Utah Valley University. The FBI released photos and video footage of a person of interest fleeing the scene after the shooting. Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, was shot during an event at the university, prompting a widespread search for the perpetrator.</p>

          <p>After Polish and Dutch fighter jets shot down armed Russian drones over Poland, NATO leaders broadly condemned the Kremlin, but the response from the US President has been less definitive. Some analysts believe the drone incursion was a probe by the Kremlin to test Europe and the US response, potentially driving a wedge between the US and Europe. The incident has prompted discussions about strengthening NATO's air and missile defense capabilities, with calls for increased investment and the development of a drone wall. Several countries have offered concrete support to Poland, including fighter jets and anti-missile systems.</p>

          <p>A federal immigration raid at a South Korean battery plant construction site in Georgia has raised concerns about the project's future and the reasons behind the raid. Workplace safety issues, including three deaths in two years, may have contributed to the decision by Homeland Security Investigations to seek a search warrant. It is conceivable that the presence of undocumented workers might have contributed to workplace safety culture issues, if people were not free to make complaints to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration out of fear of deportation. The raid resulted in the detention of 475 people, including 320 Korean nationals.</p>

          <p>The increasing popularity of weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Zepbound is impacting the apparel retail market, with resale businesses seeing a surge in larger sizes being donated as people transition to smaller sizes. Retailers are reportedly putting fewer extended sizes on racks, offering them primarily online. While the shift is mainly within the larger size range, some brands are experiencing increased demand for smaller plus sizes. Some worry that the plus-size segment, which was already underserved, could be further neglected if retailers overreact to the weight-loss drug trend.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Ukrainian children remain in Russia after being taken from their homes in occupied territories. Russia denies abducting the children, claiming they were "rescued." The Ukrainian government has made the return of deported children a prerequisite for a possible ceasefire. Conflicting numbers of Ukrainian children make it difficult to verify the exact figures, as the Ukrainian government keeps the list confidential. Many of the children have been granted Russian citizenship and placed in foster families.</p>

The Duke of Sussex stated he wanted to do "everything possible" to help the recovery of injured military personnel. He is joined by a team from his Invictus Games Foundation, which he launched in 2014 for wounded veterans to compete in sports events. This visit comes after Archewell donated $500,000 to projects supporting injured children from Ukraine and Gaza.</p>

          <p>The UK economy experienced zero growth in July, following the biggest contraction in manufacturing output for a year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This follows a 0.4% expansion in June, but the ONS will now focus on growth over a rolling three-month period, which expanded by 0.2% to July. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to raise taxes in the upcoming Budget to meet self-imposed fiscal rules. The service sector grew, but this was offset by a fall in output from the production sector, including manufacturing.</p>

          <p>Terence Crawford will attempt to make history against Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez in Las Vegas, aiming to become the first male fighter to be undisputed champion in three weight divisions. The fight is driven by money, brokered by Saudi Arabia's Turki Alalshikh and UFC chief Dana White, with Alvarez earning a reported $150m. Crawford, though, remains focused on his legacy and cementing his place in history. The event is seen as a chance to showcase legitimate, high-stakes drama in boxing.</p>

          <p>The holiday shopping season is starting early due to consumers' concerns about inflation and tariffs. Retail sales are expected to rise, but at a slower pace compared to the previous year. E-commerce is projected to grow significantly, boosting overall holiday sales. Retailers are absorbing more of the impact of tariffs than expected, but this may not last forever. Consumers are nervous about higher prices, motivating them to shop earlier and take advantage of sales events.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are considering SB 53, a bill requiring transparency reports from developers of powerful AI models, focusing on catastrophic risks like AI-enabled biological weapons attacks. The bill aims to regulate AI before it outpaces oversight, requiring companies to develop safety frameworks and report critical safety incidents. SB 53 has faced opposition from industry organizations, but proponents argue it encourages a race to the top in AI safety. The bill reflects broader disagreements about state versus federal regulation of AI, and debates over what constitutes catastrophic risk.</p>
