          <p>The stock market experienced a sharp decline as President Trump renewed his criticism of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, calling him a "major loser" for not lowering interest rates. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all fell significantly as investors grappled with ongoing tariff uncertainty and awaited earnings reports from major tech companies. The dollar index slid to its lowest level since 2022, while gold reached a record high, signaling investor concerns about the safety of U.S. assets. This market volatility follows a week of uncertainty regarding the economic impact of tariffs and potential changes at the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A minke whale died from domoic acid poisoning associated with a toxic algal bloom off the coast of Southern California, marking the latest victim in a string of marine mammal deaths.

Domoic acid, a neurotoxin produced by the bloom, accumulates in fish consumed by these marine animals. Experts attribute the bloom to upwelling, climate change, and runoff from recent fires.</p>

The prosecution argued that Daybell and her brother used their religious beliefs to justify the murder, while Daybell claimed the shooting was a "tragic family event."

The case was brought by Korea’s Hanwha Qcells, Arizona-based First Solar Inc, and several smaller producers seeking to protect billions of dollars in investments in US solar manufacturing.

          <p>A federal court in Denver is hearing a case challenging the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport migrants, with rights groups arguing that the 24-hour notice given to those facing deportation is unreasonable. The ACLU and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network argue that migrants are not given sufficient opportunity to challenge their deportation orders. The administration contends that the act allows it to detain or deport noncitizens deemed "dangerous," particularly those linked to the gang Tren de Aragua.</p>

Defaults can negatively impact credit scores and future student aid, with some states even revoking driver’s licenses.
