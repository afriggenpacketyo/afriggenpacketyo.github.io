          <p>The article discusses the increasing strain on the US aviation system due to understaffing and high traffic, leading to a rise in near-misses and communication blackouts at airports. It highlights the "Swiss cheese" model of safety, where multiple layers of defense are necessary to prevent disasters, and warns that under-resourcing these systems can lead to catastrophic outcomes. The midair collision near Reagan National Airport earlier this year, which killed over 60 people, serves as a grim reminder of the consequences of neglecting safety measures. The author urges for near-misses to be taken seriously and for improvements to be made to prevent future disasters.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit engineers initiated a strike at 12:01 a.m. Friday due to disagreements over pay raises, causing a complete shutdown of rail service and Metro-North's west of Hudson service. The strike is expected to affect over 300,000 daily commuters, with the union citing stagnant wages for the past five years amid rising cost of living. NJ Transit has proposed contingency plans, including enhanced bus service on select routes, but warns it can only accommodate about 20% of daily train riders. The last NJ Transit strike occurred in 1983 and lasted three weeks, and both sides express hope for a swift resolution.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is reviewing the Trump administration's assertion of privilege to withhold details regarding the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to a prison in El Salvador. Abrego Garcia's lawyers accuse the government of obstructing court-ordered fact-finding after he was mistakenly deported despite having a legal status preventing his removal. The Justice Department claims attorney-client privilege, state secrets privilege, and certain executive privileges to protect information, particularly concerning arrangements with El Salvador's prison system. The administration maintains it is up to El Salvador to release Abrego Garcia, while his lawyers argue he is not a gang member and has never been charged with any crimes.</p>

          <p>A new report reveals that customer complaints against U.S. airlines surged to a record 66,675 in 2024, a 9% increase compared to a 4% rise in passenger volume. The U.S. PIRG Education Fund attributes this surge to issues like cancellations, delays, refunds, and mishandled luggage, with Frontier Airlines receiving the highest rate of complaints per passenger. The report also notes that airlines mishandled fewer bags and wheelchairs compared to the previous year, though millions of bags were still lost or damaged. Passengers are increasingly voicing concerns and seeing results due to consumer protections passed last year.</p>

          <p>The new German government is planning to suspend family reunification for refugees with subsidiary protection status for at least two years, primarily affecting Syrian families. This controversial move aims to curb immigration, citing integration challenges faced by cities and municipalities. While asylum seekers and recognized refugees have the right to family reunification, those with subsidiary protection do not, leading to long waiting lists and bureaucratic hurdles. Critics argue that family separation causes psychological strain and irregular immigration, while legal experts debate the compatibility of the suspension with German and EU law.</p>

          <p>The American healthcare system is criticized for its complexity and inaccessibility, particularly regarding new GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic. Many people struggle to access these medications due to high costs and insurance limitations, leading some to resort to compounded versions with uncertain quality and safety. While insurance may cover these drugs for those with co-occurring conditions, the process is complex and time-consuming. The author argues that the pharmaceutical industry charges too much, the FDA lacks oversight, and the health insurance industry creates barriers, leaving the public frustrated and angry.

          <p>As trade tensions between the US and China impact the global shipbuilding industry, South Korean shipyards might anticipate a boost in new orders, but strong competition from China remains a significant factor. Higher docking fees for vessels made in China, imposed by the US, could shift some orders to South Korea, according to an expert. However, despite a recent de-escalation in the tariff war, the US Trade Representative's decision to increase docking fees on Chinese-made vessels still stands, creating uncertainty for the shipbuilding industry.</p>

Experts advise that the only rule to follow is to ensure the house is tidy enough for guests to relax, emphasizing that connection and spending time with friends are more important than a spotless home. Personal standards are often shaped by past experiences and social media, which can create unrealistic expectations. It's better to focus on making the hangout space comfortable and to suspend judgment about others' living spaces.</p>
