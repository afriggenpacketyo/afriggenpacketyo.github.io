          <p>A powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake has struck off the coast of the Alaskan peninsula, centered near the town of Sand Point. The significant seismic event prompted the National Weather Service to issue an immediate tsunami warning for the region, advising residents in coastal areas to be on alert. Sand Point is located on Popof Island, approximately 600 miles southwest of Anchorage, placing a remote but populated area at potential risk. The situation is currently developing as authorities assess the immediate impact and potential for tsunami waves.</p>

          <p>In a medical first for the United Kingdom, doctors have confirmed the birth of eight babies using a pioneering technique involving DNA from three individuals. This method was developed to prevent the transmission of incurable mitochondrial diseases from mother to child, conditions which can cause severe disability or death. The procedure combines the parents' genetic material with healthy mitochondria from a female donor, resulting in a child that is over 99% genetically related to its parents. While the families remain anonymous, the breakthrough offers profound hope for those affected by these devastating hereditary conditions.</p>

          <p>The Texas Attorney General's office has launched an investigation into more than 100 individuals suspected of being noncitizens who allegedly cast around 200 illegal ballots in the 2020 and 2022 elections. The majority of the suspected instances occurred in Harris County, with investigations also underway in several other counties. This probe was reportedly facilitated by a Trump-era executive order that granted states access to a federal citizenship database from the Department of Homeland Security. Attorney General Ken Paxton has affirmed his commitment to prosecuting any confirmed cases of illegal voting to protect election integrity.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has dismissed the ongoing controversy surrounding the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, labeling it a "hoax" and a "scam" orchestrated by Democrats. In public statements and social media posts, he criticized his own Republican supporters for pursuing the issue, suggesting they have been duped by his political opponents. Despite pressure from within his party for greater transparency, Trump defended Attorney General Pam Bondi's handling of the case, stating that all credible information has been released. The president's comments have created a rift with some conservative allies who continue to demand the full release of all related files.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that it is "highly unlikely" he will fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, despite his continued public criticism of the central bank's policies. After reports emerged that Trump had discussed the possibility with Republican lawmakers, the president acknowledged the conversations but clarified he was not actively planning to remove Powell unless for reasons of fraud. Trump has frequently attacked Powell for not lowering interest rates more aggressively, recently calling him a "knucklehead." The remarks come amid concerns that political interference could undermine the Federal Reserve's independence and create financial market instability. (not investment advice)</p>

The comments were made as he signed the HALT Fentanyl Act into law, which strengthens regulations on fentanyl-related substances.

          <p>President Trump's strategy of labeling the Jeffrey Epstein affair a "hoax" and blaming Democrats represents a familiar political tactic, but this time it risks alienating some of his most loyal supporters. By also criticizing Republicans who are calling for transparency, he is creating a rare division within his own base. This approach challenges the image of authenticity that has been central to his political brand, as he now argues against conspiracy theories that many of his followers embrace. While most Republican officials remain publicly supportive, the strategy could have long-term consequences if it dampens enthusiasm among his core voters.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security stated the men were convicted of serious crimes and that their home countries had refused to accept them.

          <p>Andrea Gibson, the poet laureate of Colorado and a celebrated author, has died at the age of 49 after living with ovarian cancer. Gibson was known for their profound and accessible work, which often explored themes of love, kindness, and social justice with unselfconscious earnestness. After receiving a terminal diagnosis, Gibson famously chose to embrace life with joy rather than "battle" their illness, a perspective that deeply influenced their later work and public persona. Their poetry, known for its simple yet tender language and recurring imagery, connected deeply with a wide audience and left a legacy of finding generosity even in response to cruelty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canadian government has announced new restrictions on tariff-free steel imports to shield its domestic industry from the economic impact of U.S. tariffs. Prime Minister Mark Carney stated that Canada will tighten its tariff rate quotas, effectively halving the volume of steel that can be imported from certain countries before a 50% tariff is applied. The measures specifically target steel originating from China and aim to reduce Canada's dependency on the U.S. market by prioritizing the use of Canadian steel in major domestic projects. This move comes after the U.S. imposed steep tariffs on Canadian steel, causing a significant downturn in the nation's steel production. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant data breach by a UK official in 2022, which was kept secret by a court order for over a year, has been publicly revealed. The breach involved a spreadsheet containing the personal details of almost 19,000 Afghans who had applied for relocation to the UK to flee the Taliban. The leak was discovered in 2023, prompting the government to secretly create a new relocation route for those affected, with about 4,500 people and their family members having been moved so far. The revelation has raised serious questions about government transparency, the safety of those still in Afghanistan, and the total cost of the response, estimated at £850 million.</p>

          <p>Columbia University has formally adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA) definition of antisemitism into its anti-discrimination policies. This move is part of a broader effort to reach an agreement with the Trump administration to restore $400 million in frozen federal grants. The funding was withheld over allegations that the university failed to protect Jewish students during pro-Palestinian campus protests. While the university says the step strengthens its commitment to combating antisemitism, critics argue the IHRA definition is controversial as it can be used to stifle legitimate criticism of the state of Israel.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent uptick in inflation is raising concerns that the Federal Reserve may keep interest rates elevated, which would in turn impact the cost of carrying credit card debt. Most credit cards have variable rates tied to the Fed's benchmark rate, so when the central bank maintains high rates to control inflation, credit card APRs follow suit. With the average card rate already exceeding 21%, any further persistence in inflation could mean that borrowing costs will remain high or even increase. For consumers with outstanding balances, this translates to higher interest charges, making it more difficult to pay down their debt. (not investment advice)</p>

Officials state the transfers are legal and comply with local and state sanctuary policies because they were executed in response to federal judicial warrants, mostly for the crime of illegal reentry after deportation.

The southern states justify their fixed schedule based on the timing of traditional Pentecost holidays. However, other state education ministers are now calling the rigid system unfair and are pushing for the two states to join the rotating schedule that the rest of the country follows to ease travel congestion.</p>
