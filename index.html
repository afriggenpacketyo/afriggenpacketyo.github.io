        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Defense attorneys for Luigi Mangione, accused of murdering UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, are seeking to dismiss the state murder indictment, citing double jeopardy and constitutional rights violations due to concurrent state and federal prosecutions. The attorneys argue that the "prosecutorial one-upmanship" has Mangione facing charges in multiple jurisdictions, infringing on his right to a fair trial. They are also contesting the terrorism upgrade to the charges, asserting a lack of evidence showing intent to intimidate a civilian population or influence government policy. Additionally, Mangione's legal team is attempting to suppress statements he made to authorities in Pennsylvania, claiming he was not properly informed of his Miranda rights during his arrest.

          <p>The Mississippi Supreme Court has scheduled the execution of Richard Gerald Jordan, the state's longest-serving death row inmate, for June 25. Jordan, 78, was sentenced to death in 1976 for kidnapping and killing Edwina Marter, and has had multiple appeals denied. The court order did not specify the method of execution, which Mississippi law allows to be carried out via lethal injection, nitrogen gas, electrocution, or firing squad. The case stems from Jordan's kidnapping of Edwina Marter in January 1976, where he fatally shot her and demanded ransom from her husband. Mississippi's last execution occurred in December 2022.</p>

          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs has rejected a plea deal in his sexual assault and racketeering case in New York City, with jury selection set to begin next week. Combs, who has pleaded not guilty to five counts, including transportation to engage in prostitution and sex trafficking, faces decades in prison if convicted. During the pre-trial hearing, the defense team raised concerns about the conduct of an alleged victim's attorney, and the judge reminded all parties to adhere to professional conduct rules.

          <p>BBC Verify has tracked a people smuggler named Fadi Gujjar, who falsely promised safe and legal routes to Europe, leading to the deaths of approximately 50 migrants at sea. Gujjar, operating from Mauritania, charged migrants an average of $13,000 for a perilous boat journey to the Canary Islands. Survivors reported being placed in unsafe conditions, starved, and beaten by the crew during the two-week ordeal.

          <p>Health Secretary Wes Streeting is facing criticism after his department watered down funding levels for maternity safety improvements. Campaigners argue that the decision is a betrayal, as only £2m of the previously allocated £95m is now guaranteed for maternity care this year. The remaining funds will be distributed to Integrated Care Boards, leading to fears that maternity budgets will be cut. The Royal College of Midwives has described the funding decision as taking "a wrecking ball" to maternity safety, emphasizing the potential for disastrous consequences.</p>

          <p>President Trump is closing a duty-free loophole for low-value packages, potentially increasing prices for US customers of online retailers like Shein and Temu. The "de minimis" exemption, which applied to parcels worth less than $800, allowed these companies to ship goods directly to the US without paying duties or import taxes. The Trump administration aims to tackle the illegal importation of synthetic opioids like fentanyl, which are often concealed in low-value packages. The move is in line with Trump's policies of cracking down on goods from China, and consumers may see prices rising as a result.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is getting his first salary increase in a decade, with his base salary rising to $1.5 million, a 49% increase from 2024. His variable cash also went up by $1 million, or 50%, from the 2024 fiscal year. Stock awards grew to $38.8 million, bringing total pay to $49.9 million. The compensation committee noted that the increase was appropriate given internal pay equity and Huang's leadership during Nvidia's boom, driven by its GPUs powering AI models.

          <p>Los Angeles County prosecutors are implementing a new policy to expedite the filing of felony charges in sex crime and family violence cases, prompted by a report that a backlog in the district attorney's office may have contributed to the sexual assault and death of a 13-year-old boy. The policy mandates that the process to file a criminal complaint begin within one business day of a decision to seek an arrest warrant. The announcement comes after the death of Oscar Omar Hernandez, allegedly killed by a soccer coach against whom charges had been delayed due to a backlog of cases.</p>

          <p>Apple's second-quarter financials surpassed Wall Street expectations, with revenue of $95.4bn and earnings-per-share of $1.65. However, CEO Tim Cook anticipates $900m in costs for the upcoming quarter due to tariffs. Despite this, Cook remained positive, highlighting the company's strong quarterly results. Apple is heavily reliant on Chinese manufacturing, but is shifting production to India and Vietnam to mitigate tariff impacts. The company's stock dropped in after-hours trading, likely due to the tariff news and missed expectations for its services division revenue.</p>

          <p>With Australia heading to a federal election, the shadow of President Trump's policies and unpredictability are impacting the campaign. While candidates prefer to focus on domestic issues, they are forced to address Australia's relationship with a potentially unreliable US president. Australia relies on its alliance with the US for defense and security in the face of China's growing influence. A recent poll indicated that 60% of Australians believe Trump's victory would be detrimental to the country, influencing the election dynamics and forcing leaders to re-examine Australia's ties with the US.</p>

          <p>The New York Times editorial board argues that President Trump's first 100 days in office have damaged American democracy more than anything since the end of Reconstruction. The board asserts that Trump is attempting to create a presidency unconstrained by Congress or the courts, which is an autocratic approach that the nation's founders sought to prevent. The editorial highlights Trump's attacks on the separation of powers, due process, equal justice under law, free speech, and government for the people. The board calls for a broad coalition of Americans to oppose Trump's undemocratic actions while acknowledging his legitimacy and legal actions.</p>
