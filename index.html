Iranian state media indicated that Hossein Salami, commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), was killed in a strike. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz declared a state of emergency, warning of potential missile and drone attacks against Israel, while Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated the operation would continue until the threat is removed.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked President Donald Trump's deployment of California National Guard troops to address protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles, citing the move as "illegal." The judge, Charles Breyer, ordered the Trump administration to return control of the National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom, asserting that Trump exceeded his statutory authority and violated the Tenth Amendment. Newsom expressed gratification with the ruling, stating the National Guard would be redeployed to border security, counter-drug enforcement, and forest management, reversing Trump's changes. The judge emphasized protesters' First Amendment rights and found the protests did not meet the legal requirements of a "rebellion."</p>

The outer walls of the building were defaced with graffiti threatening federal immigration officials. Collins criticized the state and city's response, accusing them of prioritizing opposition to President Trump over protecting Angelenos victimized by rioters.

Newsom hailed the court's decision as a victory for all Americans, asserting that Trump's actions threatened democracy and approached authoritarianism.

          <p>Research conducted by archaeologists from Chinese and US institutes suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago. The team analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region and found evidence that pigs were consuming humans' cooked foods and waste. These findings indicate that the domestication of Sus scrofa, the wild boar, occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient Chinese society. This challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East.</p>

          <p>Patrick Reed carded an albatross, one of golf's rarest scores, during the first round of the US Open. Reed hit a 3-wood from 286 yards on the par-5 fourth hole, resulting in a double-eagle. This marks only the fourth albatross at the US Open since record-keeping began in 1983. Despite the exceptional score, Reed finished the round at 3-over 73, concluding with a triple bogey on the final hole. This remarkable feat places him in the company of only a few golfers who have achieved this rare score in US Open history.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem affirmed that the Trump administration will persist in its crackdown on immigrants and those protesting on their behalf in Los Angeles. Noem stated that immigration agents are preparing to round up "literally tens of thousands of targets" in the city. Governor Gavin Newsom warned that the administration's actions are authoritarian, not law enforcement. Senator Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from Noem's press conference after confronting her, leading to calls for protests and accountability. Large anti-Trump demonstrations are planned in Los Angeles and other cities.</p>

          <p>Official campaigning for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election has commenced, serving as a prelude to the upcoming House of Councillors race. With no party holding a majority in the 127-member assembly, the focus is on whether Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) can maintain its seats amid low approval ratings. Parties are utilizing social media to appeal to voters, especially unaffiliated individuals. Major issues include support for households facing rising living costs, political funding scandals involving the LDP, child-rearing, and measures against heat.

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are pursuing overseas expansion to ensure their long-term survival amid ongoing trade tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Despite a temporary truce, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the U.S. remain subject to tariffs of up to 3,521%. Companies are diversifying their production bases, with a shift towards the Middle East and Africa for planned overseas capacity expansion. Localizing production abroad is seen as essential for navigating trade tensions and sustaining competitiveness in the global market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Approximately 45,000 grocery workers at Ralphs, Albertsons, Vons, and Pavilions stores in Southern California have authorized a strike to protest alleged unfair labor practices. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) locals representing the workers announced that members voted overwhelmingly in favor of authorizing a strike. The vote comes after months of contract negotiations between the union and the grocery chain companies, with the workers' contracts expiring in March. The main sticking points in the talks include staffing levels and alleged union-busting tactics by the companies. Negotiations are scheduled to resume on June 25.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has directed the US government to consolidate its wildland firefighting force into a single program, despite warnings that it could be costly and increase the risk of catastrophic blazes. The order aims to centralize firefighting efforts currently split among multiple agencies and departments. The proposed budget calls for a new Federal Wildland Fire Service under the Interior Department, shifting personnel from the Forest Service. The order cites the Los Angeles wildfires as highlighting the need for a quicker response. Critics argue that restructuring could increase the likelihood of large catastrophic fires.</p>

          <p>Douglas McCarthy, the singer of the pioneering U.K. proto-industrial band Nitzer Ebb, has died at the age of 58; the band confirmed the news on social media but did not list a cause of death. McCarthy founded Nitzer Ebb in Essex with David Gooday and Bon Harris, releasing their first single in 1985. The band's harsh and antagonistic style, known as EBM (electronic body music), influenced the industrial wave and anticipated acts like Nine Inch Nails and Rammstein. McCarthy faced health issues late in life, including liver cirrhosis, and had to drop off a 2024 European tour.</p>
