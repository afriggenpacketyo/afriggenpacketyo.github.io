          <p>An Iowa family experienced a rare wildlife encounter when they spotted two deer with white fur while driving home. It was unclear whether the animals were albino or piebald deer, the latter being more common, occurring in less than 1% of the population. Piebald deer are known for having varying amounts of white fur, while true albino deer have pink eyes and totally white hair. The family, who recently moved from Arizona, were excited by the sighting, as they enjoy seeing animals not typically found on the beaten trail.</p>

          <p>Senator Ted Cruz cautioned that President Trump's tariffs could lead to a Republican "bloodbath" in the 2026 midterm elections if they trigger a recession. Cruz expressed concern over potential trade wars and their negative impact on the U.S. economy, emphasizing the risk of job losses and economic damage. While he wants the administration to succeed, Cruz believes success means lower tariffs abroad and at home, ultimately benefiting American workers and businesses. He supports bipartisan legislation giving Congress more power over tariffs.</p>

          <p>Economic experts are questioning the accuracy of President Trump's formula for calculating tariffs, arguing that it misrepresents global trade economics. Trump claims the tariffs are "reciprocal," but the calculations are based on dividing the trade deficit of each nation by the value of its imports, which experts say doesn't align with modern definitions of trade deficits. Critics argue that the formula is unlikely to achieve the administration's goals and could lead to trade wars.</p>

          <p>Research suggests that "dead" investors, who follow a buy-and-hold strategy, often outperform active traders. Active trading can lead to higher costs, taxes, and emotional decision-making, which negatively impacts returns.
