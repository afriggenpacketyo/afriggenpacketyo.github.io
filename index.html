          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Iran is tentatively holding, leading to cautious optimism in Israel, although uncertainty remains regarding Iran's nuclear ambitions. Despite conflicting reports on the extent of the damage inflicted on Iran's nuclear program, Iran has threatened to accelerate its enrichment work without oversight from the IAEA. The ceasefire has allowed life in Israel to return to some normalcy, with the lifting of wartime restrictions and reopening of Ben Gurion International Airport. The Israeli military plans to shift its focus to Gaza, while some hope diplomacy can revive talks to end the conflict and secure the release of Israeli hostages.</p>

          <p>This article addresses the claim that NATO expansion drove Russia to war in Ukraine, a justification often used by the Kremlin. While Putin has expressed concerns about NATO's eastward expansion since 2000, NATO insists it is a defensive alliance. The article examines whether NATO promised not to expand eastward following German reunification, considering statements from Western leaders and Gorbachev's perspective. Despite differing interpretations, the article concludes that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is incontrovertibly wrong, regardless of any past assurances.</p>

          <p>Republicans in Congress are on the verge of passing significant Medicaid cuts as part of a budget bill that could lead to millions of Americans losing health insurance. The legislation would cut Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years, resulting in 10.3 million fewer people enrolled in the program by 2034. Analysis suggests these coverage losses could lead to thousands of additional annual deaths and reduced access to preventive care. The bill includes new work requirements and limits on state financing tools, potentially worsening health outcomes for low-income individuals.</p>
