          <p>Aircraft leasing company Air Lease has agreed to be acquired for $7.4 billion by a group of investors including Japan's Sumitomo and SMBC Aviation Capital, taking the company private.

This move comes as lessors benefit from a shortage of new aircraft that has driven rental rates to record highs, making it a strategic time for large-scale acquisitions to increase market share.</p>

          <p>In a landmark antitrust ruling, a federal judge has decided that Google will not be forced to sell its Chrome browser but will be barred from entering into exclusive contracts to be the default search engine. This decision is a partial victory for Google, which avoids the most severe penalty proposed by the Department of Justice. However, the ruling imposes significant restrictions on its business practices, including its multi-billion dollar arrangement with Apple to be the default search provider on iPhones.</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old boy in Houston was shot and killed after he and his cousin played a "ding-dong ditch" prank on a neighbor's house. Police allege the suspect, 42-year-old Gonzalo Leon Jr., was a former Army veteran who was "waiting in the shadows" and followed the children as they ran away before opening fire. The child, Julian Guzman, was reportedly recording the prank on his phone when the shots were fired, capturing his own final moments.</p>

          <p>President Trump has officially announced his decision to relocate the headquarters of U.S. Space Command from Colorado Springs, Colorado, to Huntsville, Alabama. This action reverses a Biden administration decision to keep the headquarters in Colorado and fulfills a plan Trump had initiated during his first term. The president framed the decision as beneficial for national security and the Alabama economy, while also alluding to the political dynamics of moving the strategic base from a Democratic-leaning state to a reliably Republican one.</p>

          <p>The parent company of popular beer brands Modelo and Corona, Constellation Brands, has significantly cut its full-year financial guidance, causing its stock to fall sharply. The company cited a challenging macroeconomic environment and weakening sales as primary reasons for the downgrade. Executives specifically pointed to a more pronounced decline in purchasing from Hispanic consumers, a key demographic, which they have previously attributed to community concerns over the administration's immigration policies and potential job losses.

          <p>An article in The Economist presents an analysis suggesting that despite the national focus on gun crime, Chicago is on track for its lowest murder rate in over a decade. The report also notes that robberies have fallen by a third compared to the previous year. It argues that violence is highly concentrated in specific neighborhoods, leaving tourist areas largely safe, and posits that visitors may be more likely to encounter non-violent crimes than the gun violence that dominates headlines and political rhetoric.</p>
