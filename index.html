          <p>Jurors have started deliberating in the sex trafficking and racketeering trial of music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, who faces life in prison if convicted. The seven-week trial featured graphic testimony from 34 witnesses, including ex-girlfriends, and video evidence of assault. Prosecutors argued Combs used his power and wealth to coerce victims, while his defense claimed the encounters were consensual and the accusations were financially motivated. Combs did not testify in his own defense.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation reveals that a decade after coercive or controlling behavior became a crime in England and Wales, police responses remain inconsistent and often inadequate. Victims report having to gather their own evidence, feeling "spoon-fed" information to unresponsive officers, leading to a lack of justice and lost lives. The report highlights significant disparities in how different police forces log the crime and a failure by many to adopt updated risk-assessment tools, prompting calls for radical change.</p>

          <p>An analytical article in The Atlantic argues that liberal advocacy groups like the ACLU are making strategic errors by bringing high-risk cases to a hostile Supreme Court. The piece contends that by challenging laws on issues like transgender rights and LGBTQ-inclusive school curricula, progressives are handing the conservative majority opportunities to create unfavorable precedents that harm their causes nationwide. Instead of relying on a court-centric approach, the author suggests that progressive movements should focus on building public support and pursuing change through democratic and political channels where they have a greater chance of success.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly preparing to sign an executive order to ease economic sanctions on Syria, following a promise made during a trip to the Middle East in May. This move comes after the collapse of the Assad regime and the establishment of a transitional government, which has been advocating for sanctions relief to rebuild the war-torn country. The Treasury Department has already issued guidance to roll back some restrictions to encourage new investment, a policy supported by U.S. allies Turkey and Saudi Arabia, who are looking to normalize relations with Syria's new leadership.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Wimbledon Championships began with its hottest opening day on record, with air temperatures reaching 31.4C (88.5F). Players, staff, and spectators contended with the sweltering conditions, utilizing ice packs, cold towels, and cooling scarves to stay cool. While the extreme heat prompted health warnings, the tournament's official heat rule, which allows for a 10-minute break, was not implemented as it depends on a broader index including humidity and surface temperature. The hot weather is forecast to continue, with one player, Ons Jabeur, having to retire from her match after feeling unwell.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic examines the growing conservative idea that empathy is a "fundamental weakness" of Western civilization, a sentiment popularized by figures like Elon Musk and Ben Shapiro. This worldview suggests that emotional responses, particularly to suffering, lead to irrational, liberal-leaning political decisions. The analysis posits that this "anti-empathy" stance may serve as a coping mechanism for conservatives to reconcile their political positions with distressing outcomes, such as harsh immigration policies.

          <p>The belief in the Illuminati, a secret society thought to control world events, remains one of the most persistent conspiracy theories, finding new life on social media platforms like TikTok. While the modern theory is largely fiction, a real group called the Order of the Illuminati was founded in Bavaria in 1776 by professor Adam Weishaupt. This Enlightenment-era society aimed to challenge the power of the monarchy and church but was outlawed and disbanded by 1785. The article traces how the myth of the group's continued existence evolved, from 18th-century anti-revolutionary panic to 1960s counter-culture and the internet age.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 10:50:34 EDT</div>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from a group of Los Angeles landlords who sought financial compensation from the city for its COVID-19 eviction moratorium. The landlords argued that the ban, which prevented them from removing non-paying tenants, constituted an unconstitutional taking of their private property without just compensation. By declining to hear the case, the justices left in place a lower court ruling that dismissed the lawsuit, citing long-standing precedents that allow for government regulation of property, including rent control laws. Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch dissented.</p>

          <h2>Lending Experts Explain Differences Between HELOC and Home Equity Loan Rates for July</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 10:48:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners looking to tap into their home's equity currently find favorable rates on both home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). Experts note that while both products have similar rates at present, they function differently. HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the Federal Reserve's actions, making them unpredictable but potentially beneficial if rates fall later this year. In contrast, home equity loans usually have fixed rates, offering stability and predictability, with their rates behaving more like traditional mortgages tied to the bond market.
