          <p>UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has authorized Royal Mail to cease second-class letter deliveries on Saturdays as a cost-cutting measure. This reform to the Universal Service Obligation is a response to declining letter volumes and rising operational costs. While second-class delivery targets are being slightly relaxed, Royal Mail must continue its six-day-a-week service for first-class mail. The changes aim to ensure the financial sustainability of the postal service while introducing new targets to minimize significant delivery delays for all mail types.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's state visit to the United Kingdom, intended to strengthen Franco-British relations, is being dominated by concerns over potential US trade tariffs. While the visit features significant diplomatic pomp, discussions between Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer are heavily focused on forming a united front against Washington's unpredictable trade policies. The uncertainty surrounding new tariffs on the European Union is creating economic anxiety, making transatlantic trade a more pressing issue than bilateral matters like migration or defense.</p>

          <p>Thirty-one construction workers were successfully rescued without any visible injuries after a tunnel collapsed in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred at the site of the Clearwater Project, a new seven-mile-long wastewater outfall tunnel. The workers were able to navigate over a large pile of debris to a safe area before being evacuated. A massive response from the Los Angeles Fire Department, including Urban Search and Rescue teams, facilitated the complex rescue operation from deep underground.</p>

          <p>Former US Secretary of State John Kerry stated that the Democratic Party made a strategic error by not addressing border security more forcefully, allowing the US-Mexico border to be "under siege" during the Biden administration. In an interview with the BBC, Kerry remarked that Donald Trump was "right" about the need for a secure border, a position he believes his own party should have embraced more openly. His comments highlight an internal Democratic debate over immigration policy as the Trump administration continues its nationwide efforts to detain and deport undocumented migrants.</p>

          <p>The market for weight-loss medication in China is rapidly expanding, mirroring a trend seen in Western countries and now estimated to be worth around US$150 billion. This growth is fueled by the approval of new, more effective drugs and rising obesity rates. Innovent Biologics, a domestic firm, was the first to receive approval to market its weight-loss drug within the country. The article notes that dozens of other producers are now vying for a share of this lucrative and nascent pharmaceutical sector in China.</p>

          <p>Vienna is frequently cited as a "renters' utopia" due to its successful housing policies, which are anchored by a large and stable social housing sector. This sector comprises about 43% of the city's housing units and serves a wide range of income levels, keeping rent significantly lower than in the private market and helping to moderate private rents as well. Originating in the 1920s, the system is funded by a levy on employee salaries and has resisted the large-scale privatization seen in other European cities. While access can be complex, the model demonstrates how long-term political commitment can prioritize housing as a basic need.</p>

Weighing only 74 milligrams, the device is attached to the bee's back and uses three needles to send electronic pulses into its brain. These pulses create illusions that effectively command the bee's flight, directing it to turn, advance, or retreat. In tests, the cyborg bee reportedly obeyed the remote commands with 90% accuracy.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat persistent youth unemployment, the Chinese government has announced a new one-off subsidy for companies that hire unemployed individuals aged 16 to 24. Employers who provide formal contracts and pay social insurance contributions can receive up to 1,500 yuan per new hire. This measure is part of a broader push to stabilize the labor market amid sluggish economic growth and intense domestic competition. The government is also expanding its "work-for-relief" program, which funds labor-intensive public works projects to create jobs for vulnerable groups.</p>

          <p>The Chinese embassy in South Africa has issued a warning to its citizens about an increased risk of kidnapping, particularly for women. The alert follows multiple recent incidents and a fatal home invasion, highlighting a growing threat to the personal and property safety of Chinese nationals in the country.

The lawsuit argues that California's rules, which mandate more space for chickens and apply to out-of-state producers selling in California, unlawfully interfere with federal authority over egg safety standards.

The Iran-backed group claimed it attacked the ship for heading to Israel and stated it took some crew members to a "safe location."

In Ruidoso, New Mexico, a deadly flood killed three people, but the community was reportedly prepared due to awareness of risks from recent wildfire "burn scars," allowing for a rapid return to normalcy. In contrast, a flood in Texas just days earlier caught officials by surprise, leading to a much higher death toll of at least 119 people. The piece suggests that recent, direct experience with a specific weather risk significantly informs a community's preparedness and response.</p>
