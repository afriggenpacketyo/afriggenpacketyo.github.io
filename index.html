          <p>Microsoft is set to lay off about 6,000 employees, which constitutes 3% of its global workforce, spanning across various levels, teams, and locations as stated in the article. The company cites organizational changes as the reason, intending to streamline operations and improve efficiency in a dynamic marketplace. Despite reporting better-than-expected financial results recently, Microsoft aims to reduce management layers to facilitate quicker decision-making. This move follows a previous reduction of 10,000 roles in 2023, marking it as a significant restructuring effort to optimize the company's structure.</p>

          <p>Representative Shri Thanedar, a Democrat from Michigan, has introduced a privileged impeachment resolution against President Donald Trump, compelling the House to consider the legislation within two days of session. House GOP leaders are likely to move to table the motion, which is a procedural vote to kill the bill without a vote on the bill itself. This action places vulnerable House Democrats in a challenging political position as they strive to regain the House majority in 2026. With Republicans unlikely to support the impeachment, the measure is expected to fail, underscoring the deep partisan divisions within the House.</p>

          <p>Vox reports that some voters who supported Donald Trump in the last election are now expressing regret, particularly among Black, Latino, and young demographics. These voters, who were initially drawn to Trump's promises on the economy, inflation, and immigration, feel betrayed by what they perceive as a failure to deliver on those promises. The article highlights interviews with voters in Philadelphia who express frustration with rising costs and a sense that the economy is worsening under Trump's presidency. While these voters are turning away from Trump, they are not necessarily shifting their support back to the Democratic Party, indicating a broader disillusionment with the political system.</p>

These changes reflect Carney's commitment to delivering change and addressing the economic challenges facing Canada. The reshuffle follows Carney's recent meeting with Trump, where they discussed the possibility of negotiating a new trade deal.</p>

          <p>Three key House committees are currently debating a major budget package aimed at addressing President Trump's priorities in defense, energy, and taxes, with Republican leaders aiming for a floor vote next week as detailed in the article. The committees are discussing proposals that include changes to Medicaid and food stamps to help fund tax cuts, but significant divisions remain among Republicans regarding Medicaid overhauls and expiring tax deductions. The changes to Medicaid include imposing work requirements, more frequent eligibility checks, and cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid for undocumented immigrants. House leaders face a tight deadline to resolve these differences before sending the package to the Senate.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez returned to court for a resentencing hearing to determine if they should be eligible for parole after serving nearly three decades for the murder of their parents, according to the article. Defense attorneys argue the brothers killed their parents in self-defense after years of sexual assault, while prosecutors maintain they sought their inheritance and were not abused. The hearing will focus on whether the brothers have been rehabilitated and deserve a lesser sentence, which would make them eligible for parole under California's youthful offender law. The current district attorney opposes resentencing, arguing the brothers have not taken full responsibility for the crime.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are advancing key components of their bill to fund President Trump's agenda, including tax and Medicaid cuts, despite internal divisions over critical issues, the article reports. Democratic members plan to challenge the proposals, while Republicans face a conservative revolt over the scale of the Medicaid cuts. The plan includes work requirements for Medicaid recipients, more frequent eligibility checks, and penalties for states that offer Medicaid to illegal immigrants. Trump has repeatedly promised not to cut Medicaid, but Republicans aim to find savings by cutting waste and fraud in the program.</p>
