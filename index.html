          <p>Dr. Céline Gounder expressed concern over a leadership vacuum at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention following the ouster of its director and other key officials. She warned that this turmoil directly impacts public health, particularly vaccine policy, which is now being dictated by political interests rather than a transparent scientific process. Gounder highlighted upcoming meetings that could restrict eligibility for crucial vaccines, including those for COVID-19 and common childhood diseases, leading to widespread confusion and potential public health risks.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys icon Michael Irvin voiced strong disapproval of the team's decision to trade star pass rusher Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers. The trade, which sent Parsons to Green Bay for two first-round picks and Kenny Clark, followed a breakdown in contract negotiations. Irvin described the move as a "crazy, dumb move" and speculated that a personal issue must have prompted owner Jerry Jones to make such a gamble. Parsons, who had requested a trade, expressed that the preceding months had been the most difficult of his life.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export agreement, a £10 billion deal to supply Norway with at least five Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence stated the deal will support approximately 4,000 UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates. The deal was seen as a major victory for the British defence industry over competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to widespread anti-government protests, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto announced that political parties have agreed to cut some state-funded perks for politicians. The demonstrations, which have turned violent in several cities, were partly fueled by public anger over a new monthly allowance for lawmakers that is nearly ten times the minimum wage in Jakarta. The unrest escalated following the death of a ride-sharing driver during a protest, leading to accusations of excessive police force. The government's concessions are an attempt to quell the dissent.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced that Abu Obeida, the prominent spokesman for Hamas's armed wing, was killed in an airstrike in Gaza City. Israel's Defence Minister confirmed the operation, stating it was based on intelligence that identified Obeida's hiding place in an apartment building. Obeida was a highly visible figure who disseminated Hamas's propaganda and had become an idol to the group's supporters. Hamas has not yet confirmed his death, and the strike occurred as Israel prepares for a broader offensive into Gaza City.</p>

          <p>Germany is set to resume admitting vulnerable Afghans after a months-long pause, but many applicants who fled to Pakistan are now living in fear of deportation. These individuals, who previously worked for German organizations, have been waiting for years for their visas while facing constant police raids in Islamabad. With a temporary pause on deportations from Pakistan expiring, over a million people could be affected. Human rights organizations are pressuring the German government to expedite the process, as a return to Afghanistan could mean persecution or death for many.</p>

          <p>Peter Navarro, a trade adviser to President Donald Trump, condemned a federal appeals court decision that ruled most of the administration's sweeping tariffs are illegal. Navarro stated that if the Supreme Court ultimately blocks the tariffs, "it will be the end of the United States," echoing the president's own strong rhetoric. The court found that Trump overstepped his authority by using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to justify the duties. The administration plans to appeal the ruling, which, if upheld, would significantly reduce the scope of goods affected by the tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A report highlights the growing crisis of indoor heat deaths in Arizona, where residents, particularly the elderly and low-income, are succumbing to extreme temperatures inside their own homes. The article details cases like that of Richard Chamblee, a 52-year-old man who died just two days after his home's air conditioning failed during a 115°F heatwave. Many victims had AC units that were broken or had their electricity disconnected because they could not afford the bills. Experts warn that as climate change intensifies heatwaves, these preventable deaths could surge.</p>

          <p>Austrian company FlyNow Aviation has successfully completed the first untethered flight of its eCopter, a personal electric helicopter designed for urban air mobility. The company aims to make this form of travel accessible to everyone, rather than operating as an exclusive air taxi service. This development is a step toward more sustainable aviation, as air travel is a significant contributor to global carbon pollution. FlyNow plans to begin commercial cargo operations by 2027, with passenger flights potentially following after extensive further testing and refinement of the technology.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's efforts to influence the Federal Reserve, including the attempted removal of Governor Lisa Cook, are raising concerns about the central bank's long-held political independence. A successful move to install a board majority loyal to the president could grant him significant control over the nation's financial infrastructure, including interest rates and banking regulations. While the administration frames its actions as reform, critics warn that politicizing the Fed could undermine the U.S. economy and risk the kind of hyperinflation seen in countries where dictators control monetary policy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have resolved a long-standing debate in biology by identifying the comb jelly as the first animal to diverge from the common ancestor of all animals. For years, scientists debated whether the first split was the sea sponge or the comb jelly. Using a new technique analyzing the arrangement of genes on chromosomes, scientists compared these animals to their closest non-animal relatives. The results showed that the comb jelly's genetic structure had changed the least from the original ancestor, indicating it was the first to branch off on the tree of life.</p>

          <p>The recent release of transcripts from Ghislaine Maxwell's interview with the Justice Department has drawn criticism for what many see as a failure to press her for more information. During the interview, Maxwell hinted that associates of Jeffrey Epstein were serving in President Trump's cabinet, but she was not asked to name them. Critics and attorneys for Epstein's survivors argue that the interview was superficial and that key figures have not been properly questioned. This has led to accusations that the disclosures are more for show than a genuine effort to uncover the full extent of Epstein's network.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, is shedding light on the origins of surfing in the United States. In 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes demonstrated the sport at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River while attending a nearby military school. They crafted boards from local redwood trees and impressed locals with what was then called "surfboard swimming." This event is now recognized as the moment the royal sport of Hawaii was introduced to the American mainland, 140 years ago, providing a key piece of cultural history.</p>
