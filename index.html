          <h2>Study Finds German Media Overrepresents Foreign Suspects in Crime Reporting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-18 12:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Macromedia University reveals a significant bias in German media, where foreign crime suspects are mentioned about three times more often than their actual share in police statistics. This disparity, which journalism professor Thomas Hestermann calls a "drastic distortion," has sharply increased since 2015. The research indicates that this skewed reporting influences public perception of danger and inadvertently aligns with right-wing populist narratives, regardless of the media outlet's political leaning. Criminologists argue that crime is linked to socioeconomic factors like poverty and lack of opportunity, not nationality, and suggest that greater diversity in newsrooms could help correct this imbalance.</p>

          <p>In Austin, Texas, Christophe Waggoner is combating the rising cost of Halloween costumes by creating and donating them to families in need. For nine years, he has frequented thrift stores to find materials he can wash, repair, and redesign into unique outfits for children. With the average costume price increasing by 11% this year, Waggoner's efforts ensure that children can experience the joy of Halloween regardless of their family's financial situation. He spends over $5,000 of his own money annually on this project, driven by the belief that every child deserves a chance to be a kid and that his work inspires a cycle of giving.</p>

          <p>Thousands have gathered in New York City's Times Square, marking the start of over 2,500 nationwide rallies organized by the "No Kings" coalition to protest what they term President Trump's "authoritarianism." Organizers, who drew over five million people to similar events in June, aim to challenge the president's perceived absolute rule. In response, Republican governors in states like Texas and Virginia have placed the National Guard on standby, with some allies labeling the demonstrations as far-left and anti-American. The protests are expected to feature prominent speakers like Senator Bernie Sanders in Washington D.C., while solidarity rallies are also taking place across Europe.</p>

          <h2>American Skier Jim Morrison Completes Historic First Descent of Mount Everest's North Face</h2>

          <p>American mountaineer Jim Morrison, 50, has made history by becoming the first person to ski down the North Face of Mount Everest via the treacherous Hornbein and Japanese Couloirs. He completed the 9,000-foot vertical drop in just over four hours, a feat previously unaccomplished due to the route's steep, icy conditions and high avalanche risk. Morrison dedicated the historic run to his late partner, famed mountaineer Hilaree Nelson, who died in a 2022 climbing accident in Nepal. After two previously failed attempts due to weather and permit issues, he successfully navigated what he described as a mix of "survival skiing and actual shredding" on the final day of his permit.</p>

          <p>Following Prince Andrew's decision to relinquish his Duke of York title and other honors, the brother of the late Virginia Giuffre is calling for King Charles to also strip him of his "prince" title. Sky Roberts stated that his sister, who accused the prince of sexual abuse and died by suicide earlier this year, would be proud of the recent developments. Prince Andrew settled a civil case with Ms. Giuffre in 2022 but has consistently denied the allegations of being involved in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking circle. Roberts emphasized the need for accountability for all individuals implicated in the scandal, expressing that the truth is finally emerging for survivors.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has fired head coach Ange Postecoglou just 39 days into his tenure, making it the shortest permanent managerial reign in Premier League history. The dismissal came minutes after a 3-0 home defeat to Chelsea, which left the team with a record of six losses and two draws across all competitions under his leadership. Forest secured only one point in five league matches with Postecoglou, leaving them just above the relegation zone. Club owner Evangelos Marinakis was present for the loss, and the decision was communicated to the Australian manager shortly after he had addressed the players post-match.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. Representative George Santos has been released from a New Jersey prison after President Donald Trump commuted his seven-year sentence for wire fraud and identity theft. The commutation came less than three months into Santos's term, following public appeals from Republican allies like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who called his conviction a "grave injustice." In a statement, Trump acknowledged Santos was a "rogue" but argued the prison term was excessive. The decision has drawn criticism from both Democrats and some Republicans, reigniting debates over presidential power on a day when nationwide protests against perceived government overreach were planned.</p>

          <p>Contrary to the common stereotype that women desire commitment more, a recent study by the Kinsey Institute found that men are more likely to want to speed up relationship milestones like moving in together or getting married. The research, which surveyed 2,000 U.S. singles, indicated that financial savings was a primary motivator for men. Experts also suggest that heterosexual men often rely on romantic relationships as their main source of social and emotional support, leading to lower psychological well-being when they are single. This trend is further supported by data from relationship coaching services, which report that men are more likely to sign up for and invest more in coaching.</p>

          <p>Amidst significant market volatility, Invesco senior portfolio manager John Burrello recommends that risk-averse investors consider income funds utilizing options-based strategies. He argues that these funds offer more structural protection because their performance is not dependent on traditional asset class correlations. This approach can provide reliable downside protection and generate income that is not sensitive to interest rate changes, which is particularly relevant as policymakers are expected to cut rates. Burrello advises investors to seek out ETFs managed by institutional-grade professionals and to be cautious of unsustainable yields and high fees in this growing market space.

          <p>U.S. prosecutors have charged Mahmoud Amin Ya'qub al-Muhtadi, a 33-year-old Louisiana resident, with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization for his alleged role in the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel. According to unsealed court documents, al-Muhtadi, an alleged operative of the National Resistance Brigades, armed himself and coordinated a group of fighters to cross into Israel during the attack. He is accused of later traveling to the U.S. on a fraudulent visa, where he became a permanent resident after denying any involvement in terrorist activities on his application. He was arrested on Thursday and has proclaimed his innocence in court.</p>

          <p>For only the second time in its 1,500-year history, the Grand Sumo Tournament is being held outside of Japan, taking place at London's iconic Royal Albert Hall. The event features over 40 professional wrestlers, known as rikishi, competing in 100 bouts over five days. Significant logistical efforts were required to maintain the sport's cultural and religious authenticity, including shipping 11 tons of special clay from Japan to construct the sacred ring, or dohyo. The tournament, which first came to London in 1991, aims to introduce the highly traditional Japanese national sport to a Western audience, complete with English commentary to explain its complex rules and rituals.</p>

          <p>In Los Angeles, a group called Mental Health Is Real Wealth offers a crucial safe space for Black men to discuss their mental health challenges. Founded by Desmond Carter after his best friend's suicide, the bi-monthly meetings address a growing crisis, as suicide rates among Black men have risen significantly. Participants discuss the unique pressures they face, from systemic racism to societal expectations of masculinity, in a supportive environment. Experts note that Black men are less likely to seek mental health support and often receive culturally incompetent care, making community-led initiatives like this essential for fostering emotional expression and breaking generational cycles of trauma.</p>

          <p>A student-organized trip to China highlights the growing political complexities surrounding U.S.-China educational exchanges. Krislyn Massey, a University of North Texas graduate student, organized her travel through a non-profit after her university canceled its own China programs. This follows a trend where American academic institutions are scaling back on such trips amid heightened geopolitical tensions and state-level restrictions, such as those in Texas. Once a routine part of international studies, these exchanges are now fraught with political navigation, requiring students and organizers to be increasingly cautious. Massey's journey reflects a determination to foster personal connections despite the challenging diplomatic climate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Carlynn Greene, who won 30 scholarships to graduate debt-free, advises students to avoid common pitfalls when applying for financial aid. She recommends focusing on local and state-level scholarships rather than highly competitive national ones, as they have smaller applicant pools. Another key strategy is to apply for "intersectionality scholarships" that have multiple specific criteria, such as race, gender, and area of study, to narrow the competition further. Greene also emphasizes that applying for scholarships is a numbers game, suggesting that students should aim to submit applications for 100 to 200 different awards to maximize their chances of success.</p>

He emphasizes that early retirement is an opportunity to redefine one's identity and find new purpose outside of a career, which for him includes hiking, writing, and volunteering.

Selected through an online vote organized by the PONS Langenscheidt publishing house, the phrase beat out contenders like "goonen" (a term for excessive self-gratification) and "checkst du" (do you understand?).

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge argues that delaying children's access to smartphones and social media until they are older contributes to greater happiness and success in adulthood. She recommends that parents begin teaching responsible technology use by late elementary school, years before providing a device. Key advice includes discussing online privacy, the permanence of digital content, and the value of real-world interactions over screen time. Twenge also advocates for setting firm rules, such as banning phones from bedrooms overnight and starting with a basic, non-internet-connected phone, to help children develop a healthier relationship with technology as they mature.</p>

The second category, which includes gold, consists of non-productive assets that investors buy hoping someone else will pay more for them later, a strategy he likens to a chain of hope. Buffett prefers the third category: productive assets like farms or businesses, which generate value and returns based on what they produce, making their intrinsic worth measurable regardless of daily market fluctuations.
