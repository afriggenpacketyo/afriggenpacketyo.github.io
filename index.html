          <p>President Trump marked his 100th day in office with a rally in Michigan, where he celebrated his administration's accomplishments and criticized political rivals. Trump touched on immigration policies, trade tariffs, and the economy, while also taking aim at Joe Biden and the Federal Reserve. He also addressed concerns about his approval ratings and insisted that polls indicating a decline in his popularity were "fake". The rally had a campaign-like atmosphere, with Trump engaging with supporters and even discussing potential nicknames for Biden.

          <p>Gilead Sciences has agreed to a $202 million settlement with the U.S. government and several states over allegations that it provided kickbacks to doctors through speaker programs to encourage them to prescribe the company's HIV drugs. According to prosecutors, Gilead gave money to doctors in the form of honoraria, meals, and travel expenses between 2011 and 2017, in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. The settlement resolves claims that Gilead's actions led to false claims being made to federal healthcare programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The company stated that it settled to avoid the cost and distraction of litigation, maintaining that its speaker programs educated healthcare professionals about its medicines.</p>

          <p>Australia's first-quarter inflation held steady at 2.4%, marking a four-year low and aligning with Reuters' expectations. The most significant price increases were observed in housing, education, and food and non-alcoholic beverages, while recreation and culture activities saw price decreases. The declining inflation rate has provided the Reserve Bank of Australia with the flexibility to cut rates to 4.1%. Economists predict that a rate cut in May is likely if trimmed mean inflation aligns with or falls below forecasts. This release comes as Australia prepares for an election on May 3, with the Labor Party currently holding a lead over the Liberal-National opposition.</p>

          <p>President Trump's aggressive tariff policies are raising concerns among economists about a potential recession. The announcement of tariffs on goods from China and other countries sent stock markets into turmoil and created uncertainty about the future of global trade. Economists warn that these tariffs could disrupt supply chains, increase prices for consumers, and ultimately harm the U.S. economy. Despite Trump's claims that tariffs will benefit the U.S., experts argue that they are likely to hurt working- and middle-class Americans the most. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mark Carney, Canada’s new prime minister, achieved a stunning political upset by campaigning against President Trump and promising to revitalize the economy. Now, he must deliver on these promises amid political instability and a trade war with the United States. Carney's immediate priorities include forming a cabinet and reconvening Parliament, which has been suspended for months. Canadian businesses are looking to Carney to restore order to commerce with the United States, as Trump's tariffs have halted private sector investment. Carney's anti-Trump stance has elevated him to a global figure, but his fiery rhetoric could pose challenges in dealing with the U.S. president.</p>

The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) dropped to 49.0, signaling a decline in manufacturing for the first time since January. This slowdown is attributed to escalating tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Chinese goods.

The administration stated that the "scope" of the assessment is being "reevaluated". This decision raises concerns about the report's objectivity and scientific rigor, as many of the dismissed scientists were non-federal employees voluntarily contributing their expertise. Critics fear the administration will appoint authors with alternative viewpoints on climate change, potentially undermining the report's credibility.

At least 28 migrants were charged in federal court for crossing into the 170-mile-long zone patrolled by US troops. The defense secretary described the area as a 'national defense area', equating entry to entering a military base. Critics, like the ACLU of New Mexico, argue that this militarization erodes the constitutional principle of separating military and civilian policing.

          <p>Paramount Global is entering mediation to settle President Trump’s $20-billion lawsuit over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. The company's board has agreed on parameters for a possible settlement, aiming to resolve the dispute and facilitate its sale to Skydance Media. Trump filed the lawsuit alleging CBS deceptively edited the interview. Paramount's controlling shareholder Shari Redstone is pushing for a settlement, sparking protests within the company. The Federal Communications Commission must approve the transfer of CBS television station licenses to the Ellison family. A large settlement could be viewed as a payoff to the president.</p>

The Guardian highlighted the Canadian election victory of Mark Carney and reported that the White House accused Amazon of a "hostile and political act" for planning to inform shoppers of the cost of Trump's tariffs.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom voiced his support for legislation that would increase the punishment to a felony for soliciting a 16- or 17-year-old for sex. This stance puts him at odds with some members of his own party, as Democrats in the state Assembly watered down the bill. Newsom believes the law should treat all sex predators who solicit minors the same, regardless of the victim's age. The bill aimed to criminalize loitering with intent to buy sex and build on existing law to make it a felony to solicit anyone under 18 for sex.</p>

Retailers are likely to experience out-of-stock situations this summer, and consumers could face higher prices. The CEOs of Walmart and Target have cautioned President Trump about potential gaps on store shelves. The tariffs are causing a widespread booking freeze and uncertainty among importers.
