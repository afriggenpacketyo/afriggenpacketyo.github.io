            <p>The rotor of the helicopter that crashed in the Hudson River on April 10th, killing all six people on board, has been recovered. The NTSB stated that the recovery included the transmission, roof beam, and tail rotor system, aiding in the ongoing investigation into the cause of the crash. The helicopter was carrying a family of Spanish tourists and the pilot, and video footage showed it plunging into the water without its tail rotor or main rotor blade. The company behind the helicopter tours has shut down operations, and the FAA will review its license and safety record.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration has frozen $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts to Harvard University after the school rejected a list of demands aimed at combating antisemitism and ensuring civil rights compliance. Harvard President Alan Garber stated that the university would not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights in response to the administration's demands, which included changes to governance, hiring practices, and admissions procedures. The administration argues that Harvard has failed to protect Jewish students and address an entitlement mindset endemic in elite universities. Harvard maintains that it has taken extensive reforms to address antisemitism.</p>

            <p>Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian activist involved in protests at Columbia University, was arrested by federal agents during his citizenship interview in Vermont. His legal team believes the Trump administration plans to deport him under a law allowing deportations if the Secretary of State deems someone poses "adverse foreign policy consequences." This arrest follows similar actions against fellow Columbia activist Mahmoud Khalil. Mahdawi's lawyers argue his detention is in retaliation for his advocacy for Palestinians and violates the First Amendment. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has defended revoking visas of Hamas supporters in America.</p>

            <p>A third federal judge has temporarily blocked some deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. United States District Judge Charlotte Sweeney entered a temporary order on Monday that bars President Donald Trump's administration from removing any noncitizens located in Colorado who are subject to Trump’s Alien Enemies Act Proclamation. The order will remain in effect for two weeks, and Sweeney set a hearing for April 21 to consider extending her order. She declined to rule on the lawfulness of the AEA proclamation, instead blocking removals to preserve the court’s jurisdiction as she considers the issue.</p>

            <p>A CNBC Supply Chain Survey indicates that President Trump's tariffs are unlikely to lead to a reshoring of supply chains to the U.S., with most companies citing cost as a major deterrent. Over half of the respondents said reshoring could double their costs, leading them to seek lower-tariffed countries instead. Concerns were also raised about finding skilled labor and the current administration's inconsistent strategy. The survey found that automation would dominate if manufacturing returned to the U.S., with layoffs being an immediate concern for many companies. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele refused to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the United States, stating that he would not "smuggle a terrorist" into the country. This statement came after Attorney General Pam Bondi said it was up to El Salvador whether the man, mistakenly deported to an El Salvador prison, returns to the U.S. The Trump administration acknowledged that Abrego Garcia's deportation was an "administrative error." Bukele referred to Abrego Garcia as a "terrorist," and said he lacked the power to return him.</p>

            <p>Harvard University decided to reject the Trump administration's demands for continued federal funding, prioritizing its independence over financial incentives. This decision contrasts with Columbia University's swift acquiescence to similar demands, which resulted in public criticism and continued government pressure. Harvard appears to have learned that appeasement does not work, as the administration's goal is to break, not reform, elite higher education. Harvard, with its substantial endowment, seems willing to sacrifice some funding to preserve its status.</p>

            <p>An arson attack on Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's residence underscores the growing threat of political violence in the United States. The suspect, Cody Balmer, who admitted to "harboring hatred" towards Shapiro, has been charged with attempted murder and other counts. While Republicans joined Democrats in condemning the attack, the incident reflects a broader trend of rising political violence, exacerbated by figures who praise or leverage the threat of violence. The attack serves as a stark reminder of the potential dangers facing political figures and their families.</p>

            <p>President Trump's return to the White House has sparked fresh flashpoints in the US-Canada relationship, raising questions about his ultimate designs on the country. Border disputes, natural resources, and Trump's rhetoric about making Canada the 51st state have fueled concerns. Some analysts believe Trump wants Canadian resources and the Arctic, while others suggest he is prioritizing a continental fortress insulated by the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. The diplomatic damage being done will be difficult to undo, and the possibility of unanticipated consequences is high.</p>

            <p>The Trump administration is initiating investigations into imports of pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, potentially leading to tariffs on both sectors based on national security grounds. Public comment is being solicited, and the inquiries must be completed within 270 days. Pharmaceuticals and semiconductors are currently exempt from existing tariffs, but Trump has indicated they will face separate levies. The US relies heavily on chip imports from Taiwan, and the administration aims to increase domestic drug manufacturing to reduce reliance on other countries. Drugmakers have expressed concerns about potential shortages and reduced access for patients.</p>

            <p>The UK housing market is seeing a surge in low-deposit mortgage options, reaching levels not seen since the 2008 financial crisis. This increase in 5% and 10% deposit deals provides a boost for first-time buyers. However, house prices and mortgage rates remain higher than in previous years. For buyers with a 5% deposit, there are 442 mortgages to choose from, and for those with a 10% deposit, there are 845 products available. Competition for homes is fierce, with properties typically listed for just over a month before a sale is agreed. (not investment advice)</p>
