        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Conservative news outlet Newsmax has initiated an antitrust lawsuit against Fox News, alleging the dominant network uses its market power to stifle competition. Newsmax claims Fox coerces cable distributors, making access to its popular content conditional on either marginalizing or refusing to carry other right-leaning channels. The suit further asserts that Fox imposes financial penalties on distributors who do not comply, forcing them to pay high fees for less-watched Fox channels like Fox Business. Newsmax is seeking a permanent injunction to halt these alleged exclusionary agreements and substantial financial damages, arguing that Fox's long-standing practices undermine fair competition and harm consumers within the right-leaning pay television news market.</p>

          <p>Jeffrey Epstein survivors convened on Capitol Hill, making an impassioned plea for the public release of all files pertaining to the accused sex trafficker. They vocally refuted President Trump's dismissal of the matter as a "Democratic hoax," with several survivors sharing emotional accounts of the abuse they endured. A bipartisan initiative, spearheaded by Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna, is actively pursuing a discharge petition to compel the Justice Department to disclose these documents. However, this push faces opposition from House Republican leadership and the White House, who prefer a more controlled investigation by the House Oversight Committee, citing the need for redactions to safeguard the identities and privacy of innocent victims.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A substantial number of experienced disaster management professionals are departing FEMA for more secure and lucrative roles in the private consulting sector, a trend intensified by the Trump administration's policies. The administration's cancellation of a key grant program for hazard mitigation and its push to decentralize disaster responsibility to states have created uncertainty within FEMA. This exodus of federal expertise raises concerns that states, often lacking their own resources, will increasingly turn to private contractors, many of whom are former FEMA employees. Critics fear this could lead to higher costs, reduced federal oversight, and potentially less equitable distribution of aid, fundamentally altering America's approach to preparing for and recovering from increasingly frequent disasters.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, a prominent candidate to potentially succeed Jerome Powell as Fed Chair, has voiced strong support for commencing a rate-cutting cycle at the central bank's upcoming September meeting. Waller, who notably dissented from a recent Federal Open Market Committee decision to maintain steady interest rates, believes that multiple cuts could be implemented over the next three to six months, arguing that current rates exceed their "neutral" level by a significant margin. Despite acknowledging the potential for tariffs to impede economic growth, he does not anticipate a recession. Waller also underscored the paramount importance of the Fed's independence from political influence, asserting that the institution's autonomy would be preserved irrespective of who assumes its leadership.

At least five homes in the small rural community, with a population of approximately 60 people, were reported to be actively burning. This incident is part of a larger series of fires in Calaveras and Tuolumne counties, collectively known as the TCU September Lightning Complex, underscoring the severe and ongoing wildfire threat across California's diverse landscapes.</p>

This change is slated to take effect on October 1, 2025. In lieu of the invitee program, Amazon is directing users towards "Amazon Family," which allows for sharing a wider array of Prime benefits, including shipping, with a single additional adult within the same household, alongside profiles for up to four teens and four children. The company is offering a promotional one-year Prime membership for $14.99 to those previously using the sharing service, a strategic move to encourage individual subscriptions following a general increase in Prime membership fees in 2022.</p>

          <p>Days after a powerful 6.0-magnitude earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan, rescue teams are facing immense difficulties reaching survivors, compounded by a subsequent 5.5-magnitude aftershock that caused rockfalls and further isolated villages.

Humanitarian organizations like Save the Children are struggling to deliver aid, with teams having to trek long distances on foot. The UN World Food Programme has warned of an impending food shortage, highlighting a severe funding shortfall for Afghanistan's humanitarian needs, where a significant portion of the population already lives in poverty and relies on aid.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made a significant diplomatic foray, appearing alongside Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin at a military parade in Beijing, marking their first joint public appearance. This event underscores growing international concerns about the "axis of upheaval" and its challenge to the existing global order. Kim's visit is primarily aimed at revitalizing economic ties with China, which serves as North Korea's largest trading partner and is crucial for its economic stability. Despite North Korea's embrace of a "new Cold War" order, analysts note China and Russia's reluctance to form a formal bloc, suggesting Kim may be leveraging this appearance for future negotiations, potentially with former President Trump, regarding North Korea's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police chief, Sir Mark Rowley, has appealed to the government to clarify or change laws concerning online free speech, following the controversial arrest of comedy writer Graham Linehan.

While defending the officers' actions as within existing legislation, Rowley stated police are in an "impossible position" policing "toxic culture wars debates." The incident has reignited a fierce debate in the UK over free speech, with figures like J.K.

          <p>A New York judge has made a groundbreaking ruling, allowing advanced whole genome sequencing DNA testing to be used as evidence in the upcoming Gilgo Beach murders trial of Rex Heuermann. This marks the first time such cutting-edge forensic technology, capable of extracting DNA from degraded or rootless hair samples, will be admitted in a New York court, setting a new statewide precedent. Prosecutors hailed the decision, as the testing linked Heuermann, his ex-wife, and daughter to hair strands found on multiple victims.

While current market trends show short-term CDs, such as 3-month or 6-month options, typically feature the highest annual percentage rates, the overall interest earned on a significant deposit like $50,000 can be substantially greater with longer-term CDs. For instance, a 2-year CD, despite a slightly lower rate, yields considerably more cumulative interest than its short-term counterparts due to the extended compounding period. Investors should carefully evaluate whether their priority is securing the highest immediate rate or maximizing total interest earnings over time, given the penalties associated with early withdrawals.

          <p>President Donald Trump has launched an appeal against a federal judge's ruling that declared his deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles for law enforcement activities unlawful. Judge Charles Breyer's decision asserted that such deployments violated the Posse Comitatus Act, which typically restricts the U.S. military from engaging in domestic law enforcement. The ruling specifically prohibits the approximately 300 remaining Guard troops in Los Angeles from performing arrests, searches, or crowd control, and applies this restriction to any similar military deployments across California. Trump's appeal coincides with his expressed intentions to potentially deploy Guard troops to other cities, fueling concerns that these actions could lead to the establishment of a "national police force" directly controlled by the President.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has publicly committed to engaging directly, alongside his international trade and foreign ministers, to resolve an escalating trade dispute with China concerning canola imports. China recently imposed substantial preliminary duties of 75.8% on Canadian canola seed, significantly intensifying a year-long trade conflict. Canada, recognized as the world's largest exporter of canola, saw its canola product exports to China reach nearly C$5 billion in 2024, with seed comprising a dominant 80% of that figure. These steep tariffs, if they remain in place, are expected to effectively halt Canadian canola seed shipments to its largest market, underscoring the urgency of Carney's intervention to safeguard this vital agricultural trade relationship.</p>

          <p>Senior Democratic senators have expressed serious concerns regarding the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), urging Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Ambassador Mike Huckabee to disclose details about its funding and oversight. The senators, including Elizabeth Warren, Chris Van Hollen, and Peter Welch, allege that the State Department overrode internal protocols to fund GHF, raising suspicions that the organization may be a front for intelligence and political operations rather than solely humanitarian aid. Citing a lack of transparency and nearly 1,000 Palestinian deaths near GHF sites, they demand an immediate halt to funding and a transfer of resources to established aid organizations, especially given GHF's reported ties to Israeli government and intelligence services.</p>

          <p>Manchester United and England midfielder Grace Clinton is reportedly on the verge of a significant transfer to rival club Manchester City, with the move anticipated to be completed before Thursday's transfer deadline. The 22-year-old, who has just one year remaining on her current contract and has not agreed to an extension, has garnered considerable interest from multiple clubs this summer. Concurrently, England midfielder Jess Park, aged 23, is slated to move in the opposite direction, from City to United, and was scheduled for a medical examination. Manchester United sees Park as a high-quality acquisition and a suitable replacement for Clinton, preferring to secure a transfer fee now rather than risk losing the England international as a free agent next year, a scenario they have encountered with other key players recently.</p>

          <p>Survivors and family members of the victims from Maine's devastating October 2023 mass shooting are suing the U.S. government, asserting that the tragedy was preventable and resulted from the Army's negligence. The lawsuit claims that Army officials were well aware of reservist Robert Card's declining mental state, which included paranoid delusions, homicidal ideations, and even a "hit list" of intended targets. Despite explicit warnings from fellow reservists about Card's potential for violence, Army leadership allegedly failed to take decisive action, dismissing concerns and neglecting to ensure the removal of his firearms as previously indicated. This legal action follows an independent commission's conclusion that multiple intervention opportunities by both military and civilian authorities were tragically overlooked before Card killed eighteen people.</p>

Shein clarified that the image originated from a third-party vendor and was promptly removed once discovered. Mangione, who pleaded not guilty to murder and stalking charges and faces a potential death penalty, has become a polarizing figure, with some online retailers previously capitalizing on his notoriety by selling related merchandise, which other platforms like Amazon had already taken down.</p>

The proposed settlement requires Disney to remit the civil penalty, adhere strictly to children's data protection regulations, and establish a comprehensive program to review and correctly designate its YouTube content. Disney emphasized that the issue was confined to its content distribution on YouTube's platform, reiterating its long-standing commitment to upholding the highest standards for children's privacy.</p>

          <p>Senator Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has strongly condemned the Trump administration's acquisition of a 10% equity stake in the embattled chipmaker Intel for $8.9 billion, describing it as a concerning "step towards socialism." A vocal advocate for free-market principles, Paul argued that direct government ownership in private enterprises is fundamentally "a bad idea" and expressed apprehension about the erosion of free-market ideology within the Republican Party. This investment exemplifies the Trump administration's increasing interventionist approach in the private sector, which has included similar stakes in other key industries. Interestingly, this policy has also found support from figures like Senator Bernie Sanders, albeit from a different ideological perspective that emphasizes taxpayer returns on corporate welfare.

          <p>Israel's domestic intelligence agency, Shin Bet, has successfully foiled a planned assassination attempt by a Hamas cell targeting the controversial National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. The operation led to the arrest of several Hamas militants in the Hebron region of the West Bank, during which drones were confiscated. Investigations revealed that the suspects intended to arm these drones with explosives to execute the attack. Ben-Gvir, known for his ultranationalist views and strong ties to the radical settler movement, is a polarizing figure within Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, having even temporarily resigned in January to protest a proposed ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. The thwarted plot underscores the persistent security threats and heightened tensions in the region.</p>

While the House Oversight Committee recently released 33,000 documents, the vast majority were already publicly accessible, prompting renewed skepticism about the administration's commitment to full transparency. Republican Representative Thomas Massie explicitly voiced his suspicion that Trump might be shielding "rich and powerful people," arguing that a comprehensive disclosure is necessary to clear the former president's name. Massie, alongside Democratic Representative Ro Khanna, has initiated a discharge petition to compel the administration to release all relevant files, attracting support from other conservative Republicans, including Marjorie Taylor-Greene.</p>

Rauch defines the "constitution of knowledge" as a system of rules, norms, and institutions—including science, journalism, law, and government—that enables peaceful, reality-based disagreement resolution. They examine how disinformation, particularly a "fire hose of falsehoods" from political figures, and the politicization of institutions like academia and government agencies, undermine public trust and the ability to discern facts. The discussion also touches on the inherent human resistance to uncertainty and the critical need for freedom, commitment to facts, and viewpoint diversity for the system to function.</p>

These guidelines stipulate that individuals granted deferred action are not deemed "unlawfully present" and are authorized to remain in the U.S. for the duration of their protection. The senators highlighted DACA's established function in safeguarding "Dreamers" who meet rigorous background checks and specific educational or work requirements, expressing alarm over recent reports of arrests and detentions involving DACA beneficiaries and calling for policy consistency.</p>

In return, South American agricultural goods will face fewer restrictions entering the EU, a point that has historically drawn strong opposition from European agricultural sectors.
