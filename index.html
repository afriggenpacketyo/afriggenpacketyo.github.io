        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea has significantly bolstered its air defense capabilities with the deployment of a new US-made Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) system, marking the first known instance of such a system at an overseas US base. This advanced mobile, ground-based weapon is specifically engineered to effectively counter a wide range of aerial threats, including cruise missiles, unmanned aircraft systems, and rockets, artillery, and mortars. The strategic move is widely interpreted as a direct response to escalating security concerns stemming from China and North Korea, aiming to enhance regional deterrence and stability. Its introduction follows earlier reports indicating the US Army's intent to evaluate new prototype air and missile defense technologies in global hotspots, reinforcing a commitment to allied security.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing decline of traditional American malls and a national rise in shopping center vacancy rates are inadvertently fostering new opportunities for small, independent businesses to access prime commercial real estate. While asking rents continue to increase, the pace of this growth has significantly slowed to around 2% annually, coupled with increased availability, creating a more flexible market. This shift enables a diverse array of local enterprises, including health practitioners, yoga instructors, and gourmet food businesses, to negotiate more favorable lease terms like shorter durations or rent-free periods, often in locations previously dominated by large chains. This trend, however, varies by geography and is balanced by landlords' inherent caution regarding the high failure rate among small businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A devastating act of targeted violence occurred at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, where 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford killed four people and injured eight others. Sanford, a Marine Corps veteran, drove his vehicle through the church's front doors during a Sunday morning worship service, then opened fire with an assault rifle and deliberately set the building ablaze. He was later killed in an exchange of gunfire with law enforcement in the parking lot. The FBI is leading the investigation, treating it as targeted violence, which has prompted widespread condemnation from officials like Governor Whitmer and President Trump, and led to increased security patrols at houses of worship across the nation.</p>

Adams faced a tumultuous year marked by a federal corruption scandal, which he denied, and criticism over his relationship with the Trump administration. Despite the challenges, political figures like Governor Hochul and House Minority Leader Jeffries acknowledged his accomplishments, including reducing violent crime and building affordable housing.</p>

          <p>The Village of Broadview has initiated a criminal investigation after a CBS News Chicago reporter, Asal Rezaei, had her vehicle struck by a pepper ball fired by an ICE agent late Sunday morning. The incident occurred near an ICE detention facility where the reporter was alone, with no active protest taking place, raising questions about the agent's motive. Rezaei reported suffering chemical exposure, including her face feeling "on fire" and vomiting. Broadview Police Chief Thomas Mills condemned the "allegedly unprovoked attack" and stated the police department expects full cooperation from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in their criminal investigation, highlighting concerns about press freedom and accountability.</p>

          <p>China's stock market has experienced a significant rally this year, with the mainland CSI 300 index climbing about 16% and its Information Technology Index reaching 2015 highs, driven by progress in artificial intelligence, efforts towards chip self-sufficiency, and Beijing's campaign to curb price wars. This surge is largely fueled by retail investors, who account for 90% of daily trading volume, shifting their record-high household savings into equities amid falling deposit rates. While some experts, like Standard Chartered's Raymond Cheng, note a disconnect from economic fundamentals, others, such as Lotus Asset Management's Hao Hong, warn that pockets of the market are "a little too hot," suggesting it is not yet a bubble but heading in that direction, especially in sectors like contract research organizations and technology.

The popular contest, despite its playful nature, serves a crucial role in raising public awareness about New Zealand's unique and highly endangered bird species, 80% of which face varying levels of threat.

          <p>New Mexico's House Bill 63, unanimously passed to reallocate public school funding to its neediest students, has inadvertently resulted in significant funding cuts for several of the state's highest-performing charter schools, with some losing over $1.5 million. These "spotlight" schools, which boast math, reading, and science proficiency rates 20 to 40 percentage points higher than the state average, are now grappling with tough decisions, including potential staff layoffs, program reductions, and in one instance, a shortened four-day school week. While the bill's intent is to address the 2018 Yazzie-Martinez ruling on educational equity for marginalized students, critics argue that defunding successful institutions to benefit others without clear accountability for the new funds is counterproductive to improving overall state education outcomes.</p>

Sony Group cited competing investment demands in its entertainment and semiconductor divisions as a key rationale for the financial unit to operate autonomously.

Similarly, China Southern Airlines’ reports indicate it had only "financially leased" three of the expected twelve single-aisle jets as of June. This issue could potentially hinder the Shanghai-based firm Comac's ambitious efforts to break into a market dominated by Western aviation giants, despite the jet having already transported over 2 million passengers since its maiden commercial flight in May 2023.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the concept of "energy vampires" in friendships—individuals who tend to drain one's emotional and mental energy through various behaviors. Psychologists and journalists identify common signs such as excessive complaining, constant self-focus without reciprocal interest, and a persistent need for attention or reassurance. These individuals may also subtly chip away at one's mood through backhanded compliments or by not allowing genuine emotional expression. To manage such draining relationships, experts recommend honest communication about feeling unheard, establishing clear boundaries regarding time spent or topics discussed, and trying alternative activities together. If the friend is unwilling to change, prioritizing one's own well-being by limiting exposure becomes crucial.</p>

          <p>Over 100,000 federal workers are reportedly set to formally resign on Tuesday, marking the largest mass resignation event in U.S. history, as part of a Trump administration program designed to implement sweeping cuts to the federal workforce. Workers preparing to leave have described months of "fear and intimidation," citing concerns over job security, the perceived undermining of their mission, and the stripping away of work-life balance. Compounding this, the White House has ordered federal agencies to draw up plans for large-scale firings if Congress fails to authorize more funding by Tuesday's deadline, which could trigger a government shutdown. This unprecedented exodus highlights deep dissatisfaction and uncertainty within the federal sector.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's ambitious goals for adopting green marine fuels are critically dependent on establishing a reliable methanol supply chain, according to Wang Yongxin, President of CM Energy. While Hong Kong has already achieved liquefied natural gas (LNG) and biodiesel fueling operations with significant throughput, it needs to work diligently to facilitate the tax-free import, storage, and sale of mainland-produced green methanol. This statement was made at the maiden voyage of the CM Hong Kong, billed as the world’s first large-vehicle carrier capable of operating on both traditional fuel and methanol. CM Energy anticipates gradually increasing its green methanol usage from 2027, driven by Europe's impending carbon emissions-based import tariff regime, despite the current cost being around four times higher than traditional fuel.

Although the unit recently closed due to low referrals, a sister dementia unit in the same building, Wellen Court, was subsequently stopped from accepting new patients amid safety concerns.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump is seeking an expedited Supreme Court review of his executive order attempting to unilaterally end birthright citizenship, after two federal courts universally blocked its enforcement on different grounds. In filings, Solicitor General John Sauer argues the government has a compelling interest in ensuring American citizenship is granted only to those lawfully entitled, based on a reinterpretation of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause. This order, if upheld, would affect an estimated 255,000 children born annually on U.S. soil to non-citizen parents. Legal experts like the ACLU and constitutional scholar James Sample contend the order is illegal and would be an "earthquake" to over a century of settled legal precedent, with the Supreme Court having affirmed birthright citizenship in the 1898 case U.S. v Wong Kim Ark.</p>

          <p>Federal officials have confirmed that Joshua Jahn, the shooter who attacked the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Dallas, acted alone and specifically targeted ICE agents, driven by an animus revealed in notes found at his residence. Jahn legally purchased an 8mm bolt-action rifle last month and used apps that track ICE agents as part of his planning, firing from a nearby office building rooftop. The attack tragically resulted in the death of one detainee, Norlan Guzman-Fuentes, and critical injuries to two others, Jose Andres Bordones-Molina and Miguel Angel Garcia-Hernandez, who were inside targeted vans. The Dallas ICE office remains closed, and authorities have attributed a significant increase in assaults on ICE officers to "wild rhetoric."</p>

Labour's Chancellor Rachel Reeves is also set to urge business leaders to focus on the perceived threat posed by Reform's economic policies. Additionally, Labour plans to introduce sanctions for long-term youth unemployed individuals who refuse paid work placements, while councils face increasing scrutiny over soaring costs for transporting special needs pupils, which have doubled to over £2bn in a decade.</p>

The vote was accompanied by bomb scares at polling stations in multiple countries and arrests for plotting unrest, which Sandu's party attributed to Moscow-backed criminal groups.

          <p>The state of Oregon has filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to block President Trump's deployment of 200 National Guard troops to Portland, arguing that his characterization of the city as "war ravaged" is "pure fiction" and based on misinformation. Governor Tina Kotek stated that local law enforcement is fully capable of managing the ongoing, small-scale protests outside a single Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility, and that the president's assertion of federal control is an unlawful abuse of power, as it is not in response to a foreign invasion or mass anarchy. The lawsuit highlights that Trump's claims appear to stem from a Fox News report that mixed social media video from current protests with older footage from 2020, potentially misleading the public and making residents less safe.</p>

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned the "vile attack" following the UN General Assembly, while former U.S. President Trump suggested NATO countries should shoot down Russian drones violating their airspace.

          <p>President Trump stated on Sunday that a government shutdown is likely unless top Democrats abandon their current negotiating position, expressing confidence that the American people will side with him and that Democrats will face political repercussions for not agreeing to his terms for further spending cuts. Ahead of a crucial meeting with congressional leaders, sources close to Trump indicated he privately welcomes the prospect of a shutdown as an opportunity to wield executive power to slash government programs and salaries. Democrats, however, are forcefully pushing back, demanding extensions of Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies and rejecting Trump's attempts to link healthcare negotiations to immigration, emphasizing that undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal health benefits.
