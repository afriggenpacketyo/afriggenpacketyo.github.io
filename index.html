          <p>The recent trade deal between the U.S. and the UK, while landmark, suggests that President Trump's 10% baseline tariffs are likely to remain in place for other trading partners. Despite the UK securing tariff reductions for specific sectors like autos, steel, and aluminum, all other goods imported to the U.S. from the UK will still be subject to the 10% tariff. Analysts suggest that the UK deal, which includes a cap on the number of cars exported at a reduced rate, may serve as a template for future agreements, indicating limited flexibility on overall tariff levels.</p>

While overall shipments of goods from China jumped, imports fell, reflecting weakening domestic demand.
