          <p>Nvidia's recent earnings report reveals a complex picture of strong growth tempered by geopolitical challenges. While the company's overall sales surged by 69%, U.S. export controls are hindering Nvidia's access to the lucrative Chinese market, potentially costing billions in lost revenue. Despite these headwinds, Nvidia's data center division continues to thrive, driven by robust demand from cloud providers like Microsoft, Google, Oracle, and Amazon, who are snapping up Nvidia's GPUs for AI applications. Looking ahead, Nvidia is betting big on AI inference, the process of using AI models to serve millions of customers, with its Blackwell chips designed to meet the growing demand for reasoning AI. Optimism surrounds Nvidia's ability to navigate challenges and capitalize on the expanding AI landscape.</p>

          <p>United Airlines and JetBlue have forged a new partnership that will allow frequent fliers to earn and redeem points on both airlines, while also involving a swap of terminal slots at New York-area airports. United will regain access to John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in 2027, acquiring seven takeoff and landing slots, while JetBlue will receive eight slots at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey. This marks United's return to JFK since 2022, complementing JetBlue's extensive East Coast network. The airlines will maintain independent management and pricing strategies, and the arrangement is slated to begin rolling out this fall, pending regulatory review.</p>

          <p>A partial glacier collapse in Switzerland caused a massive landslide that buried approximately 90% of the village of Blatten, prompting a search and rescue operation for a missing 64-year-old man. Authorities had previously evacuated the village due to concerns about the unstable glacier, and the landslide sent mud and rocks cascading down the mountainside, submerging homes and infrastructure. The event also blocked the Lonza River, raising concerns about potential flooding downstream, leading to further evacuations. Swiss glaciologists have expressed increasing alarm about the rapid thaw of glaciers due to global warming, with Switzerland experiencing significant glacier volume loss in recent years.</p>

          <p>After weeks of intense firefighting efforts, three major wildfires in northeastern Minnesota are nearing full containment, allowing for the lifting of evacuation orders issued on Memorial Day. While crews continue to battle the blazes, which have collectively burned approximately 30,000 acres, progress has been significant. The U.S. Forest Service suspects the Jenkins Creek Fire was human-caused, though the investigation is ongoing, and the Camp House Road Fire has destroyed over 150 structures. Meanwhile, air quality alerts remain in effect for the Arrowhead region due to smoke drifting from the Minnesota fires and massive wildfires just north of Minnesota in Canada's Manitoba provinces.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court panel has temporarily blocked President Trump's plan to impose significant tariffs on the European Union and other trading partners, leading to a measured response from global markets. While international stocks experienced a rise as investors hoped for a restraint on Washington's aggressive trade policies, experts cautioned that Trump could pursue alternative legal strategies to enact tariffs, given the administration's intention to appeal the decision. America's trading partners, including Australia and Britain, expressed cautious optimism, while the European Commission declined to comment, highlighting the fragility of the reprieve. The court's decision does not reverse existing sector-specific tariffs or prevent future ones, suggesting continued trade negotiations on critical sectors in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>A group of 22 young Americans has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that its pro-fossil fuel executive orders violate their constitutional rights to life and liberty. The lawsuit argues that by promoting oil and gas production while hindering carbon-free energy sources, federal officials are breaching congressional mandates to protect ecosystems and public health. The plaintiffs, aged 7 to 25, claim the administration's actions are increasing emissions and suppressing climate science, thus violating the state-created danger doctrine. The litigation targets three specific executive orders aimed at bolstering U.S. energy production, leading to agency actions that undermine renewable energy and suppress climate research.</p>

          <p>A recent US court ruling blocking some of President Trump's tariffs has limited immediate impact on the UK's trade deal with the US. The tariffs that the court deemed illegal do not include those on cars, steel, and aluminum, which constitute a significant portion of UK exports to the US. While the UK has secured a deal to reduce car tariffs to 10% and eliminate tariffs on steel and aluminum, this agreement has yet to be implemented. The ruling does block Trump's blanket tariffs of 10% on other UK goods, such as salmon and whisky, but the White House intends to appeal the decision, creating uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A US court ruling against President Trump's trade tariffs has significantly altered the global trade war landscape, raising questions about the legality of his sweeping tariff policies. The court's decision challenges the President's authority to unilaterally impose tariffs without Congressional approval, citing that the use of national emergency powers to announce permanent tariff changes was illegal and unconstitutional. This ruling undermines any attempt by the US Treasury Secretary to negotiate deals with other countries and emboldens California's similar case against the tariffs. With the White House facing pressure from bond markets, retailers, big business, and individual states, the administration's trade policies are now under intense scrutiny.</p>

The cities with the highest retirement incomes also tend to have the largest average Social Security benefits, reflecting higher earners receiving larger checks.

          <p>MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace is launching a new podcast called "The Best People," featuring conversations with figures outside of politics, as the network explores new ways to reach audiences beyond cable TV. This move comes as MSNBC, along with other NBCUniversal cable outlets, is being spun off into a new company called Versant, prompting the network to expand its digital presence. Wallace aims to connect with listeners, particularly working mothers, who may not be able to watch her daily program. The podcast will feature guests discussing their advocacy issues, with the network hiring its own newsgathering team amidst the spinoff.</p>

The move has sparked anxiety across U.S. university campuses, where international students, including over 277,000 from China, contribute significantly to research and tuition revenue.

          <p>SpaceX's Starship experienced another failed test flight, marking the third such incident, raising questions about the program's long-term reliability and safety. Despite achieving its greatest progress to date, the unmanned spacecraft spun out of control minutes after separating from its Super Heavy booster, ultimately resulting in a "rapid unscheduled disassembly." While SpaceX operates on a principle of rapid iteration, treating failures as learning opportunities, repeated costly failures raise questions about the program's ambitious goals and timelines. Some experts suggest that the repeated failures don't project the sense that safety and reliability are the primary drivers in its development.</p>

While Trump has hinted at potential sanctions, he has yet to take action, facing growing pressure to adopt a harder stance.
