          <p>A man is in custody after a stabbing attack at a Walmart in Traverse City, Michigan, left eleven people wounded. Officials report that six of the victims are in critical condition, while five are in serious condition. The incident, which occurred near the checkout area, appears to have been a random act of violence involving a folding knife. The 42-year-old suspect was apprehended with assistance from citizens in the store, who also helped provide aid to the injured. Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Walmart have both released statements expressing condolences and gratitude to first responders.</p>

          <p>Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have announced the formation of a rival civilian-led government, a move that significantly deepens the country's 27-month civil war. The new administration, led by RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, directly challenges the internationally recognized army-led government and raises fears of a permanent national division. This development follows an agreement between paramilitary, rebel, and civilian groups to establish a secular 'New Sudan.' UN officials have warned this could fragment the country further, undermining diplomatic efforts to resolve a conflict that has already displaced millions and killed an estimated 150,000 people.</p>

          <h2>Former Ballerina Ashley Benefield Convicted of Manslaughter in Husband's Death</h2>

          <p>A Florida jury found former ballerina Ashley Benefield guilty of manslaughter for the 2020 shooting death of her estranged husband, Doug Benefield. The defense argued she acted in self-defense after years of alleged abuse, while the prosecution contended she murdered him to win a contentious custody battle over their daughter. The complex trial featured testimony about their turbulent relationship, accusations of poisoning, and a history of legal disputes. Though acquitted of the more serious second-degree murder charge, Benefield was sentenced to 20 years in prison, bringing a dramatic conclusion to a case that captured public attention.</p>

          <p>Actor Johnny Depp joined Alice Cooper on stage during a concert in London for a surprise tribute to the late Ozzy Osbourne. Depp played guitar with the band for a performance of Black Sabbath's classic song "Paranoid," just days after the heavy metal icon's passing at age 76. Cooper, who wore an Osbourne t-shirt, introduced Depp as "some guy we found out in the alley." Depp, a fellow member of the band The Hollywood Vampires with Cooper, also stayed on stage to play the classic "School's Out," honoring a musician widely mourned as an unmatched showman and cultural legend.</p>

The Dodgers' offense was limited to two first-inning solo home runs from Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández, after which Crochet and the Red Sox defense shut them down for the remainder of the night.</p>

          <p>Nearly 4,000 NASA employees, representing about 20% of the agency's workforce, have opted to leave through the Trump administration's deferred resignation program. This reduction is part of a broader government plan to decrease the federal workforce and implement cuts recommended by the Department of Government Efficiency. The move comes amid debates over NASA's budget, which the administration proposed to cut by 24% for fiscal year 2026. However, Congress is considering keeping funding near current levels, and a recent bill allocated nearly $10 billion in additional long-term funding for key missions like returning to the moon and Mars.

The film, directed by Ellena Wood, details the widespread physical and sexual abuse of children and the control exerted by its late founder, Noel Stanton. The investigation reveals that children were often separated from parents, subjected to beatings, and lived in communal homes where they were vulnerable to predation. The Jesus Fellowship Trust, which is managing the group's affairs, has apologized and established a redress scheme for the hundreds of victims.</p>

          <p>The Catholic Church has beatified Floribert Bwana Chui Bin Kositi, a 26-year-old customs official from DR Congo who was murdered in 2007 after refusing bribes. Kositi was killed in a "mafia-style" murder for blocking a shipment of spoiled rice that could have poisoned the public, standing firm against corruption based on his devout Christian values. His case is on a fast track to sainthood, as the Church has declared him a martyr who died for his faith. Remembered for his integrity and commitment to social justice, especially helping street children, his story is being held up as an example of honesty against corruption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As England fans prepare for the tense Euro 2025 final, psychologists explain the intense physical and emotional reactions people experience during high-stakes games. The body's stress response, driven by hormones like adrenaline and cortisol, can cause an increased heart rate, sleeplessness, and other effects. Experts advise fans to manage these feelings by getting adequate rest, having a clear match-day plan, and staying nourished. They also suggest that movement can help dissipate nervous energy and that reframing the anxiety as part of an enjoyable, communal experience can make the event more positive, regardless of the outcome.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with July's average temperature running about one degree below normal. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. The cool temperatures are a stark contrast to the oppressive heat and wildfires seen in other parts of California. While some residents are enjoying the temperate conditions, experts note that the region's hottest weather often occurs in September, warning that the summer is not yet over.</p>

          <p>A new American Eagle campaign starring actress Sydney Sweeney has generated significant controversy and debate. The campaign, which promotes jeans to support domestic violence survivors, has been criticized by some for its suggestive tone, which they argue is "tone-deaf" and oversexualizes a serious issue. However, many fans have defended Sweeney and the ad, praising it for moving away from "woke advertising." Meanwhile, American Eagle executives are betting on Sweeney's star power to revive sales, calling her their biggest collaboration yet as the brand's stock sees a notable increase.</p>

          <p>A union representing 12,000 grocery employees at Stater Bros. Markets in Southern California has voted to authorize a strike. The United Food and Commercial Workers Local 135 stated the vote was prompted by the company allegedly breaking labor laws through surveillance and discrimination against union members. While the authorization does not trigger an immediate walkout, it strengthens the union's position ahead of contract negotiations scheduled for late July. The move follows the supermarket chain's decision earlier this year to lay off 63 clerks, a first in its 89-year history, citing inflation.</p>

The move comes after months of warnings about famine due to aid restrictions, with hundreds of Palestinians recently killed while trying to access food distribution sites. While Israel stated combat operations will continue, the planned airdrops and humanitarian pauses signal a shift in approach. However, the head of the UN's Palestinian refugee agency warned that airdrops are an inefficient and potentially dangerous solution to the crisis.</p>
