        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young Japanese workers are adopting the concept of "quiet quitting," prioritizing personal time and interests over career advancement and higher pay. Unlike previous generations who dedicated their lives to their employers, these individuals clock in and out on time, showing indifference to promotions or performance-related bonuses. This shift is motivated by a desire for better work-life balance and a rejection of the sacrifices made by their parents' generation. The coronavirus pandemic has further solidified this attitude, with young adults finding it difficult to accept lifetime commitments to one company. The article suggests this change could lead to a healthier and more balanced society, reducing the risk of 'karoshi,' or death by overwork. </p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields experienced a decline as investors weighed the impact of President Trump's proposed tariffs on the European Union and Apple. Trump's recommendation of a 50% tariff on EU goods and a 25% tariff on iPhones manufactured outside the U.S. led to a sell-off in stocks and a flight to safety in bonds. This move comes after a week of bond market volatility driven by concerns over Trump's budget bill and Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating.
