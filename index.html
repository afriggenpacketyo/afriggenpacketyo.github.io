        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of England and Wales' water sector reveals systemic failures requiring stronger regulation to protect billpayers and the environment. The Water Commission, led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, highlights shaken public trust due to pollution, mismanagement, and infrastructure failures. The government acknowledges the system is "broken" and plans a full response to the commission's recommendations, which are expected later this summer. The sector faces increasing pressure from climate change, population growth, and decades of underinvestment, with sewage spills lasting over 3.6 million hours in both 2023 and 2024. The report emphasizes the need for fundamental reset within the water sector. </p>

          <p>South Korea's opposition party leader, Lee Jae-myung, is projected to win the country's snap presidential election, according to a Gallup poll cited by Yonhap. Lee, who narrowly lost the 2022 election to ousted president Yoon Suk Yeol, holds a significant lead over his rival, Kim Moon Soo. Eurasia Group also predicts an 80% chance of victory for Lee, anticipating a more left-leaning agenda and potential shifts in trade negotiations with the U.S. Goldman Sachs notes similarities between Lee and Kim's goals, but highlights differences in their economic policy platforms, with Lee favoring fiscal support for strategic industries. The Bank of Korea recently cut rates, expecting economic growth to decline, and the South Korean won is anticipated to appreciate against the U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

His remarks follow the central bank's revised economic growth and price projections for the current fiscal year. Trade frictions caused by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs could slow the global economy and reduce profits for domestic companies, leading to a cautious approach to future rate hikes.
