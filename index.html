          <p>World champion pitmaster Josh Cooper shares his essential advice for a winning tailgate experience as college football season returns. He emphasizes that thorough preparation, including making lists for food, supplies, and safety items like shade tents and hand-washing stations, is crucial. Cooper also advises that the game's kickoff time should dictate the menu, and that food should be easy to handle and eat on the move. Finally, he stresses the importance of cleaning up the tailgate area properly to ensure the tradition can be enjoyed for years to come.</p>

          <p>The baseball bat used by 12-year-old Marco Rocco in a celebratory bat flip that led to his temporary suspension has been sold at auction for $9,882. The incident gained national attention after Rocco's father successfully took legal action to overturn the suspension, allowing his son to play in the state tournament. All proceeds from the auction, which drew significant interest, will be donated back to the Haddonfield Little League program. The event was even commemorated with a pin at the Little League World Series.</p>

          <p>Russian forces launched a massive wave of nearly 540 drones and 45 missiles across 14 regions of Ukraine, resulting in at least one death and 30 injuries. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the barrage and called for stronger international sanctions against Moscow. In response, Ukraine's military conducted its own drone strikes, successfully hitting and causing fires at major Russian oil refineries in Krasnodar and Syzran. The attacks occurred amid ongoing diplomatic efforts to end the war, which have so far failed to produce a breakthrough.</p>

          <p>Cellist Yo-Yo Ma and Afropop singer Angélique Kidjo performed their collaborative show, “Sarabande Africaine,” at the Hollywood Bowl, exploring the African origins of the Baroque sarabande dance. The performance fused Bach and Handel with traditional African drumming, Caribbean percussion, and modern arrangements of songs by Gershwin and Philip Glass. Kidjo commanded the stage with vibrant energy, while Ma's cello provided a complementary, often subtle, foundation. The concert was a celebration of cross-cultural musical connection, demonstrating how diverse traditions can enrich one another.</p>

          <h2>UK Councils Continue Legal Challenges Against Use of Hotels for Asylum Seekers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 11:24:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several local councils in England are proceeding with legal action to prevent hotels from housing asylum seekers, despite a recent Court of Appeal ruling that overturned an injunction in Epping. The ruling was seen as a setback for councils arguing that using hotels for this purpose constitutes an unauthorized change of use and creates public safety risks. Despite the government's victory in court, councils in West Northamptonshire and Broxbourne have confirmed they will press on with their own legal challenges, reflecting ongoing local and political tensions over national immigration policy.</p>

          <p>Andriy Parubiy, the former speaker of Ukraine's parliament and a key figure in the 2014 Euromaidan protests, has been shot and killed in the western city of Lviv. Unverified footage shows a gunman, reportedly disguised as a courier, approaching Parubiy and shooting him before fleeing. President Volodymyr Zelensky called the attack a "terrible murder," and a nationwide manhunt is underway for the suspect. Parubiy was a pivotal leader during the pro-European movement that ousted a pro-Russian president and later served as secretary of the National Security and Defence Council.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 11:13:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's imposition of widespread "reciprocal tariffs" on nearly all trading partners was an illegal use of presidential power. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which Trump used to justify the levies, does not grant the authority to impose tariffs. The ruling upholds a lower court's decision but keeps the tariffs in place until mid-October to allow for an appeal to the Supreme Court, setting the stage for a major legal battle with significant implications for the US economy and global trade.</p>

          <p>After a landmark study identified agricultural pollution as a major source of Iowa's water quality issues, funding designated for promoting the report's findings has been quietly eliminated. The two-year, $1 million study by 16 scientists detailed how contaminants from the state's powerful farm industry pose health risks, including potential links to high cancer rates. With over $400,000 remaining in the budget for public outreach, the sudden removal of these funds has raised concerns among environmental advocates that political and industry pressure is being used to suppress the controversial findings.</p>

          <p>Longtime investor Rebecca Patterson has cautioned that President Trump's efforts to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook represent a significant threat to the central bank's political independence. Patterson, a former Bridgewater strategist, warns that politicizing the Fed could erode its credibility and lead to severe long-term economic consequences, such as higher inflation, weaker stock market performance, and a depreciated currency. She suggests that while markets might initially react positively to politically motivated lower interest rates, the sustained damage to institutional integrity would ultimately harm the US economy.

          <p>In an opinion piece, a Palestinian writer argues that the world is only now beginning to acknowledge the possibility of genocide in Gaza after months of Palestinian deaths and pleas being dismissed. The author contends that a deliberate, philosophical dehumanization of Palestinians allowed their testimony to be consistently disbelieved and their suffering ignored by Western institutions and media. The article criticizes the double standards in media coverage and the belated concern from experts, suggesting this shift comes only after the death toll reached a level that Western consciences could no longer ignore.</p>

The analysis considered factors like financial aid, cost after aid, and median post-graduation salaries to determine value. Many of the top-ranked institutions, including MIT and Harvard, have large endowments that fund generous no-loan financial aid policies, allowing students from lower and middle-income families to graduate debt-free and secure high-paying jobs.

          <p>After a nearly 50-year career at The Washington Post covering 12 presidential elections, political correspondent Dan Balz is retiring. In a reflection on his career, Balz identified the most significant shift in American politics as its evolution into a tougher, coarser, and meaner environment. He noted that public trust in government plummeted during the Vietnam and Watergate eras and has failed to recover since. This long-term decline in civic trust has fundamentally altered the nation's political dynamics.</p>

Such a shift risks long-term economic damage, including the potential for hyperinflation and instability, by dismantling the credibility the institution has built over decades.

While overall visitor counts are down, Nevada's gaming revenue continues to grow, indicating that those who do visit are spending more. Officials are hopeful that a strong calendar of fall events will help reverse the negative trend.</p>

The piece contends that capitulating to this "extortion" would set a dangerous precedent and betray the university's values and its faculty and students.</p>
