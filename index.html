          <p>President Trump publicly contradicted his director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, regarding Iran's nuclear capabilities, stating that she was "wrong" in her assessment that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon. This marks the second time in a week that Trump has dismissed Gabbard's assessment, as the White House claims Iran possesses the means to produce a nuclear weapon within weeks, needing only the supreme leader's approval. Gabbard later clarified her testimony, stating that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months if they decide to finalize the assembly. The president is expected to decide within two weeks whether to join Israel in potential strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, adding urgency to the conflicting intelligence assessments.</p>

          <p>Kroger has announced plans to close 60 of its supermarkets across the United States over the next 18 months, representing approximately 5% of its Kroger-branded stores. The decision comes as the company reported a slight decrease in first-quarter sales, totaling $45.1 billion compared to $45.3 billion in the previous year. Kroger anticipates that these closures will result in a modest financial benefit, with savings reinvested into customer experience initiatives. The company has assured that all employees at the affected stores will be offered positions at other Kroger locations, mitigating the impact on its workforce.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against a Louisiana law that required the Ten Commandments to be displayed in every public school classroom, deeming it unconstitutional. The court affirmed a lower court's decision, siding with civil liberties groups who argued the law violates the separation of church and state and could isolate non-Christian students. Republican backers of the law claimed the Ten Commandments are foundational to U.S. law and should be displayed for historical context. The legal challenge was brought by parents from various religious backgrounds who argued the mandate infringes upon religious freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment.</p>

          <p>Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, stated that Iran would consider resuming diplomatic talks regarding its nuclear program only after Israel ceases its aggression. This statement came hours after Israel's defense minister warned of a "prolonged" conflict with Iran, amidst continued exchanges of violence. Araghchi met with European diplomats in Geneva, where he emphasized that Iran's nuclear program is peaceful and that Israel's attacks constitute a violation of international law, asserting Iran's right to self-defense. He clarified that Iran's defense capabilities are non-negotiable but expressed readiness to meet again in the near future, indicating a potential path for future discussions.</p>

          <p>José González Valencia, the brother-in-law of Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) leader "El Mencho," was sentenced to 30 years in U.S. federal prison for orchestrating a large-scale drug trafficking operation. González Valencia, who led the "Los Cuinis" group that financed CJNG's drug trafficking, was arrested in Brazil in 2017. The U.S. government has been intensifying its efforts to weaken the CJNG, which is responsible for importing significant amounts of drugs into the United States. The Trump administration previously designated CJNG as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, providing authorities with additional tools to prosecute those associated with the cartel.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a roughly 2% decrease following President Trump's decision to delay potential military action against Iran, expressing a preference for diplomatic negotiations regarding Iran's nuclear program. Trump stated that he would make a decision within two weeks, allowing time for possible negotiations with the Islamic Republic. However, Israel is escalating its attacks on Iran, with Prime Minister Netanyahu ordering intensified strikes on strategic and government targets after an Iranian missile struck a hospital in southern Israel. This situation highlights the delicate balance between potential diplomatic resolutions and ongoing military actions in the region.</p>

          <p>Barry Morphew has been indicted by a grand jury in Colorado for the murder of his wife, Suzanne Morphew, who was reported missing in May 2020 and whose remains were found in September 2023. He was previously charged with her presumed murder in 2021, but those charges were dropped shortly before trial. The indictment states that Suzanne Morphew's body was found near Moffat, Colorado, and her death was ruled a homicide caused by "undetermined means in the setting of butorphanol, azaperone, and medetomidine intoxication." Barry Morphew, a former deer farmer, had access to these sedatives, which are used to tranquilize animals.</p>

          <p>The United States is bracing for the first significant heat wave of the summer, with much of the country expecting temperatures that will feel like they are in the triple digits. Cities like Philadelphia have issued code red warnings to provide indoor shelter for the homeless, as the heat index is forecast to remain above 95 degrees for several consecutive days. The National Weather Service advises people to take precautions, including staying indoors, using air conditioning, and drinking plenty of water, to avoid heat-related complications. Climate change is contributing to heat waves that are lasting longer and reaching higher temperatures than in the past.</p>

A Tesla Safety Monitor will be present in the front passenger seat during trips, which will be confined to a geofenced area of the city and monitored remotely.

VOA once reached 360 million people weekly across dozens of languages, but now only 250 employees remain across the entire parent group, the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM).

          <p>Matthew Muller, who was the subject of the Netflix documentary “American Nightmare,” pleaded guilty to a 1993 kidnapping and sexual assault in Northern California. In 1993, Muller held a couple at gunpoint while they camped at Folsom Lake in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Muller then tied up the male victim and proceeded to carry away and sexually assault the female victim. The latest conviction is part of a string of similar sex crimes committed by Muller, who is currently serving a 40-year prison sentence for a 2015 kidnapping and sexual assault in Vallejo, Calif., and a life sentence for two 2009 kidnappings and assaults in Santa Clara.</p>
