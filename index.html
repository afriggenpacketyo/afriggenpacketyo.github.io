          <p>Rescue efforts are ongoing in Texas following severe flooding, with the number of confirmed fatalities rising to 130. A flood watch remains in effect for the Texas Hill Country, as showers and thunderstorms are expected to bring an additional one to two inches of rain, with isolated areas potentially receiving up to five inches. The persistent rainfall complicates the search for missing individuals in the disaster-stricken region. Forecasters anticipate that the weather will begin to clear by Thursday, offering a period of dry skies that may aid recovery operations.</p>

          <p>Australia is hosting its largest-ever Talisman Sabre military exercise, involving over 35,000 personnel from 19 nations, including the U.S., Japan, and several European and Pacific countries. The drills, which now extend to Papua New Guinea for the first time, showcase advanced military hardware like the HIMARS rocket system. Australian officials anticipate that Chinese surveillance ships will monitor the exercises, a practice observed since 2017, but stated it will not disrupt the proceedings. The event underscores the strengthening defense alliance between Australia and the United States amid complex geopolitical dynamics in the region.</p>

          <p>An independent inquiry into the BBC's "MasterChef" has substantiated 45 out of 83 allegations against presenter Gregg Wallace, including claims of unwelcome physical contact and inappropriate language. The report, commissioned by production company Banijay, covers a 19-year period and also notes Wallace's recent autism diagnosis, which he stated he does not wish to use as an excuse. Both the BBC and Banijay have apologized for missed opportunities to address the behavior sooner, and the BBC has confirmed it has no future plans to work with Wallace.</p>

          <p>Following a fatal Air India crash that killed 260 people, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has stated that the fuel control switches on Boeing aircraft are not an unsafe condition. A preliminary report from Indian investigators suggested that the switches on the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner were accidentally moved to the "cut-off" position, referencing a 2018 FAA advisory that recommended inspections of the switch's locking feature. Despite this, the FAA maintains that the issue does not warrant a mandatory airworthiness directive, while Air India's CEO has cautioned against drawing premature conclusions from the initial findings.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Aniston is set to portray the domineering mother in a new series based on Jennette McCurdy's memoir, "I’m Glad My Mom Died." The role resonates with Aniston's own publicly discussed, complicated relationship with her late mother, Nancy Dow, whom she described as a critical model who often made her feel inadequate. McCurdy's book details her struggles as a child actor under an abusive and controlling mother. The upcoming Apple TV+ dramedy will explore the codependent relationship between a young actress and her narcissistic mother, a theme Aniston has previously connected with in her work.</p>

          <p>Undocumented farm workers across the U.S. report feeling as if they are being "hunted like animals" as the Trump administration intensifies immigration enforcement. Raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have created a climate of fear, causing workers to lose income and live in constant stress. This crackdown affects a workforce vital to the nation's food supply, with an estimated 40% of U.S. farm workers being undocumented. Advocates criticize the administration's approach, arguing it demonizes essential workers and creates instability for families and communities.</p>

With as much as 30 percent of their habitat gone, researchers are capturing a small number of the amphibians to establish a captive breeding program at the North Carolina Zoo.

          <p>In her new book "Resurface," former Olympic diver Cassidy Krug explores how to navigate major life changes, drawing from her own transition out of professional sports. Krug argues that transitions are an inevitable part of life and that embracing uncertainty is a skill that can be developed. She emphasizes that major shifts often involve a loss of community and require a redefinition of personal success. The book suggests using rituals to honor the past and taking small, concrete steps to explore new interests, rather than waiting for a new passion to appear suddenly.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while protesting harsh ICE raids is important, the U.S. must also address the economic system that relies on low-wage, undocumented labor.

          <p>Despite nearly every U.S. county experiencing flooding, only 4% of homeowners have flood insurance, creating a significant protection gap. Experts note that standard homeowner policies do not cover flood damage, and federal disaster aid is often insufficient, leaving many financially vulnerable as climate change fuels more intense rainfall. The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is the primary source of coverage, but rising premiums are making it unaffordable for many. This financial barrier forces many to risk devastating losses, highlighting a national challenge in adapting to increasing climate-related threats. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is over 90% methane, is being rebranded as "green" energy by some US states and the EU, who view it as a bridge fuel away from coal. However, critics argue that LNG's climate impact is significant, with some studies suggesting its greenhouse gas footprint is larger than coal's over a 20-year period due to methane leaks and the energy-intensive process of liquefaction and transport. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, 85 times more powerful than CO2 over two decades, complicating claims of LNG being a clean energy source.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced plans for a significant increase in defense spending, stating that freedom has never been so threatened since 1945. Citing threats from Russia, cybercrime, and terrorism, Macron called for a budget increase that would double France's 2017 defense spending by 2027. He argued that to be free, a nation must be feared, and to be feared, it must be powerful. The proposal faces hurdles in the French parliament, as it comes at a time when the government is also trying to implement austerity measures to reduce its large budget deficit.</p>

          <p>The UK government has launched a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, suggesting that turning the state-owned enterprise into an employee-owned business is a possibility. This move aims to transform the organization's culture following the Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of subpostmasters. The 12-week consultation will seek input on a new vision for the service, focusing on meeting consumer needs and rebuilding the relationship with its postmasters. The government also announced an additional £118 million to support ongoing changes within the organization.</p>

          <p>Democrat Janelle Stelson will again challenge Republican Rep. Scott Perry for his congressional seat in a right-leaning Pennsylvania district after a narrow loss in 2024.

Perry defends the bill as a necessary measure to curb spending. With Democrats needing to flip just three seats to regain the House majority, this race is seen as a key battleground for the 2026 midterms.</p>

          <p>A new approach called social prescribing is being adopted by healthcare providers in over 30 countries to improve patient health by connecting them with community activities like art, exercise, and volunteering. The model focuses on what matters to the patient rather than just their ailments, complementing traditional medical treatments. Proponents, featured in the new book "The Connection Cure," highlight its success in managing chronic conditions like Type 2 diabetes and improving mental health. Studies show the approach not only enhances well-being but also reduces healthcare costs by lowering emergency room visits.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County is exploring the creation of a voluntary disaster registry to assist disabled and senior residents during emergencies, a move prompted by deaths in recent wildfires. However, many disability advocates are critical of such registries, arguing they provide a false sense of security without guaranteeing evacuation help. Citing failures of similar systems during past disasters like Hurricane Harvey, advocates warn that these databases can deter individuals from making their own robust emergency plans.

          <p>A federal jury trial is set to begin in Florida for a lawsuit against Tesla concerning a 2019 fatal crash involving its Autopilot system. The crash killed a 22-year-old woman when a Model S, with Autopilot engaged, failed to stop and slammed into a parked SUV. The plaintiffs accuse Tesla of exaggerating the capabilities of its driver-assistance technology, encouraging over-reliance by drivers. Tesla maintains its systems are safe when used properly with an attentive driver, but a judge ruled that a jury could reasonably find the company acted with reckless disregard for human life.</p>

          <p>The term "moderate Republican" is evolving, often now applied to conservative lawmakers who break with former President Trump on key issues. The case of North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis, who announced his retirement after opposing a Trump-backed spending bill, exemplifies this trend. Despite a career marked by conservative legislative victories, his opposition earned him the label "Republican In Name Only" (RINO). Political scientists note that the GOP has shifted significantly to the right, making unwavering loyalty to Trump, rather than traditional conservative ideology, the primary measure of a Republican's credentials.</p>
