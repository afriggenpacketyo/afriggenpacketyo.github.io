          <p>This CNBC article reports on the impact of the temporary tariff cuts between the U.S. and China, particularly on the retail sector. The pause is expected to alleviate potential product shortages for the upcoming Christmas season, as Chinese factories can resume production for U.S. clients. However, some previously imposed tariffs remain in place, and businesses still face added costs for logistics, potentially leading to overall price increases. The article also mentions that while this provides short-term relief, businesses are hopeful for a permanent agreement between the two countries.</p>
