          <p>Macy's exceeded Wall Street's second-quarter expectations, causing its stock to rise significantly. The retailer attributed the positive performance to revamped stores and strong sales in categories like denim and women's apparel. Consequently, the company has raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance, expressing cautious optimism despite potential headwinds from tariffs. The report also highlighted growth across its other brands, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury, and an increase in credit card revenues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed edible microbeads made from green tea, vitamin E, and seaweed that show potential for aiding weight loss. In a study on rats fed a high-fat diet, the microbeads led to a 17% reduction in body weight by blocking fat absorption in the gut. The beads, which are nearly flavorless, reportedly caused fewer gastrointestinal side effects than the FDA-approved drug orlistat. While the components are individually FDA-approved, the formulation awaits regulatory clearance, with human clinical trials currently underway.</p>

          <p>School districts across the United States are grappling with the effects of extreme heat, leading to early dismissals and discussions about fundamental changes to the school year. Many school buildings, designed for a cooler climate, lack adequate air conditioning, disproportionately affecting students in low-income communities. Potential solutions being explored include modernizing HVAC systems, increasing green space, and even shifting the traditional summer break to a cooler season. New York has already passed legislation setting maximum classroom temperatures, highlighting a growing need to adapt educational systems to the climate crisis.</p>

          <p>A Morgan Stanley analysis suggests that China's major property developers are poised for a business recovery in the latter half of the year, following a challenging first half. The report predicts that the pace of sales and profitability decline will slow significantly, with an anticipated 2% drop for the rest of the year, culminating in a 10% decrease overall. The bank's positive outlook is based on developers' guidance, expectations of margin recovery, and a large inventory of completed homes in major cities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Lorena has formed over the Pacific Ocean and is forecast to move parallel to the coast of Mexico's Baja California peninsula, potentially bringing life-threatening conditions. The U.S. National Hurricane Center has warned of heavy rainfall, which could lead to severe flash floods and mudslides, particularly in mountainous regions. While the storm is expected to weaken back to a tropical storm by Friday, tropical storm warnings and watches are in effect for parts of the peninsula. A second, more powerful hurricane, Kiko, is also active in the Pacific but is not currently considered a threat to land.</p>

The salary thresholds will be determined based on factors like age, league, and experience, following consultation with the Professional Footballers’ Association. This move is part of a broader effort to professionalize the game, which also includes increased standards for club facilities and player welfare.</p>

This trend involves suggesting the U.S. should have sided with Nazi Germany or downplaying the severity of Hitler's atrocities, framing him as unfairly maligned. The article argues this is not just provocation but a deliberate attempt to dismantle the post-war American consensus against antisemitism. By questioning the historical narrative of WWII, these influencers seek to normalize conspiratorial prejudices that were more common in the pre-war era.</p>

The piece contends that their tenure has been marked by capitulation to Republicans and an inability to mount an effective opposition to the Trump administration's agenda. It concludes that the current political moment demands more fearless and energetic leadership to protect democracy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a series of highly unusual moves, federal grand juries in Washington, D.C., have recently rejected at least four separate indictment requests from the Department of Justice. One case involved a woman accused of making a threat against President Trump on Instagram, while others included charges of assaulting a federal agent and interfering with law enforcement. Former federal prosecutors described the rejections as exceptionally rare, suggesting a potential loss of credibility between the Justice Department and local jurors. The rejections force prosecutors to either drop the cases or reconsider their legal strategies.</p>

          <p>China's recent military parade featured the public debut of several new and advanced intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), signaling significant progress in its nuclear arsenal. Among the surprises were the previously unknown DF-61 and DF-31BJ missiles, as well as the advanced DF-5C and the submarine-launched JL-3. The DF-61, presented as a nuclear-capable ICBM, is believed to be a substantial upgrade to the DF-41, which was previously considered China's most advanced long-range missile. This display of sophisticated military hardware underscores China's focus on modernizing its strategic deterrent forces.</p>

          <p>Six months into his second term, Donald Trump's once-strong support within the influential "manosphere" podcasting ecosystem appears to be fracturing. While some hosts remain loyal, many prominent figures like Joe Rogan and Andrew Schulz have become more critical, expressing disillusionment with the administration's policies on tariffs, government transparency, and foreign affairs. This shift is significant as these podcasts reach tens of millions of listeners, particularly young men who were a key part of Trump's winning coalition. The fragmentation of this media support could present a challenge for the MAGA movement in maintaining its unconventional voter base.</p>

          <p>While colonizing Mars is a long-term goal for figures like Elon Musk and NASA, significant hurdles in space medicine must be overcome before humans can safely make the journey. The human body is ill-suited for long-duration spaceflight, facing risks like bone density loss, muscle atrophy, and heightened cancer risk from radiation. The nascent field of space medicine is working to address these challenges, but research is limited by the small number of astronauts who have traveled to space. Future advances, potentially involving AI diagnostics and personalized countermeasures, are essential to make interplanetary travel a viable reality for a broader population.</p>

          <p>An opinion article contends that the Republican Party, under the influence of the MAGA movement, has effectively won a "war on science," culminating in the confirmation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services. The author contrasts the current political climate with that of former Republican senator and doctor Bill Frist, who supported major public health initiatives. The piece highlights that all four doctor-senators, who are Republicans, voted to confirm Kennedy, an anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist, leading to a crisis at the CDC and the defunding of crucial research, representing a dangerous break between science and ideology.</p>

          <p>Greg Gutfeld's program "Gutfeld!" on Fox News has become a dominant force in late-night television, attracting over 3 million nightly viewers and topping the ratings in its 10 p.m. time slot. The show's success is attributed to its irreverent and unpredictable comedic style, which offers a conservative-leaning alternative to mainstream late-night hosts. Gutfeld, who also co-hosts "The Five," argues that other late-night shows alienated a large portion of the country, creating an opportunity he was able to capitalize on. His approach focuses on humor and entertainment, aiming to send viewers to bed happy rather than enraged by politics.</p>

          <p>A historical review of California politics reveals a consistent pattern of extremely wealthy candidates failing in their bids for governor or U.S. senator, despite spending vast personal fortunes. Over the past five decades, numerous affluent individuals, such as Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina, have been unable to translate their business success into electoral victory for the state's highest offices. Analysts suggest that while wealth provides the means to campaign in the expensive state, voters are often suspicious of candidates who seem out of touch with the lives of average people. This history provides context for billionaire Rick Caruso's potential entry into the gubernatorial race.</p>

          <p>After decades of costly temporary repairs, the California Department of Transportation is moving forward with a plan to build a $2.1 billion tunnel to bypass Last Chance Grade, a treacherous three-mile section of Highway 101. This stretch of road, built on active landslides, is the only viable link for Del Norte County to the rest of the state and has been plagued by closures and instability for over 50 years. The proposed 6,000-foot tunnel through the redwoods would provide a permanent, safer route, though securing funding remains a major challenge. The project highlights the struggle of remote communities to address critical infrastructure needs.</p>

          <p>A large group of over 85 prominent climate researchers has publicly denounced a recent climate report from the Trump administration's Department of Energy, calling it biased and scientifically unsound. In a detailed 459-page critique, the scientists assert that the federal report misrepresents evidence, relies on discredited research, and fails to reflect the current scientific consensus on global warming. The administration's report had downplayed the economic damage of climate change and was used to support the repeal of the EPA's endangerment finding. This rebuttal marks one of the most significant repudiations of the administration's efforts to undermine climate science.</p>

          <p>California is currently experiencing a summer wave of COVID-19, with rising case numbers, hospitalizations, and high levels of the virus detected in wastewater across the state. In response to the increased transmission, some local health officials are once again recommending that residents wear masks in indoor public settings. While the overall level of hospital admissions remains categorized as "low," the rate has been steadily increasing for weeks. The updated 2025-26 COVID-19 vaccine is expected to become available soon, though new administration rules for younger, healthy individuals have drawn some criticism.</p>
