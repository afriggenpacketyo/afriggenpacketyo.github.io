          <p>Sean "Diddy" Combs' defense team is signaling a shift in trial strategy as prosecutors approach the end of their case. The defense now plans to present its case in two to five days, a contrast to the initial request of up to two weeks. Experts suggest this adjustment indicates weaknesses observed in the prosecution's case, which relies heavily on testimony from former partners and employees. The charges against Combs include racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking, carrying a minimum sentence of 15 years and a maximum of life imprisonment, but he has maintained his innocence throughout the trial. During the trial, the jury viewed videos and text messages related to the case, and the judge cautioned lawyers about violating a sealing order.</p>

          <p>China successfully conducted the first test flight of its next-generation Mengzhou crewed spacecraft, a crucial step towards its lunar ambitions in 2030. The test involved a zero-altitude escape trial at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre, where the spacecraft's escape engines ignited while grounded, simulating an emergency during launch. The return capsule reached the designated altitude, separated cleanly from the escape tower, and landed safely using parachutes and an airbag system. This safety verification ensures crew survival during potential rocket failures at liftoff, marking China's first such test since 1998, when a similar trial was conducted for the Shenzhou spacecraft program.</p>

          <p>Honda, Japan's second-largest carmaker, announced the successful test of an experimental reusable space rocket on Hokkaido, aiming for suborbital space flight by 2029. The rocket reached an altitude of nearly 300 meters before landing successfully, showcasing Honda's technologies amassed from various products and automated driving systems. Honda sees growing demand for satellite launch rockets due to increasing expectations for a "data system in outer space." While there are no firm plans for commercialization, Honda believes this technology could contribute to people's lives through satellite launches compatible with other Honda businesses. This move aligns with Japan's broader push to become a major player in satellite launches, with government subsidies encouraging startups in reusable rocket technology.</p>

          <p>The Co-op retailer is providing its members with a £10 discount on purchases of £40 or more following a recent cyber attack that resulted in the theft of customer data. The grocery chain stated it has not fully recovered from the incident. While the offer aims to attract customers back, some analysts believe it may not appeal to many due to the high spending threshold. A Co-op source indicated that stock levels have returned to normal, and the offer is a proactive measure ahead of summer trading, though some suggest it is an attempt to regain customer loyalty after the breach.</p>

          <p>Urawa Reds lost 3-1 to River Plate in their Club World Cup debut, conceding all goals through headers. Despite spirited support at Seattle's Lumen Field, Urawa's defensive lapses cost them the match. Marius Hoibraten's offside header and Yusuke Matsuo's penalty conversion offered glimpses of hope, but River Plate capitalized on defensive errors. Matsuo noted that the match hinged on small details, and the team will need to improve their defense to advance in the tournament, where they face Italian giants Inter Milan next.</p>

Despite Meta's efforts, Altman claims that none of OpenAI's top talent has accepted the offers. Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, is reportedly frustrated with his company's AI progress and is investing heavily to assemble a leading AI team for its "superintelligence" lab. This comes after Meta delayed the release of its latest AI model due to capability concerns, and Zuckerberg is prepared to invest billions in top AI talent.</p>

Roberts was ejected after arguing with the umpires following Shohei Ohtani being hit by a pitch, adding to the already heightened emotions of the rivalry.

While blood donation rules will be updated in 2026, the plasma donation rules will take effect on July 14, with new guidelines focusing on anal sex with new or multiple partners, requiring a three-month waiting period. This change reflects research indicating no impact on blood and plasma safety, and aims to address the rising global demand for plasma.</p>

Families report being ignored when raising concerns, experiencing a lack of compassion, and feeling isolated in their experiences.

          <p>Japan's exports fell by 1.7% year-over-year in May, marking the steepest decline in eight months, primarily due to falling shipments to the United States and China. Automobile exports to the U.S. plummeted by 24.7%, contributing to the overall decline. The Bank of Japan has indicated that the country's growth is likely to moderate due to trade factors and a slowdown in overseas economies. The trade deficit stood at 637.6 billion yen in May, smaller than expected, but the deteriorating trade outlook poses a threat to Japan's economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hong Kong and Shanghai have signed an action plan to facilitate mainland Chinese companies' global expansion through Hong Kong's capital market. The agreement aims to enhance connectivity between the two cities by expanding the stock connect program to include more equities, bonds, ETFs, and gold. The plan also focuses on cross-border settlements and the use of the digital yuan.

          <p>The debate over whether the US should intervene in the conflict between Iran and Israel has highlighted divisions among President Trump's supporters. The possibility of US involvement has pitted isolationist and hawkish factions of the Republican party against each other. Some Trump supporters, such as Congressman Thomas Massie, have joined Democrats in opposing unauthorized military action against Iran. Others, like former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, have criticized Republican "warmongers," provoking a rebuke from Trump and sparking further debate among his base.</p>
