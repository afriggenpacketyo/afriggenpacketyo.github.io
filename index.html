          <p>President Trump stated that Apple CEO Tim Cook intends to increase the company's investments in the United States following the agreement between the U.S. and China to suspend tariffs for 90 days. Trump mentioned that Cook plans to build more plants in the U.S., potentially investing $500 billion. Apple had previously announced plans to expand its U.S. operations, including assembling AI servers in Houston. The temporary cooling of the U.S.-China trade war is expected to benefit Apple, which manufactures the majority of its devices in China and counts the region as a significant market.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at lowering U.S. drug prices by matching them to lower prices in other countries, reviving a policy known as the "most favored nation" approach. The order targets developed countries and focuses on drugs with the largest price disparities, including weight loss and diabetes treatments. The policy aims to cut out middlemen and allow direct sales from manufacturers to American citizens at the most favored nation price. Pharmaceutical industry groups have criticized the order, while AARP has praised it.</p>

          <p>A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicates that tirzepatide, sold as Zepbound and Mounjaro, may lead to greater weight loss compared to semaglutide, known as Ozempic and Wegovy. The study found that tirzepatide users lost about 20% of their body weight, while semaglutide users lost about 14% over a 72-week period. While this study was funded by Lilly, the maker of tirzepatide, experts note that both drugs offer additional health benefits such as improved blood pressure and cholesterol levels. The high cost and limited insurance coverage of these medications remain significant challenges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the costs associated with credit counseling and compares them to other debt relief options. While initial consultations with nonprofit credit counseling agencies are often free, debt management plans typically involve setup and monthly maintenance fees, but these fees are generally lower than the interest on high-balance credit cards or fees for other debt relief methods. Credit counseling can provide expert insight, budgeting assistance, and tailored debt management strategies. Unlike debt settlement or bankruptcy, credit counseling usually doesn't harm credit scores and may even improve them over time.</p>
