          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz criticized Israel's military conduct in Gaza, calling it "beyond comprehension" following an Israeli airstrike on a school sheltering displaced civilians. The Israeli government's slow response suggests the remarks have had an impact, as Merz's comments are considered significant due to Germany's historical ties with Israel. Experts believe the Israeli government heard Merz's remarks loud and clear, especially given growing international pressure and the questioning of EU trade ties with Israel, which are contingent on upholding human rights. The article suggests that many Israelis fear their country is losing standing and can no longer be considered part of the western community of values.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration will "aggressively revoke" visas of Chinese students, including those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in "critical fields." The State Department will revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of future applications from China and Hong Kong. This move is likely to strain relations between the U.S. and China and could impact American universities that rely on international students. The decision has prompted concerns about the scope and impact on Chinese students in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade blocked reciprocal tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on numerous countries, stating that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize a president to levy universal duties on imports. The ruling potentially undermines Trump's economic agenda and trade negotiations. The court's decision ordered a permanent halt to the tariffs and barred future modifications. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling, but the Supreme Court could have the final say.</p>

While momentum for sanctions increased after Britain joined France and Canada in condemning Israel's military operations, the recent shooting of Israeli embassy employees in Washington has caused some hesitation.
