          <p>Thailand has closed two border crossings to tourists as a safety precaution due to ongoing tensions with Cambodia, following a military clash that resulted in the death of a Cambodian soldier. The Thai army has reinforced its military presence along the border, citing threats to the country's sovereignty and security, while Cambodia insists its stance is defensive. Trade will remain unaffected, and Cambodian workers can still enter Thailand, though other checkpoints have tightened their opening hours. Both countries have agreed to hold bilateral talks to resolve the border dispute, which stems from disagreements over demarcated points along their shared 817-kilometer border, an issue that has caused sporadic violence since 2008. Optimism is tempered by the history of conflict. </p>

          <p>Tesla faces mounting challenges after a public falling out between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump, triggered by Musk's criticism of Trump's spending bill. This disagreement escalated into a social media dispute, leading Trump to threaten the revocation of government contracts and subsidies for Musk's companies. The fallout caused Tesla shares to plummet, erasing billions in market value and straining the previously close relationship between Musk and the administration. Prior to the spat, Tesla was already struggling with declining revenue, increased competition, and backlash against Musk's political stances, which led to protests and boycotts against Tesla products. </p>

          <p>Earl Enderson Riley IV has been charged with multiple counts of residential burglary and robbery for targeting the homes of prominent athletes in the Seattle area. Riley allegedly stole over $6,000 in Louis Vuitton bags from Seattle Mariners pitcher Luis Castillo's home and more than $194,000 in purses and jewelry from Mariners center fielder Julio Rodriguez's residence. The thefts also included watches worth over $100,000 from former Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman's home, and an attempted burglary at Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell's home. The arrest follows a warning from the FBI about crime organizations targeting professional athletes due to the high-value items believed to be in their homes. </p>

          <p>Two nurses, Sabrina Castle and Gianna Formisano, saved the life of Merryl Hoffman after she suffered a sudden cardiac arrest in New York City. Hoffman collapsed near Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where the nurses, on their way to work, administered CPR until an ambulance arrived. Hoffman was later fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and underwent cardiac rehabilitation, eventually returning to work. The women reconnected after Hoffman shared her story, emphasizing the importance of bystander CPR in saving lives. </p>

          <p>Ukraine is pioneering new drone warfare tactics, consistently surprising Russia with innovative attacks. Recent examples include a stealthy strike on Russian warplanes using small drones hidden in trucks near air bases, and the use of sea drones to shoot down a Russian warplane. These tactics are forcing Russia to scramble to develop defenses and adapt to the evolving nature of drone warfare. Ukraine's drones are also creating problems for Russian ground forces by providing battlefield awareness and limiting troop movements, adding a huge force multiplier to Ukraine's defense efforts. </p>

This trend may contribute to a shared sense of wealth as the only measure of success, while also stimulating a desire to shop.

These claims are amplified on social media, but scientific evidence contradicts Trump's assertions. While whale strandings have occurred, there is no scientific evidence linking them to offshore wind activities. Wind turbines do cause bird deaths, but they are a relatively small factor compared to cats, collisions with buildings, and vehicles. The article concludes that there are efforts to improve wind energy recycling and that wind turbines do not operate at all times. </p>
