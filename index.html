          <p>Kering's shares experienced a 7% increase following reports that Luca de Meo, Renault's CEO, is expected to take over as the group's CEO. This news comes as Kering, the parent company of Gucci and Saint Laurent, is actively working on revitalizing its brands. De Meo's departure from Renault was confirmed, with analysts highlighting his strong brand management and marketing skills as beneficial to the luxury industry. However, challenges remain for Kering, particularly in rejuvenating the Gucci label, which has seen declining popularity, and analysts note that the success of luxury brand turnarounds has become more complex and costly, requiring significant investment.

          <p>Iran launched a barrage of missiles into Israel, resulting in at least five fatalities and numerous injuries, marking the fourth day of escalating conflict between the two nations. One missile struck near the American consulate in Tel Aviv, causing minor damage, while Israel responded by targeting command centers in Tehran. The ongoing conflict has led to the cancellation of nuclear program talks between the U.S. and Iran, and President Trump reportedly opposed an Israeli plan to assassinate Iran's Supreme Leader. Both sides have issued warnings, with Iran vowing further retaliation and Israel threatening consequences for Iranian strikes on civilians.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study finds that ice jams will become more frequent in the Yellow River's estuary due to global warming by the end of this century. Warmer weather causes upstream ice to break apart and drift downstream, where it can refreeze and accumulate in colder areas, forming ice jams. These localized hazards can cause destructive flooding, damaging downstream communities, wildlife, and infrastructure. Researchers analyzed 160 years of ice jam floods to reach their conclusions.</p>

          <p>Two Minnesota state lawmakers were shot in their homes, with one killed and the other seriously injured, in what Governor Tim Walz called a "politically motivated assassination" attempt. The suspect, Vance Luther Boelter, has been apprehended after a two-day manhunt. Melissa Hortman, a state representative, and her husband were killed, while State Senator John Hoffman and his wife were injured. Boelter, a former political appointee, reportedly had a list of potential targets, including Democratic politicians and Planned Parenthood locations.</p>

The restaurant was initially ordered to suspend business for two days after 33 customers fell ill, and later ordered to close indefinitely following additional cases of norovirus.

The order directs federal agencies to increase efforts in sanctuary cities, targeting Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York. This move follows a pause on raids at farms, hotels, restaurants, and meatpacking plants, and aligns with Trump's campaign promise to implement a large-scale deportation program. The order also aims to prevent anyone undermining the domestic tranquility of the United States from entering the country.</p>

          <p>Experts predict that up to 100 truckloads of Scotland's waste will be transported to England daily following the implementation of a landfill ban at the end of the year. The Scottish government acknowledges a shortage of incinerators to handle the extra demand, leading to concerns about a "capacity gap". The ban, covering biodegradable municipal waste, aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but may initially increase emissions due to transportation. Environmental groups worry that long-term contracts with incinerators may hinder investment in recycling initiatives.</p>
