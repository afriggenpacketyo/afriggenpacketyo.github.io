          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 08:05:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Voters in Taiwan have rejected a large-scale effort to remove 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result ensures the China-friendly KMT and its allies retain their majority in the legislature, posing a continued challenge to President Lai Ching-te's ruling Democratic Progressive Party. Political analysts suggest this outcome will make it significantly harder for President Lai to advance his agenda ahead of the 2028 elections. The recall was initiated by citizens concerned about the opposition blocking key legislation and passing laws seen as favoring Beijing.</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army has blacklisted the Aerospace Information Research Institute (AIR), a key entity under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, from all military procurement activities. The suspension was imposed as a penalty for bid rigging and collusion, marking the second time this year the institute has faced such a penalty. The institute is crucial for research in areas closely aligned with military needs, including remote sensing, aircraft design, and electronic countermeasures. The duration of the ban was not specified in the notice.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 75-year-old dog trainer, was diagnosed with terminal idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis after a routine X-ray discovered scarring on his lungs. With less than a year to live and his lung function rapidly declining, he was initially hesitant but ultimately underwent a successful double-lung transplant. Despite post-surgery complications, he has made a remarkable recovery, with his lung capacity now at 98%. He is back to training therapy dogs, naming his next puppy "Encore" to celebrate his new lease on life.</p>

          <p>Two years after a military coup ousted Niger's democratically elected president, the nation faces a deteriorating situation. The junta, led by General Abdourahmane Tchiani, has failed to improve security or economic conditions, with some analysts arguing things have worsened. The regime has cracked down on civil liberties, forced NGOs to cease operations, leading to job losses, and has shown no sign of returning to civilian rule. Human rights groups have condemned the arbitrary detention of former officials and the suppression of free expression.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young people in Germany are reporting feelings of loneliness, a trend exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the pervasive influence of social media. Experts warn this is not just a social issue but a potential threat to democracy, as studies show a correlation between loneliness and susceptibility to authoritarian thinking and conspiracy theories. The problem is particularly acute in rural areas with fewer opportunities for social interaction. Sociologists suggest this isolation can breed resentment and anger, making individuals feel disconnected from society.</p>

          <p>This essay reflects on the cultural impact of Sean "Puff Daddy" Combs and the sense of betrayal felt by those who once idolized him. During the 1990s, Combs became a formidable ambassador of "Black cool," representing ambition, success, and the ability to integrate into mainstream American life without sacrificing authenticity. The author recalls how Combs's open display of hard work and his presence in previously exclusive spaces was inspirational to a generation. The recent revelations of his cruelty have tarnished that legacy, turning a figure of aspiration into a symbol of profound disappointment.</p>

          <p>As climate change leads to hotter and more frequent heat waves, more Americans are forced to spend summers indoors to avoid the heat. This isolation and lack of sun exposure may be contributing to a rise in summer-pattern seasonal affective disorder (SAD), a rarer form of depression characterized by insomnia, restlessness, and anxiety. Experts suggest that avoiding the sun, similar to the lack of light in winter, could disrupt hormones that regulate mood. This creates a difficult choice for many between enduring dangerous heat outside or facing potential mental health consequences inside.</p>

Using a credit card to pay for expenses and then immediately paying off the balance with savings can allow couples to earn significant rewards, like points or miles for a honeymoon.

          <p>CBS's decision to end "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" in 2026 has fueled speculation about the viability of the traditional late-night talk show format. While some see it as a one-off financial decision by parent company Paramount, others view it as a sign of the genre's decline due to rising costs and shrinking linear TV audiences. The article notes that while Colbert's show was the highest-rated in its time slot, it still lost money annually. The future of the format may become clearer when Disney decides on the fate of "Jimmy Kimmel Live," whose contract expires in 2026.</p>

          <p>Wesleyan University President Michael Roth argues that the political right's campaign against higher education is a deliberate attempt to undermine civil society. In an interview, Roth states that by attacking high-profile universities, the Trump administration seeks to delegitimize institutions that operate independently of its ideology. He acknowledges that universities have problems, such as ideological narrowness among faculty and a focus on exclusivity, but contends these are not the true reasons for the assault. Roth believes the goal is to force conformity and stifle intellectual experimentation and dissent.</p>

          <p>NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Jared Verse recently endured what he described as a "psychotic" workout with retired legend Aaron Donald. After playfully challenging Donald on a podcast, Verse was put through a punishing full-body circuit that left him unable to move for over a day. Despite the trauma, Verse found the experience inspiring, as Donald emphasized the need to be strong in the fourth quarter of games. Verse now sees the workout as a benchmark for the level of dedication required to become one of the best defensive players of all time.</p>

          <p>Animal welfare advocates are pushing for the passage of the Captive Primate Safety Act, a federal bill that would ban the private ownership and breeding of primates in all 50 states. The legislation aims to slow a brutal industry where baby monkeys are poached from the wild, often after their mothers are killed, to be sold as pets. Experts at the Oakland Zoo, which rescues trafficked primates, state that these animals suffer from chronic stress, malnutrition, and psychological damage when raised by humans. The bill is currently stalled in a House committee.</p>

Survivors and local leaders claim these are not mere disputes over land but part of a campaign to drive them from their fertile land.

          <p>A growing number of high-earning Americans, sometimes called "HENRYs" (high earners, not rich yet), report not feeling wealthy despite their significant incomes. Experts point to rising costs, substantial debt, and "lifestyle creep" as primary reasons for this sentiment, with many six-figure earners still living paycheck to paycheck. Psychologists note a paradox where being in "accumulation mode" and saving money prevents the feeling of richness that spending would provide. As incomes rise, so do financial aspirations and anxieties, leaving many feeling like they are on a never-ending hamster wheel. (not investment advice)</p>

Upon re-entering Mexico, their truck and entire life savings of $5,000 were confiscated by Mexican customs officials.

This contradicts the administration's narrative, which highlights a minority of cases involving individuals with serious criminal histories.
