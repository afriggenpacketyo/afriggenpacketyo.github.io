        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Polish presidential election is too close to call, according to exit polls. Warsaw's liberal Mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, claimed victory with a slight lead of 50.3% over conservative historian Karol Nawrocki's 49.7%, but the margin is within the poll's 3% error range. Nawrocki told his supporters the result is too close to call, pending the official result due Monday morning. The president's role is largely ceremonial but includes veto power over legislation, which could impact Prime Minister Tusk's pro-EU agenda. The optimism score is based on the anticipation and tension surrounding the election's outcome.</p>
