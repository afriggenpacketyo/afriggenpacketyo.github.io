          <p>Frito-Lay has initiated a recall of select 13-ounce bags of Tostitos Cantina Traditional Yellow Corn Tortilla Chips due to potential contamination with nacho cheese tortilla chips, posing a risk to individuals with milk allergies. The recall affects less than 1,300 bags sold in 13 states across the Southeast and Midwest, with sales dating back to March 7th. While no allergic reactions have been reported, the company advises consumers with dairy sensitivities to check lot numbers on the FDA's website.

          <p>The US began collecting a 10% tariff on all imports, prompting market turmoil and global reactions. President Trump urged Americans to "hang tough" amid the volatility, describing it as an "economic revolution." The tariffs have sent shockwaves through global supply chains, with major stock indexes plunging and retaliatory measures announced by China. The UK and France expressed concerns, while Elon Musk suggested a potential zero-tariff situation between the US and Europe.&#x20;</p>

          <p>A conservative organization has filed a lawsuit challenging Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, arguing that the president lacked the authority to impose them. The New Civil Liberties Alliance argues that Mr Trump lacked the authority to impose these levies. Similar lawsuits against the broader tariff blitz of April 2nd could yet scuttle the boldest—and most destructive—move of Mr Trump’s second term. This lawsuit could potentially impact the broader tariff blitz and disrupt Trump's economic agenda.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, in its deportation campaign against Venezuelan immigrants, is relying on tattoos to identify alleged gang members, but many of these tattoos have innocent origins. Tattoo artists from the UK and India have discovered their art is being used as examples of gang tattoos, despite the tattoos having personal and unrelated meanings. Experts say that TDA, like most Venezuelan gangs, doesn’t use tattoos to signal membership, and several documents seen by The Independent clearly warn officers not to rely solely on tattoos.</p>

The court found that Paxton's office violated the Texas Whistleblower Act by retaliating against the employees for reporting allegations of bribery. Paxton denies the allegations and intends to appeal the ruling. The case stems from a federal investigation into Paxton's office after employees reported him for bribery allegations in 2020.</p>

          <p>The market reaction to Donald Trump’s announcement last Wednesday that he would be levying punitive tariffs on imports from the rest of the world was immediate: US stock markets experienced their worst single-day decline since Covid. The long-term implications will depend on how permanent Trump’s reshaping of the global economic order turns out to be. At the moment, his administration is sending contradictory signals as to whether these tariffs are here to stay, or whether they are intended to be used to in effect blackmail other countries into doing the bidding of the US. But the global recession they could trigger raises huge strategic headaches for a British government already struggling to square the fiscal circle and deliver its pledge to boost growth.</p>
