          <p>A new analysis reveals that American wages have not kept pace with inflation over the past four years, with average earnings falling 1.2 percentage points behind the rise in living costs. This persistent gap contributes to widespread public dissatisfaction with the economy, as many households struggle with diminished purchasing power. The study highlights that certain professions, particularly educators, have fallen further behind, while the overall growth in new, high-paying jobs has significantly slowed since before the pandemic.

          <p>This article investigates whether debt accumulated through "buy now, pay later" (BNPL) services qualifies for debt forgiveness programs. As unsecured debts, BNPL plans can technically be included, but eligibility often depends on the specific provider, some of whom may not negotiate settlements. For consumers struggling with these payments, the article also suggests alternative strategies such as direct negotiation with the lender, debt consolidation, or seeking guidance from a credit counselor.</p>

          <p>Organizers have canceled this year's Polari Prize, an award celebrating LGBTQ+ literature, following significant controversy surrounding the nomination of author John Boyne. The backlash stemmed from an article Boyne wrote supporting J.K. Rowling's views on trans issues, which led several other longlisted authors and a judge to withdraw in protest. The organization apologized for the hurt caused and hopes to bring the prize back in 2026 after a full governance review.</p>

Lai faces charges of collusion with foreign forces and sedition, which could lead to a life sentence if he is convicted. The trial is being closely watched internationally as a critical test of press freedom and judicial independence in Hong Kong following Beijing's imposition of the national security law.</p>

          <p>Hollie Strano, a long-time meteorologist for WKYC-TV in Cleveland, has taken on a new role providing weather forecasts for the Mix 94.1 radio station in Stark County, Ohio. Her departure from the television station after 22 years followed a DUI charge and her subsequent public discussion of her recovery from alcoholism. Strano has since filed a lawsuit against her former employer, alleging her termination was related to her decision to share her recovery journey.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests the Trump administration's recent directive to enforce the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act against wind farms may be politically motivated to hinder renewable energy development. While wind turbines do pose a risk to birds, the article points out that climate change and habitat loss are far greater threats to eagle populations. The administration's focus on this single issue is contrasted with its simultaneous efforts to weaken broader environmental protections that have historically helped these species recover.</p>

          <p>After a two-week standoff, Democratic lawmakers have returned to the Texas House of Representatives, restoring the quorum needed for legislative business to continue. Their return paves the way for the Republican majority to move forward with a controversial mid-decade redistricting plan designed to create up to five new GOP-leaning congressional seats. Democrats, who call the proposed map discriminatory, have pledged to challenge it through the legal system.</p>

Analysts suggest the market is not concerned about a price war for Lilly, given the strong insurance coverage for its own competing medications. (not investment advice)</p>
