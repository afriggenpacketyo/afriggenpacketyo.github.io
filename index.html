          <p>Vishwaskumar Ramesh, the sole survivor of the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad, India, recounted his harrowing experience, stating he "thought I would die." The London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed into a medical college shortly after takeoff, killing 241 passengers and crew, along with five people on the ground. Ramesh explained that his side of the plane fell into the building's ground floor, and he escaped through a broken door, witnessing the death of an air hostess. His brother described his survival as a miracle, as the crash resulted in numerous injuries and fatalities. The plane, with over 41,000 hours of flying time, had not previously been involved in a fatal incident. The incident is being investigated by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau.</p>

          <p>Israel launched airstrikes against Iranian nuclear facilities and military commanders in an operation dubbed "Rising Lion," prompting Iran to retaliate with drone attacks. Israel claims the strikes were preemptive, aimed at thwarting an Iranian plan to destroy Israel. The IDF reports destroying Iranian air defenses and eliminating key Iranian military leaders, including the Chief of Staff and Revolutionary Guards Commander. International reactions have been swift, with NATO urging de-escalation, while the UN nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, stated that Iran's Fordo nuclear site was not impacted, and the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant was also not targeted. The US Embassy in Israel ordered American personnel to shelter in place. Trump urged Iran to reach a nuclear deal 'before there is nothing left'.</p>

          <p>David Liao, HSBC's co-CEO for Asia and the Middle East, emphasized Hong Kong's potential to advance the yuan's internationalization by expanding its offshore liquidity while maintaining risk management. He noted that Hong Kong could scale up yuan-denominated trade finance, building on the yuan's position as the third most used currency for global trade finance. According to an HSBC survey, a significant majority of mainland businesses plan to expand overseas, while both institutional and retail investors intend to diversify their portfolios by allocating assets abroad. Hong Kong's role as a financial hub connecting East and West positions it as a crucial partner in mainland China's capital market opening.</p>

The fee includes a guaranteed Â£100 million and Â£16 million in add-ons. Wirtz, who helped Leverkusen win the Bundesliga in 2024, has also scored seven goals in 31 appearances for Germany. He is set to become the second player Liverpool has bought from Bayer Leverkusen this summer, following right full-back Jeremie Frimpong. Liverpool is also reportedly pursuing Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez, seeking to bolster their squad after winning the 2024-25 Premier League title.</p>

          <p>A House reconciliation bill, dubbed the "One, Big, Beautiful Bill," includes proposals like $1,000 investment "Trump Accounts" for newborns and an enhanced child tax credit. However, the bill's emphasis on work requirements may reduce aid for low-income families, particularly regarding tax credits, health coverage, and food assistance. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that households in the lowest income decile could lose about $1,600 per year. The proposed changes to the earned income tax credit (EITC) and cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) also raise concerns about their impact on vulnerable families and children. The bill may also make about 4.5 million children who are citizens ineligible for the child tax credit because they have at least one undocumented parent who files taxes with an individual tax identification number.</p>

          <p>The High Court has dismissed a legal challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees. The challenge, brought by families and private schools, argued the policy was discriminatory and violated human rights law. The court found that the government was entitled to consider the revenue raised for public services outweighed the impact on families. The government expects to raise Â£1.8 billion a year by 2029/30, which will be spent on raising standards in the state sector.</p>

          <p>A commentary argues that the manhandling of U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla by federal agents at a news conference is a reflection of the deep-rooted anti-Mexican sentiment in America. The author connects this incident to historical and contemporary examples of discrimination against people of Mexican heritage. They also note that conservative politicians and media figures use anti-immigrant rhetoric, contributing to the fear and marginalization of Mexicans. Despite assimilation and contributions to American society, Mexicans continue to face suspicion and prejudice, as exemplified by the treatment of Sen. Padilla.</p>

          <p>Deconstruction, the practice of carefully dismantling buildings to salvage reusable materials, is gaining traction as a climate solution. This approach reduces waste in landfills and lowers the carbon footprint of construction. Deconstruction creates a circular economy for building materials, offering an alternative to traditional demolition methods. While deconstruction presents challenges, such as the need for local infrastructure and higher costs, it holds promise for reducing the environmental impact of the built environment. Some cities are implementing ordinances to incentivize or require deconstruction practices.</p>
