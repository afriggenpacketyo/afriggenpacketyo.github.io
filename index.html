            <p>An American company, Cocona, preemptively sold off its entire Chinese inventory of a sweat-drying additive to avoid anticipated tariff hikes from China. The CEO, Jeff Bowman, cited a lack of confidence in the US administration's handling of trade relations as a key factor in the decision. Bowman noted the company could have sold three times the amount due to the uncertainty surrounding future trade policies. The move was designed to provide buyers with a supply lasting nine to twelve months, effectively bypassing the looming tariff increases. (not investment advice)</p>

            <p>In response to increased tariffs from the United States, China is focusing on strengthening diplomatic ties with its neighboring countries. This strategic shift was highlighted by a recent Communist Party conference dedicated to neighborhood diplomacy and President Xi Jinping's planned tour of Southeast Asian countries. The timing of these events signals Beijing's growing emphasis on regional relationships amid concerns of a potential economic conflict with the US. China has denounced Trump's tariffs as hegemonic acts of exerting maximum pressure.</p>

            <p>A measles outbreak in western Texas has worsened, with two deaths and over 500 infections, highlighting the challenge of countering vaccine skepticism in the region. The outbreak is concentrated among Mennonite communities, where vaccination rates are low due to avoidance of modern healthcare. Health officials are struggling to reach vaccine-hesitant residents amidst mixed messaging from federal officials, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has previously endorsed immunization conspiracy theories. The outbreak has strained local health departments and resources, with potential cuts in public health grants threatening to further limit their capacity to respond.</p>

            <p>Panamanian opposition politicians are criticizing the US for what they perceive as a "camouflaged invasion" following increased US military presence to "secure the Panama canal from Chinese influence". The US and Panama signed an agreement allowing the US military to use former bases for training and humanitarian activities, which critics view as a violation of the canal's neutrality treaty. Growing frustration stems from the government's handling of the diplomatic crisis and a lack of transparency in negotiations with the US. The situation evokes memories of the 1989 Operation Just Cause, raising concerns among Panamanians.</p>

            <p>US envoy Steve Witkoff met with Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg to discuss a potential settlement in Ukraine, as Donald Trump urged Russia to "get moving" on a ceasefire. The meeting, lasting over four hours, was described as "productive". This comes as Trump's Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg denied suggesting the country could be partitioned. Meanwhile, European nations agreed to provide €21bn in military aid to Kyiv, and Ukraine accused the Kremlin of prolonging the war.</p>

            <p>The existing global order is under assault, requiring a new framework for international cooperation. The current system, built on free trade, the rule of law, and multilateral cooperation, is being challenged by power shifts and a rejection of globalization. A new global charter is needed to address global problems and build a more sustainable and equitable world order. This should include practical cooperation on security, climate, health, humanitarian needs, and trade, while also modernizing international institutions.</p>

            <p>The UK government is considering nationalizing British Steel to save the struggling industry, prompting debate about the financial implications and strategic importance of domestic steel production. With the company facing potential closure due to financial losses and expiring blast furnaces, the government is weighing the costs of nationalization against the benefits of preserving jobs and maintaining steelmaking capacity. While some argue that nationalization is necessary to protect British interests, others raise concerns about the long-term financial burden and the need for significant investment in modernizing the plant.</p>
