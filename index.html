        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin used a bizarre metaphor to praise his kicker, Chris Boswell, following a key victory over the New York Jets. After Boswell successfully kicked a 60-yard field goal, Tomlin described him as a "serial killer" due to his calm demeanor and ability to perform under pressure. Boswell was perfect in the game, making two field goals and four extra points, which were crucial for the team's win. The comment highlights the veteran kicker's reputation for reliability and clutch performance, which has made him a vital asset for the Steelers.</p>

          <p>An astronomical event captivated stargazers as a total lunar eclipse occurred, creating a "Blood Moon." The phenomenon, visible across large parts of the world including Asia and parts of Europe and Africa, happens when the Earth passes between the sun and moon. The moon appears red because the only sunlight reaching it is scattered through Earth's atmosphere, a process that filters out blue light wavelengths. This stunning visual event has fascinated humanity for many centuries.</p>

The families' solicitor emphasized that the attack was preventable and that the inquiry must lead to meaningful change to protect others in the future.

          <p>In response to threats of increased federal law enforcement and immigration crackdowns in Chicago, local church leaders are urging their communities to remain calm but vigilant. Pastors are advising congregants on their rights and encouraging them to stay connected with family, while also speaking out against what they term "fascism and authoritarianism." Many community members, particularly in Black and Latino neighborhoods, express fear that a federal or military presence would escalate tensions rather than solve issues of crime. They are calling for investment in community resources instead of more policing.</p>

          <p>John Burton, a prominent and outspoken liberal Democrat from San Francisco who served in the U.S. Congress and the California state legislature, has passed away at the age of 92. Known for his tireless advocacy for the working class, foster children, and environmental protection, Burton was a key mentor to many political leaders, including Nancy Pelosi. After overcoming a cocaine addiction in the 1980s, he returned to politics and later chaired the California Democratic Party. Tributes from across the state have lauded him as a legendary champion for the marginalized.</p>

          <p>The city of Santa Monica is on the verge of declaring a fiscal emergency due to a severe budget crisis, exacerbated by massive legal payouts. The city has already paid over $229 million in settlements related to sexual abuse claims against a former city employee, with many more claims pending. This financial strain is compounded by budget cuts made during the pandemic, which have left city services depleted and capital projects unfunded. Councilmembers have expressed grave concerns, with one fearing the city is "careening towards bankruptcy" without bold corrective action. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has walked back a previous statement that suggested he would "go to war" with Chicago, clarifying that his intent is to "clean up" cities experiencing high crime rates. Despite objections from local leaders who call the intervention unwanted, Trump maintains federal action is necessary, citing crime statistics. This follows a social media post that referenced the film "Apocalypse Now" and the "Department of WAR," which drew sharp criticism from Illinois officials. The administration's plans to deploy National Guard troops to cities remain controversial and face legal challenges.</p>

Goldin notes that while globalisation is becoming more fragmented and regional, its center of gravity is shifting towards Asia as the U.S. partially withdraws. He also cautions that the interconnectedness of globalisation brings not only benefits but also growing risks, such as pandemics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's manager, Thomas Tuchel, has indicated he wants the team to incorporate more direct tactics, such as long throw-ins and long balls, ahead of the next World Cup. This represents a potential shift from the team's recent style, which has featured a lower percentage of long balls compared to the previous major tournament under former coach Gareth Southgate. Tuchel acknowledged the limited training time with the national squad but emphasized that such tactical details will be important on the world stage. The German coach's contract with England is set to run through the conclusion of the tournament.</p>

          <p>A drone launched by Houthi militants from Yemen struck the passenger terminal at Ramon International Airport in southern Israel, breaching the country's air defenses. The attack caused damage, including shattered windows, and resulted in one person being treated for light shrapnel wounds. The Houthis claimed the attack as a "qualitative military operation" and warned that other sensitive targets are under fire. This incident marks an escalation, as Houthi attacks have rarely hit significant infrastructure targets like airports, and follows recent Israeli strikes on Houthi leadership in Yemen.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council, stated that the Federal Reserve's monetary policy must remain "fully independent of political influence," including from President Trump. His comments come after Trump named him as a potential candidate to be the next Fed chair. Hassett warned that history shows political control over central banks is a "recipe for inflation and misery for consumers." This discussion occurs amid growing concerns about White House influence over the historically independent institution, following pressure from the president on current Chair Jerome Powell.

          <p>Aryna Sabalenka successfully defended her US Open title, securing her fourth Grand Slam championship by defeating Amanda Anisimova. This victory is seen as a testament to the lessons she learned from a painful loss in the French Open final earlier in the year. The article suggests Sabalenka has developed greater emotional control and humility, allowing her to manage pressure moments more effectively. Her consistent high-level performance in major tournaments, reaching at least the semi-finals in 11 of her last 12 Grand Slams, solidifies her position as one of the sport's most dominant players.</p>

The concert was characterized by powerful, emotional reactions from the audience, with many fans openly weeping while singing along to classic hits like "Wonderwall" and "Don't Look Back in Anger." The tour has become a major cultural event, drawing comparisons to Taylor Swift's Eras tour for its ability to create a sense of communal catharsis.

          <p>The Formula 1 title fight between McLaren teammates Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri remained amicable during the Italian Grand Prix, even after a controversial strategy call from the team. When a pit stop issue caused Norris to emerge behind Piastri, the team instructed Piastri to let his teammate pass to restore the original order, citing fairness. Team Principal Andrea Stella defended the decision as consistent with McLaren's "racing principles," which prioritize the team's values over individual race outcomes. This approach is noted as a key factor in the team's recent success.</p>

          <p>For the first time during the war, Russia has struck the main government building in Kyiv, according to Ukraine's prime minister. The attack, part of a massive overnight barrage of over 800 drones and missiles across the country, damaged the building's roof and upper floors. The nationwide strikes killed at least four people, including a baby, when a residential building was also hit. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attacks as a "deliberate crime" aimed at prolonging the war, while Russia's defense ministry claimed it targeted military-industrial and transport infrastructure.</p>

He asserted that vaccine hesitancy was primarily caused by Dr. Anthony Fauci's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, not by current administration policies.</p>

Union leaders are concerned that recent cabinet reshuffles have removed key champions of the bill, signaling a potential lack of commitment to its full implementation. Business groups, however, see the changes as an opportunity to amend the bill, which they claim is overwhelming for small businesses without dedicated HR departments. (not investment advice)</p>
