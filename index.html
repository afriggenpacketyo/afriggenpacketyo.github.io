          <p>NPR's David Graham discusses Project 2025, a conservative action plan aiming to shift the federal government significantly to the right if Donald Trump wins a second term. Graham's book, "The Project," explores how this plan could reshape various aspects of governance. Project 2025 is a comprehensive conservative action plan which seeks to align the federal government with a far-right agenda, potentially impacting policy and governance across multiple sectors. This plan is a concerted effort by conservative groups to influence the direction of the country under a Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Former NFL quarterback Boomer Esiason asserts that some NFL owners took Shedeur Sanders off their draft boards due to concerns about his attitude and perceived entitlement. Sanders, who was eventually drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the fifth round, faced criticism leading up to the draft, with one coach describing his formal interview as "the worst" they had ever experienced. Esiason suggests Sanders' on-field interactions and off-field demeanor may have contributed to his slide in the draft, indicating a potential wake-up call for young athletes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite President Trump's push for increased oil and gas production, the oil industry is facing challenges, with U.S. crude oil prices falling below $65 per barrel. Oilfield service firms are warning of slowed investment due to these low prices and uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies, including tariffs. Executives in the shale oil sector have expressed concerns about the uncertainty, with the S&P 500 energy sector underperforming the broader market since Trump's second term began. The North American petroleum market is particularly sensitive to commodity prices, potentially leading to further downside risk.</p>

          <p>House Education and Workforce Committee Republicans have introduced a plan to overhaul the student loan system, proposing limits on student borrowing and fewer repayment options. The GOP measure, known as the Student Success and Taxpayer Savings Plan, aims to facilitate the passage of President Trump's tax cuts. Consumer advocates warn the proposal could worsen the affordability crisis for families paying for college, restricting college access by cutting financial aid programs and eliminating consumer protections. The plan has immediately drawn criticism for potentially deepening the financial challenges faced by students and families.</p>

          <p>Pfizer is expanding its cost-cutting measures after reporting first-quarter profits that exceeded expectations, despite a drop in sales largely due to declining revenue from its COVID-19 pill, Paxlovid.

They're more likely to admit when they don't know something, actively seek input from others, share the substance of their work without drawing attention to their effort, pause to dig deeper before making assumptions, and bring clarity to unresolved tensions. These communication habits, born of the discomfort introverts often feel in social settings, lead to more precise and impactful communication.</p>
