Tiger Woods was among the first to congratulate McIlroy, welcoming him to the exclusive club of golfers who have won the Masters, Open Championship, US Open, and US PGA Championship. McIlroy regrouped from missing a putt which would have secured victory on the 18th hole of his final round on Sunday to beat England's Justin Rose in a sudden-death play-off.

Rising trading revenue offset a slight decline in asset and wealth management revenue compared to the previous year.

            <p>A Stanford accounting professor advises taxpayers who need more time to file their taxes to request an extension, emphasizing that an extension to file is not an extension to pay. Filing Form 4868 before the April 15 deadline grants an extension until October 15, avoiding penalties for late filing. However, failure to pay taxes by the original deadline incurs penalties and interest. The professor recommends calculating the owed amount and paying it on time to avoid additional fees, and urges taxpayers not to delay working on their taxes after obtaining an extension.</p>

            <p>A recent survey indicates that over 60% of CEOs expect a recession in the next six months, driven by concerns about tariff turmoil. The survey reveals a significant drop in CEOs' views on current business conditions, reaching levels not seen since the pandemic's early months. Cost increases and declining profit expectations are also contributing to the pessimistic outlook. Despite these concerns, some CEOs foresee improved business conditions over the next year.</p>
