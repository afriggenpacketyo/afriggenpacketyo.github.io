        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The urban planning philosophy long championed by King Charles is significantly shaping the design of a new generation of towns set to be announced by the English government. These new developments will prioritize walkability, environmental sustainability, and "gentle density" housing like terraces, moving away from high-rise buildings and car-centric designs of the past. Architectural experts note that the King's once-controversial views, which favor traditional styles and community-focused public spaces, have now become mainstream, influencing planners to create more humane and locally sensitive environments.</p>

          <p>As Beijing prepares to host a global summit on women's rights, the Chinese government is emphasizing its advancements in gender equality. A foreign ministry spokesperson stated that China is an "active actor" in promoting women's development, highlighting significant progress over recent decades. The summit is expected to include international officials, though domestic NGOs may not be invited unless sponsored by foreign entities. This focus comes as two new books by President Xi Jinping were published, featuring his speeches on topics ranging from gender equality to traditional family values.</p>

          <p>A specialized UK Ministry of Defence unit has solved a century-old mystery by identifying the remains of two Scottish soldiers killed in the Battle of Loos during World War One. The soldiers, Lance Corporal Gordon McPherson and Lieutenant James Grant Allan, were discovered during construction work for a new hospital in France. Investigators, nicknamed "war detectives," used regimental artifacts, census records, and even a set of tramway buttons found with one soldier to narrow down the identities before confirming them with DNA from living relatives. The soldiers were recently laid to rest with full military honors.</p>

Harrods described the event as an "isolated incident" that has been contained and confirmed its own internal systems were not affected. The breach is unrelated to a separate cyber attack attempt on the store in May, highlighting a broader trend of increasing cyber threats against major corporations.</p>

          <p>U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is set to personally deliver his vision for restoring a "warrior ethos" to the military at a rare gathering of several hundred senior generals and admirals. The meeting, to be held at the Marine base in Quantico, Virginia, will see Hegseth present new standards aimed at achieving this goal. This unusual summons of high-ranking officers from around the world has raised questions about the logistics, costs, and security required for such an event.

          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic flooding and landslides in western North Carolina, volunteer pilots are reflecting on their crucial role in the immediate aftermath. With roads washed out and communication lines down, these pilots were among the first to witness the scale of the destruction and became a lifeline for stranded residents. They conducted dozens of rescue missions and flew in essential supplies like food and medicine, coordinating with groups like the United Cajun Navy. Their efforts, alongside the National Guard which performed hundreds of air rescues, were vital in saving lives and supporting isolated communities.</p>

          <p>The cost for Essex Police to manage ongoing protests in the town of Epping is projected to hit £1.7 million by October. The demonstrations began after an asylum seeker, Hadush Kebatu, who was housed at the local Bell Hotel, was charged and later jailed for sexual assault. While most protests have been peaceful, some disorder has led to 32 arrests and injuries to eight officers. The police, fire and crime commissioner noted the force must absorb the substantial costs, as government assistance is only available for expenses exceeding £4 million, creating a significant financial strain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea is facing a severe demographic crisis as its birth rate, one of the lowest in the world, threatens to undermine decades of economic progress. Economic studies warn that the shrinking workforce could lead to a sustained slowdown and potentially economic contraction by the 2040s. Despite the government spending over $270 billion on incentives to encourage childbirth, the fertility rate remains far below the replacement level needed to maintain its population. This demographic shift also puts immense pressure on the nation's pension system and has significant implications for its military readiness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Startup founders are sharing their experiences of navigating the emotional and professional challenges of business failure and finding new paths forward. Entrepreneurs describe the intense personal pressure, the difficulty of disappointing investors and employees, and the sense of lost identity that can follow a company's collapse. Some who return to corporate life face a stigma, though many argue their experience makes them highly capable employees with a broad understanding of business operations. Ultimately, many founders find that reframing success around a deep sense of purpose, rather than just financial metrics, is key to building resilience.</p>

Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government maintains significant control over the media landscape, and press freedom organizations have warned of intense political and economic pressure on independent outlets.

          <p>The United Nations is poised to reimpose extensive economic and military sanctions on Iran, a decade after they were lifted under the 2015 nuclear deal. The move was triggered by the UK, France, and Germany, who accused Iran of failing to meet its commitments after the US withdrew from the agreement in 2016. Iran's president has condemned the reimposition as "unjust and illegal," while a last-minute effort by China and Russia to delay the sanctions failed to gain support. The renewed sanctions, which include an arms embargo and a ban on uranium enrichment, add significant strain to an already tense geopolitical situation.</p>

          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada showcases more than just a battle for the title; it represents a clash of economic models in the sport. England, the world's best-funded team with 32 full-time professional players, faces a Canadian side whose athletes earn a fraction of that and rely on fundraising to cover costs. Despite the massive financial gap, Canada has proven to be a formidable opponent, with many of its players gaining experience in England's top domestic league. A Canadian victory could challenge the narrative that full professionalism is the only path to success in women's rugby.</p>

Shane Tamura, a former high school football player, left notes referencing the degenerative brain disease and asked for his brain to be studied. CTE is linked to repeated head injuries and can only be definitively diagnosed after death. While experts caution against drawing a direct causal link between CTE and his violent actions, the finding has renewed focus on the long-term consequences of brain trauma in athletes.</p>

          <p>Following a deadly shooting at an ICE field office in Dallas, Attorney General Pam Bondi has ordered the deployment of Justice Department agents to guard Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities nationwide. The move is a response to what ICE describes as a spike in attacks and threats against its agents and facilities amid the Trump administration's intensified immigration enforcement. Bondi also directed Joint Terrorism Task Forces to investigate these incidents as potential domestic terrorism, vowing to pursue the most serious charges against anyone involved in violence or obstruction against federal agents.</p>

          <h2>Hurricane Humberto May Interact with Nearby Storm in Rare "Fujiwhara Effect"</h2>

          <p>As major Hurricane Humberto churns in the Atlantic, meteorologists are monitoring the possibility of a rare interaction with another developing storm system nearby. If the two storms get close enough, they could engage in what is known as the Fujiwhara effect, a phenomenon where two cyclones orbit each other or even merge. Typically, a stronger storm will absorb a weaker one, though two storms of similar strength can "dance" around each other before separating. While this interaction is considered unlikely in this case, it adds a layer of complexity to forecasting the storms' future paths and intensity.</p>
