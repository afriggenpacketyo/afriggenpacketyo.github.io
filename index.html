          <p>A powerful 6.0 magnitude earthquake has struck eastern Afghanistan, killing more than 800 people and injuring at least 2,500. The quake, which was shallow and thus more destructive, completely destroyed numerous villages in Kunar province. The Taliban government is leading rescue efforts, though its capacity is hampered by the ongoing humanitarian crisis and the withdrawal of international financial aid since its takeover. The United Nations and other aid agencies are on the ground providing emergency assistance as the death toll is expected to rise.</p>

          <p>An 11-year-old boy has died after being shot while playing "ding dong ditch" with friends in Houston. According to police, the boy rang a doorbell and was fleeing the property when someone from inside the home reportedly came out and fired at the children as they ran away. The boy was struck in the back and later succumbed to his injuries at a hospital. A man was detained for questioning but has since been released, and the investigation is ongoing.</p>

          <p>New legislation will grant the UK's justice secretary the authority to veto proposed sentencing guidelines from the independent Sentencing Council. This change ensures that any new guidance must be approved by both the justice secretary and the lady chief justice before being issued. The move follows a recent controversy where the government blocked a proposal to require judges to consider the background of offenders from certain minority groups. Proponents argue it enhances democratic oversight, while critics may see it as an infringement on judicial independence.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, was hospitalized with multiple broken bones after a high-speed, rear-end collision in New Hampshire. The crash occurred shortly after Giuliani and his associate had stopped to assist a woman on the roadside who claimed to be a victim of domestic violence. Giuliani suffered fractured thoracic vertebrae and other injuries, though they are reported as non-life-threatening. The driver of the other vehicle was also hospitalized, and police are investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>Piotr Szczerek, the CEO of a Polish paving company, has issued a public apology after a video of him taking a hat intended for a young boy at the US Open went viral.

In his statement, Szczerek claimed it was a misunderstanding and that he was "convinced" the hat was for him, but admitted he made a "huge mistake" and has since returned the item to the young fan.</p>

          <p>Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has warned he would "constitutionally declare a republic in arms" if the country were attacked by U.S. naval forces currently deployed in the Caribbean.

Maduro characterized the deployment as an "extravagant, immoral and absolutely criminal" threat, accusing Washington of seeking regime change.

Bessent confirmed that the administration has a backup plan, which could involve using authority from the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act if the Supreme Court appeal is unsuccessful.

Many residents who chose to rebuild faced immense challenges, including flawed government recovery programs, but their reflections highlight a powerful sense of community resilience and an unbreakable connection to their home.</p>
