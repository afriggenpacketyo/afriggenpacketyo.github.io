            <p>Longevity expert Dan Buettner suggests that retirement may be detrimental to health, citing research from "blue zones" where purpose-driven lives extend well beyond traditional retirement age. He notes a spike in mortality rates post-retirement and emphasizes the importance of staying physically and mentally active. Dr. Kyle Elliott adds that finding joy in one's work and maintaining social engagement can lead to a longer, healthier life, suggesting that retirement should not necessarily mean completely leaving the workforce.</p>

            <p>Following President Donald Trump's increase of tariffs on Chinese imports to 125%, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian criticized the U.S. for using "tariffs as a weapon to exert maximum pressure and seek selfish gains."

            <p>Former England cricketer Charlotte Edwards has been appointed as England's new head coach. Edwards's career began as a batter, but when she took on the captaincy for the first time in 2005, she faced a real test of her leadership when the team didn't win a single game on a tour in India. In winning both the T20 and 50-over World Cups in 2009, along with the Ashes, she led the team to becoming the most successful England side in history.</p>
