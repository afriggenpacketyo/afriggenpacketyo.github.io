          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 18:06:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new plan for NATO allies to purchase and deliver American weapons to Ukraine, ensuring continued military support as U.S. funding nears depletion. The announcement, made alongside the NATO Secretary-General, also included a threat of "very severe tariffs" on Russia if the war does not end within 50 days. This shift in policy and tone reflects growing frustration with Russia's actions, with the administration signaling a more aggressive stance to push for a resolution to the ongoing conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government has implemented a 17.09% tariff on most fresh tomatoes imported from Mexico, following the breakdown of trade negotiations. The move is intended to protect American tomato growers from what the Commerce Department calls unfair trade practices, specifically the "dumping" of produce at artificially low prices. While proponents argue it will bolster the domestic industry, opponents, including U.S. businesses and restaurant associations, warn it will increase consumer prices and could provoke retaliatory tariffs from Mexico.

          <p>San Francisco is set to become one of the largest local governments to leverage generative AI, providing Microsoft's Copilot to 30,000 city workers. The initiative aims to enhance productivity by automating administrative tasks like data analysis and report drafting, freeing up employees to focus on resident services. Following a successful six-month pilot program that showed significant time savings, the city will use the AI to improve response times for services and bridge language gaps, as it can assist with translation across dozens of languages.</p>

          <p>The UK government has launched a public consultation on the future of the state-owned Post Office, proposing that it could be mutualized and owned by its postmasters. This "fresh vision" comes in the wake of the Horizon IT scandal, which saw hundreds of postmasters wrongfully convicted, aiming to rebuild trust and transform the organization's culture. While the government doesn't plan to reduce the number of branches, it is exploring long-term structural changes, including a joint venture or a charter model, to ensure the service's stability and relevance.</p>

          <p>Chinese universities have demonstrated a significant rise in global academic rankings, with institutions like Tsinghua, Peking, and Zhejiang universities climbing higher on the Best Global Universities list. This year, 15 Chinese universities are in the top 100, a stark increase from just two in 2018, with Tsinghua University now positioned just outside the top 10. The ascent is attributed to decades of sustained national investment in higher education, research, and the strategic recruitment of international academic talent, signaling a shift in the global academic landscape.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the Trump administration can continue with its plan to fire a significant portion of the Department of Education's workforce. The decision, made on the court's "shadow docket," lifts a lower court's injunction that had halted the terminations while a lawsuit proceeds. Critics and dissenting justices argue this move effectively allows the executive branch to dismantle a federal department and its congressionally mandated programs by eliminating the staff needed to run them, raising constitutional questions about the separation of powers.</p>

          <p>During jury selection for a federal trial over a fatal Tesla Autopilot crash, the public perception of CEO Elon Musk emerged as a significant challenge. Several potential jurors expressed strong negative opinions about Musk, stating they could not be impartial in a case involving his company, with one calling his involvement "very hard for me." Tesla's lawyers acknowledged the difficulty, emphasizing that the case is about the specific accident and not Musk himself, highlighting the complexities of seating a fair jury for a high-profile and controversial company.</p>

          <p>Reddit is introducing age verification for its UK users to restrict access to "certain mature content" for those under 18. This move is in compliance with the UK's new Online Safety Act, which mandates robust age-checking measures for sites displaying adult material. The platform will use a third-party service to verify age via a selfie or a government-issued ID, with Reddit only retaining the user's verification status and date of birth to protect privacy. UK regulator Ofcom expects other platforms to adopt similar measures or face significant penalties.</p>
