          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering a military strike against Iran as tensions escalate between Iran and Israel. This consideration follows a meeting with national security advisors where various options were weighed. Trump has also issued warnings to Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stating that the U.S. is closely monitoring his location and demanding "unconditional surrender." The president has expressed concerns about potential missile attacks on civilians or American soldiers, indicating a desire to avoid further escalation while maintaining a firm stance against Iran's actions. Optimism in this situation is low due to the potential for military conflict. </p>

          <p>The United States is experiencing its largest measles outbreak since 2019, with over 1,100 cases reported across 32 states. A significant portion of these cases is concentrated in West Texas, where the outbreak has resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children. Health officials attribute the surge in measles cases to declining vaccination rates, with data showing a decrease in measles vaccinations among kindergarteners. Despite the risks associated with measles, including severe complications and death, health experts emphasize the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine, urging people to get vaccinated to prevent further spread. </p>

          <p>The increasing demand for artificial intelligence and data storage is projected to significantly increase electricity consumption, leading to higher electricity bills for consumers. Data centers, which are essential for AI and cloud computing, require vast amounts of energy, and utilities are responding by building new infrastructure and raising rates. Experts warn that this surge in demand could also compromise the reliability of the electrical grid, with some utilities already proposing new rate classes for high-energy users like data centers. While other factors contribute to rising electricity prices, the growth of AI is a significant driver, potentially impacting household energy expenditures. </p>

          <p>Channel smugglers are changing tactics by using "taxi boats" to collect migrants off the French coast, as French police struggle to halt the surge of people attempting to reach the UK. Instead of launching boats from the dunes, smugglers are using hidden locations and cruising along the coastline to pick up paying customers waiting in the sea. French authorities say they are unable to intervene at sea without risking drownings, focusing instead on intercepting boats before they launch. The shift to taxi boats gives smugglers more control over the process but also puts women and children at a disadvantage, as they struggle to climb onboard from the sea. </p>

          <p>A federal appeals court in San Francisco is considering whether President Trump can continue deploying California's National Guard in Los Angeles to protect federal immigration authorities. The court heard arguments on a Justice Department request to halt a district judge's order that required Trump to return control of the National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom. The legal battle centers on whether Trump exceeded his authority by invoking Title 10 to deploy the National Guard in response to protests against immigration raids. California argues that Trump circumvented Newsom and that the presence of troops would escalate tensions, while the Trump administration asserts that courts cannot review the president's decision to federalize the National Guard. </p>

Trump has issued warnings to Iran, stating that the U.S. has "complete and total control of the skies over Iran," while also indicating that the U.S. is not seeking to kill Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. </p>

          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion for women, marking the biggest change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, put forward by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, passed with a significant majority. While the law will still penalize those who assist a woman in obtaining an abortion outside the legal framework, women who terminate their pregnancies outside the rules will no longer face police investigation. The move was supported by abortion providers and various organizations, while some expressed concerns about the limited protections afforded by the law. </p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted of murdering her husband in 2001, had her conviction overturned after spending two decades in prison. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies with the original trial's findings. The Loyola Project for the Innocent helped uncover that some blood spots were never tested and others were not blood at all. Despite the overturned conviction, questions remain about the case and the handling of evidence, leading to a civil suit against the County of San Diego. The dismissal of the case was without prejudice, meaning charges could be brought again if new evidence surfaces. </p>
