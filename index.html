        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Commerce Ministry has blacklisted Canadian semiconductor research firm TechInsights, citing national security concerns. This action follows TechInsights' report revealing Huawei's latest AI chips contained components from outside mainland China, including from Samsung and TSMC, which are subject to U.S. export controls. The move restricts Chinese entities from sharing data with TechInsights and highlights Beijing's efforts towards a self-sufficient semiconductor supply chain amid U.S. restrictions. This development could increase opacity in China's chip industry and raises questions about the effectiveness of existing U.S. export controls.</p>

          <p>Major newspapers are reporting on a tentative Gaza peace deal, with headlines like "Peace within reach" and "A moment of shared hope." Editorials urge a comprehensive settlement, warning of potential pitfalls such as Israel reneging or terrorist actions derailing the process. Some papers credit President Trump's "force of personality" for compelling the agreement, while others highlight remaining sticking points, including Hamas's disarmament and the structure of an international stabilization force. The diverse media reactions reflect both cautious optimism and significant concerns regarding the deal's long-term viability.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government shutdown is set to extend into the following week after the Senate adjourned without resolving the budget stalemate. Lawmakers remain deadlocked, with Democrats demanding healthcare subsidies and Republicans insisting on a "clean" spending bill. This ongoing impasse impacts federal workers, with potential missed paychecks for military personnel and closures of institutions like the Smithsonian. The prolonged shutdown underscores deep political divisions and growing consequences for federal operations and the economy.</p>

          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has been indicted by a federal grand jury in Virginia on charges of bank fraud and false statements to a financial institution. The indictment, obtained by a Trump-appointed U.S. Attorney, alleges James made false statements on a mortgage for a Virginia home, claiming it as a secondary residence while renting it out. James, a vocal critic of President Trump, called the charges "baseless" and accused the president of weaponizing the justice system for political retribution. This development follows Trump's public calls for charges against James and has drawn sharp criticism from Democratic leaders, who view it as an abuse of power.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants secured a decisive 34-17 victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, who are defending Super Bowl champions. Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts faced controversy early in the game for running the "tush push" play four consecutive times, leading to widespread criticism from prominent figures. Despite scoring a touchdown from this sequence, the Eagles suffered their second consecutive loss, with rookie Giants quarterback Jaxson Dart leading his team to a stunning upset. The game highlighted the Giants' strong rookie performances and the Eagles' strategic missteps.</p>

          <p>A woman whose body was found on a Dutch beach in 2004 has finally been identified as 35-year-old German citizen Eva Maria Pommer, 21 years after her death. Her identification came through a crucial tip-off following an appeal aired on German TV as part of Operation Identify Me, an international police campaign. The cause of death remains unexplained, and investigations are ongoing. This success marks the fourth identification through the initiative, which uses Interpol "black notices" to seek public information on unidentified bodies in suspicious circumstances across Europe.</p>

          <p>The White House has claimed a "more than 1,000%" rise in assaults on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, but public evidence does not support this dramatic increase. An analysis of court records shows approximately a 25% rise in charges for assault against federal officers, including ICE agents, over the past year. Despite repeated requests, the Department of Homeland Security has not provided data to justify its higher claims. Critics argue that exaggerating such statistics jeopardizes public trust in the criminal justice system and can be used for political purposes, as seen in cases where charges were dismissed or reduced.</p>

This phenomenon, attributed to flexoelectricity, allows for the creation of an electrical response comparable to high-performing ceramic materials. The research opens new avenues for harnessing clean power in cold environments, potentially leading to low-cost energy sources. This advancement builds on previous findings by the same team regarding ice's power generation capabilities through bending, marking a significant step in sustainable energy innovation.</p>

AMD shares also rallied over 40% this week, while Nvidia's CEO confirmed increased demand and funding involvement in Elon Musk's xAI. This surge reflects strong investor confidence in the AI sector's growth and its positive impact on leading semiconductor manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican Winsome Earle-Sears and Democrat Abigail Spanberger engaged in a fiery debate for Virginia's gubernatorial race, clashing over the federal shutdown and violent political rhetoric. Earle-Sears, trailing in the polls, adopted an aggressive style, repeatedly interrupting Spanberger and pressing her on controversial issues like the attorney general candidate's violent text messages. Spanberger maintained a bipartisan tone, focusing on policy and avoiding direct confrontation. The debate highlighted the impact of national politics, particularly the government shutdown, on Virginia, a state with a large federal workforce, and underscored escalating concerns about political violence.</p>

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, is reportedly set to launch her campaign for the U.S. Senate next week. Mills aims to challenge long-serving Republican Senator Susan Collins in what is anticipated to be a closely watched race in next year's midterm elections. Mills, who is term-limited as governor, previously gained national attention for her public disagreements with President Trump. Her entry into the race presents a significant opportunity for Democrats to potentially flip a GOP-held seat and narrow the Republican majority in the Senate, despite a challenging national landscape for the party.</p>

Her vision for the economy blends fiscal expansionism with protectionist undertones, focusing on state-led industrial revival and strategic investments in defense and technology.

          <p>Battlefield 6, the latest installment in the military shooter series, is generating significant buzz and aiming to compete with rival Call of Duty. Publisher Electronic Arts (EA) has invested hundreds of millions into the project, which follows the negatively received Battlefield 2042. Developers emphasize lessons learned, early fan involvement through playtests, and the return of a single-player campaign. Despite the scale and pressure, the team is optimistic about its potential, with analysts predicting strong initial sales. Concerns exist regarding EA's recent acquisition by a Saudi-led group and the future role of AI in game development, but developers are focused on delivering a high-quality player experience.</p>

The new bills aim to ease the FAIR Plan's financial strain by enabling the issuance of bonds for catastrophic claims and allowing credit lines with institutional lenders. Additionally, the legislation enhances oversight by adding legislative members to the plan's governing committee and requires it to offer comparable insurance for manufactured homes. These reforms seek to stabilize the insurance market, protect consumers, and increase transparency amidst climate crisis challenges.</p>

Staff express demoralization and anger, while students worry about impacts on services and course availability. The UCU plans a UK-wide strike vote over a 1.4% pay offer, arguing it fails to reflect staff value.

Scientists noted unusual features, including a prong-like bone near its nostril and a long, sword-like snout. Marks on its skull suggest it may have been killed by a larger ichthyosaur, highlighting the dangerous Mesozoic oceans. The discovery, made by a prolific fossil hunter in 2001, underscores the rich paleontological significance of the region.</p>
