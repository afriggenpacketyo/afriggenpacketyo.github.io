          <p>In the eastern German city of Dessau, right-wing extremism has become alarmingly popular among young people, who see it as "cool" to glorify Hitler and chant xenophobic slogans. This trend is part of a broader radicalization across eastern Germany, fueled by a complex history of economic collapse post-reunification and persistent social issues. Despite significant investment and a rich cultural heritage like the Bauhaus movement, the city has been plagued by racist violence. The situation is compounded by the election of a far-right AfD mayor with a neo-Nazi past, though many citizens and youth groups are actively resisting this extremist surge.</p>

          <p>China's manufacturing activity shrank for the third straight month in June, with the official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) remaining below the 50-point mark that indicates expansion. While production and new orders saw slight improvements, factory employment and inventory levels continued to decline, reflecting ongoing economic challenges. The data highlights persistent deflationary pressures and sluggish consumer demand, which Beijing is attempting to counter with stimulus measures aimed at boosting domestic consumption. Economists suggest that further fiscal support will be critical to stabilizing the economy in the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two firefighters were killed and another individual was injured after being ambushed by a gunman while they were responding to a brush fire on Canfield Mountain in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.

          <p>China has conditionally lifted its nearly two-year-old ban on seafood imports from certain regions of Japan, a measure initially imposed over the release of treated water from the Fukushima nuclear plant. The easing of restrictions, which still excludes ten prefectures including Fukushima, is seen as a diplomatic step by Beijing to mend strained relations with its neighbor. The decision was made based on monitoring that found no abnormalities in the discharged water and Japan's commitment to product safety. This move comes as both nations navigate complex geopolitical dynamics, including growing trade uncertainty with the United States.</p>

          <p>World leaders and organizations are meeting in Seville, Spain, for a United Nations conference aimed at raising trillions of dollars to combat global poverty and close the development financing gap. The meeting seeks to reverse a trend of escalating debt, declining investment, and decreasing aid for many developing nations. However, the effort faces a significant challenge with the absence of the United States, a historically major contributor, which withdrew from the conference after rejecting the negotiated outcome document. Despite this setback, organizers hope the summit will send a strong message of multilateral commitment to achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has reversed its plan to implement a digital services tax on major technology companies, a day before the first payments were due. The decision came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he was terminating all trade discussions with Canada in response to the tax, which would have primarily affected American tech giants. Ottawa stated the move was made in anticipation of a new comprehensive trade deal, allowing negotiations to resume. The 3% levy was intended to address a taxation gap but was criticized by the U.S. as discriminatory and unfairly retroactive. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite a strategic partnership with Iran, which has supplied Russia with drones for its war in Ukraine, Moscow failed to provide any significant military or diplomatic support to its ally when it was attacked. Instead of taking a strong stance, President Vladimir Putin positioned himself as a neutral mediator. The author contends that Russia's entanglement in the Ukraine war has depleted its resources and crippled its credibility, leaving it unable to effectively support its allies.</p>

The legislation, which narrowly passed the House, is being advanced through the budget reconciliation process, allowing the Republican majority to pass it without Democratic support. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would add nearly $3.3 trillion to the national deficit over the next decade. Democrats are expected to use procedural tactics to delay the final vote and force Republicans to take positions on controversial amendments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent arrest of two elementary school teachers in Japan for allegedly taking and sharing indecent photos of young girls in a private social media group has raised serious concerns about child safety in schools. The group chat, which included about eight other educators, reportedly circulated around 70 voyeuristic photos and videos. The case came to light during a separate investigation into another teacher in the group. This incident, along with others, has prompted calls for stronger protective measures, including a new system for background checks on job applicants at schools, though it will not be mandatory for all institutions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers attribute to the unique characteristics of EV acceleration and deceleration. Studies indicate that features like regenerative braking, which converts kinetic energy back into battery power, can cause low-frequency deceleration that induces queasiness. Researchers from institutions in China and Hong Kong are investigating the issue, highlighting that motion sickness affects not just comfort but also the health and well-being of passengers. The findings suggest a need for engineering solutions to mitigate this unintended consequence of green technology.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, a decision that came hours after former President Trump threatened to support a primary challenger against him. The rift emerged after Tillis refused to support Trump's major spending and tax bill, citing concerns over devastating Medicaid cuts for his state. In his retirement statement, Tillis lamented the decline of bipartisanship and compromise in Washington, stating that leaders with independent thinking are becoming an "endangered species." His departure will open up a key Senate seat in a state that has trended Republican in recent presidential elections.</p>

Garcia Aquino has been charged with murder with a special circumstance of committing lewd acts with a child. It was also revealed that the coach had been the subject of two prior investigations into alleged sexual misconduct with minors, adding another tragic layer to the case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Mariano Grossi, has stated that recent U.S. airstrikes inflicted "severe damage" but not "total damage" on Iran's nuclear facilities. He cautioned that Iran retains the industrial and technological capacity to rebuild its program if it chooses to do so. Grossi's assessment appears to align with a Defense Intelligence Agency report suggesting the strikes only set Iran's program back by months, a conclusion the Trump administration has disputed. The IAEA chief stressed the urgent need for his inspectors to regain access to Iranian sites to verify the status of their nuclear materials.</p>

The inquiry will investigate key decisions, including the rapid discharge of hospital patients into care homes without testing, which is blamed for seeding the virus and leading to nearly 46,000 resident deaths in England and Wales. Other critical issues under review include the use of blanket "do not resuscitate" notices and restrictive visiting policies that isolated residents from their families.

The city's governor cited reasons of social peace and moral values for the ban, reflecting the increasingly harsh stance of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's government against the LGBTQ+ community. Despite a heavy police presence designed to prevent gatherings, activists tried to march with rainbow flags before being confronted by officers.
