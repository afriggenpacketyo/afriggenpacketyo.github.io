            <p>Sky has announced plans to launch a UK spin-off of the US TV institution Saturday Night Live, aiming to bring the same live, fast-paced sketch comedy to British audiences. The show will be overseen by SNL creator Lorne Michaels and will feature British comedic talent. The move is seen as a courageous one, given the differences between the US and UK comedy cultures and TV industries, but the success of SNL's format on social media platforms makes it a potentially lucrative venture. Previous attempts to translate US late-night shows to the UK have struggled, but the show aims to develop new talent.</p>

            <p>Women in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine share their experiences of repression, fear, and resistance. They describe efforts to erase Ukrainian identity, including banning the language and traditions, and forcing residents to take Russian passports. Speaking to the media or even relatives can be dangerous due to surveillance and the threat of punishment. Despite the risks, underground resistance groups are active, distributing leaflets and newsletters to maintain Ukrainian identity.</p>

            <p>The Gobbins Cliff Path in Northern Ireland, a tourist attraction that has received millions in funding, has been closed nearly as many days as it has been open in the past decade. Closures have been due to rockfalls, storm damage, planned works, and inspections. A local resident questioned the economic viability of the site, given the frequent closures. The council plans to invest in a major revamp, hoping to increase visitor numbers and economic benefits.</p>
