          <p>A threatened black woodpecker, Japan's largest woodpecker species, has been identified in a 2021 photograph, marking its first sighting on Japan's main island of Honshu in four years. The bird, an adult male, was spotted on Mt. Moriyoshi in Akita prefecture, the same location as the last sighting in 2017. While relatively common on Hokkaido, the black woodpecker is designated as vulnerable by the Environment Ministry due to increasing extinction risk. Experts are seeking state support for its protection, emphasizing the importance of up-to-date sighting information for vulnerable species.</p>

          <p>Roche has entered a $5.3 billion deal with Zealand Pharma to co-develop and co-commercialize petrelintide, a next-generation amylin analog for weight loss, marking Roche's move to compete with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly in the growing obesity drug market. Amylin analogs mimic a hormone that increases satiety, differing from prevalent GLP-1 drugs that suppress appetite. Early clinical data suggests comparable weight reduction with potentially better tolerability and muscle preservation. The deal includes upfront payments of $1.65 billion to Zealand, with potential milestone payments, with both companies emphasizing the scientific and cultural fit as key to the agreement.</p>

          <p>Russell Brand appeared in a London court for the initial hearing regarding multiple sexual assault charges, including two counts of sexual assault. The charges relate to alleged incidents between 1999 and 2005 involving four women. Brand, who has denied all charges, faces allegations including touching a woman's breasts and dragging another towards a male toilet. The hearing was largely procedural, with the case referred to a higher court for further proceedings. A plea hearing is expected in about a month, but the actual trial may not begin for approximately a year due to backlogs in the British judicial system.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party secured a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election in Runcorn and Helsby, seizing a seat previously held by the Labour Party. This outcome, achieved by a mere six votes, highlights Reform's growing influence in British politics, potentially accelerating the country's shift towards a more polarized, multiparty system. The victory was fueled by voter frustration with the economy and tensions over immigration, particularly regarding the housing of migrants in local hotels. The party also made gains in mayoral and local council elections, indicating a broader trend of support for Reform U.K.</p>

The piece criticizes the racing industry's claims of improved safety measures, stating that killing fewer horses is not a valid achievement. It concludes by advocating for an evolution away from the sport, emphasizing that technological advancements cannot compensate for a lack of empathy and decency towards these animals.</p>

The order instructs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and all federal departments to cease funding for the news outlets.

This move follows Trump's long-standing antagonistic relationship with mainstream media, though the CPB budget has already been approved by Congress through 2027, raising questions about the order's scope.</p>

          <p>Romania is holding a rerun of its presidential election, which was annulled last December, with right-wing extremist George Simion leading the polls. The election is critical due to Romania's geopolitical importance as an EU and NATO member bordering Ukraine, amid ongoing regional instability. Simion, known for his nationalist rhetoric and suspected ties to Russia, faces competition from Crin Antonescu, representing traditional post-communist politics, and Nicusor Dan, a progressive liberal mayor. The outcome will significantly impact Romania's future amid security concerns and domestic political challenges.</p>

          <p>Thrombosis, the formation of blood clots in blood vessels, poses a significant risk even to top athletes, as demonstrated by cases involving basketball star Victor Wembanyama and tennis icon Serena Williams. Sports physician Pascal Bauer emphasizes that athletes are not immune to the condition, which can range from mild symptoms to life-threatening pulmonary embolisms. Certain sports involving repetitive upper body movements or contact, as well as long-distance travel, may increase the risk. Prevention involves preventive sports examinations, good training hygiene, adequate hydration, and movement during travel, with diagnosis and treatment typically involving blood-thinning medication.</p>

ECB President Christine Lagarde emphasizes the need for a European alternative to mitigate potential vulnerabilities. While some experts argue that the reliance is not as dominant as portrayed, the rise of app-based payments further increases dependence on American tech firms. Russia's model of mandating domestic processing of transactions is being considered as a temporary solution, while the ECB is also promoting the development of a digital euro and the European Payments Initiative (EPI) to foster homegrown alternatives.</p>

          <p>Reporters Without Borders (RSF) reports that global press freedoms have reached an "all-time low," particularly noting a deterioration under US President Donald Trump, according to their annual ranking report. The report indicates that more than half of the world's population lives in countries with a 'very serious' situation for press freedom. Europe remains the safest region for journalists, while Germany fell below the top ten due to an increasingly hostile working environment. The report also highlights the plight of Palestinian journalists covering Israeli attacks on Gaza and notes a decline in press freedom in the US due to Trump's actions.</p>

The seat gains have primarily been at the expense of the Conservatives, while Labour's support has fallen heavily since the general election, resulting in diminished vote shares in their mayoral successes.</p>
