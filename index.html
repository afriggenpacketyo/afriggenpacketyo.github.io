          <h2>Trump Administration Ends Tariff Exemption for Low-Value Imports Globally</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 15:36:13 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has signed an executive order to suspend the "de minimis" exemption, which previously allowed imported parcels valued at $800 or less to enter the U.S. without tariffs. The White House described this as closing a "catastrophic loophole" used to evade duties and import illicit goods, a move that follows an earlier suspension for shipments from China and Hong Kong. This policy change, effective August 29, impacts online retailers like Shein and Temu, which relied on the provision to ship low-cost products directly to American consumers. The decision comes as the volume of such shipments has surged dramatically in recent years. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered widespread tsunami alerts across the Pacific, leading to evacuations in Hawaii, Japan, and the U.S. West Coast. While the quake generated significant waves, including 16-foot surges in Kamchatka, major damage and casualties were largely avoided as the most severe warnings were later downgraded to advisories. In Hawaii, small waves and minor flooding were reported, and U.S. officials expressed relief that the situation was not as catastrophic as initially feared. However, advisories remained in effect in some areas, including parts of South America, due to the potential for dangerous currents.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who is overseeing a case against former President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally. The administration accuses de Moraes of human rights violations, censorship, and politically motivated prosecutions. In conjunction with the sanctions, President Trump also imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports, citing the Brazilian government's actions as conflicting with U.S. policy on democracy and free expression. The move escalates tensions with Brazil's current government and highlights the Trump administration's support for Bolsonaro, who faces charges of attempting to overthrow the democratic order.

          <p>In a recent court filing, the Department of Justice disclosed that the grand jury transcripts related to the Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell investigations contain testimony from only two witnesses: an FBI agent and an NYPD detective. The filing, part of an effort to unseal the records, clarifies that no alleged victims testified directly before the grand juries that issued the indictments. This revelation comes after President Trump directed the DOJ to seek the release of the documents to address public interest in the case. The Justice Department argued for the release to provide transparency while remaining sensitive to victims' rights.</p>

Vogler was reported to be conscious and was transported to a burn center for treatment. Police have taken a 29-year-old suspect into custody, and the magazine's owner stated the assailant forced his way into the locked office to reach Vogler.</p>

Her comments echo concerns from lawyers representing other British hostage families, who fear the policy could disincentivize Hamas from releasing the remaining captives.

          <p>President Trump has enacted a universal 50% tariff on all copper imports, a move that immediately triggered a significant drop in U.S. copper prices. The White House stated the new duties are intended to support domestic industries and correct trade imbalances, following similar tariffs on steel and aluminum. The announcement caused copper prices to plunge by as much as 18% in after-hours trading, marking the largest potential single-day decline since 1989.

The spiders, which can live for over 20 years, are generally timid and rarely bite humans unless provoked.

          <p>A gunman opened fire inside a Midtown Manhattan office building, killing four people, including an on-duty NYPD officer, before taking his own life. The suspect, identified as 27-year-old Shane D. Tamura, used a high-powered rifle in the attack at 345 Park Avenue, which houses offices for the NFL and other major corporations. Investigators found a note in which Tamura appeared to blame the NFL for a traumatic head injury, suggesting he may have been targeting the league's headquarters. The victims included the officer, a security guard, and employees from two different companies within the building, leaving the city in shock.</p>

          <p>High Noon is recalling two lots of its Beach Variety 12-packs of vodka seltzers because some of the alcoholic beverages were mistakenly packaged in cans labeled as non-alcoholic Celsius energy drinks. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the recall, warning of the potential for unintended alcohol consumption. The error occurred at a shared packaging supplier, which shipped empty Celsius cans to High Noon's facility. The affected products were distributed to several states, and consumers are advised to dispose of any mislabeled cans and can contact the company for a refund.</p>

          <p>The city council of Leinfelden-Echterdingen, a town near Stuttgart, Germany, has ordered the demolition of a nearly completed mosque. The decision was made because the Islamic association building the mosque, VIKZ, failed to meet a contractually obligated four-year construction deadline set in 2014. After a legal battle that went to Germany's Federal Constitutional Court, the town revoked the building permit. While the council has offered to help find an alternative site, the VIKZ has stated it will not comply with the demolition order, setting the stage for a potential further legal confrontation.</p>

          <p>The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza has reported that seven more people have died from malnutrition, bringing the total number of such deaths to 154 since the conflict began. This comes as UN-backed experts warn that a famine is actively unfolding in the territory, where a dire shortage of food, fuel, and medicine persists. In a related incident, Palestinian sources reported that an Israeli tank killed six people near an aid distribution center, a claim the Israeli military disputed. The ongoing crisis and daily death toll underscore the failure to get sufficient aid into the besieged enclave.</p>

          <p>Despite facing billions in costs from tariffs on imported vehicles, parts, and materials, major automakers have so far avoided passing these expenses on to consumers. Data shows that new vehicle price increases have remained below average, as companies likely used the situation to capture market share and feared that higher prices would deter already-stretched buyers. However, this strategy is not sustainable, and executives have indicated that price hikes are likely coming, potentially with the 2026 model year vehicles. In the meantime, companies are also exploring moving production to the U.S. and cutting costs. (not investment advice)</p>

An analysis of census data showed a significant 3.1% drop in people reporting to work in the private sector when the raids began, a decline comparable only to the COVID-19 lockdown period. Economists warn that the disruption to the immigrant workforce, crucial to sectors like agriculture and construction, could have ripple effects, slowing projects and leading to job losses for citizens.

This article outlines the criteria for qualifying, noting that candidates are typically those facing genuine financial hardship, such as job loss or major medical bills. Borrowers with significant amounts of unsecured debt (often over $10,000) and those who have already fallen behind on payments are also more likely to be successful in negotiating a settlement with creditors. For those who do not qualify, alternative options like credit counseling or debt consolidation are suggested. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A deep-sea voyage has discovered extensive communities of tubeworms and mollusks flourishing at depths over 31,000 feet in the Kuril–Kamchatka and Aleutian trenches. This finding challenges previous assumptions about the limits of life in the ocean's hadal zones, which are characterized by extreme pressure and a lack of sunlight. Researchers believe these creatures survive not on nutrients trickling down from above, but through a chemical-based food web supported by microbes processing ancient carbon from the trench floor. The discovery suggests that such complex ecosystems may be more common in the deepest parts of the world's oceans than previously thought.</p>
