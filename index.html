          <p>NATO allies have convened in The Hague for a two-day summit to discuss increasing defense spending, with a target of 5% expected to be approved. Leaders from the 32 member states, along with representatives from NATO's Indo-Pacific partners, are attending the summit amidst escalating tensions in the Middle East and the ongoing war in Ukraine. US President Donald Trump, who has been a key proponent of increased defense spending among NATO members, is also expected to participate. The summit will address these pressing global crises and aim to bolster the alliance's defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, the Israeli military has reported that Iran violated the agreement by launching more missiles. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz stated that Iran had "completely violated" the ceasefire and ordered the resumption of bombing targets in Tehran. While Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi initially indicated Iran would respect the ceasefire if Israel did the same, the Israeli military reported continued missile barrages from Iran, leading to casualties in Beersheba. The situation remains tense as Israel vows to respond with force to any further violations of the ceasefire.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's intervention in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran may have resulted in a ceasefire, at least temporarily. Trump announced that both countries had agreed to a ceasefire, potentially de-escalating a conflict that threatened to engulf the region after US airstrikes hit Iranian nuclear facilities. However, the fragility of the agreement was highlighted when Israel accused Iran of violating the ceasefire shortly after it was supposed to take effect, though Iran denied any violation. The Trump administration hopes the ceasefire will hold, despite the underlying tensions, after Iran's retaliatory missile strikes on a US base in Qatar caused no casualties.</p>

          <p>Caitlin Morgan, a Swansea University graduate, secured a trainee accountant position after submitting 647 job applications over 18 months. Experiencing numerous rejections and a lack of feedback, Morgan questioned the value of her degree amidst increasing competition for graduate roles. She believes that the use of artificial intelligence in resume screening programs initially hindered her progress, as her CV was not optimized for these systems. Despite the challenges, Morgan's persistence paid off, and she will begin her role in London in September, highlighting the difficulties faced by graduates in a competitive job market.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a sharp decline as a recently announced ceasefire between Iran and Israel alleviated investor concerns about potential supply disruptions in the Middle East. Brent crude prices fell nearly $2 per barrel, paring gains from the previous session, while Nymex WTI also saw a significant decrease. The ceasefire eased fears of a potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial route for oil shipments, although analysts noted that such a closure would likely drive oil prices above $100 per barrel. The International Energy Agency has reassured that it holds substantial emergency stockpiles to mitigate supply risks.</p>

          <p>Royal experts have noted Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's silence regarding the lawsuit against Tyler Perry, who is accused of sexual harassment and assault. Perry, who provided refuge for the couple after their royal exit, faces a $260 million lawsuit. Experts suggest their silence may be perceived as a lack of moral courage and self-serving behavior, potentially damaging their credibility in both Hollywood and royal circles. While Perry's attorney denies the allegations, the couple's failure to offer public support has drawn criticism, with some suggesting it reflects an "all-about-me mindset."</p>

These heat officers analyze local conditions, develop protective measures, and ensure cities are prepared to adapt to extreme heat, moving beyond crisis management to long-term planning.

          <p>Russian drone and missile attacks have killed at least 14 civilians and injured dozens more across Ukraine, including nine deaths in Kyiv, where an apartment building partially collapsed. The attacks coincided with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to the United Kingdom, where he met with King Charles III and Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Ukraine's air force reported intercepting or jamming most of the drones and missiles, but several still reached their targets, causing significant damage. Zelenskyy condemned the attacks and described Russia, North Korea, and Iran as a "coalition of murderers."</p>

          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is expected to place significant demands on Germany's military, the Bundeswehr, including increased defense spending and troop numbers. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged to provide the necessary resources to make the Bundeswehr the strongest conventional army in Europe, aiming to meet NATO's target of spending 5% of GDP on defense by 2035. The summit will also focus on military capabilities, with a need for additional troops in Europe, potentially requiring Germany to recruit tens of thousands of new soldiers. While compulsory military service is a possibility, the current focus is on voluntary enlistment.</p>

          <p>Over 100 Labour MPs are supporting an effort to block the government's proposed changes to the benefits system, specifically targeting cuts to disability and sickness-related benefits. These MPs have signed an amendment that would allow them to vote against the entire welfare reform bill, citing concerns about pushing people into poverty, a lack of consultation, and inadequate impact assessments. Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden defended the bill, stating that the number of people on long-term sickness and disability benefits is expected to double.

The proposed allocation includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for defense-related areas like resilience and security. This split target aims to accommodate both US demands for increased spending and EU countries' financial constraints. Downing Street suggests that measures on energy and tackling smuggling could be classified as security spending.

The facts of Ferrari's current situation are that they entered the year, having come close to winning the constructors' championship last season, believing and saying they could compete for the title, but they have fallen a long way short of that so far, which ultimately is Vasseur's responsibility.</p>

The MSCI World index and US futures have seen only marginal increases, reflecting a market that is potentially fatigued by Trump's policy changes. Analysts suggest that the subdued market response is due to a growing sense of "Trump policy fatigue" and the relatively weak Iranian response to recent US strikes.

For two decades, US intelligence has maintained that Iran has not built a nuclear bomb, while Israel and Iran hawks insist Iran could quickly develop one. Trump's skepticism of the CIA and his ideological purge of national security staff have led him to disregard expert opinions on Iran and the Middle East. Without evidence of weaponization, the debate over Iran's nuclear program has become theological, with Trump dismissing intelligence assessments that contradict his preferred narrative.</p>

          <p>Western airlines may experience greater disruptions than their Chinese counterparts due to the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, which is forcing carriers to avoid dangerous airspace. While both Western and Chinese airlines are diverting flights to bypass Iran and parts of the Middle East, Western firms are at a disadvantage because they remain barred from Russian airspace. This allows Chinese airlines greater flexibility in navigating China-Europe routes, potentially widening their competitive edge due to shorter flight times and lower airfares, after Moscow closed its airspace to the West after the Russia-Ukraine war started in 2022.</p>

          <p>After 80 years of ownership, the Gully family is selling the Island of Shuna in Scotland, which includes a ruined castle, a working farm, and a holiday accommodation business. The island has been home to the Gully family since 1945, when the Dowager Viscountess Selby purchased it. The castle was built in 1911 by a New Zealand-born adventurer, and the blueprints were reportedly lost on the Titanic. The family is selling the 1,000-acre island for Â£5.5m after 12 years of management by Rob and Kathryn James, who are now moving on to another role.</p>
