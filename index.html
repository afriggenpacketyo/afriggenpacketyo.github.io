        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James is appealing a court decision that overturned a nearly $500 million penalty against Donald Trump and his company. The initial penalty was imposed after a judge found Trump and his organization had committed business fraud by inflating asset values to secure better financial terms. An appellate court had previously voided the fine, citing it as "excessive" under the U.S. Constitution's Eighth Amendment, though it upheld the fraud finding. James is now asking the state's highest court to reinstate the significant financial punishment.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma fell by nearly 20%, reaching their lowest point since its recent initial public offering. The decline occurred after the company released its first earnings report as a public entity, which included a revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter that, while showing growth, did not fully meet the market's high expectations. Despite second-quarter results being largely in line with predictions, the stock's volatility reflects investor uncertainty after its initial surge. The report noted a slight decrease in its net retention rate, a key metric for customer expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Louisiana state prosecutor successfully argued against a bond reduction for Stanley Burkhardt, a former New Orleans police detective with a history of child molestation convictions. The prosecutor described the 74-year-old as the "worst kind of offender" who repeatedly violates parole conditions. Burkhardt was arrested again in July for allegedly using secret online accounts to access photos of children. Despite his public defender's arguments, the judge sided with the prosecution, maintaining his bond at $100,000 and keeping him in custody due to the perceived risk to the community.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has confirmed that the UK government is exploring the implementation of a digital ID system to help address illegal immigration. He suggested that such a program could serve as an important tool to reduce the incentive for entering the country without permission. Starmer noted that public perception has likely evolved since the contentious debate over physical ID cards two decades ago, given the increased prevalence of digital identification today. The Conservative opposition, however, expressed skepticism, arguing that a digital ID system would not solve the core issues of illegal migration and employment.</p>

          <p>Newly released court documents reveal that FBI agents seized iPhones, computers, USB drives, and various documents during a raid on the home of John Bolton, Donald Trump's former national security adviser. The search warrant was based on probable cause of "evidence of a crime" and other illegally possessed items related to his official duties. Agents were authorized to collect materials concerning the storage or transmission of classified information. The raid is part of a federal investigation into the handling of classified documents, though Bolton has not been charged with any crime.</p>

          <h2>A Historical Look at the Use and Criticism of Puns in The Atlantic</h2>

          <p>This article explores the long and storied history of puns within the pages of The Atlantic, dating back to its co-founder, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. Despite often being maligned, wordplay has been a consistent feature of the magazine, with writers simultaneously denouncing and employing puns. The piece traces the changing attitudes toward this form of humor, from its high favor in the 19th century to its decline and modern-day status as a "wise-crack." It highlights several historical examples, including a surprisingly durable pun about the 1860 presidential election, demonstrating the enduring, if sometimes groan-inducing, nature of the pun.</p>

          <p>Andriy Parubiy, a former leader of Ukraine's parliament, was assassinated in Lviv, sparking a national debate on the security of public figures. The suspected perpetrator, who confessed, claimed he was manipulated by Russian intelligence services who allegedly promised information about his son killed in the war. This event is viewed by experts as part of Russia's hybrid warfare strategy to destabilize Ukrainian society by targeting prominent politicians and activists. The killing has raised questions about the effectiveness of Ukrainian intelligence and whether more resources are needed to protect high-profile individuals from such attacks.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced that 26 Western allies have committed to deploying troops to Ukraine immediately following a ceasefire agreement. Speaking after a summit of 35 countries, Macron stated that these security guarantees would be activated the moment hostilities cease. The plan for a "reassurance force" is expected to be finalized with U.S. support in the coming days, although direct U.S. ground troop involvement has been ruled out. This commitment comes as hopes for a diplomatic resolution have faded, with Russia continuing to send troops into Ukraine despite ongoing talks.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Determining the best age to claim Social Security benefits depends heavily on individual financial circumstances and needs. While claiming at age 62 provides immediate income, it results in a permanently reduced monthly payment. Waiting until full retirement age (66-67) secures the standard benefit, but delaying until age 70 can increase payments by about 8% for each year of deferral. To maximize benefits, financial experts suggest creating alternative income streams, such as using 401(k) funds, creating bond ladders, or considering annuities, to bridge the financial gap and allow Social Security benefits to grow.
