        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The stock market experienced a significant downturn as President Trump renewed his attacks on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing his handling of interest rates, which exacerbated existing investor anxieties about the potential economic impacts of ongoing tariff disputes. This market slump also coincides with investors awaiting earnings reports from major technology companies, further contributing to the uncertainty. Concerns over the safety of U.S. assets were evident as the dollar index weakened, gold prices reached record highs, and long-term treasury yields increased, reflecting a broader lack of confidence among global investors.

          <p>Pope Francis' will, dated June 29, 2022, expressed his wishes regarding his burial, requesting to be interred in the Papal Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, a church dedicated to the Virgin Mary where he often prayed after his international trips. He asked for a simple tomb in the earth, without elaborate decorations, bearing only his name, 'Franciscus', differing from other popes by omitting any mention of his papacy in the inscription.

          <p>Pope Francis passed away at the age of 88, with the Vatican attributing his death to a cerebral stroke, coma, and subsequent irreversible heart failure, following a history of respiratory issues and hospitalizations. The Pope had been hospitalized multiple times in recent years for bronchitis, pneumonia, and intestinal issues, often using a wheelchair due to knee problems. Earlier in the year, he battled a severe respiratory infection and pneumonia, facing critical health challenges before ultimately recovering and being discharged from the hospital just weeks before his death.</p>

          <p>Steve Hilton, a conservative commentator and Silicon Valley entrepreneur, has announced his candidacy for California governor in 2026, joining Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco as a Republican contender. Hilton aims to end what he describes as "one-party rule" in California and restore opportunity to the state, but faces an uphill battle in a state that has not elected a Republican statewide since 2006. His campaign could benefit from a fractured Democratic field and his relationships in Silicon Valley, but his past support for Donald Trump may pose a challenge.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants is facing a legal challenge in a Colorado federal court, with rights groups arguing that individuals are not being given adequate notice to fight their deportation orders. The ACLU and Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network contend that 24 hours' notice is insufficient, especially for detainees who may not speak English or have legal representation. The case raises questions about due process rights for migrants and the government's authority to remove individuals without proper legal proceedings.</p>

While the Department of Education emphasizes protecting taxpayers, critics argue that the move is cruel and will further destabilize working families.
