          <p>UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is scheduled to meet with Israeli President Isaac Herzog to discuss the "intolerable situation in Gaza." The meeting comes amid significant pressure from within the UK, including calls from dozens of MPs to deny Herzog entry over allegations of genocide, which Israel denies. Starmer will reportedly urge Israel to take action to end the suffering, while also navigating internal party divisions and criticism from human rights groups regarding the UK's stance on the conflict and arms sales.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to fast-track a case to determine the legality of tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The administration had warned that a delayed ruling could force the Treasury to refund up to $1 trillion if the tariffs are ultimately deemed illegal. A federal appeals court previously ruled that President Trump overstepped his authority by using emergency economic powers to implement the widespread duties, a decision the Supreme Court will now review in its November session.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Key inflation reports for August are anticipated to show a rise in consumer and producer prices, largely influenced by tariffs on imported goods. Economists predict that while the headline inflation rate may increase, the core reading, which excludes food and energy, will likely remain stable. This distinction is crucial, as the Federal Reserve is expected to view the tariff-driven price hikes as temporary and may still proceed with an interest rate cut to support a weakening jobs market.

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has reportedly engaged with William Parker, a researcher with a fringe theory that acetaminophen (Tylenol) is a primary cause of autism. Parker's work has been largely rejected by the mainstream scientific community, which points to genetic factors and changes in diagnostic criteria for the rise in autism rates. This development aligns with Kennedy's long-standing skepticism of established medical science and his promise to identify and eliminate the causes of autism.</p>

          <p>In the ongoing trial of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, two of the five Supreme Court justices have voted to find him guilty of plotting a coup to overturn the 2022 election results. A conviction requires at least one more guilty vote, which could result in a prison sentence of over 40 years. The presiding justice presented evidence of a detailed plan to prevent President-elect Lula from taking office, alleging that Bolsonaro led the "criminal organisation" behind the scheme.</p>

          <p>A massive immigration raid at a Hyundai manufacturing facility in Georgia, which resulted in the detention of nearly 500 workers, is forcing other foreign companies to scrutinize their U.S. operations. The event is seen as a "wakeup call," signaling the Trump administration's intensified enforcement of immigration laws within the country's interior. Analysts suggest that businesses may now accelerate efforts to hire and train more American workers to avoid similar disruptions and legal risks.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration issued a rare criticism of an Israeli military action, stating that the strike on Hamas leaders in Doha "does not advance Israel or America's goals." A White House spokesperson emphasized that Qatar is a sovereign nation and a close U.S. ally actively working to broker peace in the region. The statement also revealed that the administration was informed of the attack by the U.S. military just before it occurred, not directly by Israel.</p>

          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement, mediated by Egypt, to resume cooperation and restart inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. This marks a potential de-escalation after Iran suspended all cooperation with the watchdog following a brief war with Israel and the U.S. in June. The agreement comes at a critical time, as European nations have begun the process of reimposing sanctions on Iran for non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>

          <p>An analysis of Manchester City striker Erling Haaland's record-breaking goal tally suggests his primary strength is not his finishing ability but his extraordinary physical and tactical intelligence. While his finishing is above average, his true genius lies in his speed, strength, and movement, which allow him to consistently generate a higher quantity and quality of scoring opportunities than other elite strikers. This ability to create superior chances for himself is the fundamental driver of his phenomenal goalscoring record.</p>

He argues that the cryptocurrency's decentralized, borderless system offers a more efficient solution for international financial transfers compared to the slow and costly legacy system. While dismissing the threat from currency projects by nations like the BRICS, he believes Bitcoin has a real chance to rival the dollar's global role. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While credit card companies are unlikely to completely waive payments if a cardholder loses their job, many offer hardship programs that can provide temporary relief. These programs may allow for a short-term pause in payments or a reduction in interest rates, but consumers must proactively contact their issuer to request assistance. For those who do not qualify or need more help, the article recommends exploring other options such as nonprofit credit counseling, debt settlement, or a consolidation loan.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has suspended its restaurant remodeling program following significant public backlash against its attempt to modernize its brand. The controversy began with a new, sleeker logo that dropped the "Old Country Store" tagline and was criticized by customers and even President Trump. The company has since acknowledged that the modern designs do not reflect the "vintage Americana" atmosphere that its customers value, and it has reverted to its previous branding.</p>
