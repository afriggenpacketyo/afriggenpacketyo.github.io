          <p>A woman was killed by an alligator while canoeing on Lake Kissimmee in central Florida. The incident occurred near the mouth of Tiger Creek, south of Orlando. According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, the woman encountered an alligator and entered the water, later being recovered dead. Authorities are investigating the attack, and a nuisance alligator trapper has been dispatched to the area. Serious injuries from alligators are rare in Florida, but the FWC manages a program to remove alligators that pose a threat to people or property.</p>

          <p>Container bookings from China to the United States experienced a significant drop of 27% year-on-year, reaching their lowest level since February, according to data from Vizion. This decline is attributed to the impact of increased US tariffs, causing "deep disruption and sourcing shifts." Weekly container bookings fell sharply after President Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs, leading supply chain teams to rethink their timing, inventory levels, and sourcing strategies due to uncertainty about future tariff levels. The drop in container bookings is seen as a proxy for decreased export activity between China and the US.</p>

          <p>While AI models are increasingly being used for forecasting, they still lag behind top human forecasters, according to a recent article. Tournaments run by Metaculus show that human superforecasters consistently beat AI-driven bots, although the gap is narrowing. The most successful AI model in a recent quarter was surprisingly simple, using news articles and OpenAI's model to make predictions. However, AI faces challenges in quantitative thinking, logical reasoning, and web research skills, which limits its forecasting accuracy. The article suggests that AI forecasting is improving rapidly and may soon surpass human capabilities due to its ability to learn from mistakes and weigh information objectively.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated after India conducted missile strikes on Pakistani-controlled territory, resulting in casualties. Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the strikes as an act of war and vowed a strong response. India claimed the strikes targeted militant infrastructure linked to a recent terrorist attack in Kashmir, while Pakistan reported shooting down Indian fighter jets. The UN Secretary-General has called for maximum restraint, and concerns are mounting about potential further escalation between the two nuclear-armed nations.</p>

          <p>Sixteen individuals, including a leader from the Sinaloa cartel, have been arrested in what authorities are calling the "largest fentanyl bust in DEA history." The operation, which spanned multiple states, resulted in the seizure of three million fentanyl-laced pills, along with large quantities of fentanyl powder, methamphetamine, cocaine, and heroin. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that the individuals arrested will remain in American prisons. Drug overdoses are the leading cause of death for Americans between 18 and 44, though overdose deaths have decreased in recent years.</p>

          <p>Indian markets have shown resilience and remained largely unaffected by recent strikes against Pakistan, reflecting investor confidence in India's growth prospects. Analysts suggest that structural reforms, strong domestic demand, and solid macroeconomic fundamentals are contributing factors.

Despite the geopolitical tensions, experts anticipate a swift de-escalation and limited market fallout, drawing parallels to investor reactions following previous conflicts.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning to eliminate federal research on pollution caused by satellites and rockets, potentially benefiting Elon Musk's space companies. These research projects, part of NOAA's office of atmospheric research, aimed to study the accumulation of pollutants in the stratosphere from spacecraft, which could harm the ozone layer and destabilize the climate. Critics argue this decision is politically motivated, protecting Musk's business interests, as his companies could face new regulations based on the research. With the elimination of these projects, Musk and Jeff Bezos are effectively in charge of the stratosphere's health.</p>

          <p>Recent welfare checks conducted by immigration agents on unaccompanied migrant children have raised concerns among advocates, who fear the tactic is a guise for deportations. The checks have led to children being removed from their sponsors and placed in federal custody, or forced to leave the country with deported parents. The Trump administration has placed under review the cases of thousands of children who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border without their parents, raising fears that these welfare checks are part of a broader effort to target and deport vulnerable immigrants.</p>
