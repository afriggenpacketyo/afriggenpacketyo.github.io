          <p>A horrific attack at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Grand Blanc, Michigan, resulted in two fatalities and ten injuries during a Sunday service. The 40-year-old gunman rammed his vehicle through the doors, opened fire on hundreds of attendees, and deliberately set the church ablaze before being killed by police. Investigators are exploring potential motives, including a possible connection to the recent death of LDS President Russell M. Nelson. Federal and state officials, including President Trump and Governor Whitmer, condemned the violence, highlighting growing concerns over targeted attacks on religious institutions.</p>

          <p>A new record was set as 125 migrants successfully crossed the English Channel in a single small boat on Saturday, surpassing a previous high of 106. This incident contributes to the 895 migrants who crossed in 12 boats on Saturday alone, bringing the total for 2025 to approximately 33,000. The crossing occurred amidst further tragedy, with another migrant's body found on a French beach, raising this year's death toll from illegal attempts to at least 27. Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood condemned people-smugglers and vowed to restore order to the immigration system, as the UK government faces increasing pressure over rising crossings.</p>

          <p>Former South Carolina prosecutor Tommy Pope, who secured the conviction of Susan Smith for the 1994 drowning deaths of her two young sons, insists she must remain imprisoned. Smith, who strapped her children into their car seats before rolling her vehicle into a lake, is eligible for parole in 2026 after being denied in 2024. Pope, now a state legislator, argued that while she might not pose a future danger, her incarceration is essential punishment for her heinous actions. Smith had initially falsely blamed a Black man for carjacking her and abducting her sons, leading to a widespread manhunt.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda has formed in the western Atlantic and is projected to intensify into a hurricane by early next week, threatening the southeastern U.S. with torrential rainfall. Currently located near the Central Bahamas, Imelda is expected to bring up to eight inches of rain to Cuba and the Bahamas, potentially causing flash flooding and mudslides. The storm's path suggests heavy rains, possibly up to seven inches, could affect Florida's Atlantic coast north to the Carolinas by Wednesday. South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster has issued a state of emergency, and FEMA is preparing for potential impacts, including staging bases with essential supplies.</p>

          <p>The United States is considering Ukraine's request for long-range Tomahawk missiles to bolster its defense against Russia, Vice President JD Vance confirmed. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy proposed the U.S. sell Tomahawks to European nations for transfer to Ukraine. This article notes that President Trump will make the final decision, despite past denials, as he grows frustrated with Russia's refusal to pursue a peace deal and its stalled territorial gains. Meanwhile, Ukraine has improved its ability to strike military targets inside Russia, supported by German aid for drone production, amidst recent deadly Russian drone and missile attacks on Kyiv.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance expressed confidence that TikTok has been successfully separated from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, ensuring U.S. data security and preventing its algorithm from being used as a foreign propaganda tool. Following months of uncertainty, President Donald Trump signed an executive order approving a proposal for TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. Under the agreement, a new joint-venture company will oversee TikTok's U.S. business, with ByteDance retaining less than a 20% stake, and American investors holding the majority.

          <p>New Jersey's gubernatorial race has been significantly impacted by the accidental release of Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill's unredacted military records, including her Social Security number. The National Archives blamed a technician's error, but Sherrill and her Democratic allies allege it was a deliberate act by the Trump administration to weaponize federal resources against her. While the records confirm her unblemished Navy career, they also revived a 30-year-old cheating scandal from her Naval Academy days, which her Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, is using to question her transparency. This article highlights the political controversy and calls for investigations into the records' release.</p>

This article highlights the ongoing tension between protest groups and authorities, particularly concerning the legal status of organizations deemed proscribed, and the broader political climate surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at a major political event.</p>

This article highlights the program's critical role in rural communities, not only for early childhood education and family support but also as a significant local employer and economic contributor.
