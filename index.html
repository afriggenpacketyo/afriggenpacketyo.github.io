          <p>Analysts are struggling to predict the impact of the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran on oil prices. Israel's recent attack on Iranian infrastructure has led to increased warfare, with the U.S. calling for Iran's unconditional surrender. Energy markets are assessing the potential for U.S. involvement and major supply disruptions, including the possibility of Iran blocking the Strait of Hormuz. One analyst noted a "blanket of unease" in oil markets due to the ease with which the situation could escalate. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores how much monthly income a $500,000 annuity could generate for a 65-year-old, noting several influencing factors. Payments vary based on gender, with men receiving around $3,269 and women around $3,151 per month for life, while a joint life annuity pays approximately $2,863 per month. The current higher-rate environment is favorable for annuity payouts, but potential Federal Reserve rate cuts could change this. The type of annuity, payout features, and inflation protection also affect monthly income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that Massachusetts is projected to spend over $1 billion on its emergency shelter program in FY25, with a significant portion allocated to migrant families. The state has spent $830 million so far, accommodating over 4,000 families with shelter, food, education, legal aid, and case management, costing about $3,496 per week per family. While the number of hotels used as shelters has decreased, the influx of migrants has strained the state's resources, prompting criticism from Republican figures. The report also notes that many migrants have received work authorizations and are currently employed.</p>

The court ruled 6-3 that the law does not discriminate against transgender people, with Chief Justice John Roberts stating that the law responds to ongoing debates among medical experts. The dissenting justices, led by Sonia Sotomayor, argued that the law creates medical discrimination based on sex and abandons transgender children to political whims.

          <p>While global food production is at an all-time high, it is concentrated in a few key breadbaskets that are projected to experience significant harvest declines due to climate change. A study in Nature indicates that staple crops will see an 11.2 percent decline by the end of the century under a moderate emissions scenario. Extreme weather events are already impacting harvests, and rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns are expected to diminish yields. The study suggests that while adaptation can slow some crop losses, it may not be sufficient to keep pace with warming.</p>
