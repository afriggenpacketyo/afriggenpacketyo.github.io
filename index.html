        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Ministry of Commerce has issued a stern warning to Mexico, urging it to reconsider plans to raise tariffs on cars imported from Asia to 50%. The ministry stated that it would take necessary measures to protect its interests, potentially escalating trade tensions. This development occurs as Chinese auto manufacturers have been significantly increasing their investments and exports to Mexico, which benefits from tariff-free access to the U.S. market under the USMCA trade agreement. The proposed tariff hike, which requires congressional approval in Mexico, reflects growing international pressure on Chinese auto exports.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison after finding him guilty of orchestrating a military coup plot to unlawfully remain in power following his 2022 election defeat. The court's panel also barred the 70-year-old politician from holding public office until 2033. Bolsonaro, who was under house arrest during the trial, has denied the charges, with his lawyers calling the sentence excessive and vowing to appeal. The conviction also implicated several of his close allies, including senior military officers and former ministers.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) provides a crucial alternative to the current global multilateral system, which is described as faltering and increasingly sidelined by unilateral actions and trade conflicts. The author posits that as institutions like the United Nations face challenges, the SCO offers a platform for cooperation among countries with diverse political systems and cultures. It is framed as a stabilizing force in a world at risk of fragmentation, where negotiation is being replaced by sanctions and tariffs, promoting a different approach to international governance.</p>

Kirk was assassinated during a speaking event at Utah Valley University, and federal authorities are actively searching for the suspect. The event marks the beginning of a series of tributes for the influential founder of Turning Point USA. President Donald Trump has announced he will attend the funeral, as the FBI continues to appeal to the public for information leading to the killer's arrest.</p>

          <p>The trial of Ryan Routh, the man accused of attempting to assassinate Donald Trump at a Florida golf course, commenced with an unusual opening as Routh, representing himself, delivered a rambling philosophical statement that was cut short by the judge. Prosecutors presented their case, alleging a carefully planned plot, and called their first witnesses, including a Secret Service agent who discovered Routh hiding near the course. The agent testified that Routh aimed an AK-style weapon at him before he fired his own weapon, initiating the incident that led to Routh's capture.</p>

          <p>A new immigration detention facility in West Texas, described by Rep. Veronica Escobar as a "giant tent city," is raising concerns over its conditions and operations. With a capacity for up to 5,000 people, the center is run by a private contractor with no public record of managing such a facility, under a $1.24 billion government contract.

          <p>A recent powerful surge in China's $12 trillion stock market is testing the government's ability to manage its growth without creating another volatile bubble. Beijing is aiming to guide a sustainable bull market that can serve as a stable source of household income, shifting wealth away from the turbulent property sector and helping to boost domestic consumption. After years of dramatic booms and busts, regulators are now focused on moderating the gains to prevent risky speculation by retail investors while still maintaining positive market sentiment and an overall upward trend.

The deliveries were legal, as they were for construction, but occurred while domestic customers in a neighboring area faced a hosepipe ban and a drought order. The action was prompted by local residents who documented dozens of tankers a day transporting water from public standpipes, sparking public outrage over the use of a precious resource during a drought.</p>

          <p>Following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in Utah, security measures have been significantly increased for President Trump and other political figures across the United States. Citing an abundance of caution, the location of a presidential speech was moved, and several high-profile politicians have canceled or postponed public events. The ongoing manhunt for Kirk's killer, coupled with threats made against other institutions, has created a climate of heightened unease and underscored growing concerns about the potential for politically motivated violence in the country.</p>

          <p>The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts has dismissed Kevin Struthers, its senior director of music programming who had been with the institution for 30 years. This firing is the latest in a series of high-profile departures and terminations since President Trump became the Center's chair and appointed a new president. The move has raised concerns among the arts community about the future direction of the Kennedy Center's acclaimed jazz programming, especially following the departure of its artistic director for jazz, Jason Moran, in July.

          <p>Senate Republicans have voted to change the chamber's rules to accelerate the confirmation of President Trump's executive branch nominees, a move often referred to as the "nuclear option." The new rule allows for sub-Cabinet, ambassador, and other non-judicial nominees to be considered and confirmed in batches rather than through individual votes. Majority Leader John Thune argued the change was necessary to overcome Democratic obstruction and allow the president to staff his administration, while Minority Leader Chuck Schumer criticized it as an act of deference to the executive branch.</p>

His comments came after Spirit filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy for the second time in a year, struggling with weak consumer demand and high operational costs. Kirby criticized the model for its reliance on fees and what he described as a poor customer experience, arguing that larger rivals with more comprehensive offerings have rendered the discount-only approach obsolete in the current market.</p>

These worms are predators of essential earthworms and can decimate local populations, impacting soil health and native plant growth. The worms also secrete a toxin that can be an irritant to humans and pets. Officials are advising the public not to squish or cut the worms, as this causes them to multiply through regeneration, and instead recommend capturing and freezing them or drowning them in soapy water.</p>

Gulf leaders viewed the strike as a violation of sovereignty and a failure of the U.S. security umbrella they have long relied on, raising questions about the reliability of American protection when interests conflict with those of Israel.</p>
