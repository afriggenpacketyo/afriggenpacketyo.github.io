          <p>Solomon Peña, a former Republican candidate for a New Mexico state House seat, has been sentenced to 80 years in prison for orchestrating drive-by shootings at the homes of Democratic officials. Following his loss in the November 2022 election, Peña hired co-conspirators to carry out the attacks, which occurred between December 2022 and January 2023. He was convicted of 13 felony charges, including conspiracy and intimidation, after pressing officials not to certify election results based on unsubstantiated fraud claims. Peña personally participated in one of the shootings, though no one was hurt.</p>

          <p>Secondary sanctions, primarily used by the United States, extend restrictions to third-party countries or entities doing business with sanctioned parties, such as Russia. Their power stems from the global importance of the US dollar and access to the US market. While effective in past cases like Iran, experts debate their overall efficacy, noting they can be difficult to enforce, risk retaliation, and may push targeted countries closer together. The article concludes that secondary sanctions are a potentially useful but not a "silver bullet" tool in foreign policy, requiring careful deployment.</p>

          <p>A recent study by ADP reveals that 60% of Singaporean workers are living paycheck to paycheck in 2024, a notable increase from 53% in 2021. This trend is attributed to Singapore's high cost of living, including expensive housing and import costs, despite recent cooling inflation. Experts also point to shifting cultural priorities, with younger generations spending more on experiences and self-care rather than long-term savings. The article highlights a growing financial strain on middle-income earners in one of the world's most expensive cities.</p>

          <p>This article explores the historical context and development of the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which addresses presidential succession and disability. Years before President Kennedy's assassination, a young lawyer, John Feerick, recognized the absence of clear constitutional instructions for such scenarios. His mission led to the creation of this vital amendment, providing a framework for power transfer if a president becomes unable to serve. The article highlights the foresight and effort behind one of the Constitution's later additions.</p>

          <p>The U.K. economy expanded by 0.3% in the second quarter, surpassing Reuters' forecast of 0.1% growth, according to preliminary estimates from the Office for National Statistics. This growth, primarily driven by services, follows a strong first quarter. Despite the positive figures, economists are cautious, expecting moderation in the third quarter due to a softening labor market and ongoing inflation pressures. The Bank of England recently cut interest rates, balancing sticky inflation with subdued growth, suggesting continued vigilance for economic stability.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has rejected a $21,600 copyright claim against Pinkfong's viral children's song "Baby Shark." U.S. composer Jonathan Wright alleged the 2015 hit copied his 2011 song. However, the court upheld previous rulings, determining that Wright's rendition lacked sufficient originality to warrant protection, as both songs are based on a traditional melody popular at U.S. summer camps. Pinkfong stated the ruling confirms "Baby Shark" is based on a public domain chant, solidifying its legal standing.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit brought by environmental groups and the Miccosukee tribe challenges the construction and operation of an immigration detention center, dubbed "Alligator Alcatraz," in the Florida Everglades. A key unanswered question in court is who precisely controls the facility, with Florida claiming state operation under ICE authority, while plaintiffs argue it's a federal function. The lawsuit alleges violations of federal environmental law due to rushed construction without proper assessments, raising concerns about impacts on endangered species, water quality, and tribal communities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at easing regulations for commercial rocket launches, directing the US transportation secretary to expedite environmental reviews and cancel outdated rules. The order states that inefficient processes hinder investment and innovation in global space markets, potentially benefiting private companies like SpaceX. Environmental groups have criticized the deregulation, warning of risks from private launches that can explode and devastate surrounding areas. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has previously complained that environmental studies and reviews slow down rocket testing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans who consume alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, coinciding with increased public concern about the health risks of even moderate drinking. This shift is particularly pronounced among young people (18-34), with 66% believing moderate drinking is harmful. Experts suggest factors like greater health awareness, increased social acceptance of sobriety, and the high cost of alcohol contribute to this trend. The article also notes a starker decline in alcohol use among women compared to men.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a warning that mousse sunscreen products, including those from popular brands like Supergoop!, may not effectively protect against harmful UV rays. The FDA also highlighted a safety risk due to these products being packaged to resemble whipped cream, increasing the chance of accidental ingestion, especially by children. Several companies received warning letters for lacking required FDA approval and for "misbranded" packaging. Some companies are now working to address these violations and ensure compliance.</p>

Despite South Korea's assessment that some speakers were being dismantled, North Korea's firm stance indicates a continued refusal to engage in peace talks.
