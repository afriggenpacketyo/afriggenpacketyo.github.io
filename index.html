          <p>The United States, along with other regional entities, is attempting to prevent war between India and Pakistan. Overnight shelling and strikes have intensified tensions, overshadowing diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict. Despite public displays of strength from both sides, there are indications that security officials from both countries have initiated contact to re-establish communication, with President Trump offering assistance. The European Union has called for de-escalation and protection of civilian lives, but violence continues along the border, with both sides making claims of attacks and responses that are difficult to verify.

          <p>This article argues that President Trump is betraying his supporters by failing to reconcile conflicting promises made during his campaign. On issues ranging from tariffs to foreign policy, Trump has been forced to choose between competing interests, alienating key constituencies. The author suggests that this has led to disillusionment among some of Trump's backers and could jeopardize his political coalition. The article concludes that Trump's transactional approach to politics has inherent limits.</p>

          <p>This article examines the impact of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) on federal spending, finding that its claims of savings are often exaggerated. While DOGE has targeted specific areas for cuts, such as public health and foreign aid, the overall effect on federal outlays has been minimal. The article argues that DOGE's efforts are unlikely to significantly reduce budget deficits and may even lead to increased deficits in the long term. It concludes that DOGE's true purpose is to purge and intimidate the civil service.</p>
