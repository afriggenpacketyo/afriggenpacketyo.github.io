          <p>Justin Sun, the founder of the Tron blockchain platform, has announced that he is currently the largest holder of the $TRUMP meme token, securing him an invitation to a gala dinner with former President Donald Trump. Sun holds $18.6 million worth of the Trump-themed meme token, adding to his previous $75 million investment in World Liberty Financial, which directs a substantial portion of its revenue to Trump-owned entities. With a total stake exceeding $93 million in the Trump family's crypto ventures, Sun, who is also in discussions with the SEC regarding civil fraud charges, is eager to connect with others in the crypto space at the dinner. This move underscores the intersection of cryptocurrency and political influence. (not investment advice)</p>

Ventura also testified about wiring $20,000 to Mr. Combs, fearing for her daughter's well-being, though the money was later returned. The testimony provided a wider view of the couple’s life together, which was filled with drugs, outbursts of jealousy, and violence toward her, while Mr. Combs has denied the sex trafficking and other accusations of criminal conduct that have been lodged against him.</p>

          <p>Imelda Collins is raffling off her two-bedroom cottage in the north of Ireland, offering tickets for $6.70 each, as an alternative to the traditional real estate market.

The raffle, hosted on raffall.com, provides a turnkey transaction and could potentially net her a higher price than a conventional sale. The house, fully furnished and recently renovated, sits on 1.75 acres of countryside near Sligo Bay, and the raffle is open to anyone worldwide, concluding on May 22.</p>

          <p>A maintenance worker at the Orleans Parish Justice Center in New Orleans, Sterling Williams, has been arrested for allegedly assisting 10 inmates in their escape from the jail.

          <p>Millions of consumers in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland (and parts of Scotland) could receive up to £70 each following a court ruling that historic fees charged by Mastercard were unfair. The case, brought forward by Walter Merricks, argued that shoppers were charged higher prices due to fees wrongly levied on transactions between 1992 and 2008. Consumers who lived in the eligible regions for at least three months during the specified period and purchased goods or services from UK businesses that accepted Mastercard are eligible to claim compensation by completing an online form by the end of the year.</p>

Dr. Céline Gounder emphasizes that pregnant women are more vulnerable to heat-related issues due to the strain pregnancy places on the heart and the increased risk of dehydration. She advises pregnant women to avoid overexertion on hot days, seek shade, and utilize cooling centers, especially during the third trimester, while noting that resources related to heat safety are being cut.</p>
