        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report indicates a significant increase in complaints regarding substandard living conditions in social housing in England, with complaints now five times higher than five years ago. Housing Ombudsman Richard Blakeway highlights an "imbalance of power" between tenants and landlords, leading to a breakdown in trust due to issues like asbestos, pest control, and dampness. The ombudsman calls for a transformative overhaul, including an independent review of funding and a national tenant body to strengthen tenant voice and landlord accountability. Blakeway warns that without change, England risks the "managed decline" of social housing, potentially leading to social unrest.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled $766 million in funding for Moderna's bird flu vaccine research, despite the company reporting positive interim results from early trials. The funding, awarded through BARDA, aimed to develop a vaccine against potential pandemic influenza viruses like H5N1. The decision comes as Moderna announced its mRNA-1018 vaccine showed a robust immune response in healthy adults.

          <p>After an extensive search, the remains of LÃ©o Dufour, a 22-year-old experienced hiker, were discovered in the Adirondack Mountains months after his disappearance. Dufour had set out on a solo hike to Allen Mountain in late November, equipped for a day trip, but never returned. Despite a large-scale search effort involving dozens of rangers and helicopters, the search was suspended due to treacherous conditions. The article reflects on the inherent risks of hiking alone, especially during the late fall, and the profound impact of Dufour's death on his community.</p>

          <p>Amy Larocca's book, "How to Be Well," explores the wellness industry's growth into a $6.3 trillion market, largely driven by women seeking a state beyond mere health. The movement has expanded from fitness and diet to include alternative cures and data-driven biohacking, even influencing political movements like MAHA. However, access to health and wellness has increasingly become a luxury, with the average American spending minimal time with primary-care physicians, while exclusive wellness clinics offer extensive, costly attention. The article questions whether wellness is simply consumerism, a new politics, or a new religion, particularly in a country where healthcare access is unequal.</p>

          <p>UK car manufacturing has experienced a significant drop, reaching its lowest April output in over 70 years, primarily due to US tariffs and the timing of Easter. The transition from petrol cars to electric vehicles has also temporarily reduced production. While a US court blocked many of Trump's tariffs, the ruling does not apply to tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars. New trade deals with the US, EU, and India may help boost upcoming production, but some firms are frustrated by the slow implementation of tariff reductions.</p>

          <p>Global markets experienced a surge following a U.S. court's decision to block some of President Trump's tariffs, boosting investor sentiment. The ruling is subject to appeal but is expected to ease concerns about a trade war. Nvidia's strong earnings also contributed to the market's positive momentum, with its stock price rising significantly. Investors sold U.S. government bonds, causing the yield on the 30-year Treasury note to rise above 5 percent.</p>

          <p>Modernizing building codes to allow single-stair housing in the U.S. could lead to more affordable housing options, according to advocates. The U.S. has historically favored double-staircase apartment buildings, increasing construction costs and limiting design flexibility. Allowing single-stair construction could cut costs by about 10 percent and encourage developers to build more "missing middle" housing, including family-friendly units. While fire safety officials express concerns, advocates argue that modern safety features like sprinklers make single-stair designs just as safe.</p>

          <p>A new report from the World Meteorological Organization warns that the planet is poised to get even hotter, with average warming likely exceeding 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels within the next five years. This warming trend will lead to more frequent and intense natural disasters, including droughts, heat waves, and wildfires, particularly in the western U.S. States. The U.S. is facing this period with reduced capacity to forecast and mitigate disasters due to staffing cuts at NOAA and a broader retreat from climate mitigation efforts under the Trump administration.</p>
