          <p>A recent report indicates the Chinese yuan's international usage grew by approximately 11% in 2024, solidifying its position ahead of the British pound and Japanese yen. While the US dollar remains dominant, its influence has slightly decreased. The report suggests that promoting the yuan's internationalization is a key strategy for China to mitigate geoeconomic risks and reform the global monetary system. However, the rise of US-backed stablecoins is viewed as a potential threat to this expansion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UnitedHealth Group is confronting significant challenges as it prepares to report its earnings, with its stock price nearly halved since mid-May. The company is grappling with a sharp decline in profits from its Medicare and Optum Health divisions, which led to an abrupt CEO change and the suspension of its 2025 earnings guidance. Adding to the pressure, the Department of Justice has launched criminal and civil investigations into its Medicare billing practices, creating a "perfect storm" of issues for the major insurer.</p>

          <p>A new trade deal between the United States and the European Union, which imposes a 15% tariff on most European goods, is projected to have a major impact on global trade flows. According to a tariff simulator from The Observatory of Economic Complexity, global exports to the U.S. could drop by over 46% by 2027 compared to recent averages. The model predicts that while U.S. imports from countries like China, Canada, and Mexico will decrease sharply, imports from the UK and France may rise, leading to a significant rewiring of international trade relationships.

          <p>Polish and allied NATO aircraft were scrambled as a precautionary measure during a major Russian drone and missile attack on Ukraine. Russia launched over 300 drones and several missiles, with Ukrainian forces intercepting the vast majority. The attack resulted in at least eight injuries in Kyiv after a drone struck a residential building. Ukrainian officials stated the barrage demonstrates Russia's lack of commitment to peace, while also noting that a Russian drone briefly entered the airspace of NATO member Lithuania, testing the alliance's reaction.</p>

          <p>A criminal referral sent to the Department of Justice alleges that Senator Adam Schiff falsified bank and property documents to secure favorable loan terms. The complaint centers on claims that Schiff designated his Maryland home as his primary residence on loan applications while simultaneously claiming his California condo as his primary residence for tax purposes. This opinion article explores the legal complexities, including potential statute of limitations issues and the high bar for proving intentional fraud. The author concludes that while the allegations may appear serious, a criminal prosecution is unlikely for several legal and political reasons.</p>

          <p>Despite forecasting a near tripling of its net profit for the first half of 2025, shares of Chinese jewelry company Laopu Gold have fallen for nine consecutive sessions. The company, known for its modern designs inspired by ancient craftsmanship, attributed its projected revenue and profit growth to successful online and offline expansion. However, analysts suggest the stock's decline is due to profit-taking by investors after a massive surge, along with concerns about rising gold prices and a reset in market expectations. The company's performance contrasts with more sluggish consumer spending in the broader Chinese economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health experts are highlighting that not all children respond to ultra-processed foods in the same way, with some having a naturally stronger "food reward drive." This disposition makes them more motivated to eat, less likely to feel full, and particularly vulnerable to overconsumption of highly engineered foods. Psychologists suggest that for these children, standard advice may not be effective. Instead, they recommend creating a safer home environment by limiting the availability of ultra-processed items and focusing on whole foods, while allowing for occasional treats in social settings.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has announced it will implement a daily 10-hour "tactical pause" in fighting in three populated areas of Gaza to allow for the increased flow of humanitarian aid. This measure is intended to provide secure routes for the United Nations and other agencies to address the severe hunger crisis in the territory. The move comes amid intense global criticism and warnings of famine, with recent images of malnourished children increasing pressure on Israel. While the U.N. welcomed the step, it reiterated that a broader ceasefire is necessary to reach all civilians in need.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Cambridge have discovered a complete 4,000-year-old handprint on an ancient Egyptian "soul house," a clay model of a building found in tombs. The rare find was made while preparing the artifact for an exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum. Curators believe the print was left by the maker who moved the object before the clay had dried and been fired in a kiln. The discovery offers a direct, personal connection to the ancient craftspeople who are often overlooked in history, providing a unique glimpse into their lives and work.</p>

          <p>A new framework trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union is being hailed by the Trump administration as a significant victory, but it also contains consolations for the EU. The agreement sets a 15% tariff on many European goods, which is higher than before but lower than the 30% that was threatened. In return, the EU will reportedly open its markets to American exports and has committed to purchasing billions in U.S. energy and arms. The deal, pushed over the line by President Trump's personal involvement, averts a larger trade conflict but leaves tariffs much higher than their historical levels.</p>

          <p>This article presents a bearish outlook on two major cryptocurrencies, predicting that both XRP and Bitcoin could see their values decline by 50% or more within the next two years. For XRP, the author cites limited real-world adoption on Ripple's network and competition as key weaknesses. For Bitcoin, the argument centers on its failure as a practical daily currency, its false sense of scarcity, and a potential bubble created by companies adding it to their balance sheets. The author suggests these factors make both digital assets vulnerable to a significant correction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a meeting in Scotland with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, President Donald Trump launched into a criticism of wind power. He claimed that wind turbines are "killing" Americans, destroying scenic landscapes, and are an expensive, ineffective form of energy with components made in China. The article notes that many of these claims are inaccurate, pointing out that Germany derives a significant portion of its energy from wind and that turbine lifespans are much longer than he stated. Trump's long-standing opposition to wind power is linked to a proposed wind farm near his Scottish golf resort.</p>

The agreement also creates a tariff disparity on the island of Ireland and has been met with disappointment by German industry groups, who fear the negative effects of the 15% rate on the country's export-driven economy.</p>
