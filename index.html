            <p>A personal trainer from County Durham, Mazyar Azarbonyad, admitted to dangerous driving after fleeing from police, resulting in a pile-up of police cars on the A1 near Newcastle.

            <p>Deborah Sampson, disguised as a man named Robert Shurtlieff, was the first woman to enlist in the US military, serving in the Revolutionary War from 1781 to 1783. She sustained a musket ball wound in the thigh during a skirmish but extracted it herself to maintain her disguise. Her secret was revealed when she fell ill with a fever, but she received an honorable discharge and later became the first woman to receive a military pension with assistance from Paul Revere. Sampson went on to have a family and embarked on a lecture tour about her experiences, and is now recognized as the official heroine of Massachusetts.</p>

            <p>Sen. Chris Van Hollen's trip to El Salvador to advocate for a deportee's return to the US has drawn scrutiny, with critics suggesting it may violate the Logan Act, which prohibits unauthorized diplomacy. The Logan Act was previously invoked during the Michael Flynn probe. The American Accountability Foundation has requested the Senate Ethics Committee investigate Van Hollen's actions, while some commentators argue the Logan Act is outdated and should not be applied. No one has been successfully prosecuted under the Logan Act to date.</p>

            <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked deportations of Venezuelans held in northern Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, following an emergency appeal by the ACLU. The ACLU argued that immigration authorities were attempting to restart removals under the AEA without providing detainees a chance to argue their case in court. The Trump administration invoked the AEA to detain and remove Venezuelan migrants allegedly tied to the Tren de Aragua gang. The ACLU had sued to block deportations, citing concerns about the migrants being sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador.</p>

The analysis used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center to estimate retiree expenses.

            <p>Rivers are getting warmer, negatively impacting fish populations and the economies that depend on them. In New York's Catskill Mountains, the Delaware River's tributary, the Beaver Kill, is experiencing rising water temperatures. Organizations like Friends of the Upper Delaware River are working to restore water flow by removing sediment and clearing old dams. This helps cool the water and create a more hospitable environment for fish and other wildlife, supporting recreational activities and local economies.</p>

            <p>Elliott Management, an activist investor, has taken a stake in Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), citing undervaluation and poor execution. HPE's unique product portfolio, including a high-multiple networking business, sets it apart from peers. Elliott's involvement could drive value creation through improved management and strategic oversight, especially regarding HPE's pending acquisition of Juniper Networks. The firm's history of successful strategic activism in the technology sector suggests potential for significant returns, also likely being better positioned than Dell to face certain geopolitical headwinds.

            <p>An article reflects on the 30th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, drawing parallels between Timothy McVeigh's motivations and current political rhetoric. McVeigh's anti-government sentiments and white supremacist beliefs resonate with elements of Trump's America First ideology and attacks on diversity. The article argues that the far-right movement has moved from the fringes to the center of American politics, with echoes of McVeigh's views found in mainstream discourse. The author also criticizes the government's failure to fully explore the wider conspiracy behind the bombing.</p>

            <p>The White House's proposed cancellation of NASA's Mars sample return program has raised concerns that the US is ceding space leadership to China. China's Tianwen-3 mission aims to deliver Martian material to Earth by 2031, potentially becoming the sole mission in the race. Experts suggest that this move could prompt NASA's international partners to reconsider their cooperation with the US, weakening US leadership in space exploration.

            <p>The rising costs of hobbies, termed "hobby inflation," are making recreational activities increasingly inaccessible to the working and middle classes. This trend affects various pursuits, including shooting, bourbon collecting, fishing, golf, and skiing. The growing exclusivity of leisure has social ramifications, as hobbies create social worlds that foster community and cross-cultural connections. Hobby austerity forces people to make hard social decisions, shrink their circles, and can potentially lead to a lonelier and more intolerant society.</p>
