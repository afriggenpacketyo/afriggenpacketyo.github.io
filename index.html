          <p>Japan is experiencing a surge in Chinese tourists, exceeding pre-pandemic levels from 2019, but with a noticeable shift in travel styles. Instead of large group tours and shopping sprees, Chinese travelers now seek immersive experiences related to Japanese cuisine, culture, and scenery. The Japan National Tourism Organization is adapting its marketing strategies to target this evolving market, particularly families with young children. While concerns about a manga predicting a major disaster in Japan briefly discouraged travel, visitor numbers have rebounded, with the Japan Tourism Agency dismissing any real impact. The article highlights the resilience and adaptability of the Japanese tourism industry in response to changing consumer preferences and external factors.
