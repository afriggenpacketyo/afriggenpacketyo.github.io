          <p>A federal judge has partially blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at overhauling U.S. elections, specifically preventing the implementation of requirements for documentary proof of citizenship on the national voter registration form and citizenship assessments for public assistance recipients. The judge argued that the Constitution grants Congress and states, not the president, the authority to regulate federal elections. While other aspects of the order remain in place pending litigation, this ruling marks a setback for the administration's efforts to tighten election regulations.</p>

          <p>Federal health officials plan to cut funding to the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), effectively ending one of the largest and longest studies of women’s health. The WHI’s findings have significantly influenced medical practice and clinical guidelines, preventing numerous cases of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. The Department of Health and Human Services is terminating contracts for the WHI’s regional centers in September, raising concerns about the future of women's health research.</p>

          <p>Tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated following a deadly militant attack in Kashmir, with Pakistan warning that blocking the flow of crucial rivers would be considered an act of war. Pakistan has announced retaliatory measures, including closing its airspace to Indian carriers and suspending trade. India has also taken punitive actions, including suspending an important water treaty and revoking visas for Pakistanis, exacerbating the crisis between the two nations.</p>

          <h2>EPA to Fire or Reassign Child Health Experts with Diversity Roles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 15:07:05 EDT</div>

          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced that employees who are experts in children's health will be fired or reassigned because their job descriptions include work on environmental justice or diversity, equity, and inclusion. The EPA's regional children's health coordinators work with schools and institutions to address environmental hazard exposures among young people. This decision has been criticized as an attack on children's health protection and expertise.</p>
