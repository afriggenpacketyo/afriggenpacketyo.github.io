        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Romania is holding a presidential runoff election after the previous election in November was annulled by the constitutional court due to irregularities in campaign financing and organization. The annulled election saw far-right, pro-Russian candidate Calin Georgescu surprisingly win the first round, but he was later banned from standing in the rerun. The alleged electoral violations included the use of social media accounts to spread pro-Georgescu messaging as part of a "Russian hybrid attack", which Moscow denies. Public prosecutors opened an investigation into Georgescu in February, preventing his participation in the current election.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing to delay the expansion of Medi-Cal to more undocumented adults and impose a monthly fee on current beneficiaries with ‚Äúunsatisfactory immigration status‚Äù due to budget deficits. The changes aim to address a $12 billion state budget shortfall, partly attributed to President Donald Trump's tariffs and rising healthcare costs. Under the plan, access to comprehensive Medi-Cal services for undocumented adults over 19 would be suspended starting January 1, although limited services like pregnancy and emergency care would remain available. Adults with ‚Äúunsatisfactory‚Äù immigration status would be charged $100 per month starting in 2027.</p>

          <p>Chris Smith, an Illinois man, survived a gunshot to the brain during a first date in 2021, a case covered by "48 Hours". Smith was found with a bullet lodged in his brain and his date, Leslie Reeves, was dead; he was placed in a medically induced coma. Doctors initially gave him a poor prognosis, stating he would likely not walk again, but Smith has made a remarkable recovery through intense physical therapy. Though he has no memory of the shooting, Smith has regained his strength, sings in his rock band, and is engaged to be married, now working as a motivational speaker.</p>

          <p>In 1993, Jeanie Childs was found murdered in her Minneapolis apartment, with bloody, bare footprints providing a crucial clue. Despite collecting DNA and comparing footprints to multiple suspects, including Arthur Gray, the case went cold for years. In 2015, investigators found that blood near Jeanie's in the stairwell matched John Esswein, but his footprints were inconclusive. Investigative genetic genealogy eventually linked Jerry Westrom to the crime scene, leading to his arrest in 2019. Westrom was convicted of first-degree murder in 2022, though the case involved complex forensic evidence and questions about alternate suspects.</p>

          <p>In the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs in Minneapolis, investigators discovered bloody, bare footprints at the crime scene, a rare clue pointing to the killer. The victim was wearing socks, so the footprints belonged to her killer. The footprints were compared to multiple people, including Arthur Gray, who lived with Childs, but his alibi checked out. Years later, DNA testing led to Jerry Westrom, who denied killing Childs, but his DNA was found at the scene. The footprints are being re-examined to determine if they match Westrom, as there was other male DNA found at Childs' apartment that did not belong to him.</p>

This event marked the first dust storm warning for Chicago from the Romeoville Weather Service office, reminiscent of conditions during the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s.

Despite Kershaw's return, the Dodgers lost the game due to inconsistent pitching and an inability to contain the Angels' offense. The Angels' catcher, Logan O'Hoppe, had a career-high five RBIs, while Freddie Freeman had four hits for the Dodgers. This article indicates the return of a great baseball player, but also the struggle to maintain a great team.</p>

          <p>A Mexican Navy sailing ship, the Cuauht√©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in the deaths of two crew members and injuring at least 22 others. The ship, carrying 277 people, lost power before drifting into the bridge. The incident occurred as the ship was departing from Pier 17 in Manhattan and heading toward Iceland. An investigation is underway to determine the cause of the mechanical issues that led to the crash, and the Brooklyn Bridge has been inspected for structural damage.</p>

          <p>Simon Tisdall criticizes the international community's inability to hold despots like Vladimir Putin accountable for their actions, despite the establishment of tribunals and international laws. Putin's evasion of justice is attributed to factors such as the outdated convention of head-of-state immunity and the rejection of international jurisdiction by autocratic allies and powerful states. The author argues that the ineffectiveness of international law enforcement is exacerbated by divisions within the UN Security Council and the self-interest of powerful nations. The piece calls for greater respect for international law and a commitment to holding those responsible for atrocities accountable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Casey Michel argues that while Donald Trump's corruption is unprecedented, it is built on a foundation of previous administrations' failures to address foreign influence in American politics. The Trump family's profiting from the presidency and the acceptance of foreign investments are part of a larger pattern of American politicians being for sale to foreign interests. Michel calls for Congress to pass legislation preventing former politicians from serving as foreign lobbyists and to target the family members of high-ranking officials. He also suggests that future administrations should reinstate counterkleptocracy task forces and prosecute former presidents who have illegally enriched themselves.</p>

          <p>Dan Richards contrasts the resurgence of sleeper trains in Europe with the decline of long-distance public transport in the United States. While Europe is investing in high-speed rail and promoting eco-friendly travel, America is focused on cars, planes, and niche transportation projects. Richards argues that America's car-dependent culture has led to unhappiness and congestion, and that investing in rail networks could offer a more sustainable and community-oriented alternative. The author contrasts Elon Musk's focus on theoretical transportation systems with the successful high-speed railways in China.</p>

          <p>Proposed cuts to Medicaid, as part of President Trump's agenda, are causing concern among low-income and disabled Americans who rely on the program for healthcare coverage. An analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that these cuts could leave millions without health insurance. While Republicans argue that the cuts are aimed at eliminating fraud, waste, and abuse, many Medicaid recipients fear losing access to essential services and having to choose between healthcare and basic necessities. Some also worry that work requirements could jeopardize their ability to receive care, especially for those recovering from substance use disorders.</p>

          <p>Despite surveys indicating that most British people now regret Brexit, Prime Minister Keir Starmer's efforts to improve relations with the European Union face strong opposition from the national news media. The media landscape, dominated by pro-Brexit tabloids, complicates Starmer's efforts to forge closer ties with the EU. This resistance reflects the divisive legacy of Brexit, which has left the country politically fractured and hesitant to embrace closer European integration. Starmer's cautious approach is partly driven by the need to avoid further political turmoil and to counter attacks from right-wing populists.</p>
