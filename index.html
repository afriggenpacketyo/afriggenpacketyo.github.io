          <p>A devastating fire at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River, Massachusetts, has resulted in the deaths of nine residents. Firefighters arrived to find a chaotic scene with heavy flames and people needing rescue from windows. Over 30 people were hospitalized, including one in critical condition, and five firefighters sustained minor injuries. The building was equipped with sprinklers, but the fire still caused extensive damage to one wing and smoke damage throughout. Authorities are investigating the cause of the blaze, which the fire chief described as an "unfathomable tragedy" for the community and the families involved.</p>

          <p>A shooting at the Richmond Road Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky, left two women dead after a suspect fled there. The incident began when the suspect shot and wounded a state trooper during a traffic stop. After carjacking a vehicle, the gunman entered the church and opened fire, killing two women and wounding two other men before being fatally shot by police. The state trooper and the other two wounded individuals are reported to be in stable condition. Authorities have indicated that the shooter may have had a connection to the victims at the church, a small, tight-knit congregation.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical exploration of queerness, tracing its varied acceptance and persecution through different cultures and time periods. It highlights how ancient societies, like those in Greece and Rome, often accepted same-sex relationships, as exemplified by figures like Emperor Hadrian. In contrast, the rise of Christianity led to centuries of stigmatization and severe punishment, using biblical interpretations to condemn non-binary lifestyles. The article also touches upon the more relaxed attitudes in samurai-era Japan and at the Chinese imperial court, and profiles influential LGBTQ+ figures throughout history. It concludes by noting the progress made in modern times while emphasizing the ongoing need to protect these hard-won freedoms.</p>

          <p>The UK government has initiated a public consultation on the future of the state-owned Post Office, suggesting that turning it into a mutual, employee-owned business is a potential path forward. This proposal aims to reform the organization's culture following the major scandal involving the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters due to faulty software. The consultation will also explore the future services the Post Office should offer, particularly in banking, as high street banks close. While acknowledging a mutual model would be complex and costly, the government is seeking a new vision to restore trust and ensure the institution's financial and operational stability.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has announced a hosepipe ban for 1.1 million people in parts of southern England, effective July 22, due to a prolonged period of dry weather and increased demand. The restriction, covering postcodes in areas like Oxfordshire and Berkshire, prohibits using a hosepipe for activities such as watering gardens or washing cars, with potential fines up to £1,000 for violations. The measure follows similar bans by other water companies as the region experiences low rainfall and high water usage during hot weather. Officials state the action is necessary to manage stretched water supplies and do not expect the situation to improve soon.</p>

          <p>A military dog named Sanson is being celebrated as a hero in Colombia for saving the lives of dozens of soldiers and civilians. The canine detected a bomb planted by ELN guerrilla fighters on a community path in the Antioquia region, which detonated and severely injured one of his legs. Despite his injuries, Sanson managed to alert his handler, and his actions prevented a much larger tragedy. The dog underwent surgery, resulting in the amputation of the leg, and will now retire from service. This incident occurred just two days after another bomb, attached to a donkey, killed a soldier in the same area.</p>

          <p>European Union trade ministers are meeting to formulate a strategy after the U.S. announced a surprise plan to impose 30% tariffs on EU and Mexican goods, set to begin August 1. The move has disrupted ongoing trade negotiations, with EU officials expressing a desire to reach a deal while also preparing for potential conflict. In a gesture of goodwill, the EU has delayed its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. However, some member states like Denmark and France are advocating for a firm stance, suggesting the EU must be prepared for all outcomes, including proportionate countermeasures if a negotiated solution cannot be achieved to resolve the trade imbalance.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General has found systemic abuse in the use of restraints within the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).

The report details severe consequences, including one death and another case requiring an amputation. In response, the BOP has agreed with the report's recommendations and committed to revising its policies and practices to ensure the humane treatment of inmates.</p>

The policy is part of a broader family-focused platform that emerged from activism during the COVID-19 pandemic, which exposed the fragility of the childcare system.

Despite the area's known vulnerability to flash floods, Kerr County's plans for a siren system stalled due to political infighting and cost. In contrast, the nearby town of Comfort, which experienced the 1987 tragedy, recently installed its own warning system, which successfully enabled a full evacuation during the latest flood.</p>

          <p>India's consumer price inflation eased to 2.1% in June, marking its eighth consecutive monthly decline and falling to a more than six-year low. The figure was lower than economists' expectations and was driven by a continued drop in food prices, which entered negative territory. This sustained cooling of inflation provides the Reserve Bank of India with more room to continue its monetary easing policy, following a significant rate cut in May. Strong agricultural production and favorable weather are expected to keep food inflation low, which could help boost domestic consumption and support the country's economic growth.

          <p>Bryan Kohberger's recent guilty plea in the murder of four University of Idaho students brings a legal conclusion but leaves the public without a clear motive for the horrific crime. With the trial canceled, many details that might have emerged remain unknown. New documentaries and a book are attempting to fill the void, exploring Kohberger's background, his academic spiral, and an alleged obsession with one of the victims, Maddie Mogen. Evidence suggests Kohberger stalked the victims' residence and had an incriminating internet search history. However, without a confession or trial testimony, the central question of why he committed the murders may never be fully answered.</p>

          <p>A 40-year-old palliative care doctor in Germany is on trial, accused of murdering 15 of his patients with lethal injections between 2021 and 2024. Prosecutors allege the doctor, identified as Johannes M., acted as a "master of life and death," killing 12 women and three men by administering deadly cocktails of sedatives. In some cases, he allegedly set fire to his victims' homes to conceal the crimes. The investigation began after a suspicious co-worker raised an alarm, and prosecutors have described the motive as a "lust for murder." An additional 96 suspicious death cases, including that of the doctor's own mother-in-law, are still under investigation.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, surging past the $120,000 mark, driven by significant inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On a single day last week, these ETFs saw inflows of $1.18 billion, signaling strong institutional buying interest. The rally is also fueled by anticipation of clearer regulatory frameworks in the United States, as Congress begins deliberations on a series of crypto-related bills. Analysts believe that long-term institutional investment and growing policy clarity are key drivers, with some setting year-end price targets for Bitcoin as high as $160,000, despite potential risks from U.S. Federal Reserve policies.

          <p>An economic analysis examines the potential negative consequences of former President Donald Trump's call for the Federal Reserve to lower its benchmark interest rate to 1%. While intended to reduce government borrowing costs, such a drastic cut during a period of low unemployment and stable growth could signal an economic crisis, undermine the Fed's independence, and risk reigniting inflation. Historically, a 1% policy rate has been a response to severe economic distress, such as the periods following the dot-com crash and the 2008 financial crisis, not a tool for managing deficits in a relatively healthy economy.

          <p>An independent investigation into the BBC show "MasterChef" has substantiated 45 allegations of misconduct against presenter Gregg Wallace over a 19-year period. The claims, made by 83 individuals, primarily relate to inappropriate sexual language and humor, as well as culturally insensitive comments and one instance of unwelcome physical contact. The inquiry was launched after a BBC News report revealed claims against Wallace. The report notes that Wallace was diagnosed with autism during the investigation, which may help explain some actions, but he does not wish to hide behind it. The BBC has apologized and has no plans to work with him in the future.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has stated that the fuel control switches in Boeing aircraft are safe, responding to concerns raised by a preliminary report on the fatal Air India crash in June. The report from Indian investigators noted that the fuel switches on the Boeing 787 were moved to the "cut-off" position shortly after takeoff, cutting power to the engines. It also highlighted a 2018 FAA advisory that recommended inspecting the switches' locking feature. The FAA clarified that it does not consider the issue an unsafe condition warranting a mandatory directive, while Air India's CEO cautioned against drawing premature conclusions from the ongoing investigation.</p>

Proponents argue it is a necessary step to address systemic inequities, but opponents believe it is a proxy for race that will face swift legal challenges and be struck down as unconstitutional.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite nearly every U.S. county experiencing flooding in recent decades, only 4% of homeowners have flood insurance, creating a significant protection gap. Standard homeowner policies do not cover flooding, and federal disaster aid is often insufficient for full recovery. This issue is becoming more critical as climate change fuels more intense rainfall. While the government's National Flood Insurance Program is available, rising premiums are making it unaffordable for many, particularly in high-risk areas. Experts say this leads many to "roll the dice," leaving them financially vulnerable when floods inevitably strike, a reality recently faced by communities in Texas, New Mexico, and North Carolina.</p>
