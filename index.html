          <div class="timestamp">2025-04-24 19:21:03 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China, warnings of potential retail shortages are surfacing, with apparel, footwear, toys, and budget home goods expected to be among the first affected categories. The article highlights that tariffs are acting as import bans, preventing companies from shifting sourcing quickly enough and resulting in order cancellations and goods being held in warehouses. Experts suggest that lower-end stores with lean inventories will be hit hardest, and that close monitoring of port container volumes will be crucial in the coming months to assess the health of the supply chain.

          <p>Donald Trump's online store is selling 'Trump 2028' merchandise, including hats and T-shirts, despite the 22nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution prohibiting presidents from serving more than two terms. Trump, who has previously hinted at serving a third term, faces declining approval ratings amid concerns over his handling of economic issues and tariff policies. While amending the Constitution to allow a third term would require a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate and ratification by 38 states, Trump has insisted he is 'not joking' about finding methods to make it happen.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to advance seabed mining in international waters, a move that disregards international norms and treaties ratified by most major coastal nations. The order instructs the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to expedite permits for companies to mine in both international and U.S. territorial waters. This decision positions the U.S. as a leader in seabed mineral exploration, potentially provoking opposition from allies and rivals concerned about the environmental impact and resource management of international waters.</p>

          <p>The climate activist group Just Stop Oil (JSO) is ending its campaign of civil disobedience, citing increasingly strict policing powers that have made it nearly impossible to operate. The group claims to have achieved its goal of influencing government policy on new oil and gas licenses, but acknowledges that new laws targeting disruptive protests have significantly hampered their activities. As JSO disbands, some activists are considering more clandestine and less accountable forms of protest, raising concerns about the future of climate action in the UK and the movement's public image.</p>

          <p>Intel CFO David Zinsner has stated that President Trump's tariffs and retaliatory measures from other countries have increased the likelihood of an economic slowdown and a potential recession. The company's first-quarter results exceeded expectations due to customers stockpiling chips ahead of tariffs, but revenue and profit guidance fell short, causing the stock to decline. Zinsner cited the fluid trade policies and regulatory risks as contributing to uncertainty and potentially shrinking the overall market for Intel's chips. (not investment advice)</p>

The rulings prevent the administration, at least for now, from cutting off billions of dollars that support teachers, counselors, and academic programs in schools serving low-income children. One judge stated that the administration had not provided an adequately detailed definition of 'diversity, equity and inclusion' and that the policy threatened free speech in the classroom.</p>
