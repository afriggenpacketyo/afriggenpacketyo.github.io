          <p>Food banks in Florida are experiencing a significant strain due to recent federal funding cuts, impacting their ability to serve the growing number of families in need. The cuts, amounting to 40% of Feeding South Florida's budget, have led to empty shelves and increased desperation among families who rely on these services for balanced meals. Farmers are also affected, as they lose the financial support to process surplus produce for food banks. The organization is attempting to maintain as much food as possible while they work to figure out how to proceed with their now limited budget.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston has strongly criticized the Trump administration for violating a court order by deporting eight migrants to a third country, believed to be Djibouti, without adequate notice or due process. The judge, Brian E. Murphy, raised the possibility of criminal contempt penalties and demanded a list of everyone involved in the operation. The flight, carrying individuals from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, South Sudan, Burma, and Vietnam with criminal convictions, was intended to deport them to South Sudan, although the administration has not confirmed this. The judge has ordered that the men be given access to lawyers and interviews in which they can inform the government if they have reason to fear being sent to a country like South Sudan.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is preparing to transport Abrams tanks and other military vehicles to Washington, D.C., for a parade celebrating its 250th birthday, coinciding with President Trump's birthday. The event, expected to cost between $25 million and $45 million, has drawn scrutiny due to its resemblance to a grand military parade sought by Trump during his first term. The parade will feature a historical reenactment of the Army's evolution, with soldiers in period costumes, vintage equipment, and flyovers, but the Army will be responsible for any damage to roads and will house troops in unused federal buildings. Significant security measures are being implemented, designating the event as a "national security special event."</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Markey Carney has confirmed that Canada is in discussions with the U.S. about potentially joining its proposed "Golden Dome" missile defense system. These talks occur amid ongoing trade and security negotiations between the two countries, spurred by President Trump's earlier threats of tariffs on Canada. The Golden Dome system aims to counter advanced aerial threats, including hypersonic missiles, using space-based sensors and interceptors. While Trump anticipates Canada contributing its "fair share" to the project, experts are skeptical about the feasibility and cost of building such a comprehensive defense system.</p>

Irsay had battled health issues and addiction in recent years but remained an active figure in the NFL. The Colts' chief operating officer announced that Irsay died peacefully in his sleep.</p>

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials declined to confirm the final destination of the flight, citing operational and safety concerns, but the judge ordered the administration to provide the deportees with "reasonable fear" interviews and maintain custody over them.</p>

          <p>Texas lawmakers have advanced a bill to clarify medical exceptions under the state's restrictive abortion ban, which only allows for an abortion to save the life of the mother. The bill specifies that doctors cannot face criminal charges for performing an abortion in a medical emergency that causes major bodily impairment and defines a "life-threatening" condition as one capable of causing death. While the changes do not expand abortion access or include exceptions for cases of sexual assault or incest, the proposal is seen as a pivot for Texas Republicans and has received mixed reactions from medical providers and abortion-rights advocates.</p>
