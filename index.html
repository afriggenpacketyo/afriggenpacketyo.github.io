          <p>The Conservative party is pushing to amend the Crime and Policing Bill to restrict the recording of non-crime hate incidents (NCHIs) by police forces in England and Wales, arguing that they waste police time. NCHIs are defined as alleged acts perceived to be motivated by hostility or prejudice but do not amount to a criminal offense. Critics, including Policing Minister Diana Johnson, argue this would hinder monitoring of serious incidents like antisemitism. The Conservatives argue the use of NCHIs has spiraled out of control and want to focus police efforts on fighting crime.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has initiated legal action against the Trump administration, alleging attempts to control academic decision-making. The lawsuit challenges the administration's threat to review federal funding following Harvard's refusal to comply with demands to appoint an outside overseer and ensure viewpoint diversity. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, asserts that the government should not dictate what private universities teach or who they admit. Over 100 college presidents have signed a statement denouncing the administration's actions.</p>

          <p>A decrease in air travel to the U.S. due to President Donald Trump's tariffs is impacting Walt Disney's theme park attendance, particularly from international visitors.

However, Disney's cruise business is expected to offset some of the weakness in theme park attendance. Analysts are closely monitoring Disney's upcoming earnings report to assess the impact of these trends on the company's financials. (not investment advice)</p>
