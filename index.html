          <p>Kenyan athletes Sabastian Sawe and Rosemary Wanjiru secured first-place finishes in the men's and women's races, respectively, at the 51st Berlin Marathon. Despite Berlin's reputation as a fast course, the unusually humid and warm conditions resulted in times that were slower than world-record paces. Over 55,000 participants, including celebrities like pop star Harry Styles, ran the course through the German capital, supported by numerous volunteers and spectators. Sawe expressed his satisfaction with his performance despite the challenging weather and hopes to return next year for an even better time.</p>

          <p>The phenomenon of "RushTok" on TikTok has brought the sorority recruitment process at Southern universities, particularly at schools like the University of Alabama, into the national spotlight. This article explores the distinct fashion, social etiquette, and significant financial costs associated with the rush process, where potential new members showcase expensive outfits and adhere to strict conversational rules. The analysis also touches upon the underlying social dynamics, including the reinforcement of traditional Southern values and the persistent lack of racial diversity within these historically white institutions. The piece reflects on how this highly structured social system prepares young women for future roles in both professional and political spheres.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic and is forecast to strengthen into a hurricane. The National Hurricane Center expects the storm to pass east of Bermuda and remain over open waters, posing no direct threat to land. However, swells generated by Gabrielle are predicted to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward into Atlantic Canada. So far, the hurricane season has been quieter than initially predicted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>

          <p>Tong Jilu, the former chief of China Tower, is under investigation for corruption by the Communist Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI). Tong, who was a key figure in China's 5G infrastructure development, has reportedly been out of contact since May. While the CCDI has not provided specific details, reports suggest the investigation may be connected to another probe involving a former chairman at a major Chinese brokerage firm. Tong played a crucial role in establishing China Tower in 2014 and expanding it into a cornerstone of the nation's telecommunications network.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts are advising consumers to carefully assess the value of premium travel rewards credit cards as annual fees for several popular cards, such as the American Express Platinum and Chase Sapphire Reserve, have risen to over $500. The article suggests that these cards are only worthwhile if the user can fully leverage the perks, like airport lounge access and travel credits, to offset the high cost.

          <p>Thousands of protestors gathered in Manila and other cities across the Philippines to demonstrate against widespread corruption involving substandard or non-existent flood control projects. The scandal, which involves billions of dollars, gained national attention after being highlighted by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., leading to public outrage, especially after recent deadly monsoons. Organizers, including politicians and the Catholic Church, emphasized that the protests aim to strengthen democracy rather than destabilize the government. The Department of Finance estimates significant economic losses due to the fraud, as a construction firm has implicated nearly 30 lawmakers and officials in the scheme.</p>

          <p>Humanitarian charities and UK universities are criticizing the British government for its immigration rules that prevent scholarship students from Gaza from bringing their families with them. Recently, 34 Gazan students were evacuated to the UK to begin their studies, but some may be forced to give up their places rather than leave their dependents behind in a conflict zone. Critics, including the Refugee Council and Oxford University, have described the policy as "excessively harsh" and a moral failure, urging the government to reconsider. The rules are part of a broader crackdown on immigration, though exceptions for PhD students and rare cases granted by officials exist.</p>

          <p>This article critiques President Donald Trump's repeated attacks on the Federal Reserve's independence, including his threats to fire its governors and demands for aggressive interest rate cuts. The author argues that such political pressure undermines a crucial norm designed to prevent short-term political goals from causing long-term economic damage, such as high inflation. Historical examples, including actions by Presidents Truman and Nixon and the recent economic turmoil in Turkey, are cited as cautionary tales of what can happen when central bank autonomy is compromised. The piece concludes that Trump's attempts to control the Fed could backfire, leading to higher inflation and interest rates.</p>

          <p>The rapid expansion of co-living developments in New York City neighborhoods like Crown Heights and Bushwick is raising concerns among longtime residents about gentrification and cultural displacement. These dormitory-style complexes, which offer small private rooms with shared amenities, attract young professionals with flexible leases but come at a premium price. Community members argue that these developments cater to a transient population, driving up local rents and eroding the neighborhood's character without contributing to its long-term health. While operators claim to foster community and support local businesses, some tenants acknowledge that the spaces can feel like isolated bubbles within historic communities.</p>

Key indicators to watch will be President Trump's approval rating, economic performance, and voter enthusiasm, which have historically been more determinative than congressional maps alone.

          <p>The suspension of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" has sparked concerns among Hollywood locals and industry officials about the economic and cultural impact on the neighborhood. For over two decades, Kimmel has been a major ambassador for Hollywood Boulevard, drawing tourists and using his platform to support local causes, including homeless youth. Business owners, street performers, and labor unions fear that the show's permanent absence would harm a district still recovering from the pandemic and industry strikes. The suspension followed political pressure related to Kimmel's comments on the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, igniting a broader debate on free speech and its consequences.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom is expected to formally recognize a Palestinian state, a significant diplomatic move that diverges from the position of its close ally, the United States. The decision follows a deadline set by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had conditioned the recognition on Israel agreeing to a ceasefire and other peace-oriented steps in Gaza, which the UK has judged were not met. While largely symbolic, the recognition aims to increase diplomatic pressure to end the conflict and preserve the viability of a two-state solution. This move aligns the UK with other nations like France and Canada, who are also preparing for recognition ahead of the UN General Assembly.</p>

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK's Liberal Democrat party, is urging the communications regulator Ofcom to take action against Elon Musk and his social media platform, X. Davey alleges that "crimes" are being committed on the platform, citing the presence of harmful content and claiming Musk should be held personally accountable under the new Online Safety Act. The call for an investigation comes after Musk criticized the act as a threat to free speech and made controversial remarks at a far-right rally. Davey plans to escalate his criticism, accusing Musk of meddling in British democracy for his own ego and wealth.</p>

          <p>An email from 2011 has resurfaced in which Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, referred to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein as a "supreme friend." The message was reportedly sent just weeks after she had publicly disavowed him, calling her association a "gigantic error of judgment." A spokesperson for the duchess explained that the email was sent to appease Epstein after he threatened to sue her for defamation for linking him to pedophilia in an interview. The spokesperson reiterated that the duchess condemns Epstein's actions and was taken in by his lies, and that her thoughts remain with his victims.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on a perceived rise in hate and a deficit of empathy in both the United States and Britain. The author, an American living in the UK, shares personal experiences of racial bias and aggression, connecting them to broader societal trends of political polarization and violence. Drawing on the teachings of Martin Luther King Jr. and Rabbi Jonathan Sacks, the author argues that empathy is not a weakness but a form of moral courage essential for the health of a democracy. The piece concludes with a call to break the cycle of hate and prioritize grace over grievance for the sake of future generations.</p>

          <p>Voters in Guinea are participating in a referendum on a new constitution that could permit the nation's military leader, General Mamady Doumbouya, to run for president. Doumbouya, who seized power in a 2021 coup, has overseen the drafting of the constitution, which also extends presidential terms and makes it harder for political parties to compete in elections. The vote is expected to pass as the main opposition leaders have called for a boycott amid a government crackdown on dissent. The UN Human Rights Office has raised serious concerns about the inclusiveness and transparency of the process, given recent bans on political parties and media outlets.</p>

Her friends recount the night she disappeared and the subsequent search, expressing their belief that multiple soldiers were involved and covered up the crime.
