          <p>Erik Menendez was denied parole by California officials after a nearly 10-hour hearing, marking decades since his 1989 conviction for the murders of his parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez. The parole panel primarily cited his "behavior in prison," including multiple violations since 2013 such as inappropriate conduct with visitors, drug smuggling, and cell phone usage, as the key reason for their decision. Despite emotional family statements supporting his release and his longstanding claims of self-defense stemming from alleged sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, the panel concluded he continues to pose an unreasonable risk to public safety. He is now required to wait three years before being eligible for his next parole hearing, continuing a high-profile case that has long captivated public attention.</p>

          <p>A Bangkok court on Friday acquitted Thailand's former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, of royal defamation charges, thereby sparing him a potential 15-year prison sentence. This verdict significantly eases a major legal threat to the 76-year-old and his family's influential political movement, which is currently led by his daughter, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra. The decision arrives at a time when opinion polls suggest declining public support for the Shinawatra political faction. The lese majeste law, which criminalizes any criticism of the King and his family, remains a highly sensitive and strictly enforced statute in Thailand, making this acquittal a notable development in the country's complex political landscape.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lauded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) as one of history's greatest companies during a visit to Taiwan, asserting that investing in its stock would be a "very smart" decision. His comments were made amidst discussions about the U.S. administration potentially acquiring stakes in tech firms, particularly those receiving funding under the U.S. CHIPS Act, such as TSMC. Huang emphasized TSMC's crucial role in producing six new products for Nvidia, including next-generation AI chip components, showcasing their deep collaboration. This highlights TSMC's indispensable position in the global semiconductor supply chain and the escalating strategic importance of its relationships with major tech players and governments in the context of geopolitical competition.

The two nations aim to boost India's exports in pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and textiles to mitigate a current trade imbalance, and also plan to send skilled Indian workers to address Russia's labor shortages. This deepening partnership illustrates the intricate geopolitical landscape where historical alliances and economic self-interest continue to shape international trade dynamics, often in direct opposition to Western sanction efforts.

          <p>Nvidia has reportedly instructed some of its component suppliers to halt production of its China-specific H20 general processing units, following a significant crackdown by the Chinese government on purchases due to alleged security concerns. This directive comes weeks after Beijing reportedly told local tech companies to stop buying the chips, fearing potential "backdoors" that could allow remote operation. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang publicly denied these claims, asserting the H20 is not a military product and expressing surprise at the queries. The situation highlights the immense challenges Nvidia faces in navigating escalating U.S.-China tech tensions and rapidly shifting trade policies, which continue to impact its business in the lucrative Chinese market and previously led to a $4.5 billion inventory writedown.</p>

          <p>An international team of scientists has made a significant discovery, revealing that corn plants communicate with their neighbors by emitting linalool, a specific gas that prompts nearby plants to alter their soil composition. Published in the peer-reviewed journal Science, this groundbreaking research provides crucial insights into how planting density directly influences plant growth and defense mechanisms. Field surveys conducted in Hainan, China, demonstrated that maize plants in the inner rows of densely planted fields experienced less herbivore damage compared to those at the edges, though they also exhibited reduced growth. Understanding and optimizing the release of this natural gas could lead to innovative and environmentally friendly strategies for combating agricultural pests and substantially increasing crop yields.</p>

Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI, was reportedly angered by the company's transition into a for-profit entity, a move he saw as a betrayal of its original non-profit mission and a direct contrast to his own AI venture, xAI. OpenAI's counterclaims accuse Musk of launching a "sham bid" that harmed its business and engaging in "harassment."

          <h2>California Governor Newsom Accuses Trump of Election Rigging Amidst Redistricting Campaign</h2>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom accused President Trump of attempting to "rig the election" and undermine American democracy, defending California's proposed partisan redistricting plan as a necessary counterweight. Newsom cited Trump's actions, including deploying federal immigration agents and activating the National Guard, as evidence of authoritarian policies. Proposition 50, a ballot measure, seeks to replace the state's independent commission's congressional maps with partisan districts that could unseat several Republican representatives. This move is presented as a response to similar efforts in Texas, intensifying the national political battle over electoral boundaries and future congressional control.</p>

          <p>A massive illegal marijuana farm, spanning 13 acres, was busted in Sequoia National Park, uncovering extensive environmental degradation. Park rangers successfully removed nearly 2,400 marijuana plants and 2,000 pounds of trash from the site, which was found heavily contaminated with methamidophos, a banned and highly toxic insecticide. The illicit operation diverted natural creek water, cleared significant amounts of natural vegetation, and established illegal trails and campsites, posing severe threats to endangered species and the delicate ecosystem. This bust underscores the ongoing, two-decade struggle against well-organized drug-trafficking organizations that exploit national parks for large-scale marijuana production, creating significant hazards to biodiversity and vital water sources within these protected wilderness areas.</p>

Mike, who drove aid trucks, secretly recorded videos with gunfire and described the desperation of crowds, witnessing shootings daily. He also reported being tasked with cleaning up human and animal remains near a site. GHF has vehemently denied these allegations, stating their contractors do not fire on civilians. The IDF also denies deliberately firing at civilians but is investigating reports of harm, highlighting the dire humanitarian situation and conflicting accounts in Gaza.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has disqualified Alina Habba, President Trump's appointee as acting U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, from participating in ongoing criminal cases, ruling that her appointment was not legally valid. Judge Matthew Brann stated that Habba, who previously served as a personal lawyer for Trump, had exercised the functions and duties of the office without lawful authority since July 1, 2025. The Trump administration, through Attorney General Pam Bondi, immediately vowed to appeal the decision, criticizing it as an "activist judicial attack" and defending Habba's work. This ruling challenges the administration's "novel series of legal and personnel moves" designed to bypass a previous judicial rejection, raising significant questions about the legitimacy of her past actions and the process of federal appointments.</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department announced it will immediately halt issuing worker visas for commercial truck drivers, citing safety concerns and the protection of American truckers' livelihoods. This decision was notably influenced by a widely publicized fatal crash in Florida involving an undocumented foreign truck driver. Concurrently, the U.S. will implement continuous vetting for over 55 million existing visa holders, including tourists and students, scrutinizing for violations such as overstays, criminal activity, or "anti-American activity," with potential consequences including visa revocation and deportation. This policy marks a significant expansion of the Trump administration's broader immigration crackdown, raising concerns about its scope and potential impact on international visitors and workers in the United States.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court issued a complex 5-4 ruling concerning the Trump administration's cancellation of numerous National Institutes of Health (NIH) public health grants, which Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson critically described as "Calvinball jurisprudence." The decision lifted a lower court's order blocking $783 million in cuts related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), gender identity, and COVID-19 research. The court's fractured opinion created a jurisdictional mess, potentially forcing plaintiffs to litigate parts of their case in different courts, a process that could take years. Critics warn this will effectively halt vital research, leading to "incalculable losses in public health and human life."</p>

The families, campaigning for 18 months for an inquiry led by Donna Ockenden, reported that Amos was poorly briefed and lacked the authority to appoint Ockenden. Concerns were further heightened by the appointment of Kathryn Whitehill, a former regulator, as an investigator, which families argue compromises the review's independence.
