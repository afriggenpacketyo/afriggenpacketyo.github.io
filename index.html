          <p>Former 'Baywatch' and 'Melrose Place' star David Charvet has found new fulfillment after leaving Hollywood nearly two decades ago to pursue a career in construction. He co-founded Jones Builders Group in 2008, a company specializing in luxury homes, a move he says allowed him to be a more present father to his two children. While he misses the camaraderie of film sets, the 53-year-old expresses no regrets about his decision, stating that his new life has made him a better and more humble person. He emphasizes that his priority shifted to his family, and his construction career provided a creative outlet while ensuring he was home every night.</p>

          <p>More than 20 individuals were arrested in London during a demonstration in support of Palestine Action, a group that was officially proscribed as a terrorist organization on the same day. The Metropolitan Police stated the arrests were made on suspicion of offenses under the Terrorism Act, as expressing support for the group is now a criminal offense. Protesters had gathered in Parliament Square with placards reading "I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action." The ban follows a series of direct-action protests by the group, which the government claims have caused millions in damages, particularly targeting arms companies involved with Israel.</p>

          <p>Catastrophic flash floods in the Texas Hill Country have resulted in at least 27 deaths, including nine children, with dozens of people still missing. The Guadalupe River rose an unprecedented 26 feet in just 45 minutes, overwhelming communities and a summer camp, from which about 23 girls remain unaccounted for. Emergency crews are conducting extensive search and rescue operations, having already evacuated over 850 people, while officials warn that the danger persists with more rain forecasted. President Trump has acknowledged the tragedy, stating his administration is coordinating with state officials to provide federal aid and support for the affected families.</p>

          <p>As rescue efforts transition to a grim recovery phase in Texas, the disaster has sparked debate over the role of climate change and the adequacy of weather forecasting. With at least 27 confirmed dead, officials defended their response, stating the intensity of the rainfall, which caused the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet in 45 minutes, was not predicted. Critics, however, point to the climate crisis making such downpours more common and question if recent budget cuts at the National Weather Service under the Trump administration compromised forecasting abilities. The tragedy highlights the vulnerability of communities in 'flash flood alley' and the challenges of preparing for extreme weather events.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is facing severe criticism for distributing an email that former officials have labeled as 'blatant misinformation' and a 'lie.' The email praised a new spending bill signed by President Trump, claiming it eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most recipients. However, critics point out the legislation only provides a temporary tax deduction, not a full elimination of taxes, and that the communication sounds more like partisan messaging than official government information. The move has been called unconscionable by former agency officials for politicizing a previously apolitical institution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after Labour's 2024 election victory, a focus group of their voters in Kent reveals a prevailing sense of disappointment with the government's performance. Many participants felt that the party has not delivered on its promises, particularly concerning immigration and general progress, with some feeling 'lied to.' While some voters were forgiving, attributing the slow start to the need to 'steady the ship,' others were critical of repeated U-turns on policy, which they felt showed a lack of clear direction. The discussion also highlighted the growing appeal of Reform UK, with some former Labour voters considering supporting Nigel Farage's party in a future election.</p>

McMurdock has denied any wrongdoing, stating his business dealings were compliant, but requested the suspension as a 'precautionary measure' while Reform UK conducts an internal investigation.

Critics argue that even if the threats are not acted upon, they create a chilling effect designed to intimidate and silence dissent.

          <p>The rise of digital payment systems has led to 'tipflation,' where customers are prompted to tip more frequently and in more situations, from fast-food counters to self-service kiosks. Marketing professors note that while tip requests have exploded, the motivations for tipping—rewarding good service, social obligation, or helping low-wage workers—remain complex. The design of payment interfaces, often with pre-calculated high percentages, pressures consumers into tipping more, even if it creates irritation. Experts suggest that to navigate this new culture, consumers should understand local wage norms and, if necessary, revert to using cash to maintain control over gratuities.</p>

This development could push North Korea to further invest in a mobile, dispersed, and resilient nuclear arsenal with a robust second-strike capability.

The beverage typically combines coconut water, orange juice, lemon, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical professionals are skeptical, stating there is no scientific evidence that this combination of ingredients can meaningfully impact cortisol levels. While the drink is likely harmless for most and can aid hydration, doctors note that managing stress is more complex.

The machine is historically significant as it solved the monumental challenge of typing with a character-based language, a key step toward modern Chinese computing. Instead of phonetics, Lin's design broke down characters by their shapes, a foundational concept that underlies how Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are typed today. The discovery has excited scholars, as the typewriter represents a pivotal moment in preserving East Asian languages in the digital age and reflects a globalist vision of inter-language communication.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's highest-ranking military commander, Oleksandr Syrskyi, has warned that Russia may be preparing a new offensive in the Kharkiv region of northeastern Ukraine. After visiting troops in the area, Syrskyi stated that Russian forces appear to be gathering in numbers to press their advantage. This warning comes as Moscow's forces have been making slow but steady gains along the front lines throughout the summer, recently establishing a small foothold in the neighboring Sumy region. Syrskyi emphasized the need for Ukraine to be ready with appropriate tactical and technological solutions to prevent any Russian advance.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, Parisians are legally swimming in the Seine River after a $1.5 billion cleanup project made it possible. The swimming ban, in place since 1923 due to pollution, was officially lifted, with designated and lifeguarded swimming areas opened to the public near the Eiffel Tower. Mayor Anne Hidalgo celebrated the milestone, calling it a 'childhood dream' and a moment of 'pride' for France. Eager swimmers took to the water, expressing their delight at being able to cool off in the iconic waterway, a welcome relief amid high summer temperatures.</p>

          <p>At Oregon State University, marine scientists at the Chapple Big Fish Lab are working to change the public's negative perception of sharks while gathering vital data about ocean health. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team studies hundreds of sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay. A key research method involves temporarily capturing sharks to examine their stomach contents, which provides insights into the animal's diet and the overall health of the bay's ecosystem. Researchers emphasize that a healthy shark population indicates a healthy ocean, but note that securing funding for this crucial research remains challenging due to the fish's fearsome reputation.</p>

          <p>Following a public feud with President Trump over a new spending bill, Elon Musk is exploring the creation of a new political party, tentatively called the 'America Party.' Musk suggested a strategy of focusing resources on a small number of key congressional races, such as two or three Senate seats and eight to ten House districts. He argues that given the narrow legislative margins in Congress, this approach could give the new party enough influence to be the deciding vote on contentious issues. The idea emerged after Musk, who had previously supported Trump, vehemently opposed a budget bill that he claims will dangerously increase the national debt.</p>

          <p>North Korea has opened the Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Area, a large-scale luxury beach resort, nearly a decade after construction began. The sprawling complex features high-rise hotels, villas, and numerous amenities, reflecting Kim Jong Un's ambition to boost the nation's sanctions-hit economy through tourism. However, with the country's borders still largely closed, the resort is not open to most foreigners. The first international visitors are expected to be from Russia, a country with which Pyongyang has recently strengthened ties, though it remains unclear if this limited tourism will provide the desired economic stimulus for the isolated nation.</p>

          <p>An Arizona renter was fined $4,000 by his property management company for posting negative online reviews about his rental experience, which included issues like black mold. The fine was based on a 'non-disparagement' clause in his lease, which penalizes tenants for reviews rated three stars or less. However, such clauses are illegal under the federal Consumer Review Fairness Act of 2016, which protects a consumer's right to share honest feedback. The case highlights a broader issue of businesses attempting to silence criticism through unenforceable contract terms, and experts advise consumers to know their rights and report such violations to the FTC.</p>

          <p>The death toll from a residential building collapse in southern Pakistan has climbed to at least 16, with rescue operations continuing for a second day. The multistory building collapsed on Friday, and emergency crews have been working with heavy machinery to search for survivors believed to be trapped in the rubble. Officials report that at least eight more people may still be missing. Such incidents are unfortunately common in Pakistan, where poor construction standards, substandard materials, and a frequent disregard for safety regulations often lead to structural failures and tragic loss of life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A physician working in a public hospital argues that new Medicaid work requirements will severely harm the most vulnerable patients. The doctor illustrates how bureaucratic hurdles, such as needing a fixed address, phone, or internet access, will cause many eligible individuals to lose their coverage despite qualifying for exemptions due to disability or other circumstances. The piece contends that these requirements function as a 'time tax' designed to disenfranchise people and cut costs by denying care, rather than addressing fraud. The changes are projected to strip insurance from millions and could lead to the financial collapse of safety-net hospitals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The mixed verdict in Sean 'Diddy' Combs' federal sex-trafficking trial is being analyzed as another example of the legal system's failure to adequately address intimate partner violence. While Combs was found guilty on lesser charges, he was acquitted of the most serious counts, including racketeering and sex-trafficking. This article argues that the reliance on trafficking charges demonstrates that existing domestic violence and coercive control statutes are often ill-equipped to handle the complexities of abuse, especially when perpetrated by wealthy and powerful individuals. The outcome suggests that without better legal frameworks, achieving justice for survivors of such abuse remains a significant challenge.</p>
