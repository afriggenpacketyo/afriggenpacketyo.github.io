          <p>Hundreds, including prominent political figures like former President Joe Biden, gathered for the funeral of Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark. They were tragically killed in their home earlier this month, allegedly by a man who also attacked another political family. Speakers at the service, including Governor Tim Walz, remembered the couple for their dedicated public service, kindness, and commitment to improving the lives of Minnesotans.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump played a round of golf with Republican Senators Eric Schmitt, Lindsey Graham, and Rand Paul. The outing occurred as Senate Republicans aimed to pass a significant tax package, referred to as the "Big, Beautiful Bill," before a self-imposed July 4 deadline. The White House endorsed the bill, emphasizing its potential to provide economic certainty for businesses navigating the effects of recent tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also met with senators to advocate for the bill's passage, suggesting it could accelerate economic growth in the year's third quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman was likely bitten by a juvenile shark while swimming in waist-deep water at Jones Beach, Long Island. She sustained minor, non-life-threatening lacerations to her leg and foot and was treated at the scene. Although the woman did not see the creature, experts analyzed the bite marks and believe a juvenile sand tiger shark was the most probable cause. Following the incident, swimming was temporarily suspended, but patrols by drones and lifeguards will continue through the summer to ensure swimmer safety. Shark attacks on humans remain a rare occurrence globally.</p>

          <p>In a detailed interview, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi confirmed that recent military strikes caused "very serious" damage to Iran's nuclear facilities. He emphasized, however, that Iran retains the knowledge and industrial capacity to rebuild, making a diplomatic solution essential for long-term stability. Grossi expressed concern over the unknown location of some of Iran's highly enriched uranium and stressed the urgent need for IAEA inspectors to regain access to verify the country's nuclear activities.

A concerned driver had called in the sighting along the remote stretch of road connecting the Central Coast and the San Joaquin Valley. However, upon investigation, the responding officer discovered the animal was not a tiger cub but a deceased hawk. The California Department of Transportation was notified to remove the bird. The incident serves as a reminder that owning exotic animals like tigers is illegal in California without special permits.</p>

Separately, Russia's Defence Ministry claimed it had seized a village farther southwest, continuing its slow but destructive advance through eastern Ukraine.

          <p>One week after the U.S. attack on Iranian nuclear sites, an analysis shows contrasting descriptions of the damage from the White House and intelligence agencies. While President Trump and the Defense Secretary claimed Iran's program was "obliterated," initial Defense Intelligence Agency assessments suggested a more modest setback of only a few months. Throughout the week, officials appeared to scale back the stated goals, shifting focus from total destruction to achieving a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Questions also remain about whether Iran successfully moved some of its enriched uranium before the strikes, a possibility the President has refuted.</p>

          <p>Concerns over press freedom are growing in Kenya following a harsh crackdown on nationwide anti-government protests that left 19 dead and hundreds injured. The government's communications authority issued an order, later revoked by judges, to ban live media coverage of the demonstrations, citing incitement to violence. Journalists on the ground reported being targeted by security forces, who allegedly used live ammunition against protesters. This response has intensified tensions between the government and the youth-led protest movement, which is fueled by economic dissatisfaction and a lack of opportunities under President William Ruto's administration.</p>

          <p>In a farewell speech at the Social Democratic Party congress, former German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reflected on his time in government and delivered a stark warning about Russian President Vladimir Putin. Scholz stated that Putin intends to hold onto his conquests in Ukraine and potentially expand them, emphasizing that changing borders by force must not be tolerated. He defended his government's response to this turning point in European history, including strengthening the German military and enhancing cooperation within NATO. Scholz also called for greater contributions from high earners to finance the country's increased defense needs.</p>

          <p>Republican leaders are seizing on the New York City mayoral primary victory of Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old Democratic socialist, to frame the national Democratic party as radical and out of touch. At the Faith and Freedom Coalition summit, prominent Republicans, including former President Trump, labeled Mamdani a "communist" and used his win as a new line of attack. While some progressive Democrats have embraced Mamdani, moderate party members have been more critical. In response to the attacks, which have included Islamophobic rhetoric, several Democratic lawmakers have defended Mamdani and condemned the divisive language.</p>

City officials, however, defended the wedding, calling it the kind of "high-quality tourism" Venice needs. Despite the protests, disruption to the city appeared minimal, and Bezos made a donation of around three million euros to local conservation groups.</p>

Klopp warned that the intense schedule could lead to an increase in unprecedented injuries, ultimately devaluing the sport.
