          <p>Honda Motor reported a 76% plunge in operating profit for the fourth quarter, missing earnings estimates due to the anticipated impact of U.S. tariffs. While motorcycle sales saw record highs, automobile sales declined, particularly in China and Southeast Asia. The company is bracing for significant impacts from global tariff policies, leading to downgraded financial projections for the upcoming fiscal year. Honda is planning to produce its next-generation Civic hybrid in the U.S. to mitigate potential tariff effects, as trade tensions with the U.S. continue to escalate.</p>

Supporters argue it is a progressive move to alleviate suffering, while opponents raise concerns about safeguarding vulnerable individuals.

          <p>This week's inflation report is expected to provide an initial assessment of the impact of President Donald Trump's tariff policies on pricing in the United States. While economists initially feared a surge in inflation due to the tariffs, early data suggests a slight cooldown in price increases. However, analysts anticipate a potential resurgence of inflation as retailers restock inventory with goods imported after the tariffs took effect. Trump has since rolled back some levies, including those on China, which may mitigate the overall impact on inflation.</p>

Depardieu denied the charges, but the court found him guilty, also ordering him to be put on a list of sex offenders.

          <p>Financial technology firms, which benefited from higher interest rates in recent years, now face a key test as rates decline, raising doubts about the sustainability of their net interest income. Fintechs like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo saw profits increase due to higher rates, but must now diversify their revenue streams to reduce reliance on interest income. Some fintechs are offering services like crypto and share trading, while others are focusing on subscription models and fee-based income to weather changes in the economy.</p>

          <p>The UK jobs market is showing signs of continued weakening, with the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5% and the number of workers on payrolls falling. Job vacancies have also declined, and wage growth has slowed, although pay is still rising faster than inflation. Analysts suggest that recent increases in employer National Insurance contributions and the National Living Wage may be contributing to the softening labor market. The Bank of England is expected to remain cautious about future interest rate cuts due to sticky wage growth.</p>
