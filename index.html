          <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed a $20 billion defamation lawsuit against Dow Jones & Company, the publisher of the Wall Street Journal, and its parent company, News Corporation. The suit claims a report about a "bawdy" birthday letter allegedly signed by Trump for Jeffrey Epstein was false and defamatory. The Wall Street Journal reported the letter, from the early 2000s, was part of a collection for Epstein's 50th birthday and included a drawing of a nude woman. A spokesperson for Dow Jones expressed full confidence in their reporting and stated they will vigorously defend against the lawsuit.</p>

In response, she has launched a campaign to raise awareness about the issue, noting that not everyone has the thick skin she has developed. Reese explained that the experience initially made her withdrawn but she is now opening up more, emphasizing the importance of community and giving back by turning a negative situation into a positive one.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The use of nicotine pouches, also known as "white snus," is rapidly increasing among young people in the UK, with some products containing extremely high levels of nicotine. Unlike cigarettes or vapes, there is currently no age restriction on their sale, leading to concerns about children as young as 11 purchasing them. Health professionals and users report severe side effects, including addiction and significant gum damage, with dentists seeing lesions so deep they expose the tooth's root. The government is being urged to pass the Tobacco and Vapes Bill to regulate sales to minors.</p>

          <p>An initiative by the UK government to install "Great British Energy solar panels" in schools has sourced its initial products from Chinese manufacturers, Aiko and Longi. The revelation has drawn criticism from some Members of Parliament, who raise concerns about supporting Chinese supply chains potentially linked to forced labor allegations in the Xinjiang region. While the government and the companies involved state they comply with modern slavery rules, the situation highlights the global dominance of Chinese manufacturing in the solar industry and the ethical complexities of green energy procurement.</p>

          <p>A growing number of drivers at Edinburgh Airport are avoiding the official drop-off zone to evade fees that have risen to £6 for a ten-minute stay. Instead, they wait in nearby lay-bys and unofficial spots, coordinating with arriving passengers by phone to arrange a quick pick-up on roads with parking restrictions. This behavior highlights public frustration with what many perceive as "extortionate" charges at UK airports, which have seen fees increase at over half of the country's busiest hubs in the last year. The airport maintains that a free drop-off area is available further from the terminal.</p>

          <p>In Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine, a systematic campaign is underway to erase Ukrainian national identity and instill pro-Russian ideology in children from a young age. This involves forcing them to participate in patriotic parades, sing the Russian anthem, and learn from a revised curriculum that justifies the invasion. Organizations like the defense ministry-affiliated "Youth Army" provide military-style training, while thousands of children have been taken on tours of Russia or forcibly deported, which is a violation of international law. The efforts represent a broad strategy of cultural and demographic reshaping in the occupied regions.</p>

          <p>A debate is underway in the United Kingdom over proposals to shorten the traditional six-week school summer holiday, potentially redistributing the time off throughout the year. Proponents argue it could help prevent learning loss, alleviate childcare pressures for working parents, and address "holiday hunger" for children who rely on free school meals. However, opponents, including many teachers, believe the long break is essential for rest and preparation, and there are concerns that a shorter summer could concentrate holiday demand, potentially driving up travel prices even further.</p>

          <p>On the 15th anniversary of his death, the sister of Aamir Siddiqi has made a public appeal to the man suspected of ordering his murder, urging him to surrender. Aamir, a 17-year-old student, was stabbed to death in his Cardiff home in a case of mistaken identity by two contract killers who were targeting a businessman on a neighboring street. While the two hitmen are serving life sentences, the suspected mastermind, Mohammed Ali Ege, escaped from custody in India in 2017 and remains one of Europe's most wanted fugitives. Aamir's sister described the ongoing pain of her family.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy delivered a thrilling third-round performance at The Open, keeping his title hopes alive with a score of 66 that left him tied for fourth place. The crowd at Portrush erupted when he sank a remarkable 56-foot eagle putt on the 12th hole, a moment he later described as one of the coolest of his career. His round was also marked by a bizarre incident on the 11th hole where his swing unearthed a buried golf ball from the rough, leading to a bogey. Despite the rollercoaster day, McIlroy remains in contention, six shots behind the leader heading into the final round.</p>

The violence, which has reportedly killed over 900 people, prompted military intervention from both the Syrian government and Israel, the latter in support of the Druze. A US-brokered deal was intended to halt the fighting and Israeli strikes, but gunfire and looting were reported in Suweida city after the announcement. The ongoing conflict highlights the deep-seated tensions and the fragility of peace efforts in the region.</p>

          <p>Germany, France, and the UK are strengthening their security and defense cooperation, forming a trilateral group known as the "E3" in a significant pivot in European foreign policy. This alliance, solidified by a new German-UK treaty and joint diplomatic efforts, is driven by the threat from Russia and uncertainty over future U.S. commitments to NATO. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has signaled that Europe must become more independent in its defense, suggesting the nuclear capabilities of France and the UK could supplement U.S. protection. This strategic realignment aims to bolster European security in an increasingly unstable global environment.</p>

          <p>Concerns are rising in Ukraine over the drafting of individuals with documented mental health conditions, who are subsequently being found fit for military service. Families and human rights advocates report cases where men with incurable personality disorders and other psychological issues are being sent for training, potentially posing a danger to themselves and their units. While military medical examinations are supposed to screen out unfit individuals, lawyers suggest that gaps in medical databases and cursory exams allow these cases to slip through. The situation highlights the immense pressures of mobilization and raises questions about military recruitment practices.</p>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly close to a move to FC Barcelona after a deal in principle was reached between the clubs. The transfer, expected to be an initial loan with an option to buy, comes after Rashford fell out of favor at Old Trafford and was told to train separately. For Barcelona, the move addresses their need to strengthen their attack after failing to sign other targets. While Rashford's form has been inconsistent, the Spanish champions are reportedly willing to take a calculated risk on the 27-year-old England international, seeing his potential as a major asset.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions began their tour of Australia with a 27-19 victory in the first Test match in Brisbane, though the performance was a tale of two halves. The Lions dominated the first 50 minutes, building a commanding 24-5 lead with tries from Sione Tuipulotu, Tom Curry, and Dan Sheehan, looking sharp and cohesive. However, as replacements were introduced, their momentum faded, allowing an undercooked Australian side to score two late tries and make the final scoreline more respectable. While a win, the flat finish left a sense that the Lions have more gears to find in the series.</p>

          <p>A report from Bank of America analysts posits that quantum computing could represent the most significant technological revolution for humanity since the discovery of fire. The technology, which uses subatomic particles for processing, has the theoretical potential to perform incredibly complex calculations almost instantly, which could "warp-speed" human development. Potential applications include creating new drugs and materials, enhancing AI, and revolutionizing logistics. While major milestones have been achieved, analysts note the technology has yet to solve a practical real-world problem faster than a classical computer due to instability issues.

          <p>The 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, known as "Operation Valkyrie," is being commemorated. Led by officer Claus von Stauffenberg, the attempt involved planting a bomb in Hitler's military headquarters, but the dictator survived with only minor injuries, leading to the plot's failure. In the aftermath, Stauffenberg and around 200 co-conspirators were executed. While the plotters were initially viewed as traitors, they are now honored as heroes in modern Germany, though historians debate their democratic ideals and motivations, noting the attempt came late in the war.</p>
