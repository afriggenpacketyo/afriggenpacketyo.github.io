          <p>A memorial service for conservative activist Charlie Kirk, who was murdered last week, is being held at State Farm Stadium in Arizona, drawing tens of thousands of attendees. President Donald Trump and other high-ranking administration officials are scheduled to speak, honoring the 31-year-old founder of Turning Point USA. Kirk was a highly influential figure in conservative politics, particularly among young voters, though his commentary often sparked controversy. The event, which began with Christian music, has been described as upbeat, with attendees calling for dialogue over violence.</p>

          <p>University of Texas quarterback Arch Manning demonstrated a significant return to form during a 55-0 victory against Sam Houston State. Manning threw for 309 yards and three touchdowns, and also scored two rushing touchdowns, showing a level of "swagger" his teammates and coaches noted was missing in previous weeks. After one touchdown run, he engaged in a brief verbal exchange with a defender, a move he later admitted his mother was "pretty mad about" but attributed to built-up frustration. The performance marks a positive turn for the highly-touted quarterback and the Longhorns team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has officially approved a £2.2 billion project to build a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport, a move the government claims will foster economic growth. The plan involves converting the airport's existing northern runway for regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 by the late 2030s. Proponents cite job creation and economic benefits, but the decision faces strong opposition from environmental campaigners and local groups concerned about increased noise, traffic, and climate impact. The airport has agreed to stricter noise controls to address some of these concerns.</p>

          <p>Demonstrations have erupted in all 26 states of Brazil against legislative proposals that could grant a pardon to former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies. The protests follow a lower house vote to fast-track a bill offering amnesty for those convicted in the January 2023 uprising, including Bolsonaro himself, who was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for attempting a coup. Prominent artists and cultural figures, including music legends Caetano Veloso and Chico Buarque, have joined the protests, mobilizing crowds to oppose what they see as an attempt to shield politicians from accountability.</p>

          <p>Iranian labor and women's rights activist Sharifeh Mohammadi is facing execution after her death sentence for "armed rebellion against the state" was upheld for a third time. Mohammadi, an engineer and mother, was arrested in December 2023 for her union activities, which the government deems an "opposition group." Human rights organizations have condemned the proceedings, citing serious procedural flaws and politically motivated charges, as there is no evidence linking her to armed actions.

          <p>The mother of a freed British-Israeli hostage has strongly criticized the UK government's decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state, calling it a reward for Hamas. Mandy Damari, whose daughter Emily was held captive for 15 months, argued the timing is inappropriate while hostages remain in Gaza and Hamas retains power. Prime Minister Keir Starmer defended the move as a way to reignite hope for a two-state solution and insisted it was not a reward for the terrorist group, which he said can have no future role in governance. The decision has been welcomed by the Palestinian Authority but condemned by Israel's government.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that media executives Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are likely to be involved in the investment group aiming to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. In a recent interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as other key figures in the deal, describing them as "American patriots." The potential sale of the popular social media app from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, follows a congressional mandate over national security concerns. The White House is reportedly finalizing a deal where a U.S.-majority board would control the company and its algorithm.</p>

The coordinated announcement is intended to build momentum for a two-state solution and revive hopes for peace in the Middle East, according to the leaders of the three nations. The move, which aligns them with over 140 other countries, drew immediate condemnation from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a "huge reward to terror" and vowed a Palestinian state would not be established.

          <p>The Department of Justice reportedly shut down a public corruption investigation into Tom Homan, President Trump's "border czar," after he allegedly accepted $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents.

The new rules, issued by the recently rebranded Department of War, require journalists to pledge not to gather any information not officially authorized for release.

          <p>Police in Northern Ireland have issued a fresh appeal for information regarding the disappearance of two boys, 11-year-old David Leckey and 14-year-old Jonathan Aven, who went missing from their homes in east Belfast 56 years ago in September 1969. The case, which remains an open missing persons investigation, is being reviewed by the Police Service of Northern Ireland's legacy branch. Authorities are urging anyone who may have encountered the boys at the time, possibly on a train to Bangor, or has any information whatsoever to come forward. The families have endured decades of uncertainty about what happened to their children.</p>

          <p>The Big Cat Project has shared remarkable footage showing the intense and ferocious behavior of two Amur tigers as they were released back into the wild in Russia. The video shows the massive sibling tigers, the largest of the tiger subspecies, snarling and aggressively swatting at their cage doors just before being freed. The animals had been rehabilitated by the Amur Tiger Center. Conservation groups used the release to highlight the precarious situation of the species, with only 500 to 600 estimated to remain in the wild due to poaching and habitat loss.</p>

The victory provided a sense of vindication for Hocker, who was controversially disqualified from the 1500m semifinals earlier in the competition for "jostling."

This advanced manufacturing approach aims to eliminate errors like missing bolts or tools left inside aircraft, which typically rely on manual checks.

          <p>An analysis in The Atlantic suggests President Trump's increasing pressure on the Attorney General to prosecute his rivals is a sign of his weakening political position. The article argues that with declining public approval, stalled job growth, and rising grocery prices, Trump feels a sense of urgency to consolidate power before potential electoral losses in 2026. This creates a difficult calculation for officials like AG Pam Bondi, who must weigh the benefits of pleasing the president against the future risks of engaging in potentially illegal actions. The piece frames Trump's actions as part of a high-stakes gamble to secure his power and impunity.</p>

          <p>According to well-being and aging expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the aging process at a cellular level by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on chromosomes. While telomeres naturally shrink with age, prolonged stress speeds up this degradation. However, Epel emphasizes that this damage can be mitigated through daily practices aimed at restoring cellular health. She recommends simple lifestyle adjustments such as eating more fruits and vegetables, incorporating short meditative breaks, increasing Omega-3 intake, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga or breathwork to combat the effects of stress.</p>

The reconsideration comes as Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour government is reportedly preparing to introduce a digital ID scheme.
