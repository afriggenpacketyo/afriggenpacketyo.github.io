          <p>Jacksonville Jaguars kicker Cam Little successfully kicked a 70-yard field goal during a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers. While the incredible feat will not count as an official NFL record because it occurred in the preseason, it highlighted his exceptional leg strength. The current NFL record is a 66-yard field goal set by Justin Tucker in 2021. Teammates and Little himself acknowledged the kick as a significant display of his capabilities, suggesting he could be a major asset in long-distance situations during the regular season.</p>

The majority of arrests were for displaying placards supporting the banned organization, marking the largest number of arrests on a single day in the last decade. The government defended the ban based on security advice, while human rights groups like Amnesty International criticized the use of broad terrorism laws, arguing it threatens freedom of expression. The police counter-terrorism command is now processing the cases for potential charges.</p>

Police have arrested a 30-year-old man on suspicion of murder in connection with the incident. Authorities suspect the death may be linked to a separate, brutal assault on a priest that occurred earlier the same day at St Patrick's Church. The priest sustained a serious head injury in the attack and remains in the hospital in a serious condition, adding a layer of gravity to the ongoing investigation.</p>

He also condemned Kennedy's response to a recent shooting at the CDC, suggesting that inflammatory rhetoric has contributed to a climate of fear and violence against public health workers.</p>

The plan, which has drawn widespread international condemnation, involves demilitarizing the enclave and establishing a non-Israeli civilian administration while maintaining Israeli security control. The announcement preceded an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to discuss the controversial move.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are experiencing a surge in influence, transitioning from a niche interest to a significant factor in Washington politics and Wall Street finance. The Trump administration has shown strong support, with the president signing the Genius Act to allow major corporations to issue digital currencies and considering regulations favorable to the industry. Proponents, like conference organizer David Bailey, see it as a mainstream asset, while critics, such as former SEC official Amanda Fischer, warn of high volatility, rampant scams, and risks to consumers.

          <p>An excerpt from Mark K. Updegrove's book, "Incomparable Grace: JFK in the Presidency," provides a detailed account of President Kennedy's final weeks in November 1963. At the time, Kennedy was optimistic about his 1964 reelection prospects, with a strong economy and high approval ratings, despite challenges with his civil rights and tax cut bills in Congress. The narrative describes the political motivations behind his fateful trip to Texas, which was primarily a fundraising effort to unite a fractured state party. It culminates in a poignant, moment-by-moment retelling of the assassination in Dallas on November 22, 1963.</p>

          <p>In a humorous essay, author David Sedaris reflects on the complexities and anxieties of modern tipping practices, particularly the ubiquitous payment screens that prompt for tips in situations with minimal service. He recounts an experience at an airport breakfast spot where he ordered and paid via a screen, questioning the justification for a 22% tip when his only human interaction was someone delivering the plate. Sedaris humorously explores the internal conflict between feeling like a "cheapskate" and the logic of the transaction, ultimately tying it to broader reflections on work, immigration, and personal guilt in a comically relatable manner.</p>

          <p>Decades after President John F. Kennedy's assassination, the release of new government documents continues to fuel speculation, with a recent congressional hearing examining the CIA's potential foreknowledge of Lee Harvey Oswald. Journalist Jefferson Morley, who has pursued the files for 30 years, argues the documents show the CIA was monitoring Oswald extensively before the assassination and has since obstructed the truth. While the files have not produced a "smoking gun" to overturn the Warren Commission's findings, they reveal a pattern of secrecy. Former CIA Director Leon Panetta acknowledges the agency's concern with protecting assets but doesn't rule out other motives.</p>

          <p>This literary analysis argues that novelist Muriel Spark, often celebrated for her comic wit, should be understood as one of modern Britain's most significant religious writers. A Roman Catholic convert, Spark's work was deeply influenced by the Bible, particularly the Book of Job, and she used narrative structure to explore themes of divine will, judgment, and the conflict between God's omniscience and human shortsightedness. The article reviews a new biography, "Electric Spark" by Frances Wilson, which explores how Spark's life experiences—from working in wartime psyops to a nervous breakdown—shaped her unique theological and literary vision, where she often played the role of a capricious, all-knowing God.</p>

          <p>As generative AI provides attackers with sophisticated new tools, companies are fighting back by integrating autonomous AI agents into their cybersecurity defense forces. These "agentic teammates" are designed to automate routine and time-consuming tasks like analyzing alerts and investigating potential threats, freeing up human analysts to focus on more critical work. Cybersecurity leaders state this is a necessary evolution to counter AI-powered attacks and address the industry's talent shortage and burnout issues. While still in early stages, the adoption of AI agents for tasks like quarantining suspicious emails and restricting compromised accounts is seen as a crucial defensive strategy.</p>

          <p>London police are preparing for another day of demonstrations related to the Israel-Gaza conflict, including a march demanding the immediate release of all hostages held by Hamas. This follows a day of mass arrests where nearly 500 people were detained for supporting Palestine Action, a recently banned pro-Palestinian group. The planned hostage-release rally, organized by a coalition of groups, emphasizes the human-rights aspect of their demand, separate from political views. The ongoing protests highlight the deep divisions and high tensions within the UK over the conflict and Israel's plan to occupy Gaza City.</p>

          <p>A coalition of key European nations, including the UK, France, and Germany, has issued a joint statement emphasizing that a lasting peace cannot be decided without Ukraine's involvement. The statement came in response to President Trump's planned one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which currently excludes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. While welcoming Trump's efforts to end the war, the leaders reiterated their commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and that current borders must not be changed by force. Sources indicate the White House is open to including Zelenskyy, but the meeting remains bilateral at Putin's request.</p>

          <p>An expert who helps Americans move abroad identifies Albania as a top overlooked destination in Europe, citing its surprising affordability, natural beauty, and welcoming visa policies. Americans can stay in Albania for up to a year without a visa, making it an ideal location to "test drive" expatriate life. The cost of living is a fraction of that in the U.S. and Western Europe, with comfortable apartments available for under $500 a month. The country also boasts a stunning coastline, rugged mountains, and a growing, friendly expat community, offering a high quality of life that is increasingly out of reach elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Companies involved in immigration enforcement, including tech firm Palantir and private prison operators Geo Group and CoreCivic, have reported better-than-expected financial results, attributing their success to the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration. Palantir saw a 53% growth in US government revenue, while prison companies noted their detention facilities are fuller than ever, with executives flagging opportunities for "unprecedented growth." This financial boom comes as Congress provides a massive funding increase to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to expand its detention network, a move critics call funding cruelty at the expense of human lives.

          <p>A schoolboy jogging on a beach on Sanday, one of Scotland's Orkney Islands, discovered the wreckage of a 275-year-old ship following a storm. Community members and researchers worked together to recover and identify the vessel's hull. Historical research revealed the ship to be the Earl of Chatham, a former Royal Navy ship named HMS Hind that was built in 1749. The vessel served during the American Revolution before being sold and repurposed as a whaling ship, ultimately sinking in the North Sea in 1788. Remarkably, all 56 crew members survived the shipwreck.</p>
