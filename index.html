          <p>John Woeltz, a crypto investor, was arrested in New York City for allegedly kidnapping and torturing an Italian tourist who was lured to Woeltz's home with the promise of retrieving Bitcoin. The victim was reportedly tied up and tortured for several weeks, enduring electric shocks, a leg cut with a saw, and forced crack cocaine use. Evidence recovered included t-shirts with a crack cocaine pipe and photos of a firearm pointed at the victim's head. The victim escaped and alerted authorities after agreeing to give up his Bitcoin password out of fear for his life, leading to Woeltz's arrest and being deemed a flight risk.</p>

          <p>A new study in Scientific Reports indicates that dog owners who frequently ruminate about work stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety on to their dogs. The research found a correlation between owners with high job stress and dogs exhibiting more stress-related behaviors such as whining, pacing, and restlessness. This "crossover" of stress is attributed to emotional contagion, where dogs pick up on human feelings through subtle cues like tone of voice and body language. The article suggests that employed dog owners could benefit from avoiding work-related ruminations at home to protect their pet's well-being.</p>

A 41-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and remains in custody, while another woman in her 70s and a teenage girl, both from the same family, were hospitalized. Neighbors reported hearing smashing and screaming before discovering the fire, describing the family as "really good people."</p>

          <p>Chinese military scientists have revealed a technological breakthrough behind what they claim is the world's fastest coilgun, capable of firing 3,000 rounds per minute. This rate significantly surpasses traditional firearms and existing commercial models. The key innovation, detailed in China’s Journal of Gun Launch & Control, involves eliminating capacitors, the traditional Achilles' heel of electromagnetic weapons, and powering the coilgun directly with lithium batteries. Recent footage demonstrates the coilgun's ability to shatter car windows and demolish door panels rapidly.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto's crucial two-run double in the fourth inning propelled the New York Mets to a 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Dodgers' overworked pitching staff faced further strain after a 13-inning game the previous night, forcing manager Dave Roberts to rely heavily on starter Tony Gonsolin. Gonsolin struggled with command in the fourth, issuing consecutive walks to load the bases before Soto's decisive hit. Mets starter David Peterson delivered a strong performance, pitching 7 ⅔ innings and securing seven strikeouts.</p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly's racist tweet, calling for hotels housing asylum seekers to be set on fire, resulted in a 31-month jail sentence for inciting racial hatred, sparking a debate over free speech. While some view the sentence as tyrannical and label Connolly a political prisoner, others argue it's a necessary consequence for inciting violence. The Free Speech Union funded Connolly's appeal, arguing the sentence was disproportionate, but the Court of Appeal upheld the original ruling. Connolly's case has ignited concerns about increasing police scrutiny of online activity and the limits of free speech.</p>

Annual salaries will rise to over 6 million yen ($41,000), and chefs can opt for government-covered rented accommodation. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasizes the chefs' significant role in hosting foreign dignitaries and promoting Japanese food. The improvements aim to attract and retain skilled chefs, with about a dozen of Japan's 230 missions currently having vacancies.</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges have become a significant problem at the World Exposition in Osaka, causing discomfort to visitors and raising concerns about potential health issues. The small flies are prevalent on walls and pillars of the Grand Ring, forcing people to avoid swallowing them. While the midges don't bite, dead ones can cause allergic reactions if inhaled. The expo organizer is spraying insecticide, treating areas with growth inhibitors, and installing insect repellent lights to combat the issue.</p>

          <p>Kim Jong Un expressed fury after North Korea's newest warship sustained severe damage during a recent launch ceremony, calling it a "criminal act" that shamed the nation. A malfunction in the launch mechanism caused the destroyer's stern to slide prematurely into the water, crushing parts of the hull. Kim has ordered those responsible to be punished and the ship to be restored by late June, though analysts doubt this timeline. Satellite imagery shows the vessel lying on its side, with the stern in the water and the bow still on land.</p>

The city is offering incentives like higher wages and signing bonuses to attract lifeguards and has improved lifeguard stations. Some beachgoers expressed relief at seeing lifeguards on duty, while others said they have grown accustomed to being more cautious due to the shortage.</p>

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author of "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault," which reframed sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion, has died at 90. Her book, published in 1975, became a cornerstone of the feminist movement, influencing legal reforms and societal attitudes towards sexual assault. Brownmiller's work challenged myths surrounding sexual assault and sparked debate, particularly her assertion that all men keep all women in a state of fear. Despite facing criticism, her book remains a landmark contribution to feminist thought and legal reform.</p>

The former Arsenal player was arrested in Scotland for orchestrating the attempted importation of cannabis with a street value of £600,000. He duped two women into smuggling the drugs from Thailand, promising them cash and an all-expenses-paid trip. The conviction marks a dramatic fall from grace for Emmanuel-Thomas, who was once hailed as a footballer with elite potential by Arsene Wenger.</p>

The King's visit underscores Canada's separation from the US and reinforces its parliamentary system modeled after Britain's Westminster system.
