          <p>Eleven adult men escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in New Orleans on Friday, prompting a full-scale search operation involving local, state, and federal law enforcement. One inmate, Kendall Myles, was quickly apprehended in the French Quarter, but ten others, including Gary Price, who was charged with attempted first-degree murder, remain at large. Authorities believe the inmates likely had assistance and have changed their clothes, urging the public to remain alert but avoid panic, as victims of the inmates' crimes have been moved to safety. The sheriff has vowed a full investigation into the escape and accountability for anyone who aided the inmates.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation after posting an image on Instagram that some interpreted as a call for violence against President Trump. The image, showing seashells arranged to form the numbers "86 47," was seen by administration officials as a reference to removing the 47th president, leading to an outcry and investigation by Homeland Security and the Secret Service. Comey later deleted the image, claiming he didn't realize the numbers' association with violence and opposes violence of any kind. The incident has reignited the long-standing feud between Comey and Trump, who has accused Comey of calling for his assassination.</p>

          <p>Home electricity bills in the U.S. are expected to rise to an average of $784 this summer, marking a 12-year high and a more than 6% increase from last year, according to an analysis by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). This spike is attributed to rising electricity costs outpacing inflation, combined with projected high temperatures that will drive up cooling demands. The article highlights the disproportionate impact on low-income families, who spend a larger share of their income on energy, and warns of potential health risks if households forgo air conditioning due to financial constraints. The article suggests modernizing homes for energy efficiency as a potential solution.</p>

The report highlights the absence of limits for rice itself, despite its widespread consumption by infants and toddlers. The organization also found that white rice grown in California, jasmine rice from Thailand, and basmati rice from India had lower levels of heavy metals than brown rice and white rice grown in the Southeast U.S.</p>

          <p>A new analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model indicates that many Americans earning less than $51,000 a year could see their after-tax income decrease as a result of the Republican tax plan beginning in 2026. The plan's spending cuts, particularly to programs like Medicaid and food stamps, could disproportionately affect lower-income individuals, offsetting any potential gains from tax cuts. In contrast, the top 0.1 percent of earners could gain significantly, benefiting from tax cuts for the wealthy and favorable changes for businesses. The article mentions that the Republican tax package is facing opposition from conservative Republicans who are demanding additional spending cuts.</p>
