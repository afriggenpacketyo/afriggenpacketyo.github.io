          <p>After a 16-year hiatus marked by a public feud, Britpop band Oasis reunited for the first show of their new tour in Cardiff, Wales. Brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher performed a two-hour set of their 1990s hits to an ecstatic crowd of over 60,000. While maintaining some distance on stage, the performance was powerful and well-received, featuring classics like "Wonderwall" and "Champagne Supernova." The tour has generated immense fan excitement and significant controversy over ticket pricing practices.</p>

This marks the first time a foreign leader has received the award, symbolizing the deep historical ties between the two countries, which date back to the 19th-century arrival of indentured Indian laborers. The visit focused on strengthening strategic partnerships and boosting investment in sectors like energy and health.

          <p>Devastating flash floods in the Texas Hill Country have led to a "mass casualty event," with at least 24 confirmed fatalities and dozens of people, including children from a summer camp, still missing. The Guadalupe River rose approximately 26 feet in just 45 minutes after a rain event far exceeded forecasts, catching communities by surprise. Governor Greg Abbott has signed a disaster declaration, and extensive search and rescue operations involving helicopters and hundreds of personnel are underway. Officials are urging the public to avoid the area as the situation remains critical.</p>

          <p>During a renewed attack on renewable energy, former President Donald Trump falsely claimed he had never seen a wind farm in China, suggesting the country does not use wind turbines. The statement was immediately fact-checked on social media, as China is the world's leading producer of wind energy, with more than triple the capacity of the United States. This occurred as his new legislative bill is set to eliminate tax credits for wind and solar power. Critics, including trade unions and columnists, have condemned the move as strategically self-harming for American energy and jobs.</p>

          <p>Despite initial fears of a season-ending injury, Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy was diagnosed with a bone bruise in his knee and is expected to miss about six weeks. The positive prognosis means he should return with more than a month remaining before the playoffs. As a result, the team's general manager, Brandon Gomes, has indicated that their trade deadline plans will not be significantly altered. The Dodgers intend to rely on internal options to cover the position while awaiting Muncy's recovery later in the season.</p>

          <p>A controversial Connecticut law is drawing criticism for allowing towing companies to sell towed vehicles just 15 days after seizing them, a practice described as predatory by opponents. Residents in working-class neighborhoods report being targeted by operators who tow cars for minor infractions like expired registrations. One couple lost their car because they couldn't afford the fees in time, and their apartment complex was allegedly targeted over 1,000 times in two years. The owner of one such towing company defended his actions, stating he is simply enforcing the rules of private properties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to some claims, the recently passed "big, beautiful bill" does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. Instead, the legislation introduces a new, temporary "bonus" tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older who fall below certain income thresholds. Policy experts note this is different from repealing the tax on benefits and that the deduction applies to all of a senior's income, not just Social Security. While offering some relief, critics argue the change primarily benefits higher-income seniors and could increase financial pressure on the Social Security trust fund. (not investment advice)</p>

These creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the ocean's surface in Antarctica, grow fat, and then sink hundreds of meters into the deep ocean to hibernate. This process effectively locks away vast amounts of carbon, equivalent to the annual emissions of about 55 million cars, preventing it from re-entering the atmosphere. This "seasonal vertical migration pump" is a far more significant climate-regulating mechanism than previously understood, underscoring the importance of these overlooked organisms.</p>

The top 1% of households in states with no personal income tax, such as Wyoming, South Dakota, and Texas, are projected to see the largest average tax cuts, exceeding $100,000 annually. In contrast, the wealthiest residents in high-tax states like California and New Jersey will see smaller benefits due to the bill's cap on state and local tax deductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recently signed legislative package will bring sweeping changes to personal finances by making the 2017 tax cuts permanent and adding new provisions. The bill increases the standard deduction, child tax credit, and the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap, while also creating temporary deductions for seniors, tip income, and car loan interest. Conversely, it enacts deep spending cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP, ends clean energy tax credits, and overhauls federal student loan programs. The changes are expected to benefit higher earners while potentially harming low-income households. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Bishara Bahbah, a Palestinian-American economics professor from Arizona, has become a key, unofficial backchannel in negotiations for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release. After being contacted by Hamas in April due to his connections with the Trump administration, Dr. Bahbah has been working from Qatar to relay messages between Hamas officials and the White House. This unusual diplomatic channel is credited with helping to build trust and facilitate the release of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander in May. Dr. Bahbah, who has no formal diplomatic experience, continues his unpaid efforts to help end the conflict.</p>

          <p>A same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are successfully raising a chick at the Chester Zoo in the UK. Zoo experts entrusted the pair with one of two eggs laid by another couple to improve the survival chances for both chicks. This marks a "bumper year" for the vulnerable species at the zoo, with a total of 10 new chicks born. Same-sex penguin parenting, while not common, has been observed in other zoos, with both parents sharing incubation and feeding duties for their young.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally delivered what it termed a "positive response" to the latest US-backed proposal for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal. However, a senior Palestinian official clarified that while Hamas accepts the general framework, it has requested several key amendments. These include a guaranteed end to hostilities and a complete Israeli troop withdrawal to pre-offensive positions. The US and Israel have been reluctant to accept such demands in the past. The plan is believed to involve a phased release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and an immediate increase in humanitarian aid.</p>

The protest comes after weeks of heightened tensions in the region due to aggressive enforcement actions by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

While the eight-time champions secured the win, the performance was marred by the first-half injury of captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the pitch in tears with a suspected knee injury. Gwinn, who has a history of serious ACL injuries, will undergo an MRI to determine the extent of the damage, casting a shadow over the team's tournament prospects.

The order states the increased revenue will fund infrastructure improvements and aims to improve affordability for U.S. residents, who may also receive preferential treatment in park lotteries or permit systems. The same order also revokes a 2017 memorandum that promoted diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts in the management and storytelling within the national park system, reversing policies from the previous two administrations.</p>

This incident underscores the ongoing tensions and strategic competition between the two nations, demonstrating how India can act as a check on Chinese influence within these multilateral forums.</p>
