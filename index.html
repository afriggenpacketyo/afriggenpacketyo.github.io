          <p>Actor Jeremy Allen White is set to star as Bruce Springsteen in the upcoming film "Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere," which focuses on the creation of the 1982 album "Nebraska." In an interview, White discussed the challenges of embodying the iconic musician, particularly during a period of significant mental health struggles for Springsteen. The actor, known for his role in "The Bear," shared his own experiences with mental health and how they helped him connect with the role, emphasizing his focus on capturing the artist's emotional depth rather than attempting a perfect imitation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A pivotal and controversial call during the Auburn vs. Georgia college football game sparked significant debate on social media and among officials. Auburn quarterback Jackson Arnold appeared to cross the goal line for a touchdown, but officials ruled it a fumble before the score, a turnover that prevented Auburn from taking a 16-0 lead. The call shifted the game's momentum, allowing Georgia to score 20 unanswered points and secure a 20-10 victory. Auburn's coach Hugh Freeze expressed frustration with the ruling after the game, which dropped his team's record to 3-3.</p>

          <p>Human rights advocates and lawyers are expressing concern over the increased presence of U.S. Border Patrol agents in major American cities, far from the country's physical borders. The agents, operating under a statute that allows warrantless searches within 100 miles of any international boundary, have been involved in aggressive enforcement actions in cities like Chicago and Los Angeles. Critics argue that these agents are not trained for urban community policing and that their tactics, which include raids and indiscriminate stops, may violate constitutional rights and bring a combative culture into civil immigration enforcement.</p>

          <p>A recent study has highlighted the growing issue of "workslop," AI-generated content that appears complete but lacks substantive value, which is reportedly harming productivity. While artificial intelligence tools are often blamed, this article argues that the responsibility lies with employers who fail to properly implement the technology. The author contends that without adequate training, clear policies, and specific plans for using AI, businesses are setting their employees and the technology up for failure. True productivity gains require investment in the people using the tools, not just the software itself.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Director Kathryn Bigelow's latest thriller, "A House of Dynamite," portrays the harrowing 19 minutes the U.S. government would have to respond to an incoming nuclear missile. The film, praised for its authenticity, utilized military consultants like retired Lt. Gen. Dan Karbler to realistically depict the high-stakes decision-making process. The narrative highlights the immense pressure placed on a single individual, the president, and reveals that real-world presidents rarely participate in such drills. The filmmakers hope to remind audiences that the nuclear threat remains a contemporary and urgent issue.</p>

          <p>Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina has announced that an attempted coup is underway, as youth-led protests against his government gain support from factions of the military. The elite CAPSAT army unit, which previously helped Rajoelina take power, has joined the demonstrators and called on other soldiers to disobey orders. The protests, initially sparked by utility shortages, have grown into a widespread movement demanding the president's resignation amid a severe cost-of-living crisis.

However, the defense successfully argued that Kevin, who was intoxicated, accidentally fell and struck his head on the banister post, with their expert testifying that a single impact could cause such extensive internal injuries.

          <p>A parenting expert outlines seven common habits that can lead to mentally weak children, based on a study of over 200 parent-child relationships. These include rescuing kids from every struggle, modeling perfection instead of accountability, and silencing their big emotions. The author advises parents to instead allow children to face age-appropriate challenges, apologize for their own mistakes, and validate feelings to build emotional resilience. Fostering autonomy through small choices and teaching the value of rest are also highlighted as crucial for developing mentally strong individuals who can regulate emotions and rebound from setbacks.</p>

          <p>Estonia has closed a road used by its citizens that briefly passes through a section of Russian territory known as the "Saatse Boot" after an unusually large group of Russian soldiers was observed there. Estonia's Police and Border Guard Board stated the closure was a safety measure to prevent potential incidents. While Russian border patrols are common, their presence directly on the road was considered unusual. An Estonian minister confirmed the soldiers have since left, but the road will remain closed until at least Tuesday as a precaution amid heightened regional tensions.</p>

          <p>The mayor of Shanghai, Gong Zheng, has announced that the city will remove all limits on foreign investment in its manufacturing facilities. This move is part of a broader effort to open up the Chinese market, which has already seen deepened reforms granting full access to overseas companies in sectors like electric vehicles, biotechnology, and telecommunications. The mayor emphasized that openness is Shanghai's greatest advantage and assured that foreign-funded manufacturers will be treated equally in government procurement processes. The policy aims to encourage foreign participation in building both upstream and downstream supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses the conflict of loving the Harry Potter series while disagreeing with author J.K. Rowling's views on transgender issues. The author argues that it is possible to separate the art from the artist, noting that the books' core message of rejecting supremacy and discrimination is valuable, despite their flaws and the author's personal stances. Instead of simply "offsetting" purchases with donations, the columnist suggests engaging with the material critically and in community, using the problematic elements as a catalyst for discussion and real-world action. This approach allows fans to reclaim the positive aspects of the story while actively grappling with its complexities.</p>

          <p>Scotland's First Minister, John Swinney, has stated that if his Scottish National Party (SNP) wins a majority in the next Holyrood election, it should trigger a new independence referendum, citing the precedent set in 2011. After the SNP's majority win that year, the UK government agreed to a referendum in 2014. Swinney's strategy, backed at the party's conference, frames the next election as a de-facto poll on independence. However, the UK Labour government has reiterated its opposition to another referendum, setting the stage for a potential constitutional clash if the SNP achieves its electoral goal.</p>

          <p>El Salvador's authoritarian president, Nayib Bukele, has called on the Trump administration to follow his lead by impeaching "corrupt judges," a sentiment that has found support among prominent MAGA figures. This comes amid what experts describe as unprecedented threats against the U.S. judiciary, with a significant increase in threats against federal judges since Trump returned to office. Critics view this rhetoric as part of a broader authoritarian strategy to undermine judicial independence, similar to tactics used in countries like Hungary and El Salvador, by intimidating judges and delegitimizing the legal system as a co-equal branch of government.</p>

          <p>Blaise Ingoglia, Florida's Chief Financial Officer and a Ron DeSantis appointee, is leading an initiative to audit Democratic-run cities and counties for what he terms "excessively wasteful" spending. The move is viewed by critics as a politically motivated attack, with targeted officials like those in Broward County pushing back, claiming Ingoglia's calculations are based on inaccurate data and ignore unfunded state mandates. The initiative has also drawn criticism for its methods after armed investigators were sent to the home of a military veteran who sent Ingoglia a non-threatening postcard, raising concerns about intimidation and misuse of state resources.</p>

          <p>Steven Gerrard has turned down the opportunity to return as manager of the Scottish club Rangers, citing that the timing is not right and reportedly having concerns about working under a sporting director. This is the second time Gerrard has rejected the club's advances, leaving the board in a difficult position after he was considered their top choice to succeed the previous manager. The decision has thrown the club's leadership plans into disarray, forcing them to consider other candidates for the high-pressure role. Gerrard previously managed Rangers to a league title in 2021 before leaving for Aston Villa.</p>
