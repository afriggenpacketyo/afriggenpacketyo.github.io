          <p>OpenAI has publicly refuted Robinhood's new offering of tokenized shares of the AI company, which were made available to users in Europe. In a clear statement, OpenAI warned that these tokens do not represent actual equity in the company, that it was not involved in the initiative, and that any transfer of its equity requires approval, which was not granted. The public disagreement highlights the growing friction between crypto platforms and the private companies they seek to represent. (not investment advice)</p>
