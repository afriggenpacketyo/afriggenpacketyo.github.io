          <p>The third Test match between England and India is finely poised after three days of play at Lord's. England managed to bowl India out for 387, leveling the first-innings scores, thanks to a late surge where they took the final four wickets for only 11 runs. Key performances included a century from India's KL Rahul and crucial wickets from England's Chris Woakes, while tensions flared between the teams in the final moments of the day. With the series level, the match's outcome remains uncertain as England prepares for their second innings on a slow, challenging pitch.</p>

          <p>Following the historic all-female boxing card at Madison Square Garden, promoter Jake Paul engaged in a tense exchange with a reporter during the post-fight press conference. The reporter questioned the presence of ring girls and the "sexualization of women," prompting Paul to tell him to stop talking and make a dismissive reference to Vice President Kamala Harris. The exchange occurred after the main event where Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano by majority decision, retaining her undisputed super lightweight titles. This bout was the third in their trilogy, capping a night that set a world record for the most titles contested on a single card.</p>

          <p>An alleged leader of Italy's 'ndrangheta mafia, identified as Giuseppe Palermo, has been arrested in Bogota, Colombia. The capture was the result of a coordinated operation involving Colombian, Italian, and British authorities, along with Europol. Palermo, who was wanted under an Interpol red notice, is accused of managing extensive cocaine shipments and trafficking routes from Latin America to Europe. His arrest highlights the global reach of the powerful 'ndrangheta organization, which is a major importer of cocaine into Europe, amid rising illegal cocaine production in the region.</p>

          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek secured her first Wimbledon championship with a decisive 6-0, 6-0 victory over American Amanda Anisimova in a match lasting just 57 minutes. The 24-year-old displayed composure and experience, capitalizing on her opponent's nervousness, which resulted in numerous errors. This victory marks Swiatek's sixth Grand Slam title and makes her the youngest woman since Serena Williams to win majors on all three surfaces: clay, hard court, and grass. The result was the first "double bagel" in a Wimbledon women's final since 1911, showcasing Swiatek's mastery on her previously weakest surface.</p>

          <p>Police have arrested 55 people at protests in London and Cardiff held in opposition to the UK government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action as a terrorist organization. Most arrests were on suspicion of supporting a banned group, following the government's recent classification which makes membership or support a criminal offense. The proscription of Palestine Action, a group known for direct action against arms companies, was prompted by an incident where activists painted military aircraft. Critics, including the group's legal team, have argued that the ban is an "authoritarian abuse" of power and are challenging the decision.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's third heatwave of the year reached its peak, with temperatures hitting 33C in Ross on Wye, while Scotland and Northern Ireland recorded their own respective highs for the year.

The conditions have also disrupted travel, with heat damage affecting a railway line, and caused the cancellation of some sporting events.

          <p>Two fathers have initiated legal action against the UK government, seeking a judicial review of its guidance on smartphone use in schools. Representing a group named Generation Alpha CIC, they argue that the current policy, which allows headteachers discretion, is unlawful and fails to protect children from harms like cyberbullying and exposure to explicit content. The campaigners advocate for a complete ban on smartphones in schools, suggesting simple "brick phones" for necessary communication instead. The Department for Education maintains that schools already possess the authority to ban phones and that the Online Safety Act provides additional protections.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced plans to impose a 30% tariff on all goods imported from Mexico and the European Union, scheduled to take effect on August 1. In letters posted to his Truth Social account, the president cited Mexico's insufficient efforts to curb drug trafficking and a non-reciprocal trade relationship with the EU as justifications. The move represents a significant escalation in trade policy, potentially disrupting global trade rules and supply chains. The European Commission president stated the EU would take necessary steps to safeguard its interests, while Mexico's government called the proposed tariffs an "unfair deal."</p>

          <p>A preliminary investigation into the fatal Air India Flight 171 crash has uncovered a critical and mysterious event from the cockpit voice recorder. Seconds after takeoff, both of the Boeing 787's fuel-control switches were moved to the "cut-off" position, starving the engines of fuel. The recording captures one pilot asking the other why he initiated the cut-off, with the other denying he did so, deepening the mystery of who acted and why. This finding has become the central focus for investigators, who are trying to determine if the action was intentional, a result of confusion, or a potential mechanical malfunction.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian drug lord known as "Fito," has consented to be extradited to the United States to face drug and weapons trafficking charges. Macias, leader of the "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June after a dramatic prison escape last year that triggered a nationwide wave of violence. During a virtual court hearing, he agreed to the extradition, a process that now requires final approval from Ecuador's president. This would mark the first extradition from Ecuador since a recent referendum approved the measure as part of the government's war against powerful criminal gangs.</p>

          <p>Attorney General Pam Bondi has reportedly fired at least 20 prosecutors and support staff who were involved in former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into President Trump. According to sources, the firings targeted individuals identified by a Justice Department "weaponization working group" and have caused a chill among the department's career employees. This move follows earlier ousters of most senior prosecutors connected to the probes. The firings are part of a series of dramatic changes and purges within the federal government under the current administration, raising concerns about the politicization of the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>A CNBC analysis has identified the 10 U.S. state economies most prepared to handle a potential recession, with Florida ranking first for the third consecutive year. The study evaluated states on factors like GDP growth, job creation, fiscal health, and exposure to trade wars and federal budget cuts. Following Florida, the top states include Texas, North Carolina, Delaware, and New York, each demonstrating a strong economic foundation. The report highlights how states with diverse economies, solid finances, and less dependence on international trade or federal spending are better positioned to navigate economic uncertainty.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to rising tariff costs and trade uncertainty, companies are increasingly using U.S. Customs-sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses. These designated areas allow businesses to import materials and components duty-free, with taxes only being applied once the finished products enter U.S. commerce. This strategy, which dates back to the Great Depression, helps companies preserve cash flow and, in some cases, re-export goods without incurring any U.S. duties. However, a recent executive order by President Trump has eliminated the "inverted tariff" benefit, increasing costs for some manufacturers who rely on these zones. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investigation has found that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) repeatedly approved appeals to remove buildings at Camp Mystic from its 100-year flood map in the years before the deadly Texas flood. This reclassification loosened safety regulations and insurance requirements for the girls' summer camp, which is located in a high-risk area known as "flash flood alley." The July 4th flood, which killed at least 27 campers and counselors, was more severe than a 100-year event. However, experts question why a camp responsible for children was granted exemptions from basic flood regulations, allowing it to expand in a known danger zone.</p>

          <p>Military experts suggest Russia's recent escalation of drone and missile attacks across Ukraine is part of a multi-pronged strategy to break the country's defenses. The campaign aims to destroy Ukraine's military-industrial complex, exhaust its air defense systems, and demoralize the civilian population to pressure the government. Analysts believe these intensified strikes are preparations for a potential new summer offensive. Russia's ability to conduct these large-scale attacks has been bolstered by its own expanded drone production, as well as supplies of components and missiles from countries like China and North Korea.</p>

The discussion highlighted a shift in strategy, with the current administration appearing to scale back the federal role and place greater reliance on state and local officials to manage recovery efforts, a departure from the more hands-on approach of previous administrations.</p>

This led him to make a critical error: leaving a knife sheath at the crime scene, which contained the DNA that ultimately led to his arrest.

Historically, third parties in the U.S. have rarely won seats but have sometimes succeeded by pressuring the main parties on specific issues.
