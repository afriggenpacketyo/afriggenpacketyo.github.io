        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of a dozen states has filed a lawsuit against President Trump and his administration, challenging the legality of the recently imposed tariffs. New York Attorney General Letitia James stated that the lawsuit aims to prevent the president from unilaterally raising taxes through these tariffs, asserting that such actions exceed his constitutional authority. The lawsuit was officially lodged in the U.S. Court of International Trade in Washington, D.C., marking a significant legal challenge to the administration's trade policies. The outcome of this case could have far-reaching implications for the future of international trade relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed the installation of a makeup studio adjacent to the Pentagon briefing room, reportedly costing several thousand dollars, a move criticized amidst administration-wide cost-cutting efforts. The suggestion for the upgrade came from Tami Radabaugh, a former Fox News producer. Hegseth, formerly a Fox News co-host, has emphasized improving the armed forces' warfighting abilities. This decision has raised eyebrows, especially given Hegseth's recent controversy involving the sharing of sensitive military information through a messaging app, which is currently under review by the Defense Department acting inspector general.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plans to phase out petroleum-based synthetic dyes from America's food supply by the end of 2026, replacing them with natural alternatives. This decision follows increased scrutiny of artificial dyes, with California already banning Red Dye No. 3 due to potential cancer risks. While some experts question the actual harm caused by these additives, the Trump administration is pushing for food companies to remove them even sooner. The FDA will also begin the process of revoking authorization for Citrus Red No. 2 and Orange B.</p>
