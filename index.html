          <p>An NYPD officer and three civilians were fatally shot in a Midtown Manhattan office building by a gunman who later died by suicide. The officer, Didarul Islam, was a four-year veteran and father of two with a third child on the way. The suspect, identified as a 27-year-old from Las Vegas with a documented mental health history, used a high-powered rifle in what officials are calling a lone-wolf attack. The motive remains under investigation as authorities piece together the shooter's cross-country journey to New York City.</p>

          <p>India has become the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S., with its share of imports jumping to 44% in the second quarter, a significant rise from 13% last year. This shift is largely driven by Apple's strategy to move manufacturing away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties and U.S. tariffs. While China's share of U.S. smartphone imports fell drastically, India's export volume surged by 240%, marking a major realignment in global technology supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore Airlines experienced a significant stock drop after reporting a 59% plunge in first-quarter net profit, largely attributed to losses from its stake in Air India. The airline's operating profit also fell, reflecting normalizing demand from pandemic highs and increased competition. Analysts noted that Air India's deeper-than-expected losses are a near-term drag on SIA's financials, although the carrier stated that overall demand for air travel remains strong.

          <p>A court in Bogotá has found former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe guilty of bribery and witness tampering in a landmark case. The conviction stems from accusations that Uribe attempted to influence testimony from jailed ex-paramilitaries who had linked him to illegal armed groups. The verdict is a pivotal moment in Colombian politics, polarizing a nation where Uribe is both credited for fighting leftist rebels and criticized for alleged human rights abuses. He faces up to 12 years in prison and is expected to appeal the decision.</p>

This policy reverses the long-standing practice of allowing bond hearings for individuals not deemed a flight or safety risk.

          <p>The United States and the European Union have announced a new trade agreement, setting a 15% tariff on most EU imports, which is lower than the 30% rate President Trump had threatened. The deal also includes an EU commitment to purchase $750 billion in U.S. energy and make $600 billion in investments. While the agreement averts a more severe trade war, some economists view it as unbalanced, predicting it will reduce the EU's GDP while boosting U.S. access to European markets.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's visit with President Donald Trump in Scotland, though ostensibly a private trip for Trump, has provided the UK leader with significant, direct access to his U.S. counterpart. The unconventional diplomatic setting, including a helicopter tour of a golf course, allowed for extended, free-wheeling conversations on topics from Gaza to trade. While this access is seen by Downing Street as invaluable for strengthening the UK-US relationship, it also presents the risk of being associated with the president's unpredictable style.</p>

Wingfield, who transferred to USC for his last year, is challenging the NCAA's "Five-Year Rule," arguing it is anticompetitive and that his circumstances, including the pandemic and a past injury, merit an exception. The lawsuit seeks an injunction that would allow him to play, a critical issue for USC's thin offensive line as the season begins.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests that the stock market's muted reaction to President Trump's new trade deals is due to "tariff ennui" and a focus on more immediate factors. He argues that investors are preoccupied with this week's major tech earnings reports, the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, and Friday's employment data. According to Cramer, Wall Street has grown accustomed to the pattern of Trump's trade negotiations and will not be moved by them until the more pressing economic news of the week is released.

The case scrutinizes the legality of aggressive enforcement tactics and could set up another major immigration-related showdown at the Supreme Court.</p>
