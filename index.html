          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testified before House and Senate committees, defending the Trump administration's proposed budget cuts to HHS, which includes laying off thousands of workers and consolidating institutes. Democratic senators grilled Kennedy on the impacts of these cuts, particularly to programs like lead poisoning prevention. Kennedy avoided sharing his personal views on vaccines, deferring to doctors at NIH and CDC, while Democratic representatives criticized him for promoting vaccine skepticism amid measles outbreaks. He also defended the agency's response to the measles outbreak and stated that his goal at HHS is to focus on chronic disease and deliver effective services by cutting costs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the release of Dr. Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown scholar detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), on bail. The judge sided with the ACLU's argument that Suri was detained based on his First Amendment speech supporting Palestine. The judge also noted that Suri was unjustly punished by association with his wife and father-in-law. Suri was arrested in March and charged with removability, with the Department of Homeland Security alleging he spread Hamas propaganda and had connections to a known terrorist.

The author argues that such bizarre news is a consequence of Trump's disregard for laws and institutions, and the corruption that alters the texture of shared reality.

The tariffs, intended to protect U.S. jobs, may have the opposite effect, potentially leading Auratone to relocate its operations to Europe.</p>
