          <p>Nepal's Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has resigned following two days of violent unrest across the country, during which 19 people were killed in clashes with police. The protests were initially triggered by a government ban on major social media platforms, which has since been repealed. Despite the reversal, demonstrations continued, fueled by broader anger over corruption and unemployment, culminating in protesters setting fire to parliament and the prime minister's residence. The events highlight deep-seated frustration among Nepal's youth, who view digital freedom as essential and demand accountability from the government.</p>

          <p>The White House has denied the authenticity of an alleged 2003 birthday message from Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein, which was released by a U.S. House committee. The note, part of a "birthday book" compiled by Ghislaine Maxwell, contains a drawing and a message, but the administration claims the signature does not match Trump's. This release is part of a larger trove of documents from Epstein's estate, intensifying calls for transparency regarding investigations into the late financier's activities and associates. The document's emergence has fueled political debate, with Democrats accusing Trump of a cover-up.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials report that a Russian airstrike on the village of Yarova in the eastern Donetsk region has killed 23 people and wounded at least 18 others. The victims were civilians who had gathered to collect their pensions from a postal service vehicle near the front line. President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned the attack, sharing graphic footage and describing it as one of the deadliest assaults on civilians in recent weeks. The incident highlights the ongoing danger to non-combatants as Russian forces continue their advance in the region.</p>

          <p>International relations experts and space lawyers are raising concerns about the adequacy of existing legal frameworks, like the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, for managing modern space activities. The treaty, designed during the Cold War, is ill-equipped to handle the proliferation of state and commercial actors, the rise of dual-use technologies, and the potential for an arms race in space. With nations like the U.S. and China pursuing independent lunar ambitions and Russia declaring commercial satellites as potential military targets, the risk of miscalculation and conflict is growing. Analysts suggest that new norms of behavior and private sector involvement may be necessary to ensure peaceful development.</p>

          <p>U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright has strongly criticized the global target of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, labeling it a "colossal train wreck" and an unachievable goal. He argues that pursuing this target would lead to widespread human impoverishment. His comments contrast sharply with the climate plans of over 140 countries aiming to meet the Paris Agreement's warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius. Wright, a former oil executive, also warned that European climate regulations could jeopardize a major trade deal between the U.S. and the EU, highlighting a significant policy rift.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that renaming the U.S. Department of Defense to the Department of War would be a costly and cosmetic change that undermines America's moral standing. The author contends that the real issue is the department's unwieldy and inefficient bureaucracy. The current structure, with its multiple layers of civilian and military leadership, often leads to duplication, internal rivalries, and inertia. Instead of a symbolic name change, the focus should be on deep institutional reforms to streamline decision-making and better address modern security challenges.</p>

          <p>The rapid growth of the artificial intelligence industry is fueling significant demand in the office and residential real estate markets of several major North American cities. A CBRE analysis shows that the pool of tech workers with AI skills has grown by over 50% in the past year, with concentrations in the San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, and Seattle. Unlike the broader tech sector, which has embraced remote work, AI development often requires in-office collaboration, boosting office leasing activity. This influx of high-earning talent has also led to increased apartment rental prices in these key AI hubs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In her new book, "When All the Men Wore Hats," Susan Cheever revisits the life of her father, the acclaimed author John Cheever, blending memoir with literary appreciation. The article discusses how she navigates the complex legacy of a man who publicly projected the image of a country squire while privately struggling with alcoholism and closeted homosexuality. The piece reflects on how these hidden torments and deep anxieties fueled the "flighty, eccentric, and sometimes bitter work" that defined his celebrated short stories. It positions his personal anguish not just as a biographical detail but as a central creative catalyst for his fiction.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has officially endorsed former L.A. mayor Antonio Villaraigosa in the crowded 2026 race for California governor. Bass and Villaraigosa have a long history of collaboration, dating back to their work as community activists in the 1970s. The endorsement comes as Villaraigosa navigates a competitive field of prominent Democratic candidates seeking to replace the termed-out Governor Gavin Newsom. While the impact of Bass's endorsement is uncertain given recent fluctuations in her own approval ratings, it represents a significant consolidation of support from a key figure in California politics.</p>

Concurrently, Maduro has more than doubled a planned troop deployment to 25,000 soldiers along the country's borders. This military posturing is a response to increased U.S. naval presence and a doubled bounty for his capture, as the Trump administration accuses him of colluding with drug gangs. The U.S. has designated the Pentagon as the 'Department of War' and sent its chief to visit military assets in the region.</p>

          <p>A review of Michael Clune's new novel, "Pan," examines its portrayal of an adolescent boy besieged by panic attacks in the early 1990s. The article notes Clune's unique, impressionistic style, previously seen in his heroin addiction memoir "White Out," which captures the subjective, sensory distortion of panic with vivid precision. Rather than following a clinical or recovery-focused plot, the novel treats the protagonist's anxiety as a philosophical and metaphysical quest, exploring its connection to the Greek god Pan. The book is described as a bracing mix of coming-of-age story and intellectual exploration.</p>
