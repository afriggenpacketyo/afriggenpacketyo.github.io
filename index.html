          <p>General Timothy Haugh, head of the NSA and Cyber Command, was unexpectedly fired by the Trump administration.  This decision sparked immediate concern from top Democrats on intelligence committees, who cited Haugh's integrity and national security focus as potential reasons for his dismissal.  The firing occurred amidst other staff dismissals at the National Security Council and follows recent controversies involving the Trump administration and classified information leaks.  Lt. Gen. William Hartman will serve as acting NSA director.</p>

          <p>The UK government is developing a list of US products for potential retaliatory tariffs following President Trump's imposition of new import taxes on UK goods.  Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds is consulting with UK firms to determine which products would be most effective for retaliatory measures.  The list includes a wide range of products, aiming to minimize the economic impact on the UK while maximizing pressure on the US.  Negotiations are ongoing, but the UK has warned of potential action if a satisfactory trade deal isn't reached.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's new tariffs on European imports place pro-Trump far-right parties in a difficult position.
