          <p>Tottenham Hotspur's captain, Son Heung-min, has announced he will be leaving the club this summer, concluding a decade-long tenure. The 33-year-old South Korean forward, who joined from Bayer Leverkusen in 2015, is reportedly in advanced talks with Los Angeles FC of Major League Soccer. Son described the move as the most difficult decision of his career but necessary for a new challenge, especially after leading Spurs to their first trophy in 17 years by winning the Europa League. His final appearance could be a pre-season friendly in his home country of South Korea.</p>

          <p>A major rescue operation is in progress in central Chile to save five miners trapped in the El Teniente copper mine, the world's largest underground copper mine. The collapse was triggered by a magnitude 4.2 earth tremor, which unfortunately resulted in the death of one of their colleagues. Rescue workers are methodically working to clear the remaining distance to reach the miners, who are trapped over 900 meters deep. State-run company Codelco has halted all operations at the mine and pledged to use all available resources to ensure the safe return of the workers.</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative Party, has stated that she no longer identifies as Nigerian, despite her ancestry and having grown up partially in the country. Speaking on a podcast, Badenoch explained that while she is "Nigerian through ancestry," her identity is British, as she has spent most of her life in the UK. She revealed she has not renewed her Nigerian passport since the early 2000s and considers the UK her home. This follows previous criticism from Nigeria's vice-president, who accused her of denigrating the West African nation.</p>

          <p>The Cambodian government has announced its intention to nominate former U.S. President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. The nomination is in recognition of his role in brokering a ceasefire agreement that ended a long-standing border conflict between Cambodia and Thailand. Cambodia's deputy prime minister praised Trump's efforts, stating he deserved the award for helping to "advance fellowship between nations." The conflict had resulted in at least 43 deaths and displaced over 300,000 people before a truce was negotiated following Trump's intervention.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese-led research team has made a significant discovery about the evolutionary history of the potato, a staple food crop consumed by over a billion people. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists found that the modern potato originated from an ancient hybridization event. This event occurred approximately nine million years ago when an ancestor of the tomato crossbred with a tuberless, potato-like plant. The study, published in the journal Cell, concludes that this hybridization was the key evolutionary step that led to the development of tubers.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has maintained a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's "roving patrols" by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Southern California. The ruling affirms that ICE agents cannot conduct stops without reasonable suspicion that an individual is in the country illegally, and that such suspicion cannot be based solely on race or ethnicity. The court rejected the government's claim that the injunction would harm its enforcement efforts, noting that the order simply prevents unconstitutional stops. This decision is seen as a significant victory for civil rights groups and local officials opposing the aggressive deportation tactics.</p>

While the UK Foreign Office currently deems travel to these areas safe, the situation remains volatile.

However, if travelers decide to cancel on their own due to unease, they are unlikely to be covered unless they purchased specific catastrophe coverage.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear a major case next term that will examine the constitutionality of racial redistricting. The case stems from Louisiana's creation of a second majority-Black congressional district, which a lower court had previously invalidated as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. The justices have asked parties to file briefs on whether the map violates the 14th or 15th Amendments. The outcome could have significant implications for the Voting Rights Act and the way states draw political maps, potentially impacting the balance of power in the House of Representatives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a study published in the Journal of Climate, scientists have identified a connection between decadal-scale solar magnetic cycles and precipitation patterns in China. The research suggests that these solar activities influence a weather pattern known as "south drought and north flooding," which has become more pronounced. Understanding this link is crucial for improving climate predictions, particularly during flood seasons. The positioning of the monsoon rain belt, which is affected by these cycles, plays a significant role in determining the distribution of droughts and floods across the country.</p>

          <p>William Beach, the former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics who was appointed by Donald Trump during his first term, has strongly condemned the president's firing of his successor, Erika McEntarfer. Beach called the dismissal "totally groundless" and warned that it "sets a dangerous precedent" that undermines the credibility of federal economic statistics. In a statement, he urged Congress to investigate the matter, emphasizing that politicizing economic data can destroy public trust. The article also notes Trump's defense of the firing, stating he needs "people we can trust" in such roles.</p>

          <p>Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla is expected to attend a major fundraiser for President Trump at his New Jersey golf club, an event aiming to raise $25 million. This attendance comes just one day after Trump publicly sent letters to Pfizer and other pharmaceutical companies, demanding they lower U.S. drug prices to align with rates paid in other countries. The letters requested commitments within 60 days to sell drugs at "most favored nation" rates. The situation highlights the complex relationship between the administration and the pharmaceutical industry, juxtaposing public pressure for price cuts with high-dollar political fundraising.</p>

          <p>A National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) hearing has provided new insights into the fatal midair collision between a regional jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter near Washington, D.C., which killed all 67 people aboard both aircraft. Key revelations include the possibility that the helicopter's altimeter was inaccurate, a known issue that was not considered alarming. Investigators also learned that air traffic controllers at the busy airport faced pressure to "make it work," sometimes pushing safety limits, and that the FAA had not acted on prior internal warnings about the helicopter route's proximity to commercial flights.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards in Seal Beach, California, are warning beachgoers about a significant uptick in stingray-related injuries, with daily incidents jumping from an average of one to about ten. The increase is attributed to calm, warm waters drawing the stingrays closer to shore, coinciding with hot weather that brings more people to the beach. The area near the San Gabriel River, known locally as "ray bay," is a particular hotspot. To avoid being stung, officials advise people to shuffle their feet in the sand to alert the camouflaged fish, and to treat any stings by soaking the wound in hot water.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An internal analysis by the Trump administration's own Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) indicates that its plan to roll back greenhouse gas emission standards will lead to higher gasoline prices for consumers. The report, citing data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, found that eliminating policies encouraging fuel efficiency and EV adoption would increase demand for gasoline, thus raising its cost. This finding contradicts the administration's public claim that the deregulation would save Americans money. The analysis also projected the loss of nearly half a million jobs by 2035 under the new policy. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Trade experts are warning that President Trump's latest executive order hiking tariffs on imports will likely increase consumer prices and create extended uncertainty for businesses. With a new baseline tariff of at least 15% on most countries, the average U.S. tariff rate has risen to 17%, its highest in decades. Economists predict this will lead to pricier goods such as clothing, cars, and furniture, potentially costing the average American family over $2,000 annually. While the administration argues the policy will revive U.S. manufacturing, experts caution it could also lead to higher inflation and reduced product choices for consumers.

The announcement, which also included the closure of her newer Chicken Box restaurant, came without prior warning. This follows a pattern of abrupt closures for Deen's other establishments in the past.

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, was unable to secure an automatic qualifying spot for the U.S. Junior Ryder Cup team. After strong second and third rounds put him in contention at the Junior PGA Championship, he struggled in the final round, shooting a 74. A late-round stumble with three bogeys and a double bogey caused him to drop into a tie for ninth place. While one captain's pick for the team remains available, it is considered unlikely that Woods will be selected for the spot.</p>
