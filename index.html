          <p>House Republicans are advancing a comprehensive bill to enact President Trump's agenda, proposing significant tax cuts primarily benefiting the wealthy, increased funding for defense and immigration enforcement, and corresponding reductions in health, nutrition, education, and clean energy programs. The bill aims to make permanent many tax cuts passed in 2017, including lower income tax rates and a higher estate tax threshold, while introducing temporary tax cuts like deductions for car loan interest. However, the bill faces internal Republican divisions over the state and local tax deduction cap and Medicaid cuts, with potential impacts on millions of Americans' health coverage and access to food stamps. The legislation also includes contentious changes to clean energy tax credits, potentially affecting investments in renewable energy projects across the country.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's announcement that the U.S. would lift sanctions on Syria caught senior Treasury Department officials off guard, leading to internal discussions to determine the scope and speed of the rollback. Syria's transitional government, led by interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, has been lobbying for sanctions relief to address economic challenges, including paying civil service salaries and rebuilding infrastructure. While some work was underway at Treasury for an incremental lifting of sanctions, the president's sweeping statement prompted confusion. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated that relief may come in the form of waivers, allowing foreign partners to provide aid without facing penalties. The sanctions were initially imposed on the Assad regime for human rights abuses and support for terrorist organizations.</p>

          <p>An internal review indicates that FEMA is "not ready" for the upcoming hurricane season due to staff cuts, contract changes, and a perceived lack of understanding regarding the agency's role, as President Trump pushes to reduce its footprint. The review highlights that hurricane preparedness has been "derailed" by staffing and contract issues. While a DHS official downplayed the review's findings, multiple FEMA employees reported that Acting Administrator David Richardson did not confirm the agency's readiness during a town hall meeting. The presentation also cites "culture issues" and challenges in coordinating with other federal agencies, potentially impacting emergency response efforts. Richardson supports shrinking FEMA and increasing cost-sharing with states.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service is investigating a photo of seashells posted on Instagram by former FBI Director James Comey after Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed it constituted a "threat" against President Trump. The photo, depicting seashells forming the message "8647", was interpreted by some Trump supporters as an endorsement of violence against the 47th president. Comey removed the post and stated he was unaware of the potential meaning and does not condone violence. The incident highlights the deeply antagonistic relationship between Comey and Trump, stemming from Comey's role in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports, according to preliminary government data. The contraction was more pronounced than economists had anticipated, with exports falling by 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. The Bank of Japan had previously cautioned that the country's economy was likely to moderate due to global trade policies. Despite these concerns, the central bank appears poised to continue raising its policy rate, with some board members expressing confidence in achieving the 2% inflation target.</p>

          <p>Top U.S. diplomat Marco Rubio stated that significant progress in Ukraine-Russia peace talks is unlikely without direct interaction between President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump echoed this sentiment, suggesting that nothing substantial would occur until he and Putin meet in person to address the ongoing conflict. Ukraine confirmed its delegation would attend talks in Turkey, but criticized the level of representation from Moscow. The Kremlin insisted its team possesses "all the necessary competencies" to negotiate, despite Zelenskyy's accusations of disrespect towards Trump and Erdogan due to the Russian delegation's lack of seniority.</p>

          <p>Smokey Robinson is under criminal investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department following accusations of sexual assault by four anonymous former employees.

Robinson's lawyer, Christopher Frost, stated that the police report was filed only after the $50 million lawsuit, suggesting a motive to prejudice public opinion. The lawsuit alleges that Robinson assaulted and sexually battered the former housekeepers at his Chatsworth home between 2006 and 2024, seeking $50 million in damages.</p>

          <p>Small businesses are experiencing financial strain due to President Trump's fluctuating tariffs on Chinese goods, creating uncertainty and impacting their ability to plan for the future. Bobby Djavaheri, owner of Yedi Houseware Appliances, has been forced to increase prices after facing a 145% tariff, which has since been reduced to 30%. This volatility leaves businesses in a difficult position, unsure whether to ship goods at the current rate or wait for further tariff reductions. Logistics companies are seeing increased demand for foreign trade zones and bonded warehouses, allowing businesses to defer tariff payments until goods leave the facility.</p>

          <p>Come this fall, only older Americans and those with chronic health problems may be urged to get the Covid shot because of new testing requirements for clinical testing of vaccines that may delay the availability of shots that had formerly been updated annually without complicated trials. Federal officials are considering ending the use of the vaccine in children under 12. Some experts fear that the new federal limits are just the first steps in a campaign to undermine the use of all vaccines, including those in the childhood immunization schedule, by raising doubts about their safety and imposing requirements that make it untenable for companies to keep making them.</p>

The law includes an exception if an abortion is necessary to maintain the woman's life, but doctors are not stopping or removing the devices that are keeping her breathing. The family has been told that the fetus has fluid on the brain and doctors are concerned about his health.</p>

Ventura acknowledged she loved Combs for over a decade, but described his behavior as prone to violence, jealousy, and rage.
