          <p>A new study by First Street projects a 380% increase in foreclosures across the U.S. over the next 10 years due to extreme weather events linked to climate change. The study estimates that climate-driven events could account for 30% of all foreclosures by 2035, significantly impacting low- to moderate-income households. Lenders could face losses of up to $5.4 billion annually as they absorb mortgage defaults. The report also highlights the role of rising insurance premiums in shaping foreclosure trends, as gaps in insurance coverage put more people at risk of defaulting.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Defaulting on credit card debt can have severe financial consequences, but it doesn't happen immediately; it typically occurs after 180 days of missed payments. Defaulting can significantly damage your credit score for up to seven years, making it harder to get approved for loans or rent an apartment. Additionally, creditors can sue for unpaid debt, potentially leading to wage garnishment or bank account levies. If you're struggling with credit card debt, consider reaching out to your credit card issuer for a hardship program or working with a credit counseling agency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wall Street experienced its worst week since early April due to President Trump's threats of steep tariffs on EU goods and a tax on foreign-made iPhones. The S&P 500 index fell, adding to losses since Tuesday. Market concerns about the deficit dominated the week, fueled by a budget bill that extends tax cuts without significantly reducing spending. This has led to rising yields in the government bond market and falling stock prices. (not investment advice)</p>
