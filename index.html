          <p>Isaiah Martin, a Democratic candidate for Congress in Texas, was forcibly removed and arrested during a heated state Capitol hearing on redistricting. He accused Republicans of gerrymandering to favor former President Trump, leading to a volatile confrontation where he refused to yield the floor. Martin was charged with resisting arrest, criminal trespass, and disrupting a public meeting, though all charges were later dropped. The incident highlights the intense political divisions surrounding the redrawing of congressional maps in Texas, a process influenced by national political pressures.</p>

          <p>Israel's military has announced plans to begin airdropping humanitarian aid into Gaza and establish corridors for UN convoys to address the severe hunger crisis. This decision follows mounting international pressure and reports of starvation-related deaths after months of restricted aid access. While the move is a response to the dire situation, the military stated that combat operations against Hamas will not cease. The announcement was met with caution from aid agencies, who warn that airdrops are often inefficient and cannot replace the large-scale, consistent aid delivery needed via land routes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Coast Guard has detected a Chinese-flagged research icebreaker, the Xue Long 2, operating off the coast of Alaska within the U.S. Extended Continental Shelf (ECS). The vessel was located approximately 290 nautical miles north of Utqiagvik. The Coast Guard noted that the U.S. holds exclusive rights to manage resources in its ECS and is vigilantly monitoring the ship's activities to ensure territorial integrity. This event occurs amid heightened surveillance of foreign military and research vessels in the Arctic region by both the U.S. and Canada.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing new properties. The reforms also aim to streamline the process for opening new businesses in disused shops and encourage more outdoor dining and live performances. While the government hopes this will revitalize struggling town centers, the opposition argues that other economic policies have been more damaging to the hospitality industry.</p>

          <p>An unprecedented recall campaign in Taiwan aimed at unseating 24 opposition lawmakers from the Kuomintang (KMT) party has failed to pass. This result ensures that the KMT and its allies will retain their controlling majority in the legislature, continuing the political gridlock for President William Lai's administration. Proponents of the recall accused the lawmakers of undermining national security and being overly accommodating to China, while the opposition framed the effort as a politically motivated attempt to overturn election results. The outcome leaves President Lai facing a challenging legislative environment for the remainder of his term.</p>

          <p>Democratic members of the House Oversight Committee have formally requested a copy of a "birthday book" allegedly compiled for Jeffrey Epstein's 50th birthday from his estate. The request follows reports that the book contains a letter from Donald Trump, which he has denied. The lawmakers argue the book is relevant to their oversight of the Justice Department's handling of the Epstein investigation and the Trump administration's selective release of related files. This action precedes the scheduled deposition of Ghislaine Maxwell, who reportedly assembled the book for Epstein in 2003.</p>

          <p>President Trump's broad use of tariffs is facing critical legal challenges, with a federal appeals court set to hear arguments on whether he has overstepped his authority. The lawsuits contest his use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to unilaterally impose duties, a power that underpins many of his recent trade actions. A lower court has already ruled against the administration, a decision that is currently paused pending appeal. If the courts ultimately rule against the administration, it could invalidate numerous trade deals and tariffs enacted under this authority, significantly impacting U.S. trade policy.

After a crucial performance in the first innings, Stokes did not bowl on day four due to being "a bit stiff and sore," according to the team's assistant coach. Stokes has a history of injury issues, and his inability to bowl would be a significant blow to England's attack as they try to secure a win.

          <p>The stock price for clothing brand American Eagle has seen a significant increase following the launch of a new advertising campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The article suggests that the campaign's success stems from its traditional approach of using a popular and attractive star to sell products, a tactic that has become less common in modern advertising. It posits that many brands have shifted towards messaging-focused ads, sometimes to their financial detriment. The positive market reaction to the Sweeney campaign is presented as evidence that investors and consumers may be ready for a return to more product-focused marketing. (not investment advice)</p>
