          <p>Salesforce reported strong first-quarter results, surpassing expectations for both earnings per share and revenue. The company's revenue grew by 7.6% year-over-year, and net income remained relatively stable. CEO Marc Benioff expressed optimism, highlighting the planned acquisition of Informatica, a data management company, for $8 billion, which would be Salesforce's largest acquisition since the Slack deal. Salesforce also introduced the AgentExchange marketplace for AI agents, resulting in significant cost savings through the reassignment of customer support workers. The company raised its full-year forecast, projecting adjusted earnings per share and revenue above consensus estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration, through FEMA, denied North Carolina's request for 100% federal cost sharing for Hurricane Helene cleanup, reverting to the traditional 75%-federal, 25%-state cost-sharing model. Governor Josh Stein expressed concern that this decision would cost state residents hundreds of millions of dollars, diverting funds from other critical needs. The denial comes as the Department of Homeland Security considers eliminating FEMA, aiming to give states more control over emergency management response.

          <p>Nvidia reported a 69% increase in revenue, reaching $44.1 billion, despite U.S. government restrictions on AI chip sales to China. The company's net income rose by 26% to $18.78 billion, although it fell short of Wall Street's profit predictions. Nvidia projects a 50% revenue increase in the current quarter, driven by sales of its new Blackwell AI chip, however the company anticipates losing $8 billion due to the Trump administration's restrictions. CEO Jensen Huang criticized the U.S. restrictions, arguing that they strengthen Chinese chipmakers and weaken America's position, while the company is finding new markets for its chips in the Middle East and elsewhere.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump responded to the emergence of the "TACO" acronym, which stands for "Trump Always Chickens Out," used by Wall Street to describe his trade negotiation style. The acronym refers to the pattern of Trump announcing tariffs, markets declining, and then Trump easing the tariffs, causing markets to rebound. Trump defended his approach, stating that it is a form of negotiation and that his tariff threats have brought other countries to the negotiating table. He questioned whether it would be better to maintain tariffs at a high level, such as the 145% tariff imposed on China.</p>

          <p>The Defense Department lacks a clear strategy for the construction, deployment, and long-term management of the missile defense system being built on Guam, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO). Without a plan, the effort risks cost and schedule overruns, as well as infrastructure unready for additional personnel. The Army, leading the effort, faces hurdles in advocating for support from other military services. The Pentagon has not determined firm personnel numbers or deployment schedules, potentially exacerbating existing infrastructure issues.</p>
