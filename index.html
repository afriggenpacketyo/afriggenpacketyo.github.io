State Senator Omar Fateh claimed a federal operation involved DHS, ICE, FBI, Sheriffs, and MPD, describing it as "blatant fascism." However, the operation was a criminal search warrant for drugs and money laundering at a Mexican restaurant, unrelated to immigration enforcement. Officials condemned the "highly irresponsible" misinformation, emphasizing the potential for inciting riots and causing harm to the community, with the police chief highlighting the potential for tragedy and community loss.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously blocked the Mexican government's lawsuit against major U.S. gun manufacturers, delivering a win for the firearms industry. Mexico had argued that gun manufacturers knowingly aided and abetted the unlawful sale of their firearms to straw purchasers, who then trafficked them to drug cartels. Justice Elena Kagan stated that Mexico's complaint did not plausibly allege that the gunmakers criminally aided and abetted retail dealers' unlawful sale of weapons to Mexican traffickers. The court upheld the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which shields gun companies from liability in such cases.</p>

The ban, set to take effect on June 9, includes exemptions for U.S. permanent residents, spouses and children of U.S. citizens, and athletes participating in major sporting events. Trump stated the factors considered were related to security risks and inability to properly vet travelers. This action follows previous travel bans issued during his first administration, which faced legal challenges but were ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court.</p>

Justice Elena Kagan stated that Mexico's complaint did not adequately prove that manufacturers knowingly and deliberately helped criminals acquire guns for trafficking into Mexico. The court acknowledged Mexico's struggle with gun violence originating from the U.S., but found the lawsuit did not meet the criteria for an exception to the liability shield.
