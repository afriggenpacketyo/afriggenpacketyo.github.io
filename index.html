        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron's stock experienced a decline on Friday as the company reported a more than 30% drop in net income, which fell to $3.5 billion due to lower oil prices. In response to these financial results, Chevron plans to decrease its stock repurchase program in the second quarter to between $2.5 billion and $3 billion, down from $3.9 billion in the first quarter. The company's U.S. production business also saw a decline in profit due to higher operating expenses and lower commodity prices, despite a profit in the U.S. refining business after a previous loss.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Scottish government has decided to drop its plans to introduce a new misogyny law before the upcoming Holyrood election next year, citing insufficient time to draft a law that aligns with a recent Supreme Court judgement on the definition of a woman. Instead, ministers intend to amend existing hate crime legislation to include protections based on sex. The government also retracted plans to legislate against conversion therapy, hoping for a UK-wide solution, though it may introduce its own law if it remains in power after the election. The decision follows an expert group's recommendation in 2022 for separate legislation to address misogyny.</p>

          <p>The United States and Ukraine have announced a joint economic investment deal, granting the U.S. access to Ukrainian minerals, potentially bolstering Ukraine's defense capabilities against Russia. This agreement arrives as the U.S. seeks to diversify its access to rare earth minerals, vital for manufacturing high-tech and military equipment, amid escalating trade disputes with China. The deal encompasses a wide range of minerals, including rare earth elements, oil, and natural gas, with the U.S. offering financial or military assistance in return for a share of royalties from future projects. Ukraine holds approximately 5% of global mineral reserves.</p>

          <p>The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) is prioritizing the protection of President Trump’s Senate majority in the 2026 midterms, contrasting with the DNC's strategy of primarying older Democrats. The NRSC is backing specific candidates, Mike Rogers in Michigan and John Cornyn in Texas, discouraging donors from supporting potential primary challengers. This decision has sparked debate, with some arguing that it undermines the voters' right to choose their candidates. The DNC responded by criticizing Republicans for attempting to control House races, suggesting it stems from fear of losing seats due to their unpopular agenda.</p>

With the administration threatening to cut federal contracts and grants, and even influence hiring and curriculum, the article argues that competition among universities must give way to solidarity. Columbia University's experience demonstrates that negotiating with the administration is futile, and smaller universities cannot afford to stand alone against such pressures. The American Association of Colleges and Universities has issued a statement condemning the government's overreach, but stronger action, including financial support from well-endowed universities for their weaker counterparts, is needed.</p>

          <p>A new analysis reveals that greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. oil and gas projects are projected to increase under President Trump's administration, reversing a previous decline seen under President Biden. This shift is attributed to Trump's focus on expanding fossil fuel production, despite concerns over the economic impact of tariffs and global climate goals. While Trump's policies have faced some economic challenges due to tariffs and market volatility, the U.S. is still expected to move towards record oil production levels. Meanwhile, renewable energy projects face potential cost increases and reduced support from the administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump ended the "de minimis" exemption, a loophole that allowed cheap Chinese goods to bypass U.S. tariffs, potentially raising prices for American consumers on platforms like Amazon, Shein, and Temu. The administration is also negotiating trade deals with over a dozen other nations, but finalizing these agreements by the July 8 deadline is unlikely. Trump removed Michael Waltz as national security adviser, nominating him as U.N. ambassador, and appointed Marco Rubio as interim national security adviser. A federal judge barred the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans from a Texas district.</p>

          <p>The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has announced that transgender women are now barred from competing in all levels of women's cricket, effective immediately. The decision, aligning with a recent UK Supreme Court ruling, restricts participation in women's and girls' cricket to individuals whose biological sex is female. The ECB clarified that transgender women and girls can still participate in open and mixed cricket categories. This policy change follows a similar decision by the English Football Association (FA) regarding women's football.</p>

Morales was a key witness in the U.S. trial that led to Gonzalez's life sentence. Authorities are investigating the possibility of revenge as a motive. The Jalisco New Generation cartel is one of the most powerful criminal gangs in Mexico and has been designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government. The Trump administration has also imposed economic sanctions on individuals and entities linked to the cartel's drug trafficking and fuel theft network.</p>
