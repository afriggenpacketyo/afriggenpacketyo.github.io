          <p>Ahmed Ebid, an Egyptian-born man residing in the UK, has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for his role in smuggling nearly 3,800 migrants from North Africa to Italy between October 2022 and June 2023, some of whom later entered Britain. The National Crime Agency (NCA) believes Ebid is the first person convicted in the UK for organizing boat crossings across the Mediterranean. Ebid himself arrived in the UK via a small boat in 2022 after serving time in Italy for attempted drug smuggling and applied for asylum, though his claim was never resolved by the British government. This case highlights the ongoing efforts to combat illegal immigration and human trafficking across international borders.</p>

          <p>Federal transportation officials are investigating an incident where the Mexican naval ship CuauhtÃ©moc collided with the Brooklyn Bridge, resulting in the deaths of two crew members and injuries to at least 22 others. The ship, carrying 277 people, accelerated to six knots and struck the bridge less than five minutes after departing from a Lower Manhattan pier, according to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Investigators are working with Mexican counterparts to inspect the engine, interview crew members, and recover data recorders to determine the cause of the sudden acceleration. The vessel, which was on a goodwill tour, is currently docked at Pier 36 in Manhattan.</p>

          <p>Reese Hogan, a California track athlete from Crean Lutheran High School, received praise on social media after briefly posing on the first-place podium following her loss to a transgender athlete in the triple jump at the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Southern Section Finals. Hogan set a personal and school record but was defeated by more than four feet. This incident occurred after Hogan and other athletes were allegedly asked to remove their "Protect Girls Sports" T-shirts at a previous meet, sparking controversy. The Trump administration has since put California and Governor Gavin Newsom on notice, as the CIF is under a Title IX investigation for its policies regarding transgender athletes.</p>

          <p>Peter Green Chilled, a logistics firm that supplies major UK supermarkets like Tesco, Sainsbury's, and Aldi, has been targeted by a ransomware attack, disrupting its operations. The attack has led to potential waste of thousands of products as deliveries are halted, and one of the firm's customers estimates that ten pallets of meat products may have to be discarded if the issue is not resolved quickly. This incident highlights the increasing vulnerability of smaller logistics firms to cyber attacks, with industry sources noting that larger companies have more resources to combat such threats. The Cold Chain Federation reports a significant rise in cyber attacks on the warehousing, food storage, and distribution sectors, which are critical for maintaining the food supply chain.</p>

          <p>Lucy Connolly, the wife of a Conservative councillor from Northampton, has lost her appeal against a 31-month jail sentence for inciting racial hatred through a social media post on X. Connolly's tweet, made on the day of the Southport attacks, called for "mass deportation now" and urged followers to "set fire" to hotels housing asylum seekers, garnering 310,000 views before deletion. Judges at the Court of Appeal upheld the sentence, stating there was no arguable basis to deem it manifestly excessive. Connolly had pleaded guilty to inciting racial hatred at Birmingham Crown Court and will serve 40% of her sentence in prison before being released on license.</p>

Yaxley-Lennon was initially jailed for 18 months in October for contempt of court after ignoring an order not to repeat false allegations about a Syrian refugee. His sentence was reduced after the High Court accepted that he had shown a "change in attitude" and complied with the injunction by removing social media posts containing the libellous claims. The judge noted the "absence of contrition or remorse" but acknowledged Yaxley-Lennon's assurance to comply with the injunction in the future.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has traced the ancestor of animals and plants to a hydrogen-metabolizing cell that existed before the Great Oxidation Event, which occurred at least 2.1 billion years ago. The study, published in Nature, suggests that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes lived around 2.72 billion years ago under oxygen-deficient conditions. Eukaryotes, cells or organisms with a membrane-bound nucleus, are the foundation of complex, multicellular life. Understanding the origin of eukaryotic cells can uncover insights into the evolution of life and have implications for the exploration of life in outer space.</p>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis is experiencing a significant decline in political influence, marked by weakened control over the state legislature, open dissent from Republican lawmakers, and an uncertain future beyond his second term. Once considered a rising star in the Republican party, DeSantis has faced criticism for his autocratic style and perceived lies, leading to strained relationships with his colleagues. Additionally, an investigation into a charity scandal involving his wife, Casey DeSantis, has further complicated his political standing. Analysts suggest that DeSantis's failed presidential bid and inability to connect with voters on a personal level have contributed to his diminished status.</p>

          <p>Retiree and disability beneficiaries are expressing concerns about potential delays in payments, processing, and services due to cuts being made to the US social security system under the Trump administration. The Social Security Administration (SSA) has been a target of the so-called "department of government efficiency" (Doge), leading to staffing shortages, record backlogs, and improper payments. Beneficiaries report experiencing delays and fear they will be denied benefits or not receive payments they depend on to survive. These concerns are amplified by the rising cost of living, making it increasingly difficult for beneficiaries to make ends meet with limited social security income.</p>

          <p>In Sonora, Mexico, an innovative program is helping to conserve jaguars by compensating ranchers for photos of wild cats taken on their land, turning them from perceived threats to valuable features of the ecosystem. The Northern Jaguar Project's Viviendo con Felinos program pays ranchers for photos of jaguars, pumas, ocelots, and bobcats, incentivizing them not to kill the animals. This initiative has expanded the protected area for jaguars, as participating ranchers agree not to harm any wild animals on their property, helping to maintain a stable or growing population of jaguars in the region. The program has also fostered a shift in attitudes among ranchers, who are increasingly recognizing the importance of preserving the local ecosystem.</p>

This strategy contrasts with Walmart's announcement that it would need to raise prices to cover tariff costs.

          <p>Experts are raising concerns that a Republican-backed tax and spending bill moving forward in the House could add trillions to the U.S. deficit. The bill, which includes extending President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, is projected to cost $3.8 trillion over the next decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Moody's Ratings downgraded the nation's debt, citing the potential for the bill to add $4 trillion to the federal primary deficit. Critics argue that the bill's spending cuts are insufficient to offset the tax breaks, potentially squeezing federal spending and making it more difficult to fund programs like Social Security.</p>

          <p>Moody's Ratings downgraded the U.S. credit rating from Aaa to Aa1, citing concerns about the increasing government debt and interest payment ratios. The credit rating firm noted that successive administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits. Moody's expects federal deficits to grow from 6.4% of GDP in 2024 to 9% of GDP by 2035, driven by increased interest payments, rising entitlement spending, and relatively low revenue generation. Despite the downgrade, Moody's changed its outlook on the U.S. from negative to stable, acknowledging the country's economic strengths and effective monetary policy.</p>

          <p>The European Union has formally adopted its 17th package of sanctions on Russia as EU defense and foreign ministers meet in Brussels. This comes as US President Donald Trump indicated that Ukraine-Russia ceasefire talks would begin following a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, although conditions of the talks are currently unclear. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has called for "consequences" from Washington if Moscow "doesn't agree on an unconditional ceasefire," highlighting the ongoing international efforts to address the conflict in Ukraine.</p>

Democrats are seen as out of touch with the average person, and many voters are waiting to see how Trump's policies play out.

Putin's diplomatic victory could undermine his broader economic goals to normalize relations with the United States, as the Kremlin seeks relief from Western sanctions and increased foreign investment.

          <p>Tens of thousands of U.S. government workers have resigned rather than endure potential mass layoffs threatened by the Trump administration, according to unions, experts, and employees. President Trump signed an executive order to slash the size and cost of government, leading to many civil servants taking buyouts or early retirement offers. Agencies have sent regular emails to staff coupling incentives to quit with warnings of potential layoffs, and many workers have described living in fear of being fired. As a result, Trump and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have managed to cut nearly 12% of the federal civilian workforce largely through threats of firings, buyouts and early retirement offers.</p>
