          <p>Michelle Goldberg reviews Jesse Armstrong's new HBO movie, ‚ÄúMountainhead,‚Äù a satire of tech oligarchs who retreat to a Utah mansion while the world descends into chaos due to their creations. The film explores themes of unchecked power, the collapse of reality through deepfakes, and the potential for tech billionaires to undermine democracy. Armstrong draws inspiration from figures like Zuckerberg, Altman, Andreessen, and Thiel, capturing their blend of arrogance and naivet√©. The film serves as a commentary on the frightening influence of Silicon Valley elites and their detachment from the consequences of their innovations.</p>

          <p>Russia has escalated its aerial bombardments on Ukrainian cities, taking advantage of the United States' apparent withdrawal from diplomatic efforts and military assistance. President Trump criticized President Putin's actions but gave no indication of increased military aid to Ukraine.

A former top commander of Ukraine's military issued a warning about the difficult times ahead, emphasizing the need for continued resources and strength to defend against Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley suggests the era of investing in cryptocurrencies based on market capitalization is ending. Horsley draws parallels to Wall Street, where investors make picks by building a thesis around the business, considering its place in the market and prospects. Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan has advocated for cryptocurrency investors to look beyond Bitcoin and diversify their portfolio across several verticals. This shift towards narrative-driven investing is gaining momentum as new sectors emerge in the market, such as tokenization, games, middleware services, and AI projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While the official unemployment rate remains low, a Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) report indicates a higher "true rate" of unemployment at 24.3% in April. LISEP's measure includes unemployed workers, those seeking full-time work but unable to find it, and individuals in poverty-wage jobs. This measure captures nuances missed by traditional indicators, revealing Americans left behind during economic expansion. LISEP's chairman, Gene Ludwig, notes that the official unemployment data has flaws, such as counting individuals as employed if they have worked as little as one hour in the prior two weeks.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent actions and statements suggest a potential vision for a world where the United States, China, and Russia each dominate their respective spheres of influence. This approach reflects a return to 19th-century imperial rule, with Trump expressing interest in annexing Canada, acquiring Greenland, and re-establishing control over the Panama Canal. While some analysts dismiss these actions as lacking strategic intent, others see them as deliberate attempts to extend American dominance in the Western Hemisphere. Trump's interactions with Putin and Xi Jinping also indicate a preference for strong relationships with leaders of major powers.</p>
