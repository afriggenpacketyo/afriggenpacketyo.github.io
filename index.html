          <p>Vice President JD Vance addressed the Bitcoin 2025 conference, asserting the Trump administration's support for stablecoin legislation. Vance argued that stablecoins do not threaten the U.S. dollar's integrity but rather act as a force multiplier for the nation's economic power. He highlighted the administration's pro-crypto stance, contrasting it with previous Democratic concerns about conflicts of interest related to President Trump's cryptocurrency ventures. Vance emphasized the value of legitimizing stablecoins, referencing the GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate digital assets and potentially unlock trillions of dollars in demand for U.S. Treasuries (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A federal court has blocked many of President Trump's tariffs, stating he overstepped his authority, which the Trump administration plans to appeal. Trump expressed frustration with Russia's slow progress in ending the war in Ukraine but isn't imposing new sanctions. Meanwhile, American and European conservatives are convening in Hungary for the Conservative Political Action Conference, seeing Viktor Orban's leadership as inspirational. There are parallels between Trump and Orban in style and substance, particularly in their handling of universities, raising concerns about democratic institutions.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the U.S. will "aggressively" revoke visas of Chinese students, particularly those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in sensitive fields.

This move follows steps to ease trade tensions between the U.S. and China but also reflects concerns about national security and academic integrity.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK car manufacturing experienced a significant decline, reaching its lowest April output in over 70 years, primarily due to US tariffs and the timing of Easter. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) indicated that the shift from petrol cars to electric vehicles also contributed to the temporary reduction in output. While a US court blocked many of Trump's tariffs, the ruling does not apply to tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars, impacting British car makers like Jaguar Land Rover. Despite export challenges, the UK domestic market remains buoyant, and new trade deals may help boost future production.</p>

Despite taking a hit from U.S. semiconductor export restrictions to China, Nvidia's better-than-expected earnings and revenue boosted investor confidence. The company wrote off $4.5 billion of H20 chip inventory due to export curbs, but this did not deter overall positive sentiment.

However, the medical examiner determined the dog's injuries were postmortem, and the official cause of death is pending further study.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A deceptively simple reform that could unlock more housing is the allowance of single-stair apartment buildings, a common design in Europe and Asia. In the US, building codes typically require two staircases for buildings over three stories, adding significant construction costs and limiting design flexibility. Advocates argue that modern safety features like sprinklers make single-stair buildings just as safe and could encourage the development of more affordable "missing middle" housing. Several states are considering or have already passed laws to allow single-stair designs in four- to six-story buildings, despite resistance from fire safety officials.</p>

          <p>Complaints regarding substandard living conditions in social housing in England have increased more than fivefold in the last five years, according to the housing watchdog.

He warned of "simmering anger" potentially escalating into "social disquiet" if changes aren't implemented, including an independent review of funding practices and a "national tenant body" to enhance tenant voice and landlord accountability.</p>

          <p>Experts are cautioning that President Trump's proposed budget cuts to NASA could jeopardize the resolution of some of the universe's greatest mysteries. The proposed 24% budget reduction, impacting space and Earth science missions, could lead to the closure of labs and abandonment of deep-space missions. Projects like the Mars sample return mission and studies of Venus are at risk, potentially halting decades of debate and discussion. Scientists fear that these cuts will stifle discovery and allow other nations to surpass U.S. leadership in space exploration.</p>

          <p>The USWNT, fresh off their Olympic gold, now faces the challenge of moving forward without the dynamic 'Triple Espresso' trio of Mallory Swanson, Sophia Wilson, and Trinity Rodman. Injuries and pregnancies have sidelined the three stars, forcing coach Emma Hayes to explore new attacking options for the 2027 World Cup. The absence of the trio provides opportunities for emerging talents like Alyssa and Gisele Thompson, Michelle Cooper, and Ally Sentnor to step up and prove their worth. While the return of Triple Espresso remains a possibility, Hayes is focused on building a team that can contend with the world's elite regardless of their availability.</p>

          <p>President Trump's preference for praising and excusing Russian President Vladimir Putin has not led to progress toward peace in Ukraine. Despite claiming he could leverage his relationship with Putin, Trump has faced continued aggression, prompting him to question whether he's been misled. A chorus of foreign policy experts and members of Congress are urging Trump to take a harder line, but Trump has shown little willingness to send additional aid or weapons to Ukraine. His approach has been met with skepticism and criticism, with some suggesting he's being duped by Putin.</p>

The QBI deduction, designed to allow these businesses to report profits or losses on individual tax returns, starts to phase out when taxable income reaches certain limits.

          <p>Stock market investors have learned to profit from President Trump's tariff announcements through the 'TACO trade' (Trump Always Chickens Out), buying stocks when prices dip after a tariff announcement and selling when they rebound after Trump reverses course. This pattern, evident in the market's response to Trump's threat of tariffs on EU imports, reflects Trump's tendency to use bluster without substantial action. While the TACO trade offers short-term gains, the long-term effects of Trump's trade policies remain uncertain, shaking confidence in economic growth and disrupting international trade.</p>
