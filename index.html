          <p>President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles in response to anti-ICE protests has drawn criticism and accusations of authoritarianism. California Governor Gavin Newsom condemned Trump's actions as an overreach of power and a deliberate attempt to incite chaos. Human rights lawyer Philippe Sands warns that these tactics are part of a broader effort to normalize the use of emergency powers and test the limits of public tolerance. The ACLU has described the troop deployment as akin to a declaration of war on Californians, raising concerns about the erosion of democratic norms.</p>

          <p>A recall of Dr Pepper Zero Sugar has been upgraded due to a serious health risk, as cans labeled ‚Äúzero sugar‚Äù were found to contain the full amount of sugar, approximately 39 grams. This poses a significant risk to individuals who need to avoid sugar, especially those with diabetes, as consuming too much sugar can lead to hyperglycemia and potentially fatal complications. The affected cans, produced by Pepsi Beverages Company in Jacksonville, Florida, were distributed to retailers in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. Customers are advised to return the product for a full refund or discard it.</p>

          <p>Criminal gangs are exploiting legal loopholes in Europe to smuggle ketamine, often swapping it for other substances like salt or sugar during transit. Ketamine, a legal medicine in some countries but a controlled narcotic in others, is shipped from India through countries like Germany and the Netherlands before disappearing into the black market. This practice has led to a surge in ketamine consumption in the UK and a rise in related deaths. European police forces are planning to collaborate with Indian authorities to address the issue, as Germany is Europe's biggest importer of ketamine.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is set to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to lower the elevated prices of rice. This move aims to address the rice shortage in stores, which has caused prices to double compared to the previous year. The released rice will be sold to smaller supermarket operators, specialty shops, and major retailers, with the farm ministry beginning to accept applications. The government hopes this action will quickly provide consumers with lower-priced rice.</p>

          <p>Rapper Doechii used her BET Awards acceptance speech to condemn the Trump administration's deployment of military forces against protesters in Los Angeles amid ICE raids. Doechii highlighted the "ruthless attacks" creating fear and chaos in communities and criticized the government's response to democratic protests. She called on people to stand together in hope, not fear, as demonstrations continued in Los Angeles and other cities. California leaders, including Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, have criticized Trump's actions as inflammatory and an attempt to create disorder.</p>

          <p>More than 300 Foreign Office staff who raised concerns about potential UK complicity in Israel's actions in Gaza were advised to consider resigning if they profoundly disagreed with government policy. The staff had questioned the UK's continued arms sales and what they viewed as a disregard for international law by Israel. Senior civil servants responded that while the department welcomed healthy debate, the ultimate recourse for those with profound disagreements was resignation. This response has sparked outrage and disappointment among the staff, who feel the space for challenging government policy is shrinking.</p>

          <p>The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has issued a report highlighting an 'unprecedented decline' in global fertility rates, citing the prohibitive cost of parenthood and lack of suitable partners as key factors. A survey of 14,000 people across 14 countries revealed that one in five respondents have not had or do not expect to have their desired number of children. Financial limitations were cited by 39% of respondents as a barrier to having children, while only 12% attributed it to infertility. The UN agency is now focusing on low fertility issues, shifting from its traditional emphasis on women having more children than desired.</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased as the fentanyl crisis eases, with fatal overdoses among those under 35 dropping from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 last year. Researchers attribute this decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl being sold by dealers, increased access to addiction healthcare, and a trend of less risky drug and alcohol use among teens. However, concerns remain for those with severe addiction, and potential cuts to addiction services could jeopardize this progress.</p>
